['21576511', 'RNA-silencing mechanisms control many aspects of gene regulation including the  detection and degradation of viral RNA through the action of, among others,  Dicer-like and Argonaute (AGO) proteins. However, the extent to which RNA  silencing restricts virus host range has been difficult to separate from other  factors that can affect virus-plant compatibility. Here we show that Potato virus  X (PVX) can infect Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which is normally a  nonhost for PVX, if coinfected with a second virus, Pepper ringspot virus. Here  we show that the pepper ringspot virus 12K protein functions as a suppressor of  silencing that appears to enable PVX to infect Arabidopsis. We also show that PVX  is able to infect Arabidopsis Dicer-like mutants, indicating that RNA silencing  is responsible for Arabidopsis nonhost resistance to PVX. Furthermore, we find  that restriction of PVX on Arabidopsis also depends on AGO2, suggesting that this  AGO protein has evolved to specialize in antiviral defenses.', '2011 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.178012', 'Moffett']
