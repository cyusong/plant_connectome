Throughout plant evolution the circadian clock has expanded into a complex signaling network, coordinating physiological and metabolic processes with the environment. Early land plants faced new environmental pressures that required energy-demanding stress responses. Integrating abiotic stress response into the circadian system provides control over daily energy expenditure. Here, we describe the evolution of the circadian clock in plants and the limited, yet compelling, evidence for conserved regulation of abiotic stress. The need to introduce abiotic stress tolerance into current crops has expanded research into wild accessions and revealed extensive variation in circadian clock parameters across monocot and eudicot species. We argue that research into the ancestral links between the clock and abiotic stress will benefit crop improvement efforts.
