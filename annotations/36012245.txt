The distribution and content of auxin within plant tissues affect a variety of important growth and developmental processes. Polar auxin transport (PAT), mainly mediated by auxin influx and efflux transporters, plays a vital role in determining auxin maxima and gradients in plants. The auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED (PIN) family is one of the major protein families involved in PAT. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) genome possesses 12 <i>OsPIN</i> genes. However, the detailed functions of <i>OsPIN</i> genes involved in regulating the rice architecture and gravity response are less well understood. In the present study, <i>OsPIN1b</i> was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and its roles in modulating rice architecture and root gravitropism were investigated. Tissue-specific analysis showed that <i>OsPIN1b</i> was mainly expressed in roots, stems and sheaths at the seedling stage, and the transcript abundance was progressively decreased during the seedling stages. Expression of <i>OsPIN1b</i> could be quickly and greatly induced by NAA, indicating that <i>OsPIN1b</i> played a vital role in PAT. IAA homeostasis was disturbed in <i>ospin1b</i> mutants, as evidenced by the changed sensitivity of shoot and root to NAA and NPA treatment, respectively. Mutation of <i>OsPIN1b</i> resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes, including decreased growth of shoots and primary roots, reduced adventitious root number in rice seedlings, as well as shorter and narrower leaves, increased leaf angle, more tiller number and decreased plant height and panicle length at the late developmental stage. Moreover, <i>ospin1b</i> mutants displayed a curly root phenotype cultured with tap water regardless of lighting conditions, while nutrient solution culture could partially rescue the curly root phenotype in light and almost completely abolish this phenotype in darkness, indicating the involvement of the integration of light and nutrient signals in root gravitropism regulation. Additionally, amyloplast sedimentation was impaired in the peripheral tiers of the <i>ospin1b</i> root cap columella cell, while it was not the main contributor to the abnormal root gravitropism. These data suggest that <i>OsPIN1b</i> not only plays a vital role in regulating rice architecture but also functions in regulating root gravitropism by the integration of light and nutrient signals.
