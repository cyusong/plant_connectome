['16193053', 'Brassinosteroids are plant-specific steroid hormones that have an important role  in coupling environmental factors, especially light, with plant growth and  development. How the endogenous brassinosteroids change in response to  environmental stimuli is largely unknown. Ca2+/calmodulin has an essential role  in sensing and transducing environmental stimuli. Arabidopsis DWARF1 (DWF1) is  responsible for an early step in brassinosteroid biosynthesis that converts  24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol. Here we show that DWF1 is a  Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein and this binding is critical for its function.  Molecular genetic analysis using site-directed and deletion mutants revealed that  loss of calmodulin binding completely abolished the function of DWF1 in planta,  whereas partial loss of calmodulin binding resulted in a partial dwarf phenotype  in complementation studies. These results provide direct proof that  Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signalling has a critical role in controlling the  function of DWF1. Furthermore, we observed that DWF1 orthologues from other  plants have a similar Ca2+/calmodulin-binding domain, implying that  Ca2+/calmodulin regulation of DWF1 and its homologues is common in plants. These  results raise the possibility of producing size-engineered crops by altering the  Ca2+/calmodulin-binding property of their DWF1 orthologues.', '2005 Sep 29', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature03973', 'Poovaiah']
