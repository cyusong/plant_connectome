Proanthocyanidins (PAs; or condensed tannins) are a major class of flavonoids that contribute to citrus fruit quality. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for PA biosynthesis and accumulation in citrus remains unclear. Here, we identify a PH4-Noemi regulatory complex that regulates proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in citrus. Overexpression of PH4 or Noemi in citrus calli activated the expression of PA biosynthetic genes and significantly increased the PA content. Interestingly, Noemi was also shown to be up-regulated in CsPH4-overexpressing lines compared with wild-type calli. Simultaneously, CsPH4 partially complemented the PA-deficient phenotype of the Arabidopsis tt2 mutant and promoted PA accumulation in the wild-type. Further analysis revealed that CsPH4 interacted with Noemi, and together these proteins synergistically activated the expression of PA biosynthetic genes by directly binding to the MYB-recognizing elements (MRE) of the promoters of these genes. Moreover, CsPH4 could directly bind to the promoter of Noemi and up-regulate the expression of this gene. These findings explain how the CsPH4-Noemi regulatory complex contributes to the activation of PA biosynthetic genes via a positive feedback loop and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PA biosynthesis, which can be effectively employed for metabolic engineering to improve citrus fruit quality.
