['34202673', 'Trichome formation in Arabidopsis is regulated by several key regulators, and  plants hormones such as gibberellin, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and cytokinins  have been shown to regulate trichome formation by affecting the transcription or  activities of the key regulators. We report here the identification of two  abscisic acid (ABA) responsive genes, SMALLER TRICHOMES WITH VARIABLE BRANCHES  (SVB) and SVB2 as trichome formation regulator genes in Arabidopsis. The  expression levels of SVB and SVB2 were increased in response to ABA treatment,  their expression levels were reduced in the ABA biosynthesis mutant aba1-5, and  they have similar expression pattern. In addition to the trichome defects  reported previously for the svb single mutant, we found that even though the  trichome numbers were largely unaffected in both the svb and svb2 single mutants  generate by using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, the trichome numbers were greatly  reduced in the svb svb2 double mutants. On the other hand, trichome numbers were  increased in SVB or SVB2 overexpression plants. RT-PCR results show that the  expression of the trichome formation key regulator gene ENHANCER OF GLABRA3  (EGL3) was affected in the svb svb2 double mutants. Our results suggest that SVB  and SVB2 are ABA responsive genes, and SVB and SVB2 function redundantly to  regulate trichome formation in Arabidopsis.', '2021 Jun 24', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms22136790', 'Wang']
