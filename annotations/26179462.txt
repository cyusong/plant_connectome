Members of the SEPALLATA (SEP) gene sub-family encode class E floral homeotic MADS-domain transcription factors (MADS TFs) that specify the identity of floral organs. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 4 ancestrally duplicated and functionally redundant SEP genes, SEP1-4. Recently, a gene family of unique effectors, phyllogens, was identified as an inducer of leaf-like floral organs in phytoplasmas (plant pathogenic bacteria). While it was shown that phyllogens target some MADS TFs, including SEP3 for degradation, it is unknown whether the other SEPs (SEP1, SEP2, and SEP4) of Arabidopsis are also degraded by them. In this study, we found that all 4 SEP proteins of Arabidopsis are degraded by a phyllogen using a transient co-expression assay in Nicotiana benthamiana. This finding indicates that phyllogens may broadly target class E MADS TFs of plants.
