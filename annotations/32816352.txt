['32816352', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling is a vital plant signaling pathway for plant  responses to stress conditions. ABA treatment can alter global gene expression  patterns and cause significant phenotypic changes. We investigated the responses  to ABA treatment during flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. Dipping the flowers of  CARK3 T-DNA mutants in ABA solution, led to less reduction of pollen fertility  than in the wild type plants (Col-0). We demonstrated that PMEIL, a gene located  downstream of CARK3, directly affects pollen fertility. Due to the close  arrangement of CARK3 and PMEIL, CARK3 expression represses transcription of PMEIL  in an ABA-dependent manner through transcriptional interference. Our study  uncovers a molecular mechanism underlying ABA-mediated pollen sterility and  provides an example of how transcriptional interference caused by close  arrangement of genes may mediate stress responses during plant reproduction.', '2020 Nov', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.13871', 'ORCID:']
