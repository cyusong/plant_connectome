CAPRICE (CPC) and CAPRICE-like (CPL) myeloblastosis (MYB) family members [including TRYPTICHON (TRY) and ENHANCER OF TRYPTICHON AND CAPRICE (ETC)] of Arabidopsis thaliana encode R3-type MYB transcription factors that promote root hair differentiation and inhibit trichome formation in a redundant manner. Previously, we reported that the CPL3 gene affects flowering. The cpl3 mutant plants flower earlier and with fewer leaves than the wild type. In this study, we show that mutations in CPC or TRY delay flowering of cpl3 plants. A mutation in ETC1 did not further delay flowering but reduced plant size. Our study provides insight into the regulation of flowering time by the CPC-like MYB gene family.
