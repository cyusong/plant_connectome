Alternative splicing plays an important role in regulating gene functions and enhancing the diversity of the proteome in plants. Most of the genes are interrupted by introns in Arabidopsis. More than half of the intron-split genes involved in multiple biological processes including the circadian clock are alternatively spliced. In this review, we focus on the involvement of alternative splicing in the regulation of the circadian clock.
