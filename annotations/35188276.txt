Re-establishment of desiccation tolerance is essential for the survival of germinated seeds facing water deficit in the soil. The molecular and ultrastructural features of desiccation tolerance maintenance and loss within the nuclear compartment are not fully resolved. In the present study, the impact of desiccation-induced genotoxic stress on nucleolar ultrastructure and ribogenesis was explored along the rehydration-dehydration cycle applied in standard seed vigorization protocols. Primed and overprimed Medicago truncatula seeds, obtained through hydropriming followed by desiccation (dry-back), were analysed. In contrast to desiccation-tolerant primed seeds, overprimed seeds enter irreversible germination and do not survive dry-back. Reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and expression profiles of antioxidant/DNA Damage Response genes were measured, as main hallmarks of the seed response to desiccation stress. Nuclear ultrastructural features were also investigated. Overprimed seeds subjected to dry-back revealed altered rRNA accumulation profiles and up-regulation of genes involved in ribogenesis control. The signal molecule PAP (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate) accumulated during dry-back only in primed seeds, as a distinctive feature of desiccation tolerance. The presented results show the molecular and ultrastructural landscapes of the seed desiccation response, including substantial changes in nuclear organization.
