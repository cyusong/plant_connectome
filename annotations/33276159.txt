['33276159', 'Salinity severely reduces plant growth and limits agricultural productivity.  Dynamic changes and rearrangement of the plant cell wall is an important response  to salt stress, but relatively little is known about the biological importance of  specific cell wall components in the response. Here, we demonstrate a specific  function of beta-1,4-galactan in salt hypersensitivity. We found that salt stress  induces the accumulation of beta-1,4-galactan in root cell walls by up regulating  the expression of GALACTAN SYNTHASE 1 (GALS1), which encodes a beta-1,4-galactan  synthase. The accumulation of beta-1,4-galactan negatively affects salt tolerance.  Exogenous application of D-galactose (D-Gal) causes an increase in beta-1,4-galactan  levels in the wild type and GALS1 mutants, especially in GALS1 overexpressors,  which correlated with the aggravated salt hypersensitivity. Furthermore, we  discovered that the BARLEY B RECOMBINANT/BASIC PENTACYSTEINE transcription  factors BPC1/BPC2 positively regulate plant salt tolerance by repressing GALS1  expression and beta-1,4-galactan accumulation. Genetic analysis suggested that GALS1  is genetically epistatic to BPC1/BPC2 with respect to the control of salt  sensitivity as well as accumulation of beta-1,4-galactan. Taken together, our  results reveal a new regulatory mechanism by which beta-1,4-galactan regulated by  the BPC1/BPC2-GALS1 module aggravates salt sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2021 Mar 1', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2020.11.023', 'Zhang']
