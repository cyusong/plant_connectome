In Arabidopsis thaliana the induction of plant trehalase during clubroot disease was proposed to act as a defense mechanism in the susceptible accession Col-0, which could thereby cope with the accumulation of pathogen-synthesized trehalose. In the present study, we assessed trehalose activity and tolerance to trehalose in the clubroot partially resistant accession Bur-0. We compared both accessions for several trehalose-related physiological traits during clubroot infection. A quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis of tolerance to exogenous trehalose was also conducted on a Bur-0xCol-0 RIL progeny. Trehalase activity was not induced by clubroot in Bur-0 and the inhibition of trehalase by validamycin treatments resulted in the enhancement of clubroot symptoms only in Col-0. In pathogen-free cultures, Bur-0 showed less trehalose-induced toxicity symptoms than Col-0. A QTL analysis identified one locus involved in tolerance to trehalose overlapping the confidence interval of a QTL for resistance to Plasmodiophora brassicae. This colocalization was confirmed using heterogeneous inbred family (HIF) lines. Although not based on trehalose catabolism capacity, partial resistance to clubroot is to some extent related to the tolerance to trehalose accumulation in Bur-0. These findings support an original model where contrasting primary metabolism-related regulations could contribute to the partial resistance to a plant pathogen.
