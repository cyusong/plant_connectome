Identification of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway genes in duckweed S. polyrhiza reveals presence of prokaryotic as well as land plant-type ADC pathway but absence of ODC encoding genes. Their differential gene expression and transcript abundance is shown modulated by exogenous methyl jasmonate, salinity, and acidic pH. Genetic components encoding for polyamine (PA) biosynthetic pathway are known in several land plant species; however, little is known about them in aquatic plants. We utilized recently sequenced three duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) genome assemblies to map PA biosynthetic pathway genes in S. polyrhiza. PA biosynthesis in most higher plants except for Arabidopsis involves two pathways, via arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). ADC-mediated PA biosynthetic pathway genes, namely, one arginase (SpARG1), two arginine decarboxylases (SpADC1, SpADC2), one agmatine iminohydrolase/deiminase (SpAIH), one N-carbamoyl putrescine amidase (SpCPA), three S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases (SpSAMDc1, 2, 3), one spermidine synthase (SpSPDS1) and one spermine synthase (SpSPMS1) in S. polyrhiza genome were identified here. However, no locus was found for ODC pathway genes in this duckweed. Hidden Markov Model protein domain analysis established that SpADC1 is a prokaryotic/biodegradative type ADC and its molecular phylogenic classification fell in a separate prokaryotic origin ADC clade with SpADC2 as a biosynthetic type of arginine decarboxylase. However, thermospermine synthase (t-SPMS)/Aculis5 genes were not found present. Instead, one of the annotated SPDS may also function as SPMS, since it was found associated with the SPMS phylogenetic clade along with known SPMS genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that S. polyrhiza PA biosynthetic gene transcripts are differentially expressed in response to unfavorable conditions, such as exogenously added salt, methyl jasmonate, or acidic pH environment as well as in extreme temperature regimes. Thus, S. polyrhiza genome encodes for complete polyamine biosynthesis pathway and the genes are transcriptionally active in response to changing environmental conditions suggesting an important role of polyamines in this aquatic plant.
