This study explores how allopolyploidization reshapes the biased expression and asymmetric epigenetic modification of homoeologous gene pairs, and examines the regulation types and epigenetic basis of expression bias. We analyzed the gene expression and four epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac) of 29 976 homoeologous gene pairs in resynthesized, natural allopolyploid Brassica napus and an in silico 'hybrid'. We comprehensively elucidated the biased gene expression, asymmetric epigenetic modifications and the generational transmission characteristics of these homoeologous gene pairs in B. napus. We analyzed cis/trans effects and the epigenetic basis of homoeolog expression bias. There was a significant positive correlation between two active histone modifications and biased gene expression. We revealed that parental legacy was the dominant principle in the remodeling of homoeolog expression bias and asymmetric epigenetic modifications in B. napus, and further clarified that this depends on whether there were differences in the expression/epigenetic modifications of gene pairs in parents/progenitors. The maternal genome was dominant in the homoeolog expression bias of resynthesized B. napus, and this phenomenon was attenuated in natural B. napus. Furthermore, cis rather than trans effects were dominant when epigenetic modifications potentially affected biased expression of gene pairs in B. napus.
