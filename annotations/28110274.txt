It is now over half a century since the biochemical characterization of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway, and this special issue highlights the sheer breadth of current knowledge. New genomic and transcriptomic information shows that multi-level regulation of gene expression is required for the pathway to function, yet we know it to be one of the most dynamic examples of convergent evolution. Now, a focus on the molecular transition from C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediates, together with improved mathematical models, experimental tools and transformation systems, holds great promise for improving C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in crops.
