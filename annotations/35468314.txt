The location of the phloem deep inside the plant, the high hydrostatic pressure in the phloem, and the composition of phloem sap, which is rich in sugar with a high C:N ratio, allows phloem sap feeding insects to occupy a unique ecological niche. The anatomy and physiology of aphids, a large group of phytophagous insects that use their mouthparts, which are modified into stylets, to consume large amounts of phloem sap, has allowed aphids to successfully exploit this niche, however, to the detriment of agriculture and horticulture. The ability to reproduce asexually, a short generation time, the development of resistance to commonly used insecticides, and their ability to vector viral diseases makes aphids among the most damaging pests of plants. Here we review how plants utilize their ability to occlude sieve elements and accumulate antibiotic and antinutritive factors in the phloem sap to limit aphid infestation. In addition, we summarize progress on understanding how plants perceive aphids to activate defenses in the phloem.

Plant: !occludes sieve elements to! limit aphid infestation
Plant: !accumulates antibiotic and antinutritive factors in! phloem sap
Plant: !perceives aphids to! activate defenses in phloem
