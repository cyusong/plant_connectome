Auxin signalling plays a key role in various developmental processes ranging from embryogenesis to senescence in plants. Auxin response factor (ARF), a key component of auxin signalling, functions by binding to auxin response element within promoter of auxin response genes, activating or repressing the target genes. Increasing evidences show that ARFs are crucial for plant response to stresses. This review summarises the recent advance on the functions and their regulatory pathways of rice ARFs in development and responding to stresses. The importance of OsARFs is demonstrated by their roles in triggering various physiological, biochemical and molecular reactions to resist adverse environmental conditions. We also describe the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of OsARFs, and discuss the major challenges in this area.
