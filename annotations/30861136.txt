The interaction between tomato and Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) is a well-developed model for investigating the molecular basis of the plant immune system. There is extensive natural variation in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) but it has not been fully leveraged to enhance our understanding of the tomato-Pst pathosystem. We screened 216 genetically diverse accessions of cultivated tomato and a wild tomato species for natural variation in their response to three strains of Pst. The host response to Pst was investigated using multiple Pst strains, tomato accessions with available genome sequences, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, reporter genes and bacterial population measurements. The screen uncovered a broad range of previously unseen host symptoms in response to Pst, and one of these, stem galls, was found to be simply inherited. The screen also identified tomato accessions that showed enhanced responses to flagellin in bacterial population assays and in ROS assays upon exposure to flagellin-derived peptides, flg22 and flgII-28. Reporter genes confirmed that the host responses were due primarily to pattern recognition receptor-triggered immunity. This study revealed extensive natural variation in tomato for susceptibility and resistance to Pst and will enable elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these host responses.
