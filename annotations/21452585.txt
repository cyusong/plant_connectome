A vegetative storage protein (VSP) with trypsin inhibitor activity in a deciduous tree, Sapindus mukorassi, was characterized by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western-blot, immuno-histochemical localization, light- and electro-microscopy, together with analysis of proteinase inhibitor activity of the purified VSP in vitro. There were two proteins with molecular masses of about 23 and 27 kDa in a relatively high content in the bark tissues of terminal branches of S. mukorassi in leafless periods. The proteins decreased markedly during young shoot development, indicating their role in seasonal nitrogen storage. Immuno-histochemical localization with the polyclonal antibodies raised against the 23 kDa protein demonstrated that the 23 kDa protein was the major component of protein inclusions in protein-storing cells. The protein inclusions were identified by protein-specific staining and should correspond to the electron-dense materials in different forms in the vacuoles of phloem parenchyma cells and phloem ray parenchyma cells under an electron microscope. So, the 23 kDa protein was a typical VSP in S. mukorassi. The 23 and 27 kDa proteins shared no immuno-relatedness, whereas the 23 kDa protein was immuno-related with the 22 kDa VSP in lychee and possessed trypsin inhibitor activity. The 23 kDa protein may confer dual functions: nitrogen storage and defense.
