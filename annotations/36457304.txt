The roles of SHORT-ROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) in ground tissue patterning and differentiation have been well established in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana. Recently, work in additional organs and species revealed the extensive functional diversification of these genes, including regulation of cortical divisions essential for nodule organogenesis in legume roots, bundle sheath specification in the Arabidopsis leaf, patterning of inner leaf cell layers in maize, and stomatal development in rice. The co-option of distinct functions and cell types is attributed to different mechanisms, including paralog retention, spatiotemporal changes in gene expression, and novel protein functions. Elaborating our knowledge of the SHR-SCR module further unravels the developmental regulation that controls diverse forms and functions within and between species.
