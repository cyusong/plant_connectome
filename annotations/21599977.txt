['21599977', "BACKGROUND: Phenotype-driven forward genetic experiments are powerful approaches  for linking phenotypes to genomic elements but they still involve a laborious  positional cloning process. Although sequencing of complete genomes now becomes  available, discriminating causal mutations from the enormous amounts of  background variation remains a major challenge. METHOD: To improve this, we  developed a universal two-step approach, named 'fast forward genetics', which  combines traditional bulk segregant techniques with targeted genomic enrichment  and next-generation sequencing technology RESULTS: As a proof of principle we  successfully applied this approach to two Arabidopsis mutants and identified a  novel factor required for stem cell activity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that  the 'fast forward genetics' procedure efficiently identifies a small number of  testable candidate mutations. As the approach is independent of genome size, it  can be applied to any model system of interest. Furthermore, we show that  experiments can be multiplexed and easily scaled for the identification of  multiple individual mutants in a single sequencing run.", '2011 May 20', 'BMC Genomics', '10.1186/1471-2164-12-256', 'Cuppen']
