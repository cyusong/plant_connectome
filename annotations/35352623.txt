Epigenetic regulation is one of the most precise and subtle ways of gene regulation, including DNA modification, histone modification, RNA modification, histone variants, chromatin remodeling, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Chromatin modification is the most basic type of epigenetic regulation, which plays a key role in a myriad of developmental and physiological processes that have been thoroughly studied. These modifications are usually completed by a series of conserved chromatin modification complexes in eukaryotes. In recent years, a series of lncRNAs in organisms also have been described as having irreplaceable functions in biological environment adaptation, especially in biotic and abiotic stresses. Moreover, these molecules form a sophisticated regulatory network through mutual cross-regulation to achieve quantitative expression of key environmental response genes to external signals. For instance, the function of lncRNAs will directly or indirectly depend on the function of the chromatin modification complex. In this review, we mainly focus on chromatin modification, lncRNA, and their coordination mechanism to achieve the high adaptability of plants in low-temperature environments. We highlight recent findings and insights into lncRNA-mediated local chromatin environment changes during plant growth under low temperature via chromatin modification complexes, including target gene specificity for different lncRNA.
