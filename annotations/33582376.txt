Global food security is facing severe challenges from an ever-growing population, limited resources, and various stresses. Dominant genic male sterility (DGMS) technology combined with modern breeding strategies may create novel cultivation models with ~50% DGMS F<sub>1</sub> hybrids for field production of cross-pollinated crops, boosting crop grain yield to ensure global food security and sustainable agriculture in the post-heterosis utilization era.
