The estimation of metabolic fluxes in photosynthetic organisms represents an important challenge that has gained interest over the last decade with the development of <sup>13</sup>C-Metabolic Flux Analysis at isotopically non-stationary steady-state. This approach requires a high level of accuracy for the measurement of Carbon Isotopologue Distribution in plant metabolites. But this accuracy has still not been evaluated at the isotopologue level for GC-MS, leading to uncertainties for the metabolic fluxes calculated based on these fragments. Here, we developed a workflow to validate the measurements of CIDs from plant metabolites with GC-MS by producing tailor-made <i>E. coli</i> standard extracts harboring a predictable binomial CID for some organic and amino acids. Overall, most of our TMS-derivatives mass fragments were validated with these standards and at natural isotope abundance in plant matrices. Then, we applied this validated MS method to investigate the light/dark regulation of plant TCA cycle by incorporating U-<sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate to <i>Brassica napus</i> leaf discs. We took advantage of pathway-specific isotopologues/isotopomers observed between two and six hours of labeling to show that the TCA cycle can operate in a cyclic manner under both light and dark conditions. Interestingly, this forward cyclic flux mode has a nearly four-fold higher contribution for pyruvate-to-citrate and pyruvate-to-malate fluxes than the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) flux reassimilating carbon derived from some mitochondrial enzymes. The contribution of stored citrate to the mitochondrial TCA cycle activity was also questioned based on dynamics of <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment in citrate, glutamate and succinate and variations of citrate total amounts under light and dark conditions. Interestingly, there was a light-dependent <sup>13</sup>C-incorporation into glycine and serine showing that decarboxylations from pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and TCA cycle enzymes were actively reassimilated and could represent up to 5% to net photosynthesis.
