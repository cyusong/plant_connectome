The CYP74B2 gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia (Col) contains a 10-nucleotide deletion in its first exon that causes it to code for a truncated protein not containing the P450 signature typical of other CYP74B subfamily members. Compared to CYP74B2 transcripts in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype that code for full-length hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) protein, CYP74B2 transcripts in the Col ecotype accumulate at substantially reduced levels. Consistent with the nonfunctional HPL open reading frame in the Col ecotype, in vitro HPL activity analyses using either linoleic acid hydroperoxide or linolenic acid hydroperoxide as substrates show undetectable HPL activity in the Col ecotype and C6 volatile analyses using leaf homogenates show substantially reduced amounts of hexanal and no detectable trans-2-hexenal generated in the Col ecotype. P450-specific microarrays and full-genome oligoarrays have been used to identify the range of other transcripts expressed at different levels in these two ecotypes potentially as a result of these variations in HPL activity. Among the transcripts expressed at significantly lower levels in Col leaves are those coding for enzymes involved in the synthesis of C6 volatiles (LOX2, LOX3), jasmonates (OPR3, AOC), and aliphatic glucosinolates (CYP83A1, CYP79F1, AOP3). Two of the three transcripts coding for aliphatic glucosinolates (CYP83A1, AOP3) are also expressed at significantly lower levels in Col flowers.
