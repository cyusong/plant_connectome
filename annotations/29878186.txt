The adaptation to dehydration and rehydration cycles represents a key step in the evolution of photosynthetic organisms and requires the development of mechanisms by which to sense external stimuli and translate them into signaling components. In this study, we used genetically encoded fluorescent sensors to detect specific transient increases in the Ca2+ concentration in the moss Physcomitrella patens upon dehydration and rehydration treatment. Observation of the entire plant in a single time-series acquisition revealed that various cell types exhibited different sensitivities to osmotic stress and that Ca2+ waves originated from the basal part of the gametophore and were directionally propagated towards the top of the plant. Under similar conditions, the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibited Ca2+ waves that propagated at a higher speed than those of P. patens. Our results suggest that systemic Ca2+ propagation occurs in plants even in the absence of vascular tissue, even though the rates can be different.
