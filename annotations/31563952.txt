Seed germination is a developmental process regulated by numerous internal and external cues. Our previous studies have shown that calcium influx mediated by the Arabidopsis glutamate receptor homolog 3.5 (AtGLR3.5) modulates the expression of the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) transcription factor during germination and that L-methionine (L-Met) activates AtGLR3.1/3.5 Ca2+ channels in guard cells. However, it is not known whether L-Met participates in regulation of germination and what cellular mechanism is responsible for Met production during germination. Here, we describe Arabidopsis methionine synthase 1 (AtMS1), which acts in the final step of Met biosynthesis, synthesizes the Met required for the activation of AtGLR3.5 Ca2+ channels whose expression is up-regulated during germination, leading to the regulation of seed germination. We show that exogenous L-Met promotes germination in an AtGRL3.5-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that L-Met directly regulates the AtGLR3.5-mediated increase in cytosolic Ca2+ level in seedlings. We provide pharmacological and genetic evidence that Met synthesized via AtMS1 acts upstream of the AtGLR3.5-mediated Ca2+ signal and regulates the expression of ABI4, a major regulator in the abscisic acid response in seeds. Overall, our results link AtMS1, L-Met, the AtGLR3.5 Ca2+ channel, Ca2+ signals, and ABI4, and shed light on the physiological role and molecular mechanism of L-Met in germination.
