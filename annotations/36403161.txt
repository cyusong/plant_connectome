Plant glutamate receptor homologs (GLRs), which function as key calcium channels, play pivotal roles in various developmental processes as well as stress responses. The moss <i>Physcomitrium patens</i>, a representative of the earliest land plant lineage, possess multiple pathways of hormone signaling for coordinating growth and adaptation responses. However, it is not clear whether GLRs are connected to hormone-mediated growth control in the moss. In this study, we report that one of the two GLRs in <i>P. patens</i>, PpGLR1, involves in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated growth regulation. ABA represses the growth of wild-type moss, and intriguingly, the <i>PpGLR1</i> transcript levels are significantly increased in response to ABA treatment, based on both gene expression and the <i>PpGLR1pro::GUS</i> reporter results. Furthermore, the growth of <i>Ppglr1</i> knockout moss mutants is hypersensitive to ABA treatment. These results suggest that PpGLR1 plays a critical role in ABA-mediated growth regulation, which provide useful information for our further investigation of the regulatory mechanism between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and ABA in moss growth control.
