['28821747', 'Cells respond to many signals with a limited number of signaling components.  Heterotrimeric G proteins and MAPK cascades are universally used by eukaryotic  cells to transduce signals in various developmental processes or stress responses  by activating different effectors. MAPK cascade is integrated with G proteins by  scaffold protein during plant immunity. However, the molecular relationship  between G proteins and MAPK modules in plant development is still unclear. In  this study, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis Gbeta protein AGB1 interacts with MPK3  and 6, MKK4 and 5, as well as the regulatory domains of YODA (YDA), the upstream  MEKK of MKK4/5. Remarkably, YDA interacts with the plasma membrane associated  SHORT SUSPENSOR (SSP) through its N- and C-terminal region in vitro and in vivo.  Additionally, genetic analysis shows that AGB1 functions together with MPK3/6  signaling cascade during the asymmetric division of the zygote. These data  indicate that Gbeta may function likely as a scaffold, through direct physical  interaction with the components of the MPK signaling module in plant development.  Our results provide new insights into the molecular functions of G protein and  will advance the understanding of the complex mechanism of kinase signaling  cascades.', '2017 Aug 18', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-017-08230-4', 'Yang']
