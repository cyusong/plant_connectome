DNA damage response (DDR) in eukaryotes is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity in challenging environments. The regulatory mechanisms of DDR have been well-established in yeast and humans. However, increasing evidence supports the idea that plants seem to employ different signaling pathways that remain largely unknown. Here, we report the role of MODIFIER OF SNC1, 4-ASSOCIATED COMPLEX SUBUNIT 5A (MAC5A) in DDR in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Lack of MAC5A in mac5a mutants causes hypersensitive phenotypes to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), a DNA damage inducer. Consistent with this observation, MAC5A can regulate alternative splicing of DDR genes to maintain the proper response to genotoxic stress. Interestingly, MAC5A interacts with the 26S proteasome (26SP) and is required for its proteasome activity. MAC core subunits are also involved in MMS-induced DDR. Moreover, we find that MAC5A, the MAC core subunits, and 26SP may act collaboratively to mediate high-boron-induced growth repression through DDR. Collectively, our findings uncover the crucial role of MAC in MMS-induced DDR in orchestrating growth and stress adaptation in plants.
