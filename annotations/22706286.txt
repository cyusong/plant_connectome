['22706286', 'The metal chelator nicotianamine promotes the bioavailability of Fe and reduces  cellular Fe toxicity. For breeding Fe-efficient crops, we need to explore the  fundamental impact of nicotianamine on plant development and physiology. The  quadruple nas4x-2 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana cannot synthesize any  nicotianamine, shows strong leaf chlorosis, and is sterile. To date, these  phenotypes have not been fully explained. Here, we show that sink organs of this  mutant were Fe deficient, while aged leaves were Fe sufficient. Upper organs were  also Zn deficient. We demonstrate that transport of Fe to aged leaves relied on  citrate, which partially complemented the loss of nicotianamine. In the absence  of nicotianamine, Fe accumulated in the phloem. Our results show that rather than  enabling the long-distance movement of Fe in the phloem (as is the case for Zn),  nicotianamine facilitates the transport of Fe from the phloem to sink organs. We  delimit nicotianamine function in plant reproductive biology and demonstrate that  nicotianamine acts in pollen development in anthers and pollen tube passage in  the carpels. Since Fe and Zn both enhance pollen germination, a lack of either  metal may contribute to the reproductive defect. Our study sheds light on the  physiological functions of nicotianamine.', '2012 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.099077', 'Bauer']
