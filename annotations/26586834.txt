['26586834', 'The first step in the biosynthesis of nearly all plant membrane phospholipids and  storage triacylglycerols is catalyzed by a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase  (GPAT). The requirement for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized GPAT for both  of these critical metabolic pathways was recognized more than 60 years ago.  However, identification of the gene(s) encoding this GPAT activity has remained  elusive. Here, we present the results of a series of in vivo, in vitro, and in  silico experiments in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) designed to assign this  essential function to AtGPAT9. This gene has been highly conserved throughout  evolution and is largely present as a single copy in most plants, features  consistent with essential housekeeping functions. A knockout mutant of AtGPAT9  demonstrates both male and female gametophytic lethality phenotypes, consistent  with the role in essential membrane lipid synthesis. Significant expression of  developing seed AtGPAT9 is required for wild-type levels of triacylglycerol  accumulation, and the transcript level is directly correlated to the level of  microsomal GPAT enzymatic activity in seeds. Finally, the AtGPAT9 protein  interacts with other enzymes involved in ER glycerolipid biosynthesis, suggesting  the possibility of ER-localized lipid biosynthetic complexes. Together, these  results suggest that GPAT9 is the ER-localized GPAT enzyme responsible for plant  membrane lipid and oil biosynthesis.', '2016 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01563', 'ORCID:']
