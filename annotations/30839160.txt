Angiosperms integrate a multitude of endogenous and environmental signals to control floral development, thereby ensuring reproductive success. Here, we report the identification of AGAMOUS AND TERMINAL FLOWER (AGTFL), a novel regulator of floral development in Medicago truncatula. Mutation of AGTFL led to the transformation of carpels and stamens into numerous sepals and petals and altered primary inflorescence identity. AGTFL encodes a nucleus-localized protein containing a putative Myb/SANT-like DNA-binding domain and a PKc kinase domain. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that AGTFL regulates the transcription of MtAGs and MtTFL1 to control floral organ identity and inflorescence development.
