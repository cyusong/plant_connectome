['15356385', 'The light-harvesting antenna of higher plant photosystem (PS) I is known to be  composed of four different types of light-harvesting complex (LHC) proteins  (Lhca1-4). However, the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana contains open  reading frames coding for two additional LHC type proteins (Lhca5-6) that are  presumably associated with PSI. While Lhca6 might not be expressed at all, ESTs  have been detected for the Lhca5 gene in Arabidopsis and a number of other plant  species. Here we demonstrate the presence of the Lhca5 gene product in the  thylakoid membrane of Arabidopsis as an additional type of Lhca-protein  associated with PSI. Lhca5 seems to be regulated differently from the other LHC  proteins since Lhca5 mRNA levels increase under high light conditions. Analyses  reported here of Lhca5 in plants lacking individual Lhca1-4 proteins show that it  is more abundant in plants lacking Lhca1/4, and suggest that it interacts in a  direct physical fashion with Lhca2 or Lhca3. We propose that Lhca5 binds  chlorophylls in a similar fashion to the other Lhca proteins and is associated  with PSI only in sub-stoichiometric amounts.', '2004 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/B:PLAN.0000040813.05224.94', 'Jansson']
