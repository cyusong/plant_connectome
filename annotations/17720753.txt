['17720753', 'Although ethylene is involved in the complex cross talk of signaling pathways  regulating plant defense responses to microbial attack, its functions remain to  be elucidated. The lesion mimic mutant vad1-1 (for vascular associated death),  which exhibits the light-conditional appearance of propagative hypersensitive  response-like lesions along the vascular system, is a good model for studying the  role of ethylene in programmed cell death and defense. Here, we demonstrate that  expression of genes associated with ethylene synthesis and signaling is enhanced  in vad1-1 under lesion-promoting conditions and after plant-pathogen interaction.  Analyses of the progeny from crosses between vad1-1 plants and either 35SERF1  transgenic plants or ein2-1, ein3-1, ein4-1, ctr1-1, or eto2-1 mutants revealed  that the vad1-1 cell death and defense phenotypes are dependent on ethylene  biosynthesis and signaling. In contrast, whereas vad1-1-dependent increased  resistance was abolished by ein2, ein3, and ein4 mutations, positive regulation  of ethylene biosynthesis (eto2-1) or ethylene responses (35SERF1) did not  exacerbate this phenotype. In addition, VAD1 expression in response to a  hypersensitive response-inducing bacterial pathogen is dependent on ethylene  perception and signaling. These results, together with previous data, suggest  that VAD1 could act as an integrative node in hormonal signaling, with ethylene  acting in concert with salicylic acid as a positive regulator of cell death  propagation.', '2007 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.106302', 'Balague']
