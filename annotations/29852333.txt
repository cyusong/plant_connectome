Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is the fourth major cereal crop and shows high adaptive capabilities to diverse environments. Thus, it might represent a potential reservoir of novel genes to improve abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, a novel AP2/ERF transcription factor gene designated as HvSHN1 was isolated from barley. Protein sequence analysis showed that the HvSHN1 protein contained a nuclear localization signal and the conserved AP2/ERF domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HvSHN1 belongs to the group Va protein in the ERF subfamily which contains the Arabidopsis genes (SHN1, 2 and 3) and the wheat gene TdSHN1 with which it has 94.7% protein sequence identity. Expression profile analysis revealed that HvSHN1 is strongly induced by heat, cold, salt and drought. Transient expression using tobacco BY-2 protoplast coupled to confocal microscopy analysis revealed that HvSHN1 is exclusively targeted to the nucleus. Interestingly, when constitutively expressed in transgenic tobacco, HvSHN1 up-regulated stress responsive genes known to harbor GCC or DRE motif in their promoter regions. Therefore, HvSHN1 might represent a potential candidate for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in economically important crops.
