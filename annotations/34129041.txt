Growth, development, structure as well as dynamic adaptations and remodeling processes in plants are largely controlled by properties of their cell walls. These intricate wall structures are mostly made up of different sugars connected through specific glycosidic linkages but also contain many glycosylated proteins. A key plant sugar that is present throughout the plantae, even before the divergence of the land plant lineage, but is not found in animals, is l-arabinose (l-Ara). Here, we summarize and discuss the processes and proteins involved in l-Ara de novo synthesis, l-Ara interconversion, and the assembly and recycling of l-Ara-containing cell wall polymers and proteins. We also discuss the biological function of l-Ara in a context-focused manner, mainly addressing cell wall-related functions that are conferred by the basic physical properties of arabinose-containing polymers/compounds. In this article we explore these processes with the goal of directing future research efforts to the many exciting yet unanswered questions in this research area.
