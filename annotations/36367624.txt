IRT1 intracellular dynamics and function are finely controlled through protein-protein interactions. In plants, iron uptake from the soil is tightly regulated to allow optimal growth and development. Iron acquisition in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells requires the IRT1 transporter, which also mediates the entry of non-iron metals. In this mini-review, we describe how protein-protein interactions regulate IRT1 intracellular dynamics and IRT1-mediated metal uptake to maintain iron homeostasis. Recent interactomic data provided interesting clues on IRT1 secretion and the putative involvement of COPI- and COPII-mediated pathways. Once delivered to the plasma membrane, IRT1 can interact with other components of the iron uptake machinery to form an iron acquisition complex that likely optimizes iron entrance in root epidermal cells. Then, IRT1 may be internalized from the plasma membrane. In the past decade, IRT1 endocytosis emerged as an essential mechanism to control IRT1 subcellular localization and thus to tune iron uptake. Interestingly, IRT1 endocytosis and degradation are regulated by its non-iron metal substrates in an ubiquitin-dependent manner, which requires a set of interacting-proteins including kinases, E3 ubiquitin ligases and ESCRT complex subunits. This mechanism is essential to avoid non-iron metal overload in Arabidopsis when the iron is scarce.
