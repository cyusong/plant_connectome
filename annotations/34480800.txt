Plant seeds, which are unique reproductive organs of gymnosperms and angiosperms, are used for edible, medicinal, and industrial purposes. Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of plant growth, development, and stress responses. This review describes, in detail, the functions of TFs in regulating seed development. Different TFs, or even different TF families, may have similar functions in seed development. For example, WUSCHEL-related homeobox, LEC2/FUS3/ABI3, and HEME ACTIVATOR PROTEIN3 families can control plant seed embryonic initiation and development. In contrast, some members of the same TF family may have completely opposite roles. For instance, AtMYB76 and AtMYB89 inhibit the accumulation of seed oil, whereas AtMYB96 promotes seed fatty acid accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Compared with the number of studies that have addressed regulation by single TFs, only a few have focused on multiple-TF regulatory networks. This review should be useful as a reference for future studies on regulatory networks of TF complexes.
