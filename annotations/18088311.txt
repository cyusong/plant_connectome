['18088311', 'SOB3, which encodes a plant-specific AT-hook motif containing protein, was  identified from an activation-tagging screen for suppressors of the  long-hypocotyl phenotype of a weak phyB allele, phyB-4. sob3-D (suppressor of  phyB-4#3 dominant) overexpressing seedlings have shorter hypocotyls, and as  adults develop larger flowers and leaves, and are delayed in senescence compared  with wild-type plants. At the nucleotide level, SOB3 is closely related to  ESCAROLA (ESC), which was identified in an independent activation-tagging screen.  ESC overexpression also suppresses the phyB-4 long-hypocotyl phenotype, and  confers an adult morphology similar to sob3-D, suggesting similar functions.  Analysis of transgenic plants harboring SOB3:SOB3-GUS or ESC:ESC-GUS  translational fusions, driven by their endogenous promoter regions, showed GUS  activity in the hypocotyl and vasculature tissue in light- and dark-grown  seedlings. A loss-of-function SOB3 allele (sob3-4) was generated through an ethyl  methanesulfonate intragenic suppressor screen of sob3-D phyB-4 plants, and this  allele was combined with a predicted null allele, disrupting ESC (esc-8), to  examine potential genetic interactions. The sob3-4 esc-8 double mutant had a long  hypocotyl in multiple fluence rates of continuous white, far-red, red and blue  light. sob3-4 esc-8 phyB-9 and sob3-4 esc-8 cry-103 triple mutants also had  longer hypocotyls than photoreceptor single mutants. In contrast, the sob3-4  esc-8 phyA-211 triple mutant was the same length as phyA-211 single mutants.  Taken together, these data indicate that SOB3 and ESC act redundantly to modulate  hypocotyl growth inhibition in response to light.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03393.x', 'Neff']
