['17627276', 'POT1 is a single-copy gene in yeast and humans that encodes a single-strand  telomere binding protein required for chromosome end protection and telomere  length regulation. In contrast, Arabidopsis harbors multiple, divergent POT-like  genes that bear signature N-terminal OB-fold motifs, but otherwise share limited  sequence similarity. Here, we report that plants null for AtPOT1 show no telomere  deprotection phenotype, but rather exhibit progressive loss of telomeric DNA.  Genetic analysis indicates that AtPOT1 acts in the same pathway as telomerase. In  vitro levels of telomerase activity in pot1 mutants are significantly reduced and  are more variable than wild-type. Consistent with this observation, AtPOT1  physically associates with active telomerase particles. Although low levels of  AtPOT1 can be detected at telomeres in unsynchronized cells and in cells arrested  in G2, AtPOT1 binding is significantly enhanced during S-phase, when telomerase  is thought to act at telomeres. Our findings indicate that AtPOT1 is a novel  accessory factor for telomerase required for positive telomere length regulation,  and they underscore the coordinate and extraordinarily rapid evolution of  telomere proteins and the telomerase enzyme.', '2007 Aug 8', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601792', 'Shippen']
