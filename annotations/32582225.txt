The automated harvesting of strawberry brings benefits such as reduced labor costs, sustainability, increased productivity, less waste, and improved use of natural resources. The accurate detection of strawberries in a greenhouse can be used to assist in the effective recognition and location of strawberries for the process of strawberry collection. Furthermore, being able to detect and characterize strawberries based on field images is an essential component in the breeding pipeline for the selection of high-yield varieties. The existing manual examination method is error-prone and time-consuming, which makes mechanized harvesting difficult. In this work, we propose a robust architecture, named "improved Faster-RCNN," to detect strawberries in ground-level RGB images captured by a self-developed "Large Scene Camera System." The purpose of this research is to develop a fully automatic detection and plumpness grading system for living plants in field conditions which does not require any prior information about targets. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtained an average fruit extraction accuracy of more than 86%, which is higher than that obtained using three other methods. This demonstrates that image processing combined with the introduced novel deep learning architecture is highly feasible for counting the number of, and identifying the quality of, strawberries from ground-level images. Additionally, this work shows that deep learning techniques can serve as invaluable tools in larger field investigation frameworks, specifically for applications involving plant phenotyping.
