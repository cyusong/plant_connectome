Ferredoxin5 (FDX5), a minor ferredoxin protein in the alga <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>), helps maintain thylakoid membrane integrity in the dark. Sulfur (S) deprivation has been used to achieve prolonged hydrogen production in green algae. Here, we propose that FDX5 is involved in algal responses to S-deprivation as well as to the dark. Specifically, we tested the role of FDX5 in both the initial aerobic and subsequent anaerobic phases of S-deprivation. Under S-deprived conditions, absence of FDX5 causes a distinct delay in achieving anoxia by affecting photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution, accompanied by reduced acetate uptake, lower starch accumulation, and delayed/lower fermentative metabolite production, including photohydrogen. We attribute these differences to transcriptional and/or posttranslational regulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase and ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, and increased stability of the PSII D1 protein. Interestingly, increased levels of FDX2 and FDX1 were observed in the mutant under oxic, S-replete conditions, strengthening our previously proposed hypothesis that other ferredoxins compensate in response to a lack of FDX5. Taken together, the results of our omics and pull-down experiments confirmed biochemical and physiological results, suggesting that FDX5 may have other effects on <i>Chlamydomonas</i> metabolism through its interaction with multiple redox partners.
