['18086223', 'The transport of phosphate (Pi) between subcellular compartments is central to  metabolic regulation. Although some of the transporters involved in controlling  the intracellular distribution of Pi have been identified in plants, others are  predicted from genetic, biochemical and bioinformatics studies. Heterologous  expression in yeast, and gene expression and localization in plants were used to  characterize all six members of an Arabidopsis thaliana membrane transporter  family designated here as PHT4. PHT4 proteins share similarity with SLC17/type I  Pi transporters, a diverse group of animal proteins involved in the transport of  Pi, organic anions and chloride. All of the PHT4 proteins mediate Pi transport in  yeast with high specificity. Bioinformatic analysis and localization of PHT4-GFP  fusion proteins indicate that five of the proteins are targeted to the plastid  envelope, and the sixth resides in the Golgi apparatus. PHT4 genes are expressed  in both roots and leaves, although two of the genes are expressed predominantly  in leaves and one mostly in roots. These expression patterns, together with Pi  transport activities and subcellular locations, suggest roles for PHT4 proteins  in the transport of Pi between the cytosol and chloroplasts, heterotrophic  plastids and the Golgi apparatus.', '2008', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02331.x', 'Versaw']
