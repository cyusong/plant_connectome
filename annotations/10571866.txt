['10571866', 'We have analysed the circadian rhythm of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf movements in  the accession Cvi from the Cape Verde Islands, and in the commonly used  laboratory strains Columbia (Col) and Landsberg (erecta) (Ler), which originated  in Northern Europe. The parental lines have similar rhythmic periods, but the  progeny of crosses among them reveal extensive variation for this trait. An  analysis of 48 Ler/Cvi recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and a further 30 Ler/Col  RILs allowed us to locate four putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that  control the period of the circadian clock. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) that  contain a QTL in a small, defined chromo- somal region allowed us to confirm the  phenotypic effect and to map the positions of three period QTLs, designated  ESPRESSO, NON TROPPO and RALENTANDO. Quantitative trait loci at the locations of  RALENTANDO and of a fourth QTL, ANDANTE, were identified in both Ler/Cvi and  Ler/Col RIL populations. Some QTLs for circadian period are closely linked to  loci that control flowering time, including FLC. We show that flc mutations  shorten the circadian period such that the known allelic variation in the  MADS-box gene FLC can account for the ANDANTE QTL. The QTLs ESPRESSO and  RALENTANDO identify new genes that regulate the Arabidopsis circadian system in  nature, one of which may be the flowering-time gene GIGANTEA.', '1999 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00577.x', 'Millar']
