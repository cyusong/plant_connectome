Detection of very small amounts of RNA based on microdissection of plant tissue is essential for modern plant biology. Mass spectroscopy technology (MassARRAY) based on Sequenomtrade mark instrumentation was adapted to determine quickly and in a high-throughput fashion (by multiplexing) the absolute amounts of mRNA of closely related soybean genes. A sensitivity of 0.1 amol (10(-19)) was achieved, representing as few as 1,000 mRNA molecules. This methodology eliminates the use of housekeeping genes as reference standards and has multiple applications for plant functional genomics, such as the monitoring of individual expression of paralogous genes at ultra-low expression levels and/or in extremely small tissue samples.
