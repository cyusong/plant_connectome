Brassinosteroid (BR) plays an important role in plant development and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, but its specific function remains largely unknown in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), preventing its utilization in this important crop. In this study, the function of BR and its underlying cytological role in wheat root development were comprehensively investigated. Our findings demonstrated that BR has a conserved function in regulating root length in wheat, and novel roles in regulating lateral root emergence and root diameter were uncovered. Analyses of BR homologous gene composition and evolutionary divergence demonstrated that the genetic framework of the wheat BR pathway was close to that of rice, but contained highly redundant homologous copies of genes from the subgenome A, B and D. These homologous copies showed active expression and shared a conserved BR response. The expression of wheat DWF4 and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) genes in Arabidopsis confirmed that multiple homologous copies maintained their conserved function in regulating root development, highlighting their redundant status and indicating that a special challenge exists in wheat gene modification to deal with this high redundancy. However, our results suggested that the hypermorphic effect of T. aestivum GSK (TaGSK) genes with point mutations may be an effective approach to overcome this redundancy in the manipulation of BR signaling in wheat. Our study provides fundamental data uncovering the function of BR in wheat root development, the underlying genetic basis and a possible strategy to manipulate BR signaling in hexaploid wheat.
