['23795294', 'The gaseous plant hormone ethylene regulates a multitude of growth and  developmental processes. How the numerous growth control pathways are coordinated  by the ethylene transcriptional response remains elusive. We characterized the  dynamic ethylene transcriptional response by identifying targets of the master  regulator of the ethylene signaling pathway, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), using  chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and transcript sequencing during a  timecourse of ethylene treatment. Ethylene-induced transcription occurs in  temporal waves regulated by EIN3, suggesting distinct layers of transcriptional  control. EIN3 binding was found to modulate a multitude of downstream  transcriptional cascades, including a major feedback regulatory circuitry of the  ethylene signaling pathway, as well as integrating numerous connections between  most of the hormone mediated growth response pathways. These findings provide  direct evidence linking each of the major plant growth and development networks  in novel ways.
