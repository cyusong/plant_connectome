This review deals with biochemical and physiological aspects of plant ornithine d-aminotransferase (OAT, EC 2.6.1.13). OAT is a mitochondrial enzyme containing pyridoxal-5'-phosphate as a cofactor, which catalyzes the conversion of L-ornithine to L-glutamate gamma-semialdehyde using 2-oxoglutarate as a terminal amino group acceptor. It has been described in humans, animals, insects, plants and microorganisms. Based on the crystal structure of human OAT, both substrate binding and reaction mechanism of the enzyme are well understood. OAT shows a large structural and mechanistic similarity to other enzymes from the subgroup III of aminotransferases, which transfer an amino group from a carbon atom that does not carry a carboxyl function. In plants, the enzyme has been implicated in proline biosynthesis and accumulation (via pyrroline-5-carboxylate), which represents a way to regulate cellular osmolarity in response to osmotic stress. However, the exact metabolic pathway involving OAT remains a subject of controversy.
