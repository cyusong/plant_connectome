['18359753', 'In plants, MYB transcription factors play important roles in many developmental  processes including cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and lateral  organ polarity. It is shown here that the R2R3-MYB AtMYB11 gene is expressed in  root and shoot meristems and also in young still meristematic leaf and flower  primordia of Arabidopsis. Knock-out atmyb11-I mutants and RNAi plants germinate  faster, show a faster hypocotyl and primary root elongation, develop more lateral  and adventitious roots, show faster development of the inflorescence, and  initiate more lateral inflorescences and fruits than wild-type plants. The  opposite phenotype was displayed by plants overexpressing AtMYB11. De novo  formation of root meristemoids and, consequently, macroscopic roots, from thin  cell layers cultured in vitro was enhanced in explants from atmyb11-I and reduced  in those from lines overexpressing AtMYB11. These findings indicate that AtMYB11  modulates overall growth in plants by reducing the proliferation activity of  meristematic cells and delaying plant development.', '2008', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ern027', 'Tonelli']
