Nitrogen-13 (t(1/2) 9.97 m), a radioactive isotope of nitrogen, offers unique opportunities to explore plant nitrogen utilization over short time periods. Here we describe a method for administering (13)N as gaseous (13)NH(3) to intact leaves of Nicotiana tabacum L. (cv Samsun), and measuring the labelled amino acids using radio high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on tissue extract. We used this method to study the effects of defence induction on plant nitrogen utilization by applying treatments of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a potent defence elicitor. MeJA caused a significant increase relative to controls in key [(13)N]amino acids, including serine, glycine and alanine by 4 h post-treatment, yet had no effect on (13)NH(3) incorporation, a process that is primarily under the control of the glutamine synthatase/glutamate synthase pathway (GS/GOGAT) in cellular photorespiration. We suggest that the reconfiguration of nitrogen metabolism may reflect induction of non-photorespiratory sources of nitrogen to better serve the plant's defences.

Nitrogen-13: !administers! Nicotiana tabacum L. 
Methyl jasmonate: !induces! defence 
Serine, glycine, alanine: !increases! relative to controls 
(13)NH(3): !has no effect on! incorporation 
Glutamine synthatase/glutamate synthase pathway: !controls! photorespiration 
Reconfiguration of nitrogen metabolism: !reflects! induction of non-photorespiratory sources
