['19903478', "In Arabidopsis thaliana, adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate kinase (APK) provides  activated sulfate for sulfation of secondary metabolites, including the  glucosinolates. We have successfully isolated three of the four possible triple  homozygous mutant combinations of this family. The APK1 isoform alone was  sufficient to maintain WT levels of growth and development. Analysis of apk1 apk2  apk3 and apk1 apk3 apk4 mutants suggests that APK3 and APK4 are functionally  redundant, despite being located in cytosol and plastids, respectively. We were,  however, unable to isolate apk1 apk3 apk4 mutants, most probably because the apk1  apk3 apk4 triple mutant combination is pollen lethal. Therefore, we conclude that  APS kinase is essential for plant reproduction and viability.", '2010 Jan 4', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.11.014', 'Kopriva']
