['21917552', 'Although excess boron (B) is known to negatively affect plant growth, its  molecular mechanism of toxicity is unknown. We previously isolated two  Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, hypersensitive to excess B (heb1-1 and heb2-1). In  this study, we found that HEB1 and HEB2 encode the CAP-G2 and CAP-H2 subunits,  respectively, of the condensin II protein complex, which functions in the  maintenance of chromosome structure. Growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in medium  containing excess B induced expression of condensin II subunit genes.  Simultaneous treatment with zeocin, which induces DNA double-strand breaks  (DSBs), and aphidicolin, which blocks DNA replication, mimicked the effect of  excess B on root growth in the heb mutants. Both excess B and the heb mutations  upregulated DSBs and DSB-inducible gene transcription, suggesting that DSBs are a  cause of B toxicity and that condensin II reduces the incidence of DSBs. The  Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant atr-2, which is sensitive to  replication-blocking reagents, was also sensitive to excess B. Taken together,  these data suggest that the B toxicity mechanism in plants involves DSBs and  possibly replication blocks and that plant condensin II plays a role in DNA  damage repair or in protecting the genome from certain genotoxic stressors,  particularly excess B.', '2011 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.086314', 'Fujiwara']
