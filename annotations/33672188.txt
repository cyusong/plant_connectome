Soil salinization is a serious and growing problem around the world. Some plants, recognized as the recretohalophytes, can normally grow on saline-alkali soil without adverse effects by secreting excessive salt out of the body. The elucidation of the salt secretion process is of great significance for understanding the salt tolerance mechanism adopted by the recretohalophytes. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, three hypotheses, including the osmotic potential hypothesis, the transfer system similar to liquid flow in animals, and vesicle-mediated exocytosis, were proposed to explain the salt secretion process of plant salt glands. More recently, increasing evidence has indicated that vesicular transport plays vital roles in salt secretion of recretohalophytes. Here, we summarize recent findings, especially regarding the molecular evidence on the functional roles of vesicular trafficking in the salt secretion process of plant salt glands. A model of salt secretion in salt gland is also proposed.
