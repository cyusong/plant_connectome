['28554477', 'The Arabidopsis GASA10 gene encodes a GAST1-like (Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated)  protein. Reporter gene analysis identified consistent expression in anthers and  seeds. In anthers expression was developmentally regulated, first appearing at  stage 7 of anther development and reaching a maximum at stage 11. Strongest  expression was in the tapetum and developing microspores. GASA10 expression also  occurred throughout the seed and in root vasculature. GASA10 was shown to be  transported to the cell wall. Using GASA1 and GASA6 as positive controls,  gibberellic acid was found not to induce GASA10 expression in Arabidopsis  suspension cells. Overexpression of GASA10 (35S promoter-driven) resulted in a  reduction in silique elongation. GASA10 shares structural similarities to the  antimicrobial peptide snakin1, however, purified GASA10 failed to influence the  growth of a variety of bacterial and fungal species tested. We propose cell wall  associated GASA proteins are involved in regulating the hydroxyl radical levels  at specific sites in the cell wall to facilitate wall growth (regulating cell  wall elongation).', '2017 Jul', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2017.04.003', 'Parish']
