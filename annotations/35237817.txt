The pH parameter of soil plays a key role for plant nutrition as it is affecting the availability of minerals and consequently determines plant growth. Although the mechanisms by which root perceive the external pH is still unknown, the impact of external pH on tissue growth has been widely studied especially in hypocotyl and root. Thanks to technological development of cell imaging and fluorescent sensors, we can now monitor pH in real time with at subcellular definition. In this focus, fluorescent dye-based, as well as genetically-encoded pH indicators are discussed especially with respect to their ability to monitor acidic pH in the context of primary root. The notion of apoplastic subdomains is discussed and suggestions are made to develop fluorescent indicators for pH values below 5.0.
