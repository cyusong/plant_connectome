['24580679', 'During initial spliceosome assembly, SF1 binds to intron branch points and  interacts with U2 snRNP auxiliary factor 65 (U2AF65). Here, we present evidence  indicating that AtSF1, the Arabidopsis SF1 homolog, interacts with AtU2AF65a and  AtU2AF65b, the Arabidopsis U2AF65 homologs. A mutant allele of AtSF1 (At5g51300)  that contains a T-DNA insertion conferred pleiotropic developmental defects,  including early flowering and abnormal sensitivity to abscisic acid. An AtSF1  promoter-driven GUS reporter assay showed that AtSF1 promoter activity was  temporally and spatially altered, and that full AtSF1 promoter activity required  a significant proportion of the coding region. DNA chip analyses showed that only  a small proportion of the transcriptome was altered by more than twofold in  either direction in the AtSF1 mutant. Expression of the mRNAs of many heat shock  proteins was more than fourfold higher in the mutant strain; these mRNAs were  among those whose expression was increased most in the mutant strain. An RT-PCR  assay revealed an altered alternative splicing pattern for heat shock  transcription factor HsfA2 (At2g26150) in the mutant; this altered splicing is  probably responsible for the increased expression of the target genes induced by  HsfA2. Altered alternative splicing patterns were also detected for the  transcripts of other genes in the mutant strain. These results suggest that AtSF1  has functional similarities to its yeast and metazoan counterparts.', '2014 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12491', 'Kim']
