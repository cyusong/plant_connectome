SlBBX28 is a positive regulator of auxin metabolism and signaling, affecting plant growth and flower number in tomato B-box domain-containing proteins (BBXs) comprise a family of transcription factors that regulate several processes, such as photomorphogenesis, flowering, and stress responses. For this reason, attention is being directed toward the functional characterization of these proteins, although knowledge in species other than Arabidopsis thaliana remains scarce. Particularly in the tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, only three out of 31 SlBBX proteins have been functionally characterized to date. To deepen the understanding of the role of these proteins in tomato plant development and yield, SlBBX28, a light-responsive gene, was constitutively silenced, resulting in plants with smaller leaves and fewer flowers per inflorescence. Moreover, SlBBX28 knockdown reduced hypocotyl elongation in darkness-grown tomato. Analyses of auxin content and responsiveness revealed that SlBBX28 promotes auxin-mediated responses. Altogether, the data revealed that SlBBX28 promotes auxin production and signaling, ultimately leading to proper hypocotyl elongation, leaf expansion, and inflorescence development, which are crucial traits determining tomato yield.
