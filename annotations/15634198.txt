Previous studies have indicated that Arabidopsis thaliana experienced a genome-wide duplication event shortly before its divergence from Brassica followed by extensive chromosomal rearrangements and deletions. While a large number of the duplicated genes have significantly diverged or lost their sister genes, we found 4222 pairs that are still highly conserved, and as a result had similar functional assignments during the annotation of the genome sequence. Using whole-genome DNA microarrays, we identified 906 duplicated gene pairs in which at least one member exhibited a significant response to oxidative stress. Among these, only 117 pairs were up- or down-regulated in both pairs and many of these exhibited dissimilar patterns of expression. Examination of the expression patterns of PAL1 and PAL2, ACD1 and ACD2, genes coding for two Hsp20s, various P450s, and electron transfer flavoproteins suggests Arabidopsis evolved a number of distinct oxidative stress response mechanisms using similar gene sets following the duplication of its genome.
