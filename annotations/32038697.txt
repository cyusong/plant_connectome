DNA binding with one finger (Dof) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors with important and diverse functions in seed germination, flowering time, and biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, haplotype-based association analysis was conducted between heading date and 30 <i>Dof</i> family genes in a worldwide germplasm collection. Of these, 22 <i>Dof</i> genes were associated with heading date. Multiple comparisons among haplotypes revealed their diverse functions in promoting and suppressing heading date under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions. They cumulatively made a considerable contribution to the missing heritability of heading date. A set of knockout mutants of 30 <i>Dof</i> genes generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology showed that 11 and 9 <i>Dof</i> genes regulated heading date under LD and SD, respectively. Phenotype measurement of mutants showed that these 11 and 9 <i>Dof</i> genes slightly regulated heading with effects of 2-5 days under LD and SD, respectively. Both mutant and natural variation assays indicated functional redundancy in regulating heading date among <i>Dof</i> family genes. Nucleotide diversity analysis suggested that most <i>Dof</i> genes have been subjected to selection during domestication and improvement. Beyond heading date, this set of mutants is also a good resource for evaluating the function of <i>Dof</i> genes in regulating stress tolerance and seed germination.
