The MYB transcription factors (TFs) are evolving as critical role in the regulation of the phenylpropanoid and tanshinones biosynthetic pathway. MYB TFs relate to a very important gene family, which are involved in the regulation of primary and secondary metabolisms, terpenoids, bioactive compounds, plant defense against various stresses and cell morphology. R2R3 MYB TFs contained a conserved N-terminal domain, but the domain at C-terminal sorts them different regarding their structures and functions. MYB TFs suppressors generally possess particular repressive motifs, such as pdLNLD/ELxiG/S and TLLLFR, which contribute to their suppression role through a diversity of complex regulatory mechanisms. A novel flower specific "NF/YWSV/MEDF/LW" conserved motif has a great potential to understand the mechanisms of flower development. In the current review, we summarize recent advanced progress of MYB TFs on transcription regulation, posttranscriptional, microRNA, conserved motif and propose directions to future prospective research. We further suggest there should be more focus on the investigation for the role of MYB TFs in microalgae, which has great potential for heterologous protein expression system for future perspectives.
