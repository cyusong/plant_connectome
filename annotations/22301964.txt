Organelle dynamics in the plant male gametophyte has received attention for its importance in pollen tube growth and cytoplasmic inheritance. We recently revealed the dynamic behaviors of plastids in living Arabidopsis pollen grains and tubes, using an inherent promoter-driven FtsZ1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion. Here, we further monitored the movement of pollen tube plastids with an actin1 promoter-driven, stroma-targeted yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). In elongating pollen tubes, most plastids localized to the tube shank, where they displayed either retarded and unsteady motion, or fast, directional, and long-distance movement along the tube polarity. Efficient plastid tracking further revealed a population of tip-forwarding plastids that undergo a fluctuating motion(s) before traveling backwards. The behavior of YFP-labeled plastids in pollen basically resembled that of FtsZ1-GFP-labeled plastids, thus validating the use of FtsZ1-GFP for simultaneous visualization of the stroma and the plastid-dividing FtsZ ring.
