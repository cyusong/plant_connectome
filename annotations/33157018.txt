The ability to thrive in diverse environments requires that species maintain development and reproduction despite dynamic conditions. Many developmental processes are stabilized through robust signaling pathways that cooperatively ensure proper development.<sup>1</sup> During reproduction, plants like Arabidopsis thaliana continuously generate flowers on growing indeterminate inflorescences.<sup>2</sup> Flower primordia initiation and outgrowth depends on the hormone auxin and is robust across diverse environments.<sup>3-6</sup> Here, we show that reproductive development under different thermal conditions requires the integration of multiple pathways regulating auxin-dependent flower production. In colder/ambient temperatures, the receptor complex CLAVATA2/CORYNE (CLV2/CRN) is necessary for continuous flower outgrowth during inflorescence development. CLV2/CRN signaling is independent of CLAVATA1 (CLV1)-related receptor signaling but involves the CLAVATA3 INSENSITIVE RECEPTOR KINASE (CIK) family co-receptors, with higher order cik mutant combinations phenocopying clv2/crn flower outgrowth defects. Developing crn inflorescences display reduced auxin signaling, and restoration of auxin biosynthesis is sufficient to restore flower outgrowth in colder and ambient temperatures. In contrast, at higher temperatures, both clv2/crn signaling and heat-induced auxin biosynthesis via YUCCA family genes are synergistically required to maintain flower development. Our work reveals a novel mechanism integrating peptide hormone and auxin signaling in the regulation of flower development across diverse thermal environments.
