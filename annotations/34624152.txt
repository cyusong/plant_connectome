Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox) is one of the most important ornamental plants. Its color is mainly determined by the middle tepals. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the intriguing flower color development among different wintersweet groups are still largely unknown. In addition, wintersweet belongs to magnoliids, and the phylogenetic position of magnoliids remains to be determined conclusively. Here, the whole genome of red flower wintersweet, a new wintersweet type, was sequenced and assembled with high quality. The genome comprised 11 super-scaffolds (chromosomes) with a total size of 737.03 Mb. Based on the analyses of the long branch attraction, incomplete lineage sorting, sparse taxon sampling, and other factors, we suggest that a bifurcating tree may not fully represent the complex early diversification of the angiosperms and that magnoliids are most likely sister to the eudicots. The wintersweet genome appears to have undergone two whole-genome duplication (WGD) events: a recent WGD event representing an independent event specific to the Calycanthaceae and an ancient WGD event shared by Laurales. By integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data, CpANS1 and the transcription factor CpMYB1 were found to play key roles in regulating tepal color development, whereas CpMYB1 needs to form a complex with bHLH and WD40 to fully perform its regulatory function. The present study not only provides novel insights into the evolution of magnoliids and the molecular mechanism for flower color development, but also lays the foundation for subsequent functional genomics study and molecular breeding of wintersweet.
