['21216945', 'Tap42/alpha4, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, is a downstream  effector of the target of rapamycin (TOR) protein kinase, which regulates cell  growth in coordination with nutrient and environmental conditions in yeast and  mammals. In this study, we characterized the functions and phosphatase regulation  of plant Tap46. Depletion of Tap46 resulted in growth arrest and acute plant  death with morphological markers of programmed cell death. Tap46 interacted with  PP2A and PP2A-like phosphatases PP4 and PP6. Tap46 silencing modulated cellular  PP2A activities in a time-dependent fashion similar to TOR silencing.  Immunoprecipitated full-length and deletion forms of Arabidopsis thaliana TOR  phosphorylated recombinant Tap46 protein in vitro, supporting a functional link  between Tap46 and TOR. Tap46 depletion reproduced the signature phenotypes of TOR  inactivation, such as dramatic repression of global translation and activation of  autophagy and nitrogen mobilization, indicating that Tap46 may act as a positive  effector of TOR signaling in controlling those processes. Additionally, Tap46  silencing in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells caused chromatin bridge  formation at anaphase, indicating its role in sister chromatid segregation. These  findings suggest that Tap46, in conjunction with associated phosphatases, plays  an essential role in plant growth and development as a component of the TOR  signaling pathway.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074005', 'Pai']
