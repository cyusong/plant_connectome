In the past few years, factors involved in abscisic acid signalling have been isolated and recognized as elements related to RNA metabolism, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is required for abiotic stress responses. Some of these factors can be linked to the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNA molecules that are important regulators of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by repressing mRNA expression. Here, we review the role of miRNAs in stress responses, highlighting recent advances in elucidating the role of individual miRNAs and efforts to identify stress-responsive miRNAs at a genome-wide level in different model plants. Complete understanding of miRNA action depends on the identification of its target transcripts, and recent developments in miRNA research indicate that they will be uncovered in the near future.
