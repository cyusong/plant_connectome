Seismonastic or thigmonastic movements of Mimosa pudica L. is mostly because of the fast loss of water from swollen motor cells, resulting in temporary collapse of cells and quick curvature in the parts where these cells are located. Because of this, the plant has been much studied since the 18th century, leading us to think about the classical binomial stimulus-response (action-reaction) when compared to animals. Mechanic and electrical stimuli were used to investigate the analogy of mimosa branch with an artificial neuron model and to observe the action potential propagation through the mimosa branch. Boolean function applied to the mimosa branch in analogy with an artificial neuron model is one of the peculiarities of our hypothesis.
