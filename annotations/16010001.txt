The Gene Ontology project (http://www.geneontology.org/) produces structured, controlled vocabularies and gene product annotations. Gene products are classified according to the cellular locations and biological process in which they act, and the molecular functions that they carry out. We annotate gene products from a broad range of model species and provide support for those groups that wish to contribute annotation of further model species. The Gene Ontology facilitates the exchange of information between groups of scientists studying similar processes in different model organisms, and so provides a broad range of opportunities for plant scientists.
