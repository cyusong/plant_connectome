['30698803', "Double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in plant organelles are repaired via genomic  rearrangements characterized by microhomologous repeats. These microhomologous  signatures predict the existence of an unidentified enzymatic machinery capable  of repairing of DSBs via microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) in plant  organelles. Here, we show that organellar DNA polymerases from Arabidopsis  thaliana (AtPolIA and AtPolIB) perform MMEJ using microhomologous sequences as  short as six nucleotides. AtPolIs execute MMEJ by virtue of two specialized amino  acid insertions located in their thumb subdomains. Single-stranded binding  proteins (SSBs) unique to plants, AtWhirly2 and organellar single-stranded  binding proteins (AtOSBs), hinder MMEJ, whereas canonical mitochondrial SSBs  (AtmtSSB1 and AtmtSSB2) do not interfere with MMEJ. Our data predict that  organellar DNA rearrangements by MMEJ are a consequence of a competition for the  3'-OH of a DSBs. If AtWhirlies or AtOSBs gain access to the single-stranded DNA  (ssDNA) region of a DSB, the reaction will shift towards high-fidelity routes  like homologous recombination. Conversely MMEJ would be favored if AtPolIs or  AtmtSSBs interact with the DSB. AtPolIs are not phylogenetically related to  metazoan mitochondrial DNA polymerases, and the ability of AtPolIs to execute  MMEJ may explain the abundance of DNA rearrangements in plant organelles in  comparison to animal mitochondria.", '2019 Apr 8', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkz039', 'Brieba']
