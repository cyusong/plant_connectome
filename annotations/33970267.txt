The environment is continuously challenging plants. As a response, plants use various coping strategies, such as adaptation of their growth. Thermomorphogenesis is a specific growth adaptation that promotes organ growth in response to moderately high temperature. This would eventually enable plants to cool down by dissipating the heat. Although well understood for shoot organs, the thermomorphogenesis response in roots only recently obtained increasing research attention. Accordingly, in the last few years, the hormonal responses and underlying molecular players important for root thermomorphogenesis were revealed. Other responses triggered by high temperature in the root encompass modifications of overall root architecture and interactions with the soil environment, with consequences on the whole plant. Here, we review the scientific knowledge and highlight the current understanding on roots responding to moderately high and extreme temperature.
