It has long been recognized that stomatal movement modulates CO<sub>2</sub> availability and as a consequence the photosynthetic rate of plants, and that this process is feedback-regulated by photoassimilates. However, the genetic components and mechanisms underlying this regulatory loop remain poorly understood, especially in monocot crop species. Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) mutant named <i>closed stomata1</i> (<i>cst1</i>). Map-based cloning of <i>cst1</i> followed by confirmation with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR <i>associated protein 9</i> system identified the causal mutation in a Clade I Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEET) family gene, which leads to the E81K mutation in the CST1 protein. <i>CST1</i> encodes a functional glucose transporter expressed in subsidiary cells, and the E81K mutation strongly impairs the oligomerization and glucose transporter activity of CST1. Mutation of <i>CST1</i> results in reduced stomatal opening, carbon starvation, and early senescence in leaves, suggesting that <i>CST1</i> functions as a positive regulator of stomatal opening. Moreover, <i>CST1</i> expression is induced by carbon starvation and suppressed by photoassimilate accumulation. Our study thus defines <i>CST1</i> as a missing link in the feedback-regulation of stomatal movement and photosynthesis by photoassimilates in maize.
