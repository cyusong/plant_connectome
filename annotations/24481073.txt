Plants respond to changes in the environment by triggering a suite of regulatory networks that control and synchronize molecular signaling in different tissues, organs, and the whole plant. Molecular studies through genetic and environmental perturbations, particularly in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, have revealed many of the mechanisms by which these responses are actuated. In recent years, mathematical modeling has become a complementary tool to the experimental approach that has furthered our understanding of biological mechanisms. In this review, we present modeling examples encompassing a range of different biological processes, in particular those regulated by light. Current issues and future directions in the modeling of plant systems are discussed.
