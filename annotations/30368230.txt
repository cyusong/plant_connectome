Lipoxygenases (LOXs) (EC 1.13.11.12) catalyze the oxygenation of fatty acids and produce oxylipins including the plant hormone jasmonate (jasmonic acid/methyl jasmonate; MeJA). Little is known about the tomato LOX gene family members that impact tomato growth and development, and less so about their feed-back regulation in response to MeJA. We present genome wide identification of 14 LOX gene family members in tomato which map unevenly on 12 chromosomes. The characteristic structural features of 9-LOX and 13-LOX tomato gene family, their protein domains/features, and divergence are presented. Quantification of the expression patterns of all the 14 SlLOX gene members segregated the members based on differential association with growth, development, or fruit ripening. We also identified those SlLOX genes whose transcription responds to exogenous MeJA and/or wounding stress. MeJA-based feedback regulation that involves activation of specific members of LOX genes is defined. Specific nature of SlLOX gene regulation in tomato is defined. The novel data on dynamics of SlLOX gene expression should help catalyze future strategies to elucidate role(s) of each gene member in planta and for crop biotechnological intervention.
