Wood formation is the terminal differentiation of xylem mother cells derived from cambial initials, and negative regulators play important roles in xylem differentiation. The molecular mechanism of the negative regulator of xylem differentiation PagKNAT2/6b was investigated. PagKNAT2/6b is an ortholog of Arabidopsis KNAT2 and KNAT6 that is highly expressed in phloem and xylem. Compared to nontransgenic control plants, transgenic poplar plants overexpressing PagKNAT2/6b present with altered vascular patterns, characterized by decreased secondary xylem with thin cell walls containing less cellulose, xylose and lignin. RNA sequencing analyses revealed that differentially expressed genes are enriched in xylem differentiation and secondary wall synthesis functions. Expression of NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) domain genes including PagSND1-A1, PagSND1-A2, PagSND1-B2 and PagVND6-C1 is downregulated by PagKNAT2/6b, while PagXND1a is directly upregulated. Accordingly, the dominant repression form of PagKNAT2/6b leads to increased xylem width per stem diameter through downregulation of PagXND1a. PagKNAT2/6b can inhibit cell differentiation and secondary wall deposition during wood formation in poplar by modulating the expression of NAC domain transcription factors. Direct activation of PagXND1a by PagKNAT2/6b is a key node in the negative regulatory network of xylem differentiation by KNOXs.
