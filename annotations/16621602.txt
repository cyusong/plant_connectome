['16621602', 'Fluorescent cell division cycle (CDC)48 proteins were studied in living plant  protoplasts. CDC48A and somatic embryogenesis receptor like kinase 1 (SERK1) were  found to co-localize in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and at the plasma  membrane (PM), but not in endosomal compartments. Fluorescent lifetime imaging  microscopy (FLIM) was used to detect Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)  between CrFP/YFP-tagged CDC48A and SERK1. FRET is indicative of direct  protein-protein interaction. CDC48A was found to interact only with SERK1 in  small areas at the PM, but not in endosomes. These findings confirm and extend  our previous findings that CDC48A in plants directly interacts with SERK1.', '2006 Oct', 'J Struct Biol', '10.1016/j.jsb.2006.03.004', 'de']
