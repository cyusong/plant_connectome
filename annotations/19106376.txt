The homeostasis of gibberellins (GAs) is maintained by negative feedback in plants. REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG) is a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) transcriptional activator that has been suggested to play a role in GA feedback by the regulation of GA biosynthetic enzymes. The 14-3-3 signaling proteins negatively regulate RSG by sequestering it in the cytoplasm in response to GAs. The phosphorylation on Ser-114 of RSG is essential for 14-3-3 binding of RSG. Here, we identified tobacco Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase (CDPK1) as an RSG kinase that promotes 14-3-3 binding to RSG by phosphorylation of Ser-114 of RSG. CDPK1 interacts with RSG in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro and specifically phosphorylates Ser-114 of RSG. Inhibition of CDPK repressed the GA-induced phosphorylation of Ser-114 of RSG and the GA-induced nuclear export of RSG. Overexpression of CDPK1 inhibited the feedback regulation of a GA 20-oxidase gene and resulted in sensitization to the GA biosynthetic inhibitor. Our results suggest that CDPK1 decodes the Ca(2+) signal produced by GAs and regulates the intracellular localization of RSG.
