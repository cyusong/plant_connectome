RNA silencing is an integral part of the cellular defense mechanisms in plants that act against virus infection. However, the specific role of RNA silencing and the interplay between host and virus components during recovery from geminivirus infection remains unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed to examine the mechanism behind the host-specific recovery of Nicotiana tabacum infected with Tomato leaf curl Gujarat virus (ToLCGV). Unlike Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), ToLCGV infection resulted in symptom remission in N. tabacum, and we found that this was mainly due to cross-talk between the pre-coat protein (encoded by the AV2 ORF) of the virus and the host RNA-silencing component RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 (encoded by NtRDR1) of N. tabacum. Moreover, apart from the AV2 mutant, other mutants of ToLCNDV developed severe symptoms on a transgenic NtRDR1-overexpression line of N. benthamiana. In contrast, inoculation with ToLCGV resulted in symptom remission, which was due to enhanced methylation of the ToLCGV promoter. Our study reveals a novel 'arms race' in which the pre-coat protein of ToLCNDV selectively blocks the recovery process through inhibiting host-specific RDR1-mediated antiviral silencing in tobacco.
