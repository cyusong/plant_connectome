Cytokinins are plant hormones with crucial roles in growth and development. Although cytokinin signaling is well characterized in the model dicot <i>Arabidopsis</i>, we are only beginning to understand its role in monocots, such as rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and other cereals of agronomic importance. Here, we used primarily a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing approach to characterize the roles of a key family of transcription factors, the type-B response regulators (RRs), in cytokinin signaling in rice. Results from the analysis of single <i>rr</i> mutants as well as higher-order <i>rr21/22/23</i> mutant lines revealed functional overlap as well as subfunctionalization within members of the gene family. Mutant phenotypes associated with decreased activity of rice type-B RRs included effects on leaf and root growth, inflorescence architecture, flower development and fertilization, trichome formation and cytokinin sensitivity. Development of the stigma brush involved in pollen capture was compromised in the <i>rr21/22/23</i> mutant, whereas anther development was compromised in the <i>rr24</i> mutant. Novel as well as conserved roles for type-B RRs in the growth and development of a monocot compared with dicots were identified.
