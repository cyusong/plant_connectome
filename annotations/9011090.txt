['9011090', 'In a screen for early-flowering mutants, a number of mutants that were early  flowering under both short and long days were isolated. One such mutant, pef1,  was selectively insensitive to both red and far-red light in the inhibition of  hypocotyl elongation response; a classic phytochrome phenotype mediated by both  PHYA and PHYB. The pef1 mutant seedlings could not be phenotypically rescued by  biliverdin, a precursor of the phytochrome chromophore, nor did they fail to  complement any previously identified elongated hypocotyl (hy) mutants. Difference  spectra and Western blot analysis showed normal concentrations of PHYA  photoreceptor apoprotein, which appeared photochemically active. It was concluded  that the pef1 mutant is defective in both PHYA- and PHYB-mediated signaling  pathways, and may represent a lesion in an early step of the phytochrome signal  transduction pathway. Additional pef mutants deficient specifically in  PHYB-mediated responses were also identified by this screen.', '1996 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1996.10061103.x', 'Cashmore']
