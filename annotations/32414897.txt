The greening of etiolated seedlings is crucial for the growth and survival of plants. After reaching the soil surface and sunlight, etiolated seedlings integrate numerous environmental signals and internal cues to control the initiation and rate of greening thus to improve their survival and adaption. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms by which light and phytohormones, such as abscisic acid (ABA), coordinately regulate greening of the etiolated seedlings is still unknown. In this study, we showed that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) DE-ETIOLATED1 (DET1), a key negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, positively regulated light-induced greening by repressing ABA responses. Upon irradiating etiolated seedlings with light, DET1 physically interacts with FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and subsequently associates to the promoter region of the FHY3 direct downstream target <i>ABA INSENSITIVE5</i> (<i>ABI5</i>). Further, DET1 recruits HISTONE DEACETYLASE6 to the locus of the <i>ABI5</i> promoter and reduces the enrichments of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 modification, thus subsequently repressing <i>ABI5</i> expression and promoting the greening of etiolated seedlings. This study reveals the physiological and molecular function of DET1 and FHY3 in the greening of seedlings and provides insights into the regulatory mechanism by which plants integrate light and ABA signals to fine-tune early seedling establishment.
