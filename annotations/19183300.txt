We appraised the literature and described an approach to estimate the parameters of the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry model using measured CO(2) assimilation rate (A) and photosystem II (PSII) electron transport efficiency (Phi(2)). The approach uses curve fitting to data of A and Phi(2) at various levels of incident irradiance (I(inc)), intercellular CO(2) (C(i)) and O(2). Estimated parameters include day respiration (R(d)), conversion efficiency of I(inc) into linear electron transport of PSII under limiting light [kappa(2(LL))], electron transport capacity (J(max)), curvature factor (theta) for the non-rectangular hyperbolic response of electron flux to I(inc), ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) CO(2)/O(2) specificity (S(c/o)), Rubisco carboxylation capacity (V(cmax)), rate of triose phosphate utilization (T(p)) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)). The method is used to analyse combined gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements on leaves of various ages and positions in wheat plants grown at two nitrogen levels. Estimated S(c/o) (25 degrees C) was 3.13 mbar microbar(-1); R(d) was lower than respiration in the dark; J(max) was lower and theta was higher at 2% than at 21% O(2); kappa(2(LL)), V(cmax), J(max) and T(p) correlated to leaf nitrogen content; and g(m) decreased with increasing C(i) and with decreasing I(inc). Based on the parameter estimates, we surmised that there was some alternative electron transport.
