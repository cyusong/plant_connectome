The primary cell wall is a fundamental plant constituent that is flexible but sufficiently rigid to support the plant cell shape. Although many studies have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as important signaling messengers to modify the cell wall structure and affect cellular growth, the regulatory mechanism underlying the spatial-temporal regulation of ROS activity for cell wall maintenance remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) multi-copper oxidase-like protein skewed 5 (SKU5) and its homolog SKU5-similar 1 (SKS1) in root cell wall formation through modulating ROS homeostasis. Loss of SKU5 and SKS1 function resulted in aberrant division planes, protruding cell walls, ectopic deposition of iron, and NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS overproduction in the root epidermis-cortex and cortex-endodermis junctions. A decrease of ROS level or inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity rescued the cell wall defects of sku5 sks1 double mutants. SKU5 and SKS1 proteins were activated by iron treatment, and iron over-accumulated in the walls between root epidermis and cortex cell layers of sku5 sks1. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored motif was crucial for membrane association and functionality of SKU5 and SKS1. Overall, our results identified SKU5 and SKS1 as regulators of ROS at the cell surface for regulation of cell wall structure and root cell growth.
