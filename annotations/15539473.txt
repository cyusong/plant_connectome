['15539473', 'Regulation of iron uptake is critical for plant survival. Although the activities  responsible for reduction and transport of iron at the plant root surface have  been described, the genes controlling these activities are largely unknown. We  report the identification of the essential gene Fe-deficiency Induced  Transcription Factor 1 (FIT1), which encodes a putative transcription factor that  regulates iron uptake responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Like the Fe(III) chelate  reductase FRO2 and high affinity Fe(II) transporter IRT1, FIT1 mRNA is detected  in the outer cell layers of the root and accumulates in response to iron  deficiency. fit1 mutant plants are chlorotic and die as seedlings but can be  rescued by the addition of supplemental iron, pointing to a defect in iron  uptake. fit1 mutant plants accumulate less iron than wild-type plants in root and  shoot tissues. Microarray analysis shows that expression of many (72 of 179)  iron-regulated genes is dependent on FIT1. We demonstrate that FIT1 regulates  FRO2 at the level of mRNA accumulation and IRT1 at the level of protein  accumulation. We propose a new model for iron uptake in Arabidopsis where FRO2  and IRT1 are differentially regulated by FIT1.', '2004 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.024315', 'Guerinot']
