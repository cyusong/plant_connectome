Gibberellin (GA) plays a key role in the release of bud dormancy and the GA receptor GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1) and DELLA protein are the GA signaling parts, but the molecular mechanism of GA-GID1-DELLA module regulating leaf bud dormancy in peach (<i>Prunus persica</i>) is still not very clear. In this study, we isolated and characterized the GID1 gene <i>PpGID1c</i> from the peach cultivar "Zhong you No.4." Overexpressing <i>PpGID1c</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> promoted seed germination, which indicated that <i>PpGID1c</i> has an important function in dormancy. The expression level of PpGID1c in peach leaf buds during endodormancy release was higher than that during ecodormancy and was positively correlated with GA<sub>4</sub> levels. Our study also found that GA<sub>4</sub> had the most obvious effect on promoting the bud break, indicating that GA<sub>4</sub> may be the key gibberellin to promoting peach leaf bud endodormancy release. Moreover, a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) found that GA<sub>4</sub> could increase the expression of the gibberellin signaling gene <i>PpDELLA2</i>. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay suggested that the PpGID1c interaction with the PpDELLA1 protein was not dependent on gibberellin, while the PpGID1c interaction with PpDELLA2 required GA<sub>4</sub> or another gibberellin. These findings suggested that the GA<sub>4</sub>-GID1c-DELLA2 module regulates peach leaf bud endodormancy release, with this finding significantly enhancing our comprehensive understanding of bud endodormancy release and revealing a new mechanism for regulating leaf bud endodormancy release in peach.
