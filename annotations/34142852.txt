<i>Kabatiella zeae</i> is the causative pathogen of corn eyespot disease, which is an important leaf disease that damages corn (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) worldwide. In this study, we provided an annotated draft of the assembled genome of the <i>K. zeae</i> field strain KZ1 through PacBio and Illumina sequencing. The assembled KZ1 genome size is 23,602,820 bp, and its GC content is 50.71%. The completeness of the assembled genome is 97.6% in this study. The assembly obtained in this study has 94 contigs and the length of N<sub>50</sub> is 720,243 bp. This study is the first report of the <i>K. zeae</i> genome, which contributes to further research on the genetic variation and pathogenic mechanism of this important fungal pathogen.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
