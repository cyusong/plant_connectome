['21781195', 'In plants, stem cells reside in apical meristems, and provide the descendants  required for post-embryonic growth and development throughout the life of a  plant. To identify a novel factor required for the maintenance of stem cells, we  isolated an Arabidopsis mutant, named meristem disorganization 1-1 (mdo1-1), that  exhibits several developmental defects, such as abnormal phyllotaxy and  plastochron, stem fasciation and retarded root growth. We found that the mutant  plants fail to maintain stem cells, resulting in the differentiation or death of  stem cells. The mutant plants also showed several phenotypes related to DNA  damage, suggesting that the mutant cells are exposed constitutively to DNA damage  even without external genotoxic stress. The growth defect and the  hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents of mdo1-1 were enhanced significantly  when combined with a lesion of the ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM) gene, but  not of the ATM/RAD3-RELATED (ATR) gene, suggesting that the function of the MDO1  gene is closely related to that of ATM kinase. The MDO1 gene encodes an unknown  protein that is conserved in a wide variety of land plants. The results thus  suggested that the MDO1 gene product is required for the maintenance of stem  cells through a reduction in DNA damage.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04718.x', 'Ueguchi']
