High quantities of anthocyanins in plants confer potential protective benefits against biotic and abiotic stressors. Studies have shown that the bZIP transcription factor HY5 plays a key role in controlling anthocyanin accumulation in response to light. However, in hy5 mutants, residual anthocyanins have been detected, indicating that other regulators exist to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in an HY5-independent manner. Here, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system specifically to induce targeted mutagenesis of SlHY5 in the purple tomato cultivar 'Indigo Rose'. The T2 generation of tomato plants homozygous for the null allele of the SlHY5 frameshift mutated by a 1 bp insertion contained a lower anthocyanin content. Transcriptional analysis showed that most of the anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes and several regulatory genes were down-regulated in the hy5 mutant lines. With transcriptome analyses of the various tissues from hy5 mutant lines, eight candidate transcription factors were identified that may regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in an HY5-independent manner. These findings deepen our understanding of how light controls anthocyanin accumulation and facilitate the identification of the regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in an HY5-independent manner.
