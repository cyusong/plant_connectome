Despite the key role of proteolysis in various intensively studied biological processes, such as plant immunity, seed development and abiotic stress responses, our knowledge on the identity of natural protease substrates in plants remains scarce. In the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, for instance, approximately 700 genes code for proteases. However, only a few natural substrates have been identified, mainly because of the previous lack of sensitive proteomics technologies enabling the identification of low abundant proteins, together with a delay in the implementation of these technologies in the field of plant research. Here, we review the current knowledge on the identity of natural plant protease substrates and describe recently established degradomics technologies that should allow proteome-wide studies of plant proteases in the near future.
