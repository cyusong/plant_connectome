Endosymbiotic associations between hornworts and nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria form when the plant is limited for combined nitrogen (N). We generated RNA-seq data to examine temporal gene expression patterns during the culturing of N-starved <i>Anthoceros punctatus</i> in the absence and the presence of symbiotic cyanobacterium <i>Nostoc punctiforme</i>. In symbiont-free <i>A</i>. <i>punctatus</i> gametophytes, N starvation caused downregulation of chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics as well as transcription of photosynthesis-related genes. This downregulation was reversed in <i>A</i>. <i>punctatus</i> cocultured with <i>N</i>. <i>punctiforme</i>, corresponding to the provision by the symbiont of N<sub>2</sub>-derived NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, which commenced within 5 days of coculture and reached a maximum by 14 days. We also observed transient increases in transcription of ammonium and nitrate transporters in a <i>N</i>. <i>punctiforme</i>-dependent manner as well as that of a SWEET transporter that was initially independent of N<sub>2</sub>-derived NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The temporal patterns of differential gene expression indicated that <i>N</i>. <i>punctiforme</i> transmits signals that impact gene expression to <i>A</i>. <i>punctatus</i> both prior to and after its provision of fixed N. This study is the first illustrating the temporal patterns of gene expression during establishment of an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association in this monophyletic evolutionary lineage of land plants.
