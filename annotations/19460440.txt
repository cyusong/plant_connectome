['19460440', 'Developmentally regulated G-proteins (DRGs) are a highly conserved family of  GTP-binding proteins found in archaea, plants, fungi and animals, indicating  important roles in fundamental pathways. Their function is poorly understood, but  they have been implicated in cell division, proliferation, and growth, as well as  several medical conditions. Individual subfamilies within the G-protein  superfamily possess unique nucleotide binding and hydrolysis rates that are  intrinsic to their cellular function, and so characterization of these rates for  a particular G-protein may provide insight into its cellular activity. We have  produced recombinant active DRG protein using a bacterial expression system and  refolding, and performed biochemical characterization of their GTP binding and  hydrolysis. We show that recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana atDRG1 and atDRG2a are  able to bind GDP and GTP. We also show that DRGs can hydrolyze GTP in vitro  without the assistance of GTPase-activating proteins and guanine exchange  factors. The atDRG proteins hydrolyze GTP at a relatively slow rate  (0.94x10(-3)min(-1) for DRG1 and 1.36x10(-3)min(-1) for DRG2) that is consistent  with their nearest characterized relatives, the Obg subfamily. The ability of  DRGs to bind nucleotide substrates without assistance, their slow rate of GTP  hydrolysis, heat stress activation and domain conservation suggest a possible  role as a chaperone in ribosome assembly in response to stress as it has been  suggested for the Obg proteins, a different but related G-protein subfamily.', '2009 Oct', 'Protein Expr Purif', '10.1016/j.pep.2009.05.009', 'Botella']
