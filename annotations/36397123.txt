Rice is an important food crop in the world and the study of its growth and plasticity has a profound influence on sustainable development. Ethylene modulates multiple agronomic traits of rice as well as abiotic and biotic stresses during its lifecycle. It has diverse roles, depending on the organs, developmental stages and environmental conditions. Compared to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice ethylene signalling pathway has its own unique features due to its special semiaquatic living environment and distinct plant structure. Ethylene signalling and responses are part of an intricate network in crosstalk with internal and external factors. This review will summarize the current progress in the mechanisms of ethylene-regulated coleoptile growth in rice, with a special focus on ethylene signaling and interaction with other hormones. Insights into these molecular mechanisms may shed light on ethylene biology and should be beneficial for the genetic improvement of rice and other crops.
