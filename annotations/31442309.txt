Strigolactones are an important class of plant signalling molecule with both external rhizospheric and internal hormonal functions in flowering plants. The past decade has seen staggering progress in strigolactone biology, permitting highly detailed understanding of their signalling, synthesis and biological roles - or so it seems. However, phylogenetic analyses show that strigolactone signalling mediated by the D14-SCF<sup>MAX</sup><sup>2</sup> -SMXL7 complex is only one of a number of closely related signalling pathways, and is much less ubiquitous in land plants than might be expected. The existence of closely related pathways, such as the KAI2-SMAX1 module, challenges many of our assumptions about strigolactones, and in particular emphasises how little we understand about the specificity of strigolactone signalling with respect to related signalling pathways. In this review, we examine recent advances in strigolactone signalling, taking a holistic evolutionary view to identify the ambiguities and uncertainties in our understanding. We highlight that while we now have highly detailed molecular models for the core mechanism of D14-SMXL7 signalling, we still do not understand the ligand specificity of D14, the specificity of its interaction with SMXL7, nor the specificity of SMXL7 function. Our analysis therefore identifies key areas requiring further study.
