['20398216', "Based on studies in yeast and mammalian cells the Elongator complex has been  implicated in functions as diverse as histone acetylation, polarized protein  trafficking and tRNA modification. Here we show that Arabidopsis mutants lacking  the Elongator subunit AtELP3/ELO3 have a defect in tRNA wobble uridine  modification. Moreover, we demonstrate that yeast elp3 and elp1 mutants  expressing the respective Arabidopsis Elongator homologues AtELP3/ELO3 and  AtELP1/ELO2 assemble integer Elongator complexes indicating a high degree of  structural conservation. Surprisingly, in vivo complementation studies based on  Elongator-dependent tRNA nonsense suppression and zymocin tRNase toxin assays  indicated that while AtELP1 rescued defects of a yeast elp1 mutant, the most  conserved Elongator gene AtELP3, failed to complement an elp3 mutant. This lack  of complementation is due to incompatibility with yeast ELP1 as coexpression of  both plant genes in an elp1 elp3 yeast mutant restored Elongator's tRNA  modification function in vivo. Similarly, AtELP1, not ScELP1 also supported  partial complementation by yeast-plant Elp3 hybrids suggesting that AtElp1 has  less stringent sequence requirements for Elp3 than ScElp1. We conclude that yeast  and plant Elongator share tRNA modification roles and propose that this function  might be conserved in Elongator from all eukaryotic kingdoms of life.", '2010 Jun 1', 'Mol Microbiol', '10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07163.x', 'Breunig']
