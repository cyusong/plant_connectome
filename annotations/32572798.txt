Increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has a significant effect on plant growth and development. To explore the elevated-CO<sub>2</sub> response, we generated transcriptional profiles over a time course (2 h-14 days) of exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genes related to photosynthesis were down-regulated and circadian rhythm-related genes were abnormally regulated in the early to middle phase of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> exposure. To understand the novel mechanism of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> signaling, we focused on 42 unknown small coding genes that showed differential expression patterns under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Four transgenic plants overexpressing the small coding gene exhibited a growth-defective phenotype under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> but not under current CO<sub>2</sub>. Transcriptome analysis showed that circadian rhythm-related genes were commonly regulated in four transgenic plants. These circadian rhythm-related genes were transcribed in the dark when CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the leaf was high. Taken together, our identified four small coding genes are likely to participate in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> signaling to the circadian rhythm.
