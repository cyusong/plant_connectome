['27255930', 'We initially observed that Brassica rapa cultivars containing the Turnip mosaic  virus (TuMV) resistance gene, Rnt1-1, accumulated a high level of endogenous  ascorbic acid (AS) and dehydroascobic acid (DHA) when infected with TuMV. We here  hypothesized a possible contribution of an elevated level of AS+DHA (TAA) to the  Rnt1-1-mediated resistance, and conducted a series of experiments using B. rapa  and Arabidopsis plants. The application of l-galactose (the key substrate in AS  synthesis) to a susceptible cultivar could increase the TAA level ~2-fold, and  simultaneously lead to some degree of enhanced viral resistance. To confirm some  positive correlation between TAA levels and viral resistance, we analyzed two  Arabidopsis knockout mutants (ao and vtc1) in the AS pathways; the TAA levels  were significantly increased and decreased in ao and vtc1 plants, respectively.  While the ao plants showed enhanced resistance to TuMV, vtc1 plants were more  susceptible than the control, supporting our hypothesis. When we analyzed the  expression profiles of the genes involved in the AS pathways upon TuMV infection,  we found that the observed TAA increase was mainly brought about by the reduction  of AS oxidation and activation of AS recycling. We then investigated the  secondary signals that regulate endogenous TAA levels in response to viral  infection, and found that jasmonic acid (JA) might play an important role in TAA  accumulation. In conclusion, we reason that the elevated TAA accumulation in B.  rapa plants would be at least partly mediated by the JA-dependent signaling  pathway and may significantly contribute to viral resistance.', '2016 Jul', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erw223', 'Inukai']
