Although most cultivated soils have high levels of total phosphorus (P), the levels of bioavailable inorganic P (Pi) are insufficient. The application of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is an eco-friendly strategy for P utilization; however, PGPR-mediated plant responses that enhance Pi acquisition remain unexplored. Here, we investigated the effect of Azospirillum brasilense on Arabidopsis adaptation to Pi deficiency. Results showed that A. brasilense inoculation alleviated Pi-deficiency-induced growth inhibition and anthocyanin accumulation and increased the total P content in Arabidopsis plants. A comprehensive analysis of root morphology revealed that A. brasilense increased root hair density and length under Pi-limited conditions. We further demonstrated that A. brasilense enhanced the acid phosphatase activity and upregulated the expression of several Pi transporter genes, such as PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1), PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 1:(PHT1:1) and PHT1;4. However, A. brasilense did not enhance the growth o total P content in pht1;1, pht1;4 and pht1;1pht1;4 mutants. Moreover, A. brasilense could not increase the P content and PHT1;1 expression in the root hairless mutant rsl4rsl2, because of the occurrence of low-Pi-induced PHT1;1 and PHT1;4 in root hairs. These results indicate that A. brasilense can promote root hair development and enhance acid phosphatase activity and Pi transporter expression levels, consequently improving the Pi absorption capacity and conferring plant tolerance to Pi deficiency.
