['21934146', 'Plasmodesmata (PD) are thought to play a fundamental role in almost every aspect  of plant life, including normal growth, physiology, and developmental responses.  However, how specific signaling pathways integrate PD-mediated cell-to-cell  communication is not well understood. Here, we present experimental evidence  showing that the Arabidopsis thaliana plasmodesmata-located protein 5 (PDLP5;  also known as HOPW1-1-INDUCED GENE1) mediates crosstalk between PD regulation and  salicylic acid-dependent defense responses. PDLP5 was found to localize at the  central region of PD channels and associate with PD pit fields, acting as an  inhibitor to PD trafficking, potentially through its capacity to modulate PD  callose deposition. As a regulator of PD, PDLP5 was also essential for conferring  enhanced innate immunity against bacterial pathogens in a salicylic  acid-dependent manner. Based on these findings, a model is proposed illustrating  that the regulation of PD closure mediated by PDLP5 constitutes a crucial part of  coordinated control of cell-to-cell communication and defense signaling.', '2011 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.087742', 'Lakshmanan']
