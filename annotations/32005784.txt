['32005784', 'Chloroplasts divide by binary fission, which is driven by a ring-like  multiprotein complex spanning the inner and outer envelope membranes (OEMs) at  the division site. The cytosolic DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 5B (DRP5B/ARC5) is a  mechanochemical GTPase involved in binary fission of the chloroplast membrane in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but the dynamics of its interactions with the  chloroplast membranes and their regulation by guanine nucleotides and protein  effectors remain poorly characterized. Using an Arabidopsis phot2 mutant with  defects in chloroplast photorelocation movement, we determined that the ring  structures of DRP5B at the chloroplast division site underwent subunit exchange  with a cytosolic DRP5B pool. Mutant DRP5B proteins with impaired GTPase activity  retained the ability to self-assemble at the constriction sites of chloroplasts,  but did not rescue the chloroplast division defects in the Arabidopsis drp5B  mutant. Our in vivo kinetic measurements of the DRP5B mutant T82D suggested that  turnover of the DRP5B ring at the chloroplast division site is coupled to GTP  hydrolysis. Furthermore, we established that DRP5B targeting to the chloroplast  surface and assembly into a ring structure at the division site are specifically  determined by the chloroplast outer OEM protein PLASTID DIVISION2 (PDV2), and  that DRP5B-OEM dissociation is mainly mediated by PDV1, a paralog of PDV2. Thus,  this study suggests that the mechanochemical properties of DRP5B on the  chloroplast surface are dynamically regulated by its GTPase activity and major  binding partners.', '2020 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.01490', 'ORCID:']
