Cultivated strawberry (Fragaria xananassa) is a valuable crop, yet the absence of a rapid, high-throughput transgenic system has precluded meaningful application of biotechnology and translation of information from plant models to this crop. A new octoploid strawberry genetic line Laboratory Festival #9 has been identified, selected solely for its rapid regeneration and efficient transformation. Direct organogenesis has been achieved from all tissues tested, with rapidly-growing shoot initials visible in as few as 13 days. The conditions for optimal shoot regeneration, transformant selection, root generation, and plant acclimatization are presented. The progression from explant to plant in soil can be achieved in about 60 days. The development of transformation protocols in this rapid-cycling genotype allows high-throughput studies of gene function in the octoploid strawberry genetic background.
