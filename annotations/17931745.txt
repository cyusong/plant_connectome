The secretion levels of momilactone A from rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings of eight cultivars into the rhizosphere were compared with the endogenous momilactone A concentrations in their shoots and roots. All rice cultivars contained momilactone A in the shoots and roots, and concentrations differed among the cultivars. Momilactone A was also found in all culture solutions in which the rice seedlings were grown, and the concentrations differed among the cultivars. The momilactone A concentrations in the culture solutions were reflected in the momilactone A concentrations in the shoots. These results suggest that all rice cultivars may produce momilactome A and secrete momilactone A into the culture solutions. The secretion levels of momilactone A may be more dependent on their capacities for momilactone A production in the shoots than on their capacities for momilactone A transportation from the shoots into the environment via the roots. As momilactone A acts as an antimicrobial and allelopathic agent, the secretion of momilactone A into the rice rhizosphere may provide a competitive advantage for root establishment through local suppression of soil microorganisms and inhibition of the growth of competing plant species.
