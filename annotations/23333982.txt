Drought is the major environmental stress that limits rice productivity worldwide. In vitro somaclonal variation using different selection agents has been used for crop improvement. Here, rice plants of cv PR113 were selected in vitro on 30, 50 and 70 g L(-1) polyethylene glycol 6,000 (PEG). Callus growth, proliferation, calli volume (first and second culture) and plantlet regeneration (third culture) were found to be decreased upto a certain level to acquire tolerance to PEG-induced drought. From the field data, 30 g L(-1) PEG lines showed higher vegetative growth (plant height, tiller number, leaf number, shoot weight and root growth) as compared with 50 g L(-1) PEG selected somaclone lines under limited irrigation. The yield parameters-panicle length, panicle weight, grains per panicle, 1,000-grain weight, grain yield per plant, harvest index and grain straw ratio were also higher in 30 g L(-1) PEG lines as compared with 50 g L(-1) PEG lines. The results, therefore indicate that 30 g L(-1) PEG selected somaclone lines were more suited than 50 g L(-1) PEG selected somaclone lines under stress as compared with WT. The finding suggests that rice cv PR113 somaclones generated on PEG are found to be drought tolerant under field condition with better yield.
