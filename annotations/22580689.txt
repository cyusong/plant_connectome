Various rhizobacteria are known for their beneficial effects on plants, i. e. promotion of growth and induction of systemic resistance against pathogens. These bacteria are categorized as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and are associated with plant roots. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of plant growth promotion in vivo is still very limited, but interference of bacteria with plant hormone metabolism is suggested to play a major role. To obtain new growth promoting bacteria, we started a quest for rhizobacteria that are naturally associated to Arabidopsis thaliana. A suite of native root-associated bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized roots of the Arabidopsis ecotype Gol-1 derived from a field site near Golm (Berlin area, Germany). We found several Pseudomonas and a Microbacterium species and tested these for growth promotion effects on the Arabidopsis ecotypes Gol-1 and Col-0, and for growth-promotion associated traits, such as auxin production, ACC deaminase activity and phosphate solubilization capacity. We showed that two of the bacteria strains promote plant growth with respect to rosette diameter, stalk length and accelerate development and that the effects were greater when bacteria were applied to Col-0 compared with Gol-1. Furthermore, the capability of promoting growth was not explained by the tested metabolic properties of the bacteria, suggesting that further bacterial traits are required. The natural variation of growth effects, combined with the extensive transgenic approaches available for the model plant Arabidopsis, will build a valuable tool to augment our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the natural Arabidopsis - PGPR association.
