One option to achieving greater resiliency for barley production in the face of climate change is to explore the potential of winter and facultative growth habits: for both types, low temperature tolerance (LTT) and vernalization sensitivity are key traits. Sensitivity to short-day photoperiod is a desirable attribute for facultative types. In order to broaden our understanding of the genetics of these phenotypes, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and identified candidate genes using a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) panel composed of 882 barley accessions that was genotyped with the Illumina 9K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Fifteen loci including 5 known and 10 novel QTL/genes were identified for LTT-assessed as winter survival in 10 field tests and mapped using a GWAS meta-analysis. <i>FR-H1</i>, <i>FR-H2</i>, and <i>FR-H3</i> were major drivers of LTT, and candidate genes were identified for <i>FR-H3</i>. The principal determinants of vernalization sensitivity were <i>VRN-H1</i>, <i>VRN-H2</i>, and <i>PPD-H1</i>. <i>VRN-H2</i> deletions conferred insensitive or intermediate sensitivity to vernalization. A subset of accessions with maximum LTT were identified as a resource for allele mining and further characterization. Facultative types comprised a small portion of the GWAS panel but may be useful for developing germplasm with this growth habit.
