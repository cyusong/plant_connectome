['18799661', 'Glucosinolates (GSLs) are amino acid-derived secondary metabolites with diverse  biological activities dependent on chemical modifications of the side chain. We  previously identified the flavin-monooxygenase FMO(GS-OX1) as an enzyme in the  biosynthesis of aliphatic GSLs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that  catalyzes the S-oxygenation of methylthioalkyl to methylsulfinylalkyl GSLs. Here,  we report the fine mapping of a quantitative trait locus for the S-oxygenating  activity in Arabidopsis. In this region, there are three FMOs that, together with  FMO(GS-OX1) and a fifth FMO, form what appears to be a crucifer-specific  subclade. We report the identification of these four uncharacterized FMOs,  designated FMO(GS-OX2) to FMO(GS-OX5). Biochemical characterization of the  recombinant protein combined with the analysis of GSL content in knockout mutants  and overexpression lines show that FMO(GS-OX2), FMO(GS-OX3), and FMO(GS-OX4) have  broad substrate specificity and catalyze the conversion from methylthioalkyl GSL  to the corresponding methylsulfinylalkyl GSL independent of chain length. In  contrast, FMO(GS-OX5) shows substrate specificity toward the long-chain  8-methylthiooctyl GSL. Identification of the FMO(GS-OX) subclade will generate  better understanding of the evolution of biosynthetic activities and  specificities in secondary metabolism and provides an important tool for breeding  plants with improved cancer prevention characteristics as provided by the  methylsulfinylalkyl GSL.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.125757', 'Halkier']
