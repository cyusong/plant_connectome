The staghorn fern (<i>Platycerium bifurcatum</i>, Polypodiaceae) is an epiphyte from Australasia that displays many life history characteristics commonly associated with eusocial animals. Here, I hypothesize about the selective advantage of living in cooperative groups by comparing the morphological characteristics of colonies to their solitary congeners.
