<i>Prunus mume</i> is one of the most important woody perennials for edible and ornamental use. Despite a substantial variation in the flowering phenology among the <i>P. mume</i> germplasm resources, the genetic control for flowering time remains to be elucidated. In this study, we examined five blooming time-related traits of 235 <i>P. mume</i> landraces for 2 years. Based on the phenotypic data, we performed genome-wide association studies, which included a combination of marker- and gene-based association tests, and identified 1,445 candidate genes that are consistently linked with flowering time across multiple years. Furthermore, we assessed the global transcriptome change of floral buds from the two <i>P. mume</i> cultivars exhibiting contrasting bloom dates and detected 617 associated genes that were differentially expressed during the flowering process. By integrating a co-expression network analysis, we screened out 191 gene candidates of conserved transcriptional pattern during blooming across cultivars. Finally, we validated the temporal expression profiles of these candidates and highlighted their putative roles in regulating floral bud break and blooming time in <i>P. mume</i>. Our findings are important to expand the understanding of flowering time control in woody perennials and will boost the molecular breeding of novel varieties in <i>P. mume</i>.
