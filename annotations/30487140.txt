['30487140', 'The evolutionarily conserved YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 proteins are involved in the  insertion of membrane proteins in all domains of life. In plant mitochondria,  individual knockouts of OXA1a, OXA2a, and OXA2b are embryo-lethal. In contrast to  other members of the protein family, OXA2a and OXA2b contain a tetratricopeptide  repeat (TPR) domain at the C-terminus. Here, the role of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) OXA2b was determined by using viable mutant plants that were generated  by complementing homozygous lethal OXA2b T-DNA insertional mutants with a  C-terminally truncated OXA2b lacking the TPR domain. The  truncated-OXA2b-complemented plants displayed severe growth retardation due to a  strong reduction in the steady-state abundance and enzyme activity of the  mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. The TPR domain of OXA2b directly  interacts with cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2, aiding in efficient membrane  insertion and translocation of its C-terminus. Thus, OXA2b is crucial for the  biogenesis of complex IV in plant mitochondria.', '2019 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.01286', 'ORCID:']
