Root hydraulic conductance is primarily determined by the conductance of living tissues to radial water flow. Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) in root cortical cells are important for plants to take up water and are believed to be directly involved in cell growth. In this study, we found that constitutive overexpression of the poplar root-specific gene PtoPIP1;1 in Arabidopsis accelerated bolting and flowering. At the early stage of the developmental process, PtoPIP1;1 OE Arabidopsis exhibited faster cell growth in both leaves and roots. The turgor pressure of plants was correspondingly increased in PtoPIP1;1 OE Arabidopsis, and the water status was changed. At the same time, the expression levels of flowering-related genes (CRY1, CRY2 and FCA) and hub genes in the regulatory networks underlying floral timing (FT and SOC1) were significantly upregulated in OE plants, while the floral repressor FLC gene was significantly downregulated. Taken together, the results of our study indicate that constitutive overexpression of PtoPIP1;1 in Arabidopsis accelerates bolting and flowering through faster cell growth in both the leaf and root at an early stage of the developmental process. The autonomous pathway of flowering regulation may be executed by monitoring developmental age. The increase in turgor and changes in water status with PtoPIP1;1 overexpression play a role in promoting cell growth.
