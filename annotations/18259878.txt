['18259878', 'Plants have developed sophisticated gravity sensing mechanisms to interpret  environmental signals that are vital for optimum plant growth. Loss of SHOOT  GRAVITROPISM 5 (SGR5) gene function has been shown to affect the gravitropic  response of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems. SGR5 is a member of the  INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) zinc finger protein family of putative transcription  factors. As part of an ongoing functional analysis of Arabidopsis IDD genes  (AtIDD) we have extended the characterisation of SGR5, and show that gravity  sensing amyloplasts in the shoot endodermis of sgr5 mutants sediment more slowly  than wild type, suggesting a defect in gravity perception. This is correlated  with lower amyloplast starch levels, which may account for the reduced  gravitropic sensitivity in sgr5. Further, we find that sgr5 mutants have a  severely attenuated stem circumnutation movement typified by a reduced amplitude  and an decreased periodicity. adg1-1 and sex1-1 mutants, which contain no starch  or increased starch, respectively, also show alterations in the amplitude and  period of circumnutation. Together these results suggest that plant growth  movement may depend on starch levels and/or gravity sensing. Overall, we propose  that loss of SGR5 regulatory activity affects starch accumulation in Arabidopsis  shoot tissues and causes decreased sensitivity to gravity and diminished  circumnutational movements.', '2008 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9301-0', 'Colasanti']
