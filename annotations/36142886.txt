Soybean is one of the most important food crops in the world. However, with the environmental change in recent years, many environmental factors like drought, salinity, heavy metal, and disease seriously affected the growth and development of soybean, causing substantial economic losses. In this study, we screened a bZIP transcription factor gene, <i>GmbZIP152</i>, which is significantly induced by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> (<i>S. sclerotiorum</i>), phytohormones, salt-, drought-, and heavy metal stresses in soybean. We found that overexpression of <i>GmbZIP152</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<i>OE-GmbZIP152</i>) enhances the resistance to <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> and the tolerance of salt, drought, and heavy metal stresses compared to wild-type (WT). The antioxidant enzyme related genes (including <i>AtCAT1</i>, <i>AtSOD,</i> and <i>AtPOD1</i>) and their enzyme activities are induced by <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>, salt, drought, and heavy metal stress in <i>OE-GmbZIP152</i> compared to WT. Furthermore, we also found that the expression level of biotic- and abiotic-related marker genes (<i>AtLOX6</i>, <i>AtACS6</i>, <i>AtERF1</i>, and <i>AtABI2,</i> etc.) were increased in <i>OE-GmbZIP152</i> compared to WT under <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> and abiotic stresses. Moreover, we performed a Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and found that GmbZIP152 could directly bind to promoters of ABA-, JA-, ETH-, and SA-induced biotic- and abiotic-related genes in soybean. Altogether, <i>GmbZIP152</i> plays an essential role in soybean response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
