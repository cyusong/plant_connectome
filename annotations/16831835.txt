['16831835', 'In flowering plants, male fertility depends on proper cell differentiation in the  anther. However, relatively little is known about the genes that regulate anther  cell differentiation and function. Here, we report the analysis of a new  Arabidopsis male sterile mutant, dysfunctional tapetum1 (dyt1). The dyt1 mutant  exhibits abnormal anther morphology beginning at anther stage 4, with tapetal  cells that have excess and/or enlarged vacuoles and lack the densely stained  cytoplasm typical of normal tapetal cells. The mutant meiocytes are able to  complete meiosis I, but they do not have a thick callose wall; they often fail to  complete meiotic cytokinesis and eventually collapse. DYT1 encodes a putative  bHLH transcription factor and is strongly expressed in the tapetum from late  anther stage 5 to early stage 6, and at a lower level in meiocytes. In addition,  the level of DYT1 mRNA is reduced in the sporocyteless/nozzle (spl/nzz) and  excess microsporocytes1/extra sporogenous cell (ems1/exs) mutants; together with  the mutant phenotypes, this suggests that DYT1 acts downstream of SPL/NZZ and  EMS1/EXS. RT-PCR results showed that the expression levels of many  tapetum-preferential genes are reduced significantly in the dyt1 mutant,  indicating that DYT1 is important for the expression of tapetum genes. Our  results support the hypothesis that DYT1 is a crucial component of a genetic  network that controls anther development and function.', '2006 Aug', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02463', 'Ma']
