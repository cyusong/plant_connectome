['30753577', 'During plant vascular development, xylem tracheary elements (TEs) form  water-conducting, empty pipes by genetically regulated cell death. Cell death is  prevented from spreading to non-TEs by unidentified intercellular mechanisms,  downstream of METACASPASE9 (MC9)-mediated regulation of autophagy in TEs. Here,  we identified differentially abundant extracellular peptides in  vascular-differentiating wild-type and MC9-down-regulated Arabidopsis cell  suspensions. A peptide named Kratos rescued the abnormally high ectopic non-TE  death resulting from either MC9 knockout or TE-specific overexpression of the  ATG5 autophagy protein during experimentally induced vascular differentiation in  Arabidopsis cotyledons. Kratos also reduced cell death following mechanical  damage and extracellular ROS production in Arabidopsis leaves. Stress-induced but  not vascular non-TE cell death was enhanced by another identified peptide, named  Bia. Bia is therefore reminiscent of several known plant cell death-inducing  peptides acting as damage-associated molecular patterns. In contrast, Kratos  plays a novel extracellular cell survival role in the context of development and  during stress response.', '2019 Apr 12', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erz021', 'Tuominen']
