Cell division and cell fate decisions are highly regulated processes that need to be coordinated both spatially and temporally for correct plant growth and development. Gaining a deeper molecular and cellular understanding of these links is especially relevant for plant biology since, unlike in animals, formation of new organs is a process that takes place after embryogenesis and continues throughout the entire plant lifespan. The recent identification of a novel factor, GEM, has provided a molecular framework that coordinates cell division to cell fate in the Arabidopsis epidermis. GEM is an inhibitor of cell division through interacting with CDT1, a DNA replication protein. It also inhibits the expression of the homeobox GLABRA2 (GL2) gene that determines the hair/non-hair fate and the pavement/trichome fate in the root and leaf epidermis, respectively. GEM seems to be crucial in controlling the balance of activating/repressing histone modifications at its target promoters.
