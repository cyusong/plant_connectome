<i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> symbiovar <i>trifolii</i> strains TA1 and CC275e are nitrogen-fixing microsymbionts of <i>Trifolium</i> spp. and have been used as commercial inoculant strains for clovers in pastoral agriculture in Australia and New Zealand. Here we present the complete genome sequences of both strains, resolving their multipartite genome structures and allowing for future studies using genomic approaches.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
