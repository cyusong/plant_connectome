Plant-nematode interactions are mainly considered from the negative aspect with a focus on plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs), which is justified considering the agronomic losses caused by PPNs. Despite the fact that PPNs are outnumbered by nonparasitic free-living nematodes (FLNs), the functional importance of FLNs, especially with regard to plant performance, remains largely unknown. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview and most recent insights into soil nematodes by showing direct and indirect links of both PPNs and FLNs with plant performance. We especially emphasize the knowledge gaps and potential of FLNs as important indirect players in driving plant performance such as stimulating the resistance to pests via improving the disease suppressive activity of the rhizobiome. Together, we present a holistic view of soil nematodes as positive and negative contributors to plant performance, accentuating the positive but underexplored role of FLNs.
