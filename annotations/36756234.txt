Mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i>) fruit is known for its taste, health benefits, and drought tolerance. Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is one of the most abundant ions in a plant cell. It is important for various biological functions related to plant growth, development, and flowering/fruiting. It significantly contributes to fruit yield, quality, and drought tolerance in plants. However, molecular mechanisms comprising K<sup>+</sup> transport in mango are least known. In the present study, 37 members of K<sup>+</sup> transport-related genes (PTGs) were identified in mango, which include 22 K<sup>+</sup> transporters (16 HAKs, 1 HKT, and 6 KEAs) and 15 K<sup>+</sup> channels (6 TPKs and 8 Shakers). All PTGs were predicted to be expressed at the plasma membrane and possess characteristic motifs and domains. Phylogenetic analysis identified a strong kinship of PTGs among <i>Oryza sativa</i>, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Cicer arietinum</i>, <i>Malus domestica</i>, and <i>M. indica</i>. The promoter analysis identified 60 types of <i>cis</i>-elements related to various biological processes. RNA-seq-based expression profiling identified that <i>MiTPK1.2</i>, <i>MiHAK1</i>, <i>MiHAK2.1</i>, <i>HAK6.1</i>, and <i>MiAKT1.1</i> were most upregulated in roots and that <i>MiKEA2</i>, <i>MiAKT2</i>, and <i>MiAKT1</i> were upregulated in leaves. Moreover, <i>MiAKT6</i>, <i>MiHAK1.1</i>, <i>MiKAT2</i>, <i>MiKAT2.1</i>, <i>MiHKT1</i>, <i>MiTPK1.1</i>, <i>MiHAK7</i>, and <i>MiHAK12</i> were highly expressed during the five growth stages of mango fruit. The current study is the first comprehensive report on K<sup>+</sup> transport system in tropical fruits. Therefore, it will provide the foundation knowledge for the functional characterization of K<sup>+</sup> genes in mango and related plants.
