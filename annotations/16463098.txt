The chenopodiaceae Suaeda salsa L. is a leaf succulent euhalophyte. Shoots of the S. salsa are larger and more succulent when grown in highly saline environments. This increased growth and water uptake has been correlated with a large and specific cellular accumulation of sodium. S. salsa does not have salt glands or salt bladders on its leaves. Thus, this plant must compartmentalize the toxic Na(+) in the vacuoles. The ability to compartmentalize sodium may result from a stimulation of the proton pumps that provide the driving force for increased sodium transport into the vacuole. In this work, we isolated the cDNA of the vacuolar membrane proton-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H(+) -PPase) from S. salsa. The SsVP cDNA contains an uninterrupted open reading frame of 2292 bp, coding for a polypeptide of 764 amino acids. Northern blotting analysis showed that SsVP was induced in salinity treated leaves. The activities of both the V-ATPase and the V-PPase in Arabidopsis overexpressing SsVP-2 is higher markedly than in wild-type plant under 200 mM NaCl and drought stresses. The Overexpression of SsVP can increase salt and drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis.
