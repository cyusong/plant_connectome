Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to environmental stimuli that influence their growth and yield is a prerequisite for understanding the adaptation of plants to climate change. Plants are sessile organisms and one important factor for their successful acclimation is the temporal coordination of the 24 h daily cycles and the stress response. The crosstalk between second messengers, such as Ca2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and hormones is a fundamental aspect in plant adaptation and survival under environmental stresses. In this sense, the circadian clock, in conjunction with Ca2+- and hormone-signalling pathways, appears to act as an important mechanism controlling plant adaptation to stress. The relationship between the circadian clock and ROS-generating and ROS-scavenging mechanisms is still not fully understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level and in stress situations in which ROS levels increase and changes in cell redox state occur. In this review, we summarize the information regarding the relationship between the circadian clock and the ROS homeostasis network. We pay special attention not only to the transcriptional regulation of ROS-generating and ROS-scavenging enzymes, but also to the few studies that have been performed at the biochemical level and those conducted under stress conditions.

Circadian clock: !regulates! ROS homeostasis
Ca2+: !crosstalks with! hormones
ROS: !influences! plant adaptation
Circadian clock: !coordinates! 24 h daily cycles
ROS: !generates! ROS-scavenging enzymes
ROS: !increases! under stress
