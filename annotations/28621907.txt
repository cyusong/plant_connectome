CPSF100 is a core component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex for 3'-end formation of mRNA, but it still has no clear functional assignment. CPSF100 was reported to play a role in RNA silencing and promote flowering in Arabidopsis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood. Our genetics analyses indicate that plants with a hypomorphic mutant of CPSF100 (esp5) show defects in embryogenesis, reduced seed production or altered root morphology. To unravel this puzzle, we employed a poly(A) tag sequencing protocol and uncovered a different poly(A) profile in esp5. This transcriptome-wide analysis revealed alternative polyadenylation of thousands of genes, most of which result in transcriptional read-through in protein-coding genes. AtCPSF100 also affects poly(A) signal recognition on the far-upstream elements; in particular it prefers less U-rich sequences. Importantly, AtCPSF100 was found to exert its functions through the change of poly(A) sites on genes encoding binding proteins, such as nucleotide-binding, RNA-binding and poly(U)-binding proteins. In addition, through its interaction with RNA Polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and affecting the expression level of CTD phosphatase-like 3 (CPL3), AtCPSF100 is shown to potentially ensure transcriptional termination by dephosphorylation of Ser2 on the CTD. These data suggest a key role for CPSF100 in locating poly(A) sites and affecting transcription termination.
