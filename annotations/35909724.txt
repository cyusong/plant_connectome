Identifying the genetic variation characteristics of phenotypic traits is important for fruit tree breeding. During the long-term evolution of fruit trees, gene recombination and natural mutation have resulted in a high degree of heterozygosity. Apple (<i>Malus</i> × <i>domestica</i> Borkh.) shows strong ecological adaptability and is widely cultivated, and is among the most economically important fruit crops worldwide. However, the high level of heterozygosity and large genome of apple, in combination with its perennial life history and long juvenile phase, complicate investigation of the genetic basis of fruit quality traits. With continuing augmentation in the apple genomic resources available, in recent years important progress has been achieved in research on the genetic variation of fruit quality traits. This review focuses on summarizing recent genetic studies on apple fruit quality traits, including appearance, flavor, nutritional, ripening, and storage qualities. In addition, we discuss the mapping of quantitative trait loci, screening of molecular markers, and mining of major genes associated with fruit quality traits. The overall aim of this review is to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of genetic variation and molecular breeding of important fruit quality traits in apple.
