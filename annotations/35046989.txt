Fiber quality and yield-related traits are important agronomic traits in cotton breeding. To detect the genetic basis of fiber quality and yield related traits, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population consisting of 182 lines was established from a cross between <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> cultivar CCRI35 and <i>G. hirsutum</i> race <i>palmeri</i> accession TX-832. The RIL population was deeply genotyped using SLAF-seq and was phenotyped in six environments. A high-density genetic linkage map with 15,765 SNP markers and 153 SSR markers was constructed, with an average distance of 0.30 cM between adjacent markers. A total of 210 fiber quality quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 73 yield-related QTLs were identified. Of the detected QTLs, 62 fiber quality QTLs and 10 yield-related QTLs were stable across multiple environments. Twelve and twenty QTL clusters were detected on the At and Dt subgenome, respectively. Twenty-three major QTL clusters were further validated through associated analysis and five candidate genes of four stable fiber quality QTLs were identified. This study revealed elite loci influencing fiber quality and yield and significant phenotypic selection regions during <i>G. hirsutum</i> domestication, and set a stage for future utilization of molecular marker assisted breeding in cotton breeding programs.
