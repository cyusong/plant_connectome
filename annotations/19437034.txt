We investigated the effects of prolonged hypoxia on the sugar uptake in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. var. MP-1) roots. Hydroponic cultures of whole tomato plants were submitted to hypoxic treatment for 1 week, and the roots were analyzed for sugar concentrations, hexose uptake and hexose transporter expression level. Contrary to what has been observed after anoxic shock or short-term hypoxic treatment, we show that sugar concentrations increase and hexose uptake is up-regulated in the roots after 1 week of hypoxic treatment. Increased hexose transport is concomitant with the induction of the hexose transporter gene LeHT2. These responses may be due either to a direct effect of low O(2) supply, or to a secondary effect associated with the increase in sugar concentrations, which, typically, develops in most hypoxic plants.

LeHT2: !induces! Hexose transport 
Hypoxia: !increases! Sugar concentrations 
Hypoxia: !up-regulates! Hexose uptake 
Sugar concentrations: !develops in! Most hypoxic plants
