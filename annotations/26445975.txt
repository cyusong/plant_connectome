Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is one of the most effective inducers of taxol biosynthetic genes, particularly the tasy gene. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of tasy by MeJA is still unknown. In this study, a 550-bp 5'-flanking sequence was obtained and confirmed as the promoter of the tasy gene. Deletion analysis revealed that the fragment containing a GCC-box from -150 to -131 was the crucial jasmonate (JA)-responsive element, designated as JRE. Using JRE as bait, two binding proteins, namely TcERF12 and TcERF15, were discovered. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that TcERF12 was related to the repressor AtERF3, while TcERF15 was more related to the activator ORA59; these are typical GCC-box-binding ethylene-responsive factors. Both could significantly respond to MeJA for 10 and 4.5 times, respectively, in 0.5 h. When the two TcERFs were overexpressed in Taxus cells, tasy gene expression decreased by 2.1 times in TcERF12-overexpressing cells, but increased by 2.5 times in TcERF15-overexpressing cells. Results indicated that TcERF12 and TcERF15 were negative and positive regulators, respectively, in the JA signal transduction to the tasy gene by binding the GCC-box in the JRE of the tasy promoter. Our results promote further research on regulatory mechanisms of taxol biosynthesis.
