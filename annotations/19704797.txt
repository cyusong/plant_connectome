['19704797', 'Homeodomain proteins set up domains of gene expression during the development of  animal and plant body plans. In plants, homeodomain proteins of the KNOX class I  family have been shown to play a role in shoot apical meristem development.  Recently, we have investigated the role of the Arabidopsis thaliana KNOX class II  genes KNAT3, KNAT4 and KNAT5 in root development. These genes showed root domain  and cell type specific expression patterns, and their expression was regulated by  hormones that influence root growth. Moreover, sub-cellular localization of the  KNAT proteins exhibited regulation, suggesting that post-transcriptional control  contributes to KNOX class II protein activity. Our data provide a survey of KNAT  gene expression in the root and indicate that the investigated KNAT genes might  play distinct roles during root development.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.2.1.3604', 'Haseloff']
