Plant carbon balance depends upon the difference between photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss. In C<sub>3</sub> plants, growth at an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) stimulates photosynthesis and raises the leaf carbohydrate status, but how respiration responds is less understood. In this study, growth of <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> at ECO<sub>2</sub> increased the protein amount of the non-energy conserving mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX). Growth at ECO<sub>2</sub> increased <i>AOX1a</i> transcript amount, and the transcript amount of a putative sugar-responsive gene encoding a chloroplast glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT3). We suggest that the elevated amounts of AOX and GPT3 represent distinctive mitochondrial and chloroplast mechanisms to manage an excessive cytosolic pool of sugar phosphates. AOX respiration could consume cytosolic sugar phosphates, without this activity being restricted by rates of ATP turnover. GPT3 could allow accumulating cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate to return to the chloroplast. This could feed starch synthesis or a glucose-6-phosphate shunt in the Calvin cycle. AOX and GPT3 activities could buffer against P<sub>i</sub> depletions that might otherwise disrupt mitochondrial and chloroplast electron transport chain activities. AOX and GPT3 activities could also buffer against a down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity by preventing a persistent imbalance between photosynthetic carbon gain and the activity of carbon utilizing sinks.

AOX: !consumes! Cytosolic sugar phosphates
GPT3: !translocates! Glucose-6-phosphate
AOX: !buffers against! P<sub>i</sub> depletions
GPT3: !buffers against! Down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity
