['26257748', 'Organisms adopt a wide range of strategies to adapt to change. Gene silencing  describes the ability of organisms to modulate the expression of susceptible  genes at certain times at the transcriptional or the translational level. In all  known eukaryotic organisms 21-nt long short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the  effector molecules of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), while 24-nt  long siRNAs are involved in PTGS in plants. Mutant studies in Caenorhabditis  elegans lead to the identification of the enzyme ERI (Enhancer of  RNAinterference) with enhanced PTGS. Although the genes involved in growth vigor  and growth rate are still unknown, it becomes clearer that the population of  small RNAs plays a role in the very early phase of plant development. To pinpoint  the link between growth and siRNAs, the expression of Arabidopsis uni-gene  Enhancer of RNAi (ERI) homolog from C. elegans was modulated. Increased  degradation of small RNAs was achieved by ectopic AtERI overexpression in planta.  Based on global small RNA analysis, AtERI overexpression affects mainly the  population of 21 mers, excluding miRNAs. To identify target genes, AtERI  gain-of-function mutants were analyzed, and differentially abundant small RNAs  were identified. Plants with an elevated level of AtERI were bigger in all three  light intensities analyzed, indicating an inhibitory function of particular small  RNAs in plant growth, with differences in relative growth rates depending on  developmental stage and light intensity. Understanding the role of these siRNAs  could open new avenues for enhancing plant growth.', '2015', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2015.00531', 'Kuhlmann']
