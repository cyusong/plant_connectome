['23952652', 'Like their animal counterparts, plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) homologs are  intimately associated with Ca(2+) influx through plasma membrane and participate  in various physiological processes. In pathogen-associated molecular patterns  (PAMP)-/elicitor-mediated resistance, Ca(2+) fluxes are necessary for activating  downstream signaling events related to plant defense. In this study,  oligogalacturonides (OGs), which are endogenous elicitors derived from cell wall  degradation, were used to investigate the role of Arabidopsis GLRs in defense  signaling. Pharmacological investigations indicated that GLRs are partly involved  in free cytosolic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)]cyt) variations, nitric oxide (NO)  production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and expression of  defense-related genes by OGs. In addition, wild-type Col-0 plants treated with  the glutamate-receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitriquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) had a  compromised resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis.  Moreover, we provide genetic evidence that AtGLR3.3 is a key component of  resistance against H. arabidopsidis. In addition, some OGs-triggered immune  events such as defense gene expression, NO and ROS production are also to  different extents dependent on AtGLR3.3. Taken together, these data provide  evidence for the involvement of GLRs in elicitor/pathogen-mediated plant defense  signaling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2013 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12311', 'Garcia-Brugger']
