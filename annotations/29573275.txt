Root-knot nematodes (RKNs; Meloidogyne spp.) are a major pest for the agriculture worldwide. RKNs induce specialized feeding cells (giant cells, GCs) inside galls which are de novo formed pseudo-organs in the roots that share similarities with other developmental processes as lateral root (LR) and callus formation or grafting involving new vascular development or pericycle proliferation. Hence, it is pertinent to study the molecular mechanisms directing the plant-nematode interaction. In this respect, ALF4 is a key gene during LR formation, vascular vessels reconnection in grafting, hormone-induced callus formation or de novo root organogenesis from leaf explants. Our results show that ALF4 is also induced in galls at early infection stages in an auxin-independent way. Furthermore, ALF4 activity is necessary for the formation of proper galls and GCs, as the mutant alf4-1 presents aberrant galls and GCs with severe structural abnormalities leading to a dramatic reduction in the nematode egg production. However, a low-reproduction rate is maintained, that might be explained by the local auxin maximum build by the nematodes in galls, partially rescuing alf4-1 phenotype. This would be similar to the partial rescue described for LR formation with exogenous auxins and also agrees with the LR emergence from alf4-1 galls but not from uninfected roots. In addition, ALF4 is also induced in syncytia formed by cyst nematodes. All these data support a pivotal role for ALF4 during de novo organogenesis processes induced by endoparasitic nematodes, in addition to its role in LR formation, callus development or vessel reconnection during grafting.
