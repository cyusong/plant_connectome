Leaf expansion and xylem cytokinin concentration ([X-CK]) decrease in response to nitrogen (N) deprivation. Debate continues over cause, effect, and correlation. Supporting studies provide, at best, correlative evidence that [X-CK] controls leaf growth in response to N-deprivation, while dissenting studies indicate that leaf growth responses to N can be independent of changes in X-CK supply to leaves. A model is proposed to evaluate the physiological significance to leaf growth of changes in plant and environment N concentrations, and plant CK concentrations.

N: !affects! Leaf expansion 
X-CK: !controls! Leaf growth 
N: !correlates with! X-CK 
Leaf growth: !can be independent of! X-CK supply
