['20451385', 'In animals, the interface between organism and environment is constituted by the  epithelium. In plants, the exchange of nutrients and signals between root and  soil is crucial for their survival, but the cellular mechanisms underlying the  epithelium-like function and specific localization of proteins to the root  surface have not been identified. Here we analyze the mechanism of polar delivery  to the root-soil interface of the proteins BOR4, ABCG37, and PEN3, which  transport nutrients, transport plant hormones, and are required for pathogen  defense, respectively. The simultaneous visualization of these proteins and the  apical and basal cargos in a single cell demonstrates that the outermost cell  side represents an additional polar domain. Delivery to this outer polar domain  depends on ARF GEF and actin function but does not require known molecular  components of the apical or basal targeting. The outer polar delivery is, in  contrast to known basal and apical cargos, mediated by the polar secretion. Our  findings show that the outermost cell membranes of roots define an additional  polar domain in plant cells along with a specific, previously uncharacterized,  polar targeting mechanism that is important for defining the functional,  epithelium-like root-soil interface.', '2010 May 25', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2010.03.059', 'Friml']
