CAPRICE (CPC) encodes a small protein with an R3 MYB motif and promotes root hair cell differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Three additional CPC-like MYB genes, TRY (TRIPTYCHON), ETC1 (ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC 1) and ETC2 (ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC 2) act in a redundant manner with CPC in trichome and root hair patterning. In this study, we identified an additional homolog, CPC-LIKE MYB 3 (CPL3), which has high sequence similarity to CPC, TRY, ETC1 and ETC2. Overexpression of CPL3 results in the suppression of trichomes and overproduction of root hairs, as has been observed for CPC, TRY, ETC1 and ETC2. Morphological studies with double, triple and quadruple homolog mutants indicate that the CPL3 gene cooperatively regulates epidermal cell differentiation with other CPC homologs. Promoter-GUS analyses indicate that CPL3 is specifically expressed in leaf epidermal cells, including stomate guard cells. Notably, the CPL3 gene has pleiotropic effects on flowering development, epidermal cell size and trichome branching through the regulation of endoreduplication.
