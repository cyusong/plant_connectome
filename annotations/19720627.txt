Four out of five members of the RBCS multigene family (OsRBCS2-OsRBCS5) were highly expressed in leaf blades of rice (Oryza sativa L.) irrespective of plant growth stage, whereas accumulation of all RBCS mRNAs in leaf sheaths, roots and developing spikelets was quite low. A highly positive correlation was observed between total RBCS and RBCL mRNA levels and Rubisco content at their maxima, irrespective of tissue and growth stage. The results indicate that the total RBCS mRNA level may be a primary determinant for maximal Rubisco protein content and that Rubisco gene expression is well coordinated through the whole life of rice.
