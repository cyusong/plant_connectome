MYB transcription factors, comprising one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, play many roles in secondary metabolism, especially in anthocyanin biosynthesis. However, the functions of the PdeMYB transcription factor in colored-leaf poplar remain elusive. In the present study, genome-wide characterization of the PdeMYB genes in colored-leaf poplar (Populus deltoids) was conducted. A total of 302 PdeMYB transcription factors were identified, including 183 R2R3-MYB, five R1R2R3-MYB, one 4R-MYB, and 113 1R-MYB transcription factor genes. Genomic localization and paralogs of PdeMYB genes mapped 289 genes on 19 chromosomes, with collinearity relationships among genes. The conserved domain, gene structure, and evolutionary relationships of the PdeMYB genes were also established and analyzed. The expression levels of PdeMYB genes were obtained from previous data in green leaf poplar (L2025) and colored leaf poplar (QHP) as well as our own qRT-PCR analysis data in green leaf poplar (L2025) and colored leaf poplar (CHP), which provide valuable clues for further functional characterization of PdeMYB genes. The above results provide not only comprehensive insights into the structure and functions of PdeMYB genes but also provide candidate genes for the future improvement of leaf colorization in Populus deltoids.
