Peach fruits subjected to prolonged cold storage (CS) to delay decay and over-ripening often develop a form of chilling injury (CI) called mealiness/woolliness (WLT), a flesh textural disorder characterized by lack of juiciness. Transcript profiles were analyzed after different lengths of CS and subsequent shelf life ripening (SLR) in pools of fruits from siblings of the Pop-DG population with contrasting sensitivity to develop WLT. This was followed by quantitative PCR on pools and individual lines of the Pop-DG population to validate and extend the microarray results. Relative tolerance to WLT development during SLR was related to the fruit's ability to recover from cold and the reactivation of normal ripening, processes that are probably regulated by transcription factors involved in stress protection, stress recovery and induction of ripening. Furthermore, our results showed that altered ripening in WLT fruits during shelf life is probably due, in part, to cold-induced desynchronization of the ripening program involving ethylene and auxin hormonal regulation of metabolism and cell wall. In addition, we found strong correlation between expression of RNA translation and protein assembly genes and the visual injury symptoms.
