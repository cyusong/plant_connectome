Land plants live in a crisis-filled environment and the fluctuation of sunlight intensity often causes damage to photosynthetic apparatus. Phyto-melatonin is an effective bioactive molecule that helps plants to resist various biotic and abiotic stresses. In order to explore the role of melatonin under high light stress, we investigated the effects of melatonin on anti-oxidative system and photosynthesis of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> under high light. Results showed that exogenous melatonin increased photosynthetic rate and protected photosynthetic proteins under high light. This was mainly owing to the fact that exogenous melatonin effectively decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and protected integrity of membrane and photosynthetic pigments, and reduced cell death. Taken together, our study promoted more comprehensive understanding in the protective effects of exogenous melatonin under high light.
