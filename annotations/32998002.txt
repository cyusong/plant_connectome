Mycoviruses are viruses that infect fungi, and hypovirulence-associated mycoviruses have the potential to control fungal diseases. However, it is unclear how mycovirus-mediated hypovirulent strains live and survive in the field, and no mycovirus has been applied for field crop protection. In this study, we found that a previously identified small DNA mycovirus (SsHADV-1) can convert its host, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, from a typical necrotrophic pathogen to a beneficial endophytic fungus. SsHADV-1 downregulates the expression of key pathogenicity factor genes in S. sclerotiorum during infection. When growing in rapeseed, the SsHADV-1-infected strain DT-8 significantly regulates the expression of rapeseed genes involved in defense, hormone signaling, and circadian rhythm pathways. As a result, plant growth is promoted and disease resistance is enhanced. Field experiments showed that spraying DT-8 at the early flowering stage can reduce the disease severity of rapeseed stem rot by 67.6% and improve yield by 14.9%. Moreover, we discovered that SsHADV-1 could also infect other S. sclerotiorum strains on DT-8-inoculated plants and that DT-8 could be recovered from dead plants. These findings suggest that the mycoviruses may have the ability to shape the origin of endophytism. Our discoveries suggest that mycoviruses may influence the origin of endophytism and may also offer a novel strategy for disease control in which mycovirus-infected strains are used to improve crop health and release mycoviruses into the field.
