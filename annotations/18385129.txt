['18385129', 'Plants produce p-aminobenzoate (pABA) in chloroplasts and use it for folate  synthesis in mitochondria. In plant tissues, however, pABA is known to occur  predominantly as its glucose ester (pABA-Glc), and the role of this metabolite in  folate synthesis has not been defined. In this study, the UDP-glucose:pABA  acyl-glucosyltransferase (pAGT) activity in Arabidopsis extracts was found to  reside principally (95%) in one isoform with an apparent K(m) for pABA of 0.12  mm. Screening of recombinant Arabidopsis UDP-glycosyltransferases identified only  three that recognized pABA. One of these (UGT75B1) exhibited a far higher  k(cat)/K(m) value than the others and a far lower apparent K(m) for pABA (0.12  mm), suggesting its identity with the principal enzyme in vivo. Supporting this  possibility, ablation of UGT75B1 reduced extractable pAGT activity by 95%, in  vivo [(14)C]pABA glucosylation by 77%, and the endogenous pABA-Glc/pABA ratio by  9-fold. The K(eq) for the pABA esterification reaction was found to be 3 x  10(-3). Taken with literature data on the cytosolic location of pAGT activity and  on cytosolic UDP-glucose/UDP ratios, this K(eq) value allowed estimation that  only 4% of cytosolic pABA is esterified. That pABA-Glc predominates in planta  therefore implies that it is sequestered away from the cytosol and, consistent  with this possibility, vacuoles isolated from [(14)C]pABA-fed pea leaves were  estimated to contain> or =88% of the [(14)C]pABA-Glc formed. In total, these data  and the fact that isolated mitochondria did not take up [(3)H]pABA-Glc, suggest  that the glucose ester represents a storage form of pABA that does not contribute  directly to folate synthesis.', '2008 May 30', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M709591200', 'Hanson']
