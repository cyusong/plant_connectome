Floral organ identity is defined by organ homoetic genes whose coordinated expression is crucial with respect to the time and place of floral organ formation. Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of the rice STAMENLESS 1 (SL1) gene that is involved in floral development. The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels. Additionally, sl1 produces flowers with varied numbers of inner floral organs, and amorphous tissues without floral organ identity were frequently formed in whorls 3 and 4. We also show that SL1 specifies lodicule and stamen identities through positive transcriptional regulation of SPW1/OsMADS16 expression. SL1 encodes a member of the C2H2 family of zinc finger proteins, closely related to JAG of Arabidopsis. The functional divergence between SL1 and JAG implies that SL1 was co-opted for its distinctive roles in specification of floral organ identity in rice after the lineage split from Arabidopsis.
