Concomitant increase of auxin-responsive factors <i>ARF16 and ARF17</i>, along with enhanced expression of <i>ARF10</i> in resistant <i>Sinapis alba</i> compared with that in susceptible <i>Brassica juncea</i> upon challenge with <i>Alternaria brassicicola</i>, revealed that abscisic acid (ABA)-auxin crosstalk is a critical factor for resistance response. Here, we induced the ABA response through conditional expression of <i>ARF10</i> in <i>B. juncea</i> using the <i>A. brassicicola</i>-inducible <i>GH3.3</i> promoter. Induced ABA sensitivity caused by conditional expression of ARF10 in transgenic <i>B. juncea</i> resulted in tolerance against <i>A. brassicicola</i> and led to enhanced expression of several ABA-responsive genes without affecting the auxin biosynthetic gene expression. Compared with <i>ABI3</i> and <i>ABI4</i>, <i>ABI5</i> showed maximum upregulation in the most tolerant transgenic lines upon pathogen challenge. Moreover, elevated expression of <i>ARF10</i> by different means revealed a direct correlation between ARF10 expression and the induction of ABI5 protein in <i>B. juncea</i>. Through in vitro DNA-protein experiments and chromosome immunoprecipitation using the ARF10 antibody, we demonstrated that ARF10 interacts with the auxin-responsive elements of the <i>ABI5</i> promoter. This suggests that ARF10 may function as a modulator of ABI5 to induce ABA sensitivity and mediate the resistance response against <i>A. brassicicola</i>.
