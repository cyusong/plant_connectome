Since 1999, various forward- and reverse-genetic approaches have uncovered nearly 200 genes required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in legumes. These discoveries advanced our understanding of the evolution of SNF in plants and its relationship to other beneficial endosymbioses, signaling between plants and microbes, the control of microbial infection of plant cells, the control of plant cell division leading to nodule development, autoregulation of nodulation, intracellular accommodation of bacteria, nodule oxygen homeostasis, the control of bacteroid differentiation, metabolism and transport supporting symbiosis, and the control of nodule senescence. This review catalogs and contextualizes all of the plant genes currently known to be required for SNF in two model legume species, <i>Medicago truncatula</i> and <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and two crop species, <i>Glycine max</i> (soybean) and <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> (common bean). We also briefly consider the future of SNF genetics in the era of pan-genomics and genome editing.
