Fruit phenotypic information reflects all the physical, physiological, biochemical characteristics and traits of fruit. Accurate access to phenotypic information is very necessary and meaningful for post-harvest storage, sales and deep processing. The methods of obtaining phenotypic information include traditional manual measurement and damage detection, which are inefficient and destructive. In the field of fruit phenotype research, image technology is increasingly mature, which greatly improves the efficiency of fruit phenotype information acquisition. This review paper mainly reviews the research on phenotypic information of Prunoideae fruit based on three imaging techniques (RGB imaging, hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging). Firstly, the classification was carried out according to the image type. On this basis, the review and summary of previous studies were completed from the perspectives of fruit maturity detection, fruit quality classification and fruit disease damage identification. Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various types of images in the study, and try to give the next research direction for improvement.

RGB imaging: !used for! Fruit maturity detection
Hyperspectral imaging: !used for! Fruit quality classification
Multispectral imaging: !used for! Fruit disease damage identification
