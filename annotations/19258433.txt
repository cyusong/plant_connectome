Choosing a favourite image is very difficult to do, not least because different images are important to us for different reasons. I have decided to focus here on an image that is not only intrinsically beautiful, but that also emphasizes the importance of looking and seeing properly when trying to understand the world around us. For me, this image, the adaxial surface of the petal of Veronica caucasia, exemplifies how looking at things in different ways can provide unexpected insights into the way nature works.
