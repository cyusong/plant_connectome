['11341960', 'The fatty acid elongase-1 beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, FAE1 KCS, a seed-specific  elongase condensing enzyme from Arabidopsis, is involved in the production of  eicosenoic (C20:1) and erucic (C22:1) acids. Alignment of the amino acid  sequences of FAE1 KCS, KCS1, and five other putative elongase condensing enzymes  (KCSs) revealed the presence of six conserved cysteine and four conserved  histidine residues. Each of the conserved cysteine and histidine residues was  individually converted by site-directed mutagenesis to both alanine and serine,  and alanine and lysine respectively. After expression in yeast cells, the mutant  enzymes were analyzed for their fatty acid elongase activity. Our results  indicated that only cysteine 223 is an essential residue for enzyme activity,  presumably for acyl chain transfer. All histidine substitutions resulted in  complete loss of elongase activity. The loss of activity of these mutants was not  due to their lower expression level since immunoblot analysis confirmed each was  expressed to the same extent as the wild type FAE1 KCS.', '2001 Jan 15', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/s1388-1981(00)00168-2', 'Jaworski']
