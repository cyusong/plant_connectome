['15546352', 'Root hairs are a major site for the uptake of water and nutrients into plants,  and they form an increasingly important model system for the study of development  in higher plants. We now report on the molecular genetic analysis of the srh1  mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana impaired in root hair tip growth. We show that  srh1 is a new allele of cow1 (can of worms1) and we identified the COW1 gene  using a positional cloning strategy. The N-terminus of the COW1 protein is 32%  identical to an essential phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP), the yeast  Sec14 protein (sec14p) while the C-terminus is 34.5% identical to a late nodulin  of Lotus japonicus, Nlj16. We show that expression of the COW1 lipid-binding  domain complements the growth defect associated with Sec14p dysfunction in yeast.  In addition, we show that GFP fused to the COW1 protein specifically accumulates  at the site of root hair outgrowth. We conclude that the COW1 protein is a PITP,  essential for proper root hair growth.', '2004 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02245.x', 'Nogue']
