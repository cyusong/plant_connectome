SKU5-Similar 6 (SKS6) is a one of a large gene family of 19 members in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh that encode multicopper oxidase-like proteins that are related to ferroxidases, ascorbate oxidases and laccases. Only one member of the family has been previously studied; Skewed5 (SKU5) is involved in the control of root growth. The encoded SKS6 protein, like SKU5 appears to lack a functional copper-binding site and is most closely related to Bp10 from Brassica napus and Ntp303 from Nicotiana tobacum. The SKS6 promoter contains many putative regulatory sites and differential expression of an SKS6::GUS reporter gene revealed selective induction in several seedling tissues including guard cells, root cortex cells, and leaf margin hydathodes. It was also expressed later in flower development in flower primordia, ovules, and the abscission zones of seeds and siliques. Furthermore, SKS6 was upregulated in roots in response to treatment of seedlings with the hormones abscisic acid, indole-3 acetic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate. A loss-of function sks6-1 T-DNA insertion allele revealed that cotyledon vascular patterning is affected in the mutant, suggesting a role for the protein in metabolism of nutrients or hormones in the hydathodes, the sites of auxin synthesis and chemical recycling.
