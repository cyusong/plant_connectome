['16500991', 'Plants and animals share similar mechanisms in the heat shock (HS) response, such  as synthesis of the conserved HS proteins (Hsps). However, because plants are  confined to a growing environment, in general they require unique features to  cope with heat stress. Here, we report on the analysis of the function of a novel  Hsp, heat-stress-associated 32-kD protein (Hsa32), which is highly conserved in  land plants but absent in most other organisms. The gene responds to HS at the  transcriptional level in moss (Physcomitrella patens), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana), and rice (Oryza sativa). Like other Hsps, Hsa32 protein accumulates  greatly in Arabidopsis seedlings after HS treatment. Disruption of Hsa32 by T-DNA  insertion does not affect growth and development under normal conditions.  However, the acquired thermotolerance in the knockout line was compromised  following a long recovery period (>24 h) after acclimation HS treatment, when a  severe HS challenge killed the mutant but not the wild-type plants, but no  significant difference was observed if they were challenged within a short  recovery period. Quantitative hypocotyl elongation assay also revealed that  thermotolerance decayed faster in the absence of Hsa32 after a long recovery.  Similar results were obtained in Arabidopsis transgenic plants with Hsa32  expression suppressed by RNA interference. Microarray analysis of the knockout  mutant indicates that only the expression of Hsa32 was significantly altered in  HS response. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsa32 is required not for  induction but rather maintenance of acquired thermotolerance, a feature that  could be important to plants.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.074898', 'Ko']
