Leaf gas exchange and temperature response were measured to assess temperature acclimation within a tree canopy in climatically contrasting genotypes of Acer rubrum L. Over the course of two 50 d continuous periods, growth temperature was controlled within tree crowns and the steady-state rate of leaf gas exchange was measured. Data were then modelled to calculate the influence of genotype variation and vertical distribution of physiological activity on carbon uptake. The maximal rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V(cmax)), the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)), leaf dark respiration rate (R(d)), maximum photosynthesis (A(max)), and the CO(2) compensation point (Gamma) increased with temperature during both (i) a constant long-term (50 d) daytime temperature or (ii) ambient daytime temperature with short-term temperature control (25-38 degrees C). In addition, within-crown variation in the temperature response of photosynthesis and R(d) was influenced by acclimation to local microclimate temperature gradients. Results indicated that carbon uptake estimates could be overestimated by 22-25% if the vertical distribution of temperature gradients is disregarded. Temperature is a major factor driving photosynthetic acclimation and within-crown gas exchange variation. Thus, this study established the importance of including spatial acclimation to temperature- and provenance-, ecotype-, and/or genotype-specific parameter sets into carbon uptake models.
