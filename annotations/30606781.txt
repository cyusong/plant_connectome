Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) is initiated upon PAMP recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRR). PTI signals are transmitted through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inducing signaling and defense processes such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and callose deposition. Here, we examine mutants for two <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> genes encoding homologs of UBIQUITIN-ASSOCIATED DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2 (UBAC2), a conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein implicated in ER protein quality control. The <i>ubac2</i> mutants were hypersusceptible to a type III secretion-deficient strain of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, indicating a PTI defect. The <i>ubac2</i> mutants showed normal PRR biogenesis, MAPK activation, ROS burst, and PTI-associated gene expression. Pathogen- and PAMP-induced callose deposition, however, was compromised in <i>ubac2</i> mutants. UBAC2 proteins interact with the plant-specific long coiled-coil protein PAMP-INDUCED COILED COIL (PICC), and <i>picc</i> mutants were compromised in callose deposition and PTI. Compromised callose deposition in the <i>ubac2</i> and <i>picc</i> mutants was associated with reduced accumulation of the POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANT 4 (PMR4) callose synthase, which is responsible for pathogen-induced callose synthesis. Constitutive overexpression of PMR4 restored pathogen-induced callose synthesis and PTI in the <i>ubac2</i> and <i>picc</i> mutants. These results uncover an ER pathway involving the conserved UBAC2 and plant-specific PICC proteins that specifically regulate pathogen-induced callose deposition in plant innate immunity.
