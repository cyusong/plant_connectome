Rhizobia are rod-shaped bacteria that form nitrogen-fixing root nodules on leguminous plants; however, they don't carry MreB, a key determinant of rod-like cell shape. Here, we introduced an actin-like <i>mreB</i> homolog from a pseudomonad into <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> 7653R (a microsymbiont of <i>Astragalus sinicus</i> L.) and examined the molecular, cellular, and symbiotic phenotypes of the resultant mutant. Exogenous <i>mreB</i> caused an enlarged cell size and slower growth in laboratory medium. However, the mutant formed small, ineffective nodules on <i>A. sinicus</i> (Nod<sup>+</sup> Fix<sup>-</sup>), and rhizobial cells in the infection zone were unable to differentiate into bacteroids. RNA sequencing analysis also revealed minor effects of <i>mreB</i> on global gene expression in free-living cells but larger effects for cells grown in planta. Differentially expressed nodule-specific genes include cell cycle regulators such as the tubulin-like <i>ftsZ<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>ftsZ<sub>2</sub></i>. Unlike the ubiquitous FtsZ<sub>1</sub>, an FtsZ<sub>2</sub> homolog was commonly found in <i>Rhizobium</i>, <i>Sinorhizobium</i>, and <i>Mesorhizobium</i> spp. but not in closely related nonsymbiotic species. Bacterial two-hybrid analysis revealed that MreB interacts with FtsZ<sub>1</sub> and FtsZ<sub>2</sub>, which are targeted by the host-derived nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides. Significantly, MreB mutation D283A disrupted the protein-protein interactions and restored the aforementioned phenotypic defects caused by MreB in <i>M. huakuii</i>. Together, our data indicate that MreB is detrimental for modern rhizobia and its interaction with FtsZ<sub>1</sub> and FtsZ<sub>2</sub> causes the symbiotic process to cease at the late stage of bacteroid differentiation. These findings led to a hypothesis that loss of <i>mreB</i> in the common ancestor of members of <i>Rhizobiales</i> and subsequent acquisition of <i>ftsZ<sub>2</sub></i> are critical evolutionary steps leading to legume-rhizobial symbiosis.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
