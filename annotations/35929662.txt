The double-recessive genic male-sterile (ms) line ms5 ms6 has been used to develop cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) hybrids for many years, but its molecular-genetic basis has remained unclear. Here, we identified the Ms5 and Ms6 loci through map-based cloning and confirmed their function in male sterility through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Ms5 and Ms6 are highly expressed in stages 7-9 anthers and encode the cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases CYP703A2-A and CYP703A2-D. The ms5 mutant carries a single-nucleotide C-to-T nonsense mutation leading to premature chain termination at amino acid 312 (GhCYP703A2-A<sup>312aa</sup> ), and ms6 carries three nonsynonymous substitutions (D98E, E168K, and G198R) and a synonymous mutation (L11L). Enzyme assays showed that GhCYP703A2 proteins hydroxylate fatty acids, and the ms5 (GhCYP703A2-A<sup>312aa</sup> ) and ms6 (GhCYP703A2-D<sup>D98E,E168K,G198R</sup> ) mutant proteins have decreased enzyme activities. Biochemical and lipidomic analyses showed that in ms5 ms6 plants, C12-C18 free fatty acid and phospholipid levels are significantly elevated in stages 7-9 anthers, while stages 8-10 anthers lack sporopollenin fluorescence around the pollen, causing microspore degradation and male sterility. Overall, our characterization uncovered functions of GhCYP703A2 in sporopollenin formation and fertility, providing guidance for creating male-sterile lines to facilitate hybrid cotton production and therefore exploit heterosis for improvement of cotton.
