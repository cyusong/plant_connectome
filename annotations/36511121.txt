Soybean (Glycine max) is a major source of plant protein and oil. Soybean breeding has benefited from advances in functional genomics. In particular, the release of soybean reference genomes has advanced our understanding of soybean adaptation to soil nutrient deficiencies, the molecular mechanism of symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and the roles of flowering time in regional adaptation, plant architecture, and seed yield and quality. Nevertheless, many challenges remain for soybean functional genomics and molecular breeding, mainly related to improving grain yield through high-density planting, maize-soybean intercropping, taking advantage of wild resources, utilization of heterosis, genomic prediction and selection breeding, and precise breeding through genome editing. This review summarizes the current progress in soybean functional genomics and directs future challenges for molecular breeding of soybean.
