['32111670', 'Calcium-regulated protein kinases are key components of intracellular signaling  in plants that mediate rapid stress-induced responses to changes in the  environment. To identify in vivo phosphorylation substrates of CALCIUM-DEPENDENT  PROTEIN KINASE1 (CPK1), we analyzed the conditional expression of constitutively  active CPK1 in conjunction with in vivo phosphoproteomics. We identified  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ORESARA1 (ORE1), the developmental master  regulator of senescence, as a direct CPK1 phosphorylation substrate. CPK1  phosphorylates ORE1 at a hotspot within an intrinsically disordered region. This  augments transcriptional activation by ORE1 of its downstream target gene  BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE1 (BFN1). Plants that overexpress ORE1, but not an ORE1  variant lacking the CPK1 phosphorylation hotspot, promote early senescence.  Furthermore, ORE1 is required for enhanced cell death induced by CPK1 signaling.  Our data validate the use of conditional expression of an active enzyme combined  with phosphoproteomics to decipher specific kinase target proteins of low  abundance, of transient phosphorylation, or in yet-undescribed biological  contexts. Here, we have identified that senescence is not just under molecular  surveillance manifested by stringent gene regulatory control over ORE1 In  addition, the decision to die is superimposed by an additional layer of control  toward ORE1 via its posttranslational modification linked to the  calcium-regulatory network through CPK1.', '2020 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00810', 'ORCID:']
