Phytomelatonin, a multifunctional molecule that has been found to be present in all plants examined to date, has an important role in plants as a modulatory agent (a biostimulator) that improves plant tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stress. We present a review of phytomelatonin that considers its roles in plant metabolism and in particular its interactions with plant hormone network. In the primary metabolism of plants, melatonin improves the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis, as well related factors such as stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2, and Rubisco activity. It has also been shown to down-regulate some senescence transcription factors. Melatonin up-regulates many enzyme transcripts related to carbohydrates (including sucrose and starch), amino acids, and lipid metabolism, optimizing N, P, and S uptake. With respect to the secondary metabolism, clear increases in polyphenol, glucosinolate, terpenoid, and alkaloid contents have been described in numerous melatonin-treated plants. Generally, the most important genes of these secondary biosynthesis pathways have been found to be up-regulated by melatonin. The great regulatory capacity of melatonin is a result of its control of the redox and plant hormone networks. Melatonin acts as a plant master regulator, up-/down-regulating different plant hormone levels and signalling, and is a key player in redox homeostasis. It has the capacity to counteract diverse critical situations such as pathogen infections and abiotic stresses, and provide plants with varying degrees of tolerance. We propose possible future applications of melatonin for crop improvement and post-harvest product preservation.
