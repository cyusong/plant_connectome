Auxin and cytokinin are two kinds of important phytohormones that mediate outgrowth of axillary buds in plants. How nitric oxide and its regulator of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) take part in auxin and cytokinin signaling for controlling axillary buds outgrowth remains elusive. We investigated the roles of GSNOR during tomato axillary bud outgrowth by using physiological, biochemical and genetic approaches. GSNOR negatively regulated NO homeostasis. Suppression of GSNOR promoted axillary bud outgrowth by inhibiting the expression of FZY in both apical and axillary buds. Meanwhile, AUX1 and PIN1 were down-regulated in apical buds but up-regulated in axillary buds in GSNOR-suppressed plants. Thus, reduced IAA accumulation was shown in both apical buds and axillary buds of GSNOR-suppressed plants. GSNOR-mediated changes of NO and auxin affected cytokinin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling. And a decreased ratio of auxin: cytokinin was shown in axillary buds of GSNOR-suppressed plants, leading to bud dormancy breaking. We also found that the original NO signaling was generated by nitrate reductase (NR) catalyzing nitrate as substrate. NR-mediated NO reduced the GSNOR activity through S-nitrosylation of Cys-10, then induced a further NO burst, which played the above roles to promote axillary buds outgrowth. Together, GSNOR-mediated NO played important roles in controlling axillary buds outgrowth by altering the homeostasis and signaling of auxin and cytokinin in tomato plants.
