['16601150', 'Intercellular flow of the phytohormone auxin underpins multiple developmental  processes in plants. Plant-specific pin-formed (PIN) proteins and several  phosphoglycoprotein (PGP) transporters are crucial factors in auxin  transport-related development, yet the molecular function of PINs remains  unknown. Here, we show that PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast  cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. Conditional  gain-of-function alleles and quantitative measurements of auxin accumulation in  Arabidopsis and tobacco cultured cells revealed that the action of PINs in auxin  efflux is distinct from PGP, rate-limiting, specific to auxins, and sensitive to  auxin transport inhibitors. This suggests a direct involvement of PINs in  catalyzing cellular auxin efflux.', '2006 May 12', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1123542', 'Friml']
