['17227549', 'The ATR and ATM protein kinases are known to be involved in a wide variety of  responses to DNA damage. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome includes both ATR and  ATM orthologs, and plants with null alleles of these genes are viable.  Arabidopsis atr and atm mutants display hypersensitivity to gamma-irradiation. To  further characterize the roles of ATM and ATR in response to ionizing radiation,  we performed a short-term global transcription analysis in wild-type and mutant  lines. We found that hundreds of genes are upregulated in response to  gamma-irradiation, and that the induction of virtually all of these genes is  dependent on ATM, but not ATR. The transcript of CYCB1;1 is unique among the  cyclin transcripts in being rapidly and powerfully upregulated in response to  ionizing radiation, while other G(2)-associated transcripts are suppressed. We  found that both ATM and ATR contribute to the induction of a CYCB1;1:GUS fusion  by IR, but only ATR is required for the persistence of this response. We propose  that this upregulation of CYCB1;1 does not reflect the accumulation of cells in  G(2), but instead reflects a still unknown role for this cyclin in DNA damage  response.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02931.x', 'Britt']
