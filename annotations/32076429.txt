['32076429', 'Heme plays an active role in primary plant metabolic pathways as well as in  stress signaling. In this study, we characterized the predicted heme-binding  protein SOUL4. Proteomics evidence suggests that SOUL4 is a component of  Arabidopsis plastoglobules (PGs, chloroplast lipid droplets). SOUL4 contains  heme-binding motifs and the recombinant protein is shown here to bind heme in  vitro. Fluorescence-tagged SOUL4 colocalized with the specific PG marker  Fibrillin1A (FBN1A) in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. In  addition, SOUL4 cofractionated with another PG marker Fibrillin2 (FBN2) in  sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation experiments. In vitro kinase experiments  revealed that SOUL4 is phosphorylated by a yet unknown chloroplast protein  kinase. Our data demonstrate that SOUL4 is a bona fide PG protein and may  function in heme-buffering in the chloroplast.', '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.00002', 'Kessler']
