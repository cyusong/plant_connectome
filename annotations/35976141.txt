A decade ago, the CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted for genome editing. Since then, hundreds of organisms have been altered using genome editing and discussions were raised on the regulatory status of genome edited organisms esp. crops. To date, many countries have made decisions on the regulatory status of products of genome editing, by exempting some kinds of edits from the classical GMO regulation. However, the guidance differs between countries even in the same region. Several countries are still debating the issue or are in the progress of updating guidance and regulatory systems to cover products of genome editing. The current global situation of different regulatory systems is putting a harmonized framework on genome-edited crops in the far future. In this update, we summarize the current developments in the field of regulation concerning edited crops and present a short insight into perception of genome editing in the society.
