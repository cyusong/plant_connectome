Exogenous BAP but not 2iP disrupts actin structures and induces tip-growth retardation and cytokinesis failure in the moss Physcomitrium patens. Synthetic cytokinins have been widely used to address hormonal responses during plant development. However, exogenous cytokinins can cause a variety of cellular effects. A detailed characterization of such effects has not been well studied. Here, using Physcomitrium patens as a model, we show that the aromatic cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) inhibits tip growth at concentrations above 0.2 µM. At higher concentrations (0.6-1 µM), BAP can additionally block mitotic entry and induce cytokinesis defects and cell death. These effects are associated with altered actin dynamics and structures. By contrast, 2-isopentenyladenine (2iP) does not cause marked defects at various concentrations up to 10 µM, while t-zeatin (tZ) can moderately inhibit moss growth. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the inhibitory effects of BAP on cell growth and cell division and call for attention to the use of synthetic cytokinins for bioassays.
