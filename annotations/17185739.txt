Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] plants produce some seeds (called stone or impermeable seeds) that do not take up water for long periods of time. The present investigation confirmed that the stone seed trait is a feature of the seed coat: isolated embryos from both stone and permeable seeds took up water equally quickly. A whole, permeable seed typically imbibed water initially through its dorsal side, forming wrinkles in the seed coat and delivering water to the underlying cotyledons. Later, some lateral movement of water through the coat occurred, presumably through the air spaces of the osteosclereid layer. Imbibition by seeds was a two-phase process, the first dominated by hydration of the seed coat and the second by hydration of the cotyledons, which was rate-limited by the coat. When hydrated, coats of stone seeds were permeable to water but their hydraulic conductivity, as measured with a pressure probe, was smaller than that of coats from permeable seeds by a factor of five. Hydrated coats of both permeable and stone seeds showed weak osmometer properties.
