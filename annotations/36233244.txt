Secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi are an important source of biologically active compounds. The current research was focused on the biological activities of ethyl acetate extracts of fungi, isolated and identified from <i>Vernonia anthelmintica</i> flowers for the first time. In addition, an investigation of the non-polar chemical composition of dichloromethane-ethyl acetate extracts of the most active fungal strain was carried out. The isolates included <i>Ovatospora senegalensis</i> NR-03, <i>Chaetomium globosum</i> NR-04, <i>Thielavia subthermophila</i> NR-06, <i>Aspergillus calidoustus</i> NR-10, <i>Aspergillus keveii</i> XJF-23 and <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> XJF-3 species. Strains were identified by 18S rRNA gene sequencing methods and were registered in GenBank. Crude extracts of the fungi displayed in vitro biological activities, including antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. A melanin content assay was performed on murine B16 cells. An ethyl acetate extract of <i>O. senegalensis</i> NR-03 showed high anticancer and antimicrobial activity; therefore, we also studied the non-polar chemical composition of the dichloromethane-ethyl acetate fraction and identified 52 non-polar compounds with the different medium. This investigation discovered that the secondary metabolites of the total extract of endophytic fungi could be a potential source of alternative natural antimicrobial, cytotoxic and melanin synthesis activity in their host plant, and the isolation of bioactive metabolites may provide a lead to new compounds of pharmaceutical significance.
