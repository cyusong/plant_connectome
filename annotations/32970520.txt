Glutaredoxin (GRX) plays an essential role in the control of the cellular redox state and related pathways in many organisms. There is limited information on GRXs from the model nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)-fixing bacterium <i>Azorhizobium caulinodans</i>. In the present work, we identified and performed functional analyses of monothiol and dithiol GRXs in <i>A. caulinodans</i> in the free-living state and during symbiosis with <i>Sesbania rostrata</i>. Our data show that monothiol GRXs may be very important for bacterial growth under normal conditions and in response to oxidative stress due to imbalance of the redox state in <i>grx</i> mutants of <i>A. caulinodans</i>. Functional redundancies were also observed within monothiol and dithiol GRXs in terms of different physiological functions. The changes in catalase activity and iron content in <i>grx</i> mutants were assumed to favor the maintenance of bacterial resistance against oxidants, nodulation, and N<sub>2</sub> fixation efficiency in this bacterium. Furthermore, the monothiol GRX12 and dithiol GRX34 play a collective role in symbiotic associations between <i>A. caulinodans</i> and <i>Sesbania rostrata.</i> Our study provided systematic evidence that further investigations are required to understand the importance of glutaredoxins in <i>A. caulinodans</i> and other rhizobia.
