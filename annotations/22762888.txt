['22762888', 'Although root hair development in Arabidopsis thaliana has been extensively  studied, it remains unknown whether the zinc finger proteins, the largest family  of transcription factors in plants, are involved in this process. Here we report  that the C2H2 zinc finger protein ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 5 (ZFP5) is a key regulator  of root hair initiation and morphogenesis in Arabidopsis. ZFP5 is mainly  expressed in root and preferentially in root hair cells. Using both zfp5 mutants  and ZFP5 RNAi lines, we show that reduction in ZFP5 function leads to fewer and  much shorter root hairs compared to wild-type. Genetic and molecular experiments  demonstrate that ZFP5 exerts its effect on root hair development by directly  promoting expression of the CAPRICE (CPC) gene. Furthermore, we show that ZFP5  expression is induced by cytokinin, and that ZFP5 mediates cytokinin and ethylene  effects on the formation and growth of root hairs. These results suggest that  ZFP5 integrates various plant hormone cues to control root epidermal cell  development in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05094.x', 'Gan']
