Chalkiness is a crucial determinant of rice quality. During seed filling period, high temperature usually increases grain chalkiness, resulting in poor grain quality. Rice chalkiness was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and influenced by environmental conditions. In this study, we identified two single-segment substitution lines (SSSLs) 22-05 and 15-06 with significantly lower percentage of grain chalkiness (PGC) than recipient Huajingxian 74 (HJX74) over 6 cropping seasons. Two major QTLs for chalkiness, <i>qPGC5</i> and <i>qPGC6</i>, were located by substitution mapping of SSSLs 22-05 and 15-06, respectively. <i>qPGC5</i> was located in the 876.5 kb interval of chromosome 5 and <i>qPGC6</i> was located in the 269.1 kb interval of chromosome 6. Interestingly, the PGC of HJX74 was significantly different between the two cropping seasons per year, with 25.8% in the first cropping season (FCS) and 16.6% in the second cropping season (SCS), while the PGC of SSSLs 22-05 and 15-06 did not significantly differ between FCS and SCS. The additive effects of <i>qPGC5</i> and <i>qPGC6</i> on chalkiness in the SSSLs were significantly greater in FCS than in SCS. These results showed that <i>qPGC5</i> and <i>qPGC6</i> had major effects on chalkiness and the SSSL alleles were more effective in reducing chalkiness under high temperature condition in FCS. The fine-mapping of the two QTLs will facilitate the cloning of genes for chalkiness and provide new genetic resources to develop new cultivars with low chalkiness even under high temperature condition.
