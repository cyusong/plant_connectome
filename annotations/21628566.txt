['21628566', 'Plants take up iron from the soil using the iron-regulated transporter 1 (IRT1)  high-affinity iron transporter at the root surface. Sophisticated regulatory  mechanisms allow plants to tightly control the levels of IRT1, ensuring optimal  absorption of essential but toxic iron. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression  of Arabidopsis thaliana IRT1 leads to constitutive IRT1 protein accumulation,  metal overload, and oxidative stress. IRT1 is unexpectedly found in trans-Golgi  network/early endosomes of root hair cells, and its levels and localization are  unaffected by iron nutrition. Using pharmacological approaches, we show that IRT1  cycles to the plasma membrane to perform iron and metal uptake at the cell  surface and is sent to the vacuole for proper turnover. We also prove that IRT1  is monoubiquitinated on several cytosol-exposed residues in vivo and that  mutation of two putative monoubiquitination target residues in IRT1 triggers  stabilization at the plasma membrane and leads to extreme lethality. Together,  these data suggest a model in which monoubiquitin-dependent  internalization/sorting and turnover keep the plasma membrane pool of IRT1 low to  ensure proper iron uptake and to prevent metal toxicity. More generally, our work  demonstrates the existence of monoubiquitin-dependent trafficking to lytic  vacuoles in plants and points to proteasome-independent turnover of plasma  membrane proteins.', '2011 Aug 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1100659108', 'Vert']
