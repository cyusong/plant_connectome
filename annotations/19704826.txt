Preserving crop yield under drought stress is a major challenge for modern agriculture. To cope with the detrimental effects of water scarcity on crop productivity it is important to develop new plants with a more sustainable use of water and capable of higher performance under stress conditions. Transpiration through stomatal pores accounts for over 90% of water loss in land plants. Recent studies have increased our understanding of the networks that control stomatal activity and have led to practical approaches for enhancing drought tolerance. Genetic engineering of target genes in stomata requires effective expression systems, including suitable promoters, because constitutive promoters (i.e., CaMV35S) are not always functional or can have negative effects on plant growth and productivity. Here we describe the identification of the CYP86A2 guard cell promoter and discuss its potential for gene expression in stomata.
