Temporal development of roots is key to the understanding of root system architecture of plants which influences nutrient uptake, anchorage and plant competition. Using time lapse imaging we analyzed developmental patterns of length, growth angle, depth and curvature of Phaseolus basal roots from emergence till 48 h in two genotypes, B98311 and TLP19 with contrasting growth angles. In both genotypes all basal roots appeared almost simultaneously, but their growth rates varied which accounted for differences in root length. The growth angles of the basal roots fluctuated rapidly during initial development due to oscillatory root growth causing local bends. Beyond 24 h, as the root curvature stabilized, so did the growth angle. Therefore growth angle of basal roots is not a very reliable quantity for characterizing root architecture, especially during early seedling development. Comparatively, tip depth is a more robust measure of vertical distribution of the basal roots even during early seedling development.
