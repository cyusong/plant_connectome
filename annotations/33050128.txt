Abiotic stresses cause plant growth inhibition, damage, and in the most severe cases, cell death, resulting in major crop yield losses worldwide. Many abiotic stresses lead also to oxidative stress. Recent genetic and genomics studies have revealed highly complex and integrated gene networks which are responsible for stress adaptation. Here we summarize the main findings of the papers published in the Special Issue "ROS and Abiotic Stress in Plants", providing a global picture of the link between reactive oxygen species and various abiotic stresses such as acid toxicity, drought, heat, heavy metals, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and salinity.
