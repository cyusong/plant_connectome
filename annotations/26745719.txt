['26745719', 'The cuticle is a hydrophobic lipid layer covering the epidermal cells of  terrestrial plants. Although many genes involved in Arabidopsis cuticle  development have been identified, the transcriptional regulation of these genes  is largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that AtCFL1 negatively regulates  cuticle development by interacting with the HD-ZIP IV transcription factor HDG1.  Here, we report that two bHLH transcription factors, AtCFL1 associated protein 1  (CFLAP1) and CFLAP2, are also involved in AtCFL1-mediated regulation of cuticle  development. CFLAP1 and CFLAP2 interact with AtCFL1 both in vitro and in vivo.  Overexpression of either CFLAP1 or CFLAP2 led to expressional changes of genes  involved in fatty acids, cutin and wax biosynthesis pathways and caused multiple  cuticle defective phenotypes such as organ fusion, breakage of the cuticle layer  and decreased epicuticular wax crystal loading. Functional inactivation of CFLAP1  and CFLAP2 by chimeric repression technology caused opposite phenotypes to the  CFLAP1 overexpressor plants. Interestingly, we find that, similar to the  transcription factor HDG1, the function of CFLAP1 in cuticle development is  dependent on the presence of AtCFL1. Furthermore, both HDG1 and CFLAP1/2 interact  with the same C-terminal C4 zinc finger domain of AtCFL1, a domain that is  essential for AtCFL1 function. These results suggest that AtCFL1 may serve as a  master regulator in the transcriptional regulation of cuticle development, and  that CFLAP1 and CFLAP2 are involved in the AtCFL1-mediated regulation pathway,  probably through competing with HDG1 to bind to AtCFL1.', '2016 Jan', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005744', 'Gu']
