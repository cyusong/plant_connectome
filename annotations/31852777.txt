We exploited the broad host range of <i>Fusarium virguliforme</i> to identify differential fungal responses leading to either an endophytic or a pathogenic lifestyle during colonization of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), respectively. To provide a foundation to survey the transcriptomic landscape, we produced an improved de novo genome assembly and annotation of <i>F. virguliforme</i> using PacBio sequencing. Next, we conducted a high-resolution time course of <i>F. virguliforme</i> colonization and infection of both soybean, a symptomatic host, and maize, an asymptomatic host. Comparative transcriptomic analyses uncovered a nearly complete network rewiring, with less than 8% average gene coexpression module overlap upon colonizing the different plant hosts. Divergence of transcriptomes originating from host specific temporal induction genes is central to infection and colonization, including carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and necrosis inducing effectors. Upregulation of Zn(II)-Cys6 transcription factors were uniquely induced in soybean at 2 d postinoculation, suggestive of enhanced pathogen virulence on soybean. In total, the data described herein suggest that <i>F. virguliforme</i> modulates divergent infection profiles through transcriptional plasticity.
