Using petrolatum gel as an antitranspirant on the flowers of California poppy and giant bindweed, we show that transpiration provides a large contribution to floral humidity generation. Floral humidity, an area of elevated humidity in the headspace of flowers, is believed to be produced predominantly through a combination of evaporation of liquid nectar and transpirational water loss from the flower. However, the role of transpiration in floral humidity generation has not been directly tested and is largely inferred by continued humidity production when nectar is removed from flowers. We test whether transpiration contributes to the floral humidity generation of two species previously identified to produce elevated floral humidity, Calystegia silvatica and Eschscholzia californica. Floral humidity production of flowers that underwent an antitranspirant treatment, petrolatum gel which blocks transpiration from treated tissues, is compared to flowers that did not receive such treatments. Gel treatments reduced floral humidity production to approximately a third of that produced by untreated flowers in C. silvatica, and half of that in E. californica. This confirms the previously untested inferences that transpiration has a large contribution to floral humidity generation and that this contribution may vary between species.
