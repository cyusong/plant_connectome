['17605755', 'The salt tolerance protein (STO) of Arabidopsis was identified as a protein  conferring salt tolerance to yeast cells. In order to uncover its function, we  isolated an STO T-DNA insertion line and generated RNAi and overexpressor  Arabidopsis plants. Here we present data on the hypocotyl growth of these lines  indicating that STO acts as a negative regulator in phytochrome and blue-light  signalling. Transcription analysis of STO uncovered a light and circadian  dependent regulation of gene expression, and analysis of light-regulated genes  revealed that STO is involved in the regulation of CHS expression during  de-etiolation. In addition, we could show that CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1  (COP1) represses the transcription of STO and contributes to the destabilization  of the protein in etiolated seedlings. Microscopic analysis revealed that the  STO:eGFP fusion protein is located in the nucleus, accumulates in a  light-dependent manner, and, in transient transformation assays in onion  epidermal cells, co-localizes with COP1 in nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregations.  However, the analysis of gain- and loss-of-function STO mutants in the cop1-4  background points towards a COP1-independent role during photomorphogenesis.', '2007 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03162.x', 'Rodriguez-Franco']
