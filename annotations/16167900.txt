['16167900', 'The specification of epidermal (L1) identity occurs early during plant  embryogenesis. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis, AtDEK1 encodes a key component  of the embryonic L1 cell-layer specification pathway. Loss of AtDEK1 function  leads to early embryo lethality characterized by a severe loss of cell  organization in the embryo proper and abnormal cell divisions within the  suspensor. Markers for L1 identity, ACR4 and ATML1, are not expressed in  homozygous mutant embryos. In order to clarify the function of AtDEK1 further, an  RNAi knockdown approach was used. This allowed embryos to partially complete  embryogenesis before losing AtDEK1 activity. Resulting seedlings showed a  specific loss of epidermal cell identity within large portions of the cotyledons.  In addition, meristem structure and function was systematically either reduced or  entirely lost. AtDEK1 expression is not restricted to the L1 epidermal cell layer  at any stage in development. This is consistent with AtDEK1 playing an upstream  role in the continuous generation or interpretation of positional information  required for epidermal specification. Our results not only identify a specific  role for AtDEK1 during embryogenesis, but underline the potential key importance  of L1 specification at the globular stage for subsequent progression through  embryogenesis.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02514.x', 'Ingram']
