Mutation of the BEIIb gene in an isa1 mutant background mitigates the negative effect of the ISA1 mutation on grain filling, and facilitates recovery of amyloplast formation in rice endosperm. In this study, the effect of branching enzyme IIb and isoamylase 1 deficiency on starch properties was demonstrated using high resistant starch rice lines, Chikushi-kona 85 and EM129. Both lines harbored a mutation in the BEIIb and ISA1 genes and showed no BEIIb and ISA1 activity, implying that both lines are beIIb isa1 double mutants. The amylopectin long chain and apparent amylose content of both mutant lines were higher than those of the wild-type. While both mutants contained loosely packed, round starch grains, a trait specific to beIIb mutants, they also showed collapsed starch grains at the center of the endosperm, a property specific to isa1 mutants. Furthermore, beIIb isa1 double mutant F<sub>2</sub> lines derived from a cross between Chikushi-kona 85 and Nishihomare (wild-type cultivar) showed significantly heavier seed weight than the beIIb and isa1 single mutant lines. These results suggest that co-occurrence of beIIb and isa1 mutant alleles in a single genetic background mitigates the negative effect of the isa1 allele on grain filling, and contributes to recovery of the amyloplast formation defect in the isa1 single mutant.
