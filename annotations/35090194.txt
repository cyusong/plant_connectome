To better explore the potential of rice extra-large G (XLG) proteins in future breeding, we characterised the function of OsXLG1, OsXLG2 and OsXLG3 in disease resistance. Loss-of-function Osxlg2 and Osxlg3 mutants showed reduced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, whereas Osxlg1 mutants were specifically compromised in resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. Consistent with their effects on rice blast resistance, mutations in OsXLG2 and OsXLG3 caused greater defects than did mutations in OsXLG1 for chitin-induced defence responses. All three OsXLGs interacted with components of a surface immune receptor complex composed of OsCERK1, OsRLCK176 and OsRLCK185. Further characterisation of yield-related traits showed that the Osxlg3 mutants displayed reduced plant height, panicle length and 1000grain weight, whereas Osxlg1 mutants exhibited increased plant height, panicle length and 1000-grain weight. Together the study shows the differential contributions of the three OsXLG proteins to disease resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens, their yield-related traits and provides insights for future improvement of rice production.
