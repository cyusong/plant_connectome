Stomatal movements via the control of gas exchanges determine plant growth in relation to environmental stimuli through a complex signalling network involving reactive oxygen species that lead to post-translational modifications of Cys and Met residues, and alter protein activity and/or conformation. Thiol-reductases (TRs), which include thioredoxins, glutaredoxins (GRXs) and peroxiredoxins (PRXs), participate in signalling pathways through the control of Cys redox status in client proteins. Their involvement in stomatal functioning remains poorly characterized. By performing a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we show that numerous thiol reductases, like PRXs, are highly abundant in guard cells. When investigating various Arabidopsis mutants impaired in the expression of TR genes, no change in stomatal density and index was noticed. In optimal growth conditions, a line deficient in cytosolic NADPH-thioredoxin reductases displayed higher stomatal conductance and lower leaf temperature evaluated by thermal infrared imaging. In contrast, lines deficient in plastidial 2-CysPRXs or type-II GRXs exhibited compared to WT reduced conductance and warmer leaves in optimal conditions, and enhanced stomatal closure in epidermal peels treated with abscisic acid or hydrogen peroxide. Altogether, these data strongly support the contribution of thiol redox switches within the signalling network regulating guard cell movements and stomatal functioning.
