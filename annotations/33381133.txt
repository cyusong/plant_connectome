SKIP, a component of the spliceosome, is involved in numerous signaling pathways. However, there is no direct genetic evidence supporting the function of SKIP in defense responses. In this paper, two <i>SKIPs</i>, namely, <i>SlSKIP1a</i> and <i>SlSKIP1b</i>, were analyzed in tomato. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the <i>SlSKIP1b</i> expression was triggered via <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 and <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>B. cinerea</i>), together with the defense-associated signals. In addition, the functions of <i>SlSKIP1a</i> and <i>SlSKIP1b</i> in disease resistance were analyzed in tomato through the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technique. VIGS-mediated <i>SlSKIP1b</i> silencing led to increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with the decreased expression of defense-related genes (DRGs) after pathogen infection, suggesting that it reduced <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>Pst</i> DC3000 resistance. There was no significant difference in <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>Pst</i> DC3000 resistance in TRV-<i>SlSKIP1a</i>-infiltrated plants compared with the TRV-<i>GUS</i>-silencing counterparts. As suggested by the above findings, <i>SlSKIP1b</i> plays a vital role in disease resistance against pathogens possibly by regulating the accumulation of ROS as well as the expression of DRGs.
