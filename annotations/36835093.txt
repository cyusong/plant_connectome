<i>Casuarina glauca</i> is an important coastal protection forest species, which is exposed to high salt stress all year round. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can promote the growth and salt tolerance of <i>C</i>. <i>glauca</i> under salt stress. However, the effects of AMF on the distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> and the expression of related genes in <i>C</i>. <i>glauca</i> under salt stress need to be further explored. This study explored the effects of <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> on plant biomass, the distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>, and the expression of related genes in <i>C</i>. <i>glauca</i> under NaCl stress through pot simulation experiments. The results revealed that the mechanisms of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> transport of <i>C. glauca</i> under NaCl stress were different. <i>C. glauca</i> took a salt accumulation approach to Na<sup>+</sup>, transferring Na<sup>+</sup> from roots to shoots. Salt accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> promoted by AMF was associated with <i>CgNHX7</i>. The transport mechanism of <i>C. glauca</i> to Cl<sup>-</sup> might involve salt exclusion rather than salt accumulation, and Cl<sup>-</sup> was no longer transferred to shoots in large quantities but started to accumulate in roots. However, AMF alleviated Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> stress by similar mechanisms. AMF could promote salt dilution of <i>C. glauca</i> by increasing biomass and the content of K<sup>+</sup>, compartmentalizing Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in vacuoles. These processes were associated with the expression of <i>CgNHX1</i>, <i>CgNHX2-1</i>, <i>CgCLCD</i>, <i>CgCLCF</i>, and <i>CgCLCG.</i> Our study will provide a theoretical basis for the application of AMF to improve salt tolerance in plants.
