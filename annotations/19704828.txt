Resistance (R) gene-mediated immunity provides plants with rapid and strain-specific protection against pathogen infection. Our recent study using the genetically tractable Arabidopsis and turnip crinkle virus (TCV) pathosystem revealed a novel component, named CRT1 (compromised for recognition of the TCV CP), that is involved in general R gene-mediated signaling, including that mediated by HRT, an R gene against TCV. The Arabidopsis CRT1 gene family contains six additional members, of which two share high homology to CRT1 (75 and 81% a.a. identity); either CRT1 or its closest homolog restore the cell death phenotype suppressed by crt1. Analysis of single knock-out mutants for CRT1 and its closest homologs suggest that each may have unique and redundant functions. Here, we provide insight into the screening conditions that enabled identification of a mutant gene despite the presence of functionally redundant family members. We also discuss a potential mechanism that may regulate the interaction between CRT1 and R proteins.
