Agricultural practices in grapevines management include water restrictions due to its positive effect on wine quality, especially when applied at fruit ripening. Although the effects of water stress in some groups of phytohormones have already been described in leaves and whole grapes, information regarding tissue-specific variations in hormones during ripening in grapes is scarce. Field-grown grapevines from the cv. "Merlot" were subjected to two differential water supplies, including only rainfed, non-irrigated vines (T0) and vines additionally irrigated with 25Lweek<sup>-1</sup> vine<sup>-1</sup> (T1). Tissue-specific variations in the hormonal profiling of grapes [including changes in the contents of abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), the ethylene precursor 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the auxin indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellins 1, 3, 4, and 7 (GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub>, GA<sub>4</sub>, and GA<sub>7</sub>), the cytokinins <i>trans</i>-zeatin, and 2-isopentenyl adenine, including as well their respective ribosylated forms] were periodically evaluated from <i>veraison</i> to harvest. The hormonal profiling in leaves was also measured at the beginning and end of the season for comparison. Results showed that grape growth dynamics were transiently affected by the differences in water regimes, the increased water supply leading to an accelerated growth, slightly reduced accumulation of sugars, and transiently lowered pH, although grape quality did not differ between treatments at harvest. Hormonal profiling of whole berries did not reveal any difference in the endogenous contents of phytohormones between treatments, except for a transient decrease in GA<sub>4</sub> contents in T1 compared to T0 vines, which was not confirmed at the tissular level. Hormonal profiling at the tissue level highlighted a differential accumulation of phytohormones during ripening in berry tissues, with pulps being particularly poor in ABA, JA, and SA contents, seeds particularly accumulating ACC, gibberellins, and zeatin-type cytokinins, and the skin being particularly rich in auxin and active cytokinins. Changes in water supply led to very small and transient changes in the endogenous contents of phytohormones in the seeds, pulp, and skin of berries, the most remarkable variations being observed in cytokinin contents, which increased earlier [between 5 and 12days after <i>veraison</i> (DAV)] but later kept more constant in the skin from T1 compared to T0 vines and were also 3-fold higher at 40 DAV in seeds of T1 compared to T0 vines. It is concluded that small changes in water supply can trigger hormonal-driven physiological adjustments at the tissular level affecting the evolution of fruit growth and quality throughout grape berry ripening.
