Evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is not distributed evenly in the plant kingdom. Particularly interesting is the situation in the Brassicaceae, because the family contains no C<sub>4</sub> species, but several C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediates, mainly in the genus Moricandia Investigation of leaf anatomy, gas exchange parameters, the metabolome, and the transcriptome of two C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate Moricandia species, M. arvensis and M. suffruticosa, and their close C<sub>3</sub> relative M. moricandioides enabled us to unravel the specific C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> characteristics in these Moricandia lines. Reduced CO<sub>2</sub> compensation points in these lines were accompanied by anatomical adjustments, such as centripetal concentration of organelles in the bundle sheath, and metabolic adjustments, such as the balancing of C and N metabolism between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells by multiple pathways. Evolution from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediacy was probably facilitated first by loss of one copy of the glycine decarboxylase P-protein, followed by dominant activity of a bundle sheath-specific element in its promoter. In contrast to recent models, installation of the C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> pathway was not accompanied by enhanced activity of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle. Our results indicate that metabolic limitations connected to N metabolism or anatomical limitations connected to vein density could have constrained evolution of C<sub>4</sub> in Moricandia.
