['26179959', 'Cryptochromes are blue-light absorbing flavoproteins with many important  signaling roles in plants, including in de-etiolation, development, and stress  response. They interact with downstream signaling partners such as transcription  factors and components of the proteasome, and thereby alter regulation of nuclear  gene expression in a light dependent manner. In a prior study, it has also been  shown that Arabidopsis cry1 activation by blue light results in direct enzymatic  conversion of molecular oxygen (O2) to ROS (reactive oxygen species) in vivo  leading to cell death in overexpressing lines. Here we extend these observations  to show that Atcry2 is translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus in response  to blue light illumination, resulting in nuclear accumulation of ROS in  expressing insect cell cultures. These observations suggest that ROS formation  may represent a novel means of signaling by Atcry2 distinct from, and perhaps  complementary to, the currently known mechanism of light-mediated conformational  change.', '2015', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.1080/15592324.2015.1042647', 'Ahmad']
