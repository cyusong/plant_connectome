A genetic screen of Arabidopsis 'activation-tagging' mutant collection based on tolerance to norspermidine resulted in a dominant mutant (par1-1D) with increased expression of the QSO2 gene (At1g15020), encoding a member of the quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidase (QSO) family. The par1-1D mutant and transgenic plants overexpressing QSO2 cDNA grow better than wild-type Arabidopsis in media with toxic cations (polyamines, Li(+) and Na(+)) or reduced K(+) concentrations. This correlates with a decrease in the accumulation of toxic cations and an increase in the accumulation of K(+) in xylem sap and shoots. Conversely, three independent loss-of-function mutants of QSO2 exhibit phenotypes opposite to those of par1-1D. QSO2 is mostly expressed in roots and is upregulated by K(+) starvation. A QSO2Colon, two colonsGFP fusion ectopically expressed in leaf epidermis localized at the cell wall. The recombinant QSO2 protein, produced in yeast in secreted form, exhibits disulfhydryl oxidase activity. A plausible mechanism of QSO2 action consists on the activation of root systems loading K(+) into xylem, but different from the SKOR channel, which is not required for QSO2 action. These results uncover QSOs as novel regulators of ion homeostasis.
