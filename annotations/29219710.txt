Endomembrane protein trafficking has emerged as important means of regulating stress responses in plants. The Arabidopsis SNX1 protein is involved in recycling the iron transporter IRT1, thus promoting its presence at the plasma membrane. SNX1 and its interacting partners undergo stress-related regulation at both transcriptional and posttranslational level, which may include differential regulation at tissue level. Based on this, we explore the tissue-specific regulation of iron import, specifically concentrating on the factors involved in the expression and recycling of IRT1 in root tissues. We propose that different processes affecting IRT1 regulation may lead to similar outcomes, allowing for fine-tuning iron acquisition and distribution.
