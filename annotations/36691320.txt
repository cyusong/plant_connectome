Circadian regulation plays a vital role in optimizing plant responses to the environment. However, while circadian regulation has been extensively studied in angiosperms, very little is known for lycophytes and ferns, leaving a gap in our understanding of the evolution of circadian rhythms across the plant kingdom. Here, we investigated circadian regulation in gas exchange through stomatal conductance and photosynthetic efficiency in a phylogenetically broad panel of 21 species of lycophytes and ferns over a 46 h period under constant light and a selected few under more natural conditions with day-night cycles. No rhythm was detected under constant light for either lycophytes or ferns, except for two semi-aquatic species of the family Marsileaceae (Marsilea azorica and Regnellidium diphyllum), which showed rhythms in stomatal conductance. Furthermore, these results indicated the presence of a light-driven stomatal control for ferns and lycophytes, with a possible passive fine-tuning through leaf water status adjustments. These findings support previous evidence for the fundamentally different regulation of gas exchange in lycophytes and ferns compared to angiosperms, and they suggest the presence of alternative stomatal regulations in Marsileaceae, an aquatic family already well known for numerous other distinctive physiological traits. Overall, our study provides evidence for heterogeneous circadian regulation across plant lineages, highlighting the importance of broad taxonomic scope in comparative plant physiology studies.
