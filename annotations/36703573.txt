Transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) through chromatin is a dynamic and highly regulated step of eukaryotic gene expression. A combination of transcript elongation factors (TEFs) including modulators of RNAPII activity and histone chaperones facilitate efficient transcription on nucleosomal templates. Biochemical and genetic analyses, primarily performed in Arabidopsis, provided insight into the contribution of TEFs to establish gene expression patterns during plant growth and development. In addition to summarising the role of TEFs in plant gene expression, we emphasise in our review recent advances in the field. Thus, mechanisms are presented how aberrant intragenic transcript initiation is suppressed by repressing transcriptional start sites within coding sequences. We also discuss how transcriptional interference of ongoing transcription with neighbouring genes is prevented. Moreover, it appears that plants make no use of promoter-proximal RNAPII pausing in the way mammals do, but there are nucleosome-defined mechanism(s) that determine the efficiency of mRNA synthesis by RNAPII. Accordingly, a still growing number of processes related to plant growth, development and responses to changing environmental conditions prove to be regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation.
