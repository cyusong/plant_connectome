['16567632', 'Endogenous plant arsenate reductase (ACR) activity converts arsenate to arsenite  in roots, immobilizing arsenic below ground. By blocking this activity, we hoped  to construct plants that would mobilize more arsenate aboveground. We have  identified a single gene in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, ACR2, with moderate  sequence homology to yeast arsenate reductase. Expression of ACR2 cDNA in  Escherichia coli complemented the arsenate-resistant and arsenate-sensitive  phenotypes of various bacterial ars operon mutants. RNA interference reduced ACR2  protein expression in Arabidopsis to as low as 2% of wild-type levels. The  various knockdown plant lines were more sensitive to high concentrations of  arsenate, but not arsenite, than wild type. The knockdown lines accumulated 10-  to 16-fold more arsenic in shoots (350-500 ppm) and retained less arsenic in  roots than wild type, when grown on arsenate medium with <8 ppm arsenic. Reducing  expression of ACR2 homologs in tree, shrub, and grass species should play a vital  role in the phytoremediation of environmental arsenic contamination.', '2006 Apr 4', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0509770102', 'Meagher']
