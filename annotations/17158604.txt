['17158604', "mRNA turnover in eukaryotes involves the removal of m7GDP from the 5' end. This  decapping reaction is mediated by a protein complex well characterized in yeast  and human but not in plants. The function of the decapping complex in the  development of multicellular organisms is also poorly understood. Here, we show  that Arabidopsis thaliana DCP2 can generate from capped mRNAs, m7GDP, and  5'-phosphorylated mRNAs in vitro and that this decapping activity requires an  active Nudix domain. DCP2 interacts in vitro and in vivo with DCP1 and VARICOSE  (VCS), an Arabidopsis homolog of human Hedls/Ge-1. Moreover, the interacting  proteins stimulate DCP2 activity, suggesting that the three proteins operate as a  decapping complex. Consistent with their role in mRNA decay, DCP1, DCP2, and VCS  colocalize in cytoplasmic foci, which are putative Arabidopsis processing bodies.  Compared with the wild type, null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate  capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar  lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins,  swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology. We conclude that mRNA  turnover mediated by the decapping complex is required for postembryonic  development in Arabidopsis.", '2006 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047605', 'Chua']
