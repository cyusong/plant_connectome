['32344669', 'RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in regulating RNA function and  fate. However, the full complement of RBPs has only recently begun to be  uncovered through proteome-wide approaches such as RNA interactome capture (RIC).  RIC has been applied to various cell lines and organisms, including plants,  greatly expanding the repertoire of RBPs. However, several technical challenges  have limited the efficacy of RIC when applied to plant tissues. Here, we report  an improved version of RIC that overcomes the difficulties imposed by leaf  tissue. Using this improved RIC method in Arabidopsis leaves, we identified 717  RBPs, generating a deep RNA-binding proteome for leaf tissues. While 75% of these  RBPs can be linked to RNA biology, the remaining 25% were previously not known to  interact with RNA. Interestingly, we observed that a large number of proteins  related to photosynthesis associate with RNA in vivo, including proteins from the  four major photosynthetic supercomplexes. As has previously been reported for  mammals, a large proportion of leaf RBPs lack known RNA-binding domains,  suggesting unconventional modes of RNA binding. We anticipate that this improved  RIC method will provide critical insights into RNA metabolism in plants,  including how cellular RBPs respond to environmental, physiological and  pathological cues.', '2020 Apr 24', 'Biomolecules', '10.3390/biom10040661', 'ORCID:']
