['26163189', "Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) plays a critical role in regulating numerous aspects  of plant growth and development. While there is much genetic support for  tryptophan-dependent (Trp-D) IAA synthesis pathways, there is little genetic  evidence for tryptophan-independent (Trp-I) IAA synthesis pathways. Using  Arabidopsis, we identified two mutant alleles of ISS1 ( I: ndole S: evere S:  ensitive) that display indole-dependent IAA overproduction phenotypes including  leaf epinasty and adventitious rooting. Stable isotope labeling showed that iss1,  but not WT, uses primarily Trp-I IAA synthesis when grown on indole-supplemented  medium. In contrast, both iss1 and WT use primarily Trp-D IAA synthesis when  grown on unsupplemented medium. iss1 seedlings produce 8-fold higher levels of  IAA when grown on indole and surprisingly have a 174-fold increase in Trp. These  findings indicate that the iss1 mutant's increase in Trp-I IAA synthesis is due  to a loss of Trp catabolism. ISS1 was identified as At1g80360, a predicted  aromatic aminotransferase, and in vitro and in vivo analysis confirmed this  activity. At1g80360 was previously shown to primarily carry out the conversion of  indole-3-pyruvic acid to Trp as an IAA homeostatic mechanism in young seedlings.  Our results suggest that in addition to this activity, in more mature plants ISS1  has a role in Trp catabolism and possibly in the metabolism of other aromatic  amino acids. We postulate that this loss of Trp catabolism impacts the use of  Trp-D and/or Trp-I IAA synthesis pathways.", '2015 Sep', 'Genetics', '10.1534/genetics.115.180356', 'Celenza']
