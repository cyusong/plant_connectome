['16231155', 'There are two independent pathways, the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway and  the plastid nonmevalonate (nonMVA) pathway, to synthesize isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate in plants. Carotenoids and the phytyl side chain of  chlorophylls are isoprenoids derived from the plastid nonMVA pathway. All enzymes  involved in the nonMVA pathway have been identified in Escherichia coli. The E.  coli IspF protein catalyzes a unique cyclization reaction to convert  4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate into  2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate in the nonMVA pathway. We have  characterized an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant, ispF-1, which has a null  mutation in the IspF gene. Homozygous ispF-1 mutants are albino lethal and the  IspF transcripts are undetectable in these plants. Moreover, the ispF-1 mutant  chloroplasts are filled with vesicles instead of thylakoids. Amino acid sequence  alignment reveals that the IspF proteins are highly conserved between plants and  bacteria. Interestingly, expression of the Arabidopsis IspF protein can rescue  the lethal phenotype of an E. coli ispF mutant. These results indicate that the  Arabidopsis IspF may share similar enzymatic mechanisms with the E. coli protein.', '2006 Mar', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-005-0140-9', 'Goodman']
