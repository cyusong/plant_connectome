Plants and microbial pathogens often engage in a fierce war that determines their survival. Host plants have evolved sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to fine-tune defense responses to counter attacks from pathogens, while pathogens often hijack the lipid-derived phytohormone jasmonate to cause hormonal signaling imbalances for efficient infection. This review focuses on the jasmonate-based warfare between host plants and pathogenic intruders, and further discusses approaches to uncouple plant growth and defense tradeoffs in crop breeding.

Pathogens: !hijack! jasmonate
Host plants: !evolve! regulatory mechanisms
Jasmonate: !causes! hormonal signaling imbalances
Plants: !engage in! warfare
Crop breeding: !uncouples! plant growth and defense tradeoffs
