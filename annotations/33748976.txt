Nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth, and the relationship between leaf N content and photosynthesis has been widely studied in different species under steady-state light. However, under natural conditions, the light intensity at the leaf level is always changing, inherently heterogeneous in time and space. Therefore, the effect of leaf N content on photosynthesis under dynamic light conditions needs further study. At present, the effects of leaf N content on leaf non-steady-state photosynthesis have not been reported in canola (Brassica napus L.). To clarify the relationship between leaf N content and the speed of the response leaf gas exchange to variations in light intensity, eight genotypes of canola varying in leaf N content were used to study the temporal response of gas exchange to a step increase in irradiance. We found there were significant differences in non-steady-state photosynthesis, physiological characteristics, and anatomical traits across genotypes (the maximum amplitude was about fivefold), despite the lack of contrast under normal, steady-state photosynthesis. In addition, initial stomatal conductance to water vapor in the darkness and leaf N content per leaf area were negatively correlated with the time required to achieve 50% and 100% of the maximum photosynthetic rate. Contrarily, the time required to reach 50% of the maximum stomatal conductance was positively correlated with the time required to achieve 90% of the maximum photosynthetic rate across genotypes. It is concluded that the genotypes of canola with higher N content per leaf area show a faster induction of photosynthesis to fluctuating light conditions.
