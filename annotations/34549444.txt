Salinity is one of the most important constraints for global cereal production, and breeding for salinity tolerance is a challenge. The limited gene pools, merged information regarding osmotic stress/tissue tolerance mechanism(s) including the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> , over-stressed on the Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion mechanism, and inadequate suitable screening methods further weaken the progress. In the present study, an attempt was made to evaluate the salt tolerance in Triticum aestivum lines using the membership function value (MFV) of certain traits viz., the root and shoot length (RL & SL), shoot and root fresh weight (SFW & RFW), shoot and root dry weight (SDW & RDW) and germination percentage (GP). This study screened 314 wheat lines (278 linked top cross population [LTPs] and 36 normal wheat cultivars) under lab conditions to evaluate their salt tolerance. A positive, and the highest, correlation coefficient was recorded between salt tolerance index (STI) of SL and the STI of RL.0.11 highly salt tolerant (HST), 59 salt tolerant (ST), 100 moderately salt tolerant (MST), 137 salt sensitive (SS), and seven highly salt sensitive (HSS) were observed with a distance of 2.2 between each category. The R-square value was maximum (0.836) between the STI of SFW and the mean MFV, which can be used as the most reliable trait for the salinity tolerance in T. aestivum at the germination phase. Wheat tolerant lines had higher tolerance to salt stress in comparison with the used normal wheat cultivars were detected at the seedling stage.
