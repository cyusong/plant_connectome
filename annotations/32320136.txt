On acid soils, the trivalent aluminium ion (Al<sup>3+</sup> ) predominates and is very rhizotoxic to most plant species. For some native plant species adapted to acid soils including tea (Camellia sinensis), Al<sup>3+</sup> has been regarded as a beneficial mineral element. In this study, we discovered that Al<sup>3+</sup> is actually essential for tea root growth and development in all the tested varieties. Aluminum ion promoted new root growth in five representative tea varieties with dose-dependent responses to Al<sup>3+</sup> availability. In the absence of Al<sup>3+</sup> , the tea plants failed to generate new roots, and the root tips were damaged within 1 d of Al deprivation. Structural analysis of root tips demonstrated that Al was required for root meristem development and activity. In situ morin staining of Al<sup>3+</sup> in roots revealed that Al mainly localized to nuclei in root meristem cells, but then gradually moved to the cytosol when Al<sup>3+</sup> was subsequently withdrawn. This movement of Al<sup>3+</sup> from nuclei to cytosols was accompanied by exacerbated DNA damage, which suggests that the nuclear-targeted Al primarily acts to maintain DNA integrity. Taken together, these results provide novel evidence that Al<sup>3+</sup> is essential for root growth in tea plants through maintenance of DNA integrity in meristematic cells.
