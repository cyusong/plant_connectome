The maize gene <i>Rp1-D21</i> is a mutant form of the gene <i>Rp1-D</i> that confers resistance to common rust. <i>Rp1-D21</i> triggers a spontaneous defense response that occurs in the absence of the pathogen and includes a programed cell death called the hypersensitive response (HR). Eleven plants heterozygous for <i>Rp1-D21,</i> in four different genetic backgrounds, were identified that had chimeric leaves with lesioned sectors showing HR abutting green nonlesioned sectors lacking HR. The <i>Rp1-D21</i> sequence derived from each of the lesioned portions of leaves was unaltered from the expected sequence whereas the <i>Rp1-D21</i> sequences from nine of the nonlesioned sectors displayed various mutations, and we were unable to amplify <i>Rp1-D21</i> from the other two nonlesioned sectors. In every case, the borders between the sectors were sharp, with no transition zone, suggesting that HR and chlorosis associated with <i>Rp1-D21</i> activity was cell autonomous. Expression of defense response marker genes was assessed in the lesioned and nonlesioned sectors as well as in near-isogenic plants lacking and carrying <i>Rp1-D21</i>. Defense gene expression was somewhat elevated in nonlesioned sectors abutting sectors carrying <i>Rp1-D21</i> compared with near-isogenic plants lacking <i>Rp1-D21</i>. This suggests that, whereas the HR itself was cell autonomous, other aspects of the defense response initiated by <i>Rp1-D21</i> were not.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
