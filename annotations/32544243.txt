Spermine (Spm) regulates water balance involved in water channel proteins, aquaporins (AQPs), in plants. An increase in endogenous Spm content via exogenous Spm application significantly improved cell membrane stability, photosynthesis, osmotic adjustment (OA) and water use efficiency (WUE) contributing to enhanced tolerance to water stress in white clover. Spm upregulated TrTIP2-1, TrTIP2-2 and TrPIP2-7 expressions and also increased the abundance of TIP2 and PIP2-7 proteins in white clover under water stress. Spm quickly activated intracellular Ca2+ signaling and Spm-induced TrTIP2-2 and TrPIP2-7 expressions could be blocked by Ca2+ channel blockers and the inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase in leaves of white clover. TrSAMS in relation to Spm biosynthesis was first cloned from white clover and the TrSAMS was located in the nucleus. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing the TrSAMS had significantly higher endogenous Spm content and improved cell membrane stability, photosynthesis, OA, WUE and transcript levels of AtSIP1-1, AtSIP1-2, AtTIP2-1, AtTIP2-2, AtPIP1-2, AtPIP2-1 and AtNIP2-1 than wild type in response to water stress. Current findings indicate that Spm regulates water balance via an enhancement in OA, WUE and water transport related to Ca2+-dependent AQP expression in plants under water stress.
