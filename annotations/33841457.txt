<i>Clematis</i> is a superior perennial ornamental vine known for varied colors and shapes of its flowers. <i>Clematis crassifolia</i> is sensitive to high temperature, whereas <i>Clematis cadmia</i> has a certain temperature adaptability. Here we analyzed the potential regulatory mechanisms of <i>C. crassifolia</i> and <i>C. cadmia</i> in response to heat stress by studying the photosynthesis, antioxidant parameters, amino acids, and gene expression patterns under three temperature treatments. Heat stress caused the fading of leaves; decreased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity; increased 13 kinds of amino acids content; and up-regulated the expression of seven genes, including C194329_G3, C194434_G1, and C188817_g1, etc., in <i>C. crassifolia</i> plants. Under the treatments of heat stress, the leaf tips of <i>C. cadmia</i> were wilted, and the net photosynthetic rate and soluble protein content decreased, with the increase of 12 amino acids content and the expression of c194329_g3, c194434_g1, and c195983_g1. Our results showed that <i>C. crassifolia</i> and <i>C. cadmia</i> had different physiological and molecular response mechanisms to heat stress during the ecological adaptation.
