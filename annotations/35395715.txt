As a vital osmoticum, proline has an important role in enhancing the tolerance of plants to environmental stress. It is unclear whether the application of exogenous proline can improve the tolerance of Brassica juncea to cadmium (Cd). This study investigated the effects of different concentrations of proline (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L) under Cd stress at different times (0 d, 2 d, and 7 d) on the growth and physiology of B. juncea. Treatment with exogenous proline not only increased the content of proline in B. juncea but also alleviated Cd-induced seedling growth inhibition via the maintenance of higher photosynthetic pigment content and cell viability and a decrease in the content of Cd. Moreover, it increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio to reduce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Compared with other concentrations, 60 mg/L of exogenous proline was the most effective at mitigating Cd toxicity in B. juncea. Exogenous proline treatment enhanced the tolerance to Cd via a decrease in Cd accumulation and reestablishment of the redox homeostasis in B. juncea.
