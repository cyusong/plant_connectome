['23273925', 'Histone acetylation is an important posttranslational modification associated  with gene activation. In Arabidopsis, two MYST histone acetyltransferases HAM1  and HAM2 work redundantly to acetylate histone H4 lysine 5 (H4K5ace) in vitro.  The double mutant ham1/ham2 is lethal, which suggests the critical role of HAM1  and HAM2 in development. Here, we used an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) strategy  in Arabidopsis to uncover a novel function of HAM1 and HAM2. The amiRNA-HAM1/2  transgenic plants showed early flowering and reduced fertility. In addition, they  responded normally to photoperiod, gibberellic acid treatment, and vernalization.  The expression of flowering-repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and its homologues,  MADS-box Affecting Flowering genes 3/4 (MAF3/4), were decreased in amiRNA-HAM1/2  lines. HAM1 overexpression caused late flowering and elevated expression of FLC  and MAF3/4. Mutation of FLC almost rescued the late flowering with HAM1  overexpression, which suggests that HAM1 regulation of flowering time depended on  FLC. Global H4 acetylation was decreased in amiRNA-HAM1/2 lines, but increased in  HAM1-OE lines, which further confirmed the acetyltransferase activity of HAM1 in  vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that H4 hyperacetylation and H4K5ace  at FLC and MAF3/4 were less abundant in amiRNA-HAM1/2 lines than the wild type,  but were enriched in HAM1-OE lines. Thus, HAM1 and HAM2 may affect flowering time  by epigenetic modification of FLC and MAF3/4 chromatins at H4K5 acetylation.', '2013 Mar 1', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2012.11.007', 'Xu']
