['15937227', 'The hammerhead ribozyme (HHRz) is an autocatalytic RNA motif found in subviral  plant pathogens and transcripts of repetitive DNA sequences in animals. Here, we  report the discovery and characterization of unique HHRzs encoded in a plant  genome. Two novel sequences were identified on chromosome IV of Arabidopsis  thaliana in a database search, which took into account recently defined  structural requirements. The HHRzs are expressed in several tissues and coexist  in vivo as both cleaved and noncleaved species. In vitro, both sequences cleave  efficiently at physiological Mg(2+) concentrations, indicative of functional  loop-loop interactions. Kinetic analysis of loop nucleotide variants was used to  determine a three-dimensional model of these tertiary interactions. Based on  these results, on the lack of infectivity of hammerhead-carrying viroids in  Arabidopsis, and on extensive sequence comparisons, we propose that the ribozyme  sequences did not invade this plant by horizontal transfer but have evolved  independently to perform a specific, yet unidentified, biological function.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.032730', 'Hammann']
