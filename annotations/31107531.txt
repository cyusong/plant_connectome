Signaling mediated by cell surface receptor kinases is central to the coordination of growth patterns during organogenesis. Receptor kinase signaling is in part controlled through endocytosis and subcellular distribution of the respective receptor kinase. For the majority of plant cell surface receptors, the underlying trafficking mechanisms are not characterized. In Arabidopsis, tissue morphogenesis requires the atypical receptor kinase STRUBBELIG (SUB). Here, we studied the endocytic mechanism of SUB. Our data revealed that a functional SUB-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion is ubiquitinated in vivo. We further showed that plasma membrane-bound SUB:EGFP becomes internalized in a clathrin-dependent fashion. We also found that SUB:EGFP associates with the trans-Golgi network and accumulates in multivesicular bodies and the vacuole. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that SUB:EGFP and clathrin are present within the same protein complex. Our genetic analysis showed that SUB and CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN (CHC) 2 regulate root hair patterning. By contrast, genetic reduction of CHC activity ameliorates the floral defects of sub mutants. Taken together, the data indicate that SUB undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis, that this process does not rely on stimulation of SUB signaling by an exogenous agent, and that SUB genetically interacts with clathrin-dependent pathways in a tissue-specific manner.
