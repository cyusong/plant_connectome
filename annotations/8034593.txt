['8034593', 'Plastocyanin and the 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (OE33) are two  of several thylakoid lumen-located proteins that are made in the cytosol,  imported into chloroplasts, and subsequently transported into thylakoids.  Recently, competition studies showed that there are two pathways for protein  transport into the thylakoid lumen and that plastocyanin and OE33 are on the same  pathway (Cline, K., Henry, R., Li, C., and Yuan, J. (1993) EMBO J. 12,  4105-4114). Our expectation is that transport requirements reflect the steps of  the process and that proteins on the same pathway share similar requirements.  Unfortunately, the transport requirements for plastocyanin and OE33 are not well  established. Here, we investigated transport in a reconstituted system with  isolated thylakoids. Efficient transport of OE33 and plastocyanin was only  obtained when stromal extract was included in the assay. Heat or protease  treatment of stromal extract eliminated its ability to stimulate transport.  Transport was abolished by treatments designed to deplete ATP or to prevent its  formation and was greatly reduced in the presence of ionophores that dissipate  the trans-thylakoidal proton gradient. These results show that transport of OE33  and plastocyanin requires ATP and is stimulated by stromal protein(s) and the  trans-thylakoidal proton gradient. Taken together, these and previous results  suggest that there are two mechanistically distinct pathways for protein  transport into the thylakoid lumen.', '1994 Jul 15', 'J Biol Chem', 'S0021-9258(17)32331-1', 'Cline']
