Crop varieties with a high yield are most desirable in the present context of the ever-growing human population. Mostly, the yield traits are governed by a complex of numerous molecular and genetic facets modulated by various quantitative trait loci (QTLs). With the identification and molecular characterizations of yield-associated QTLs over recent years, the central role of phytohormones in regulating plant yield is becoming more apparent. Most often, different groups of phytohormones work in close association to orchestrate yield attributes. Understanding this cross talk would thus provide new venues for phytohormone pyramiding by editing a single gene or QTL(s) for yield improvement. Here, we review a few important findings to integrate the knowledge on the roles of auxin, brassinosteroid and cytokinin and how a single gene or a QTL could govern cross talk among multiple phytohormones to determine the yield traits.

QTL: !governs! yield traits
phytohormones: !orchestrate! yield attributes
auxin: !works in association with! brassinosteroid and cytokinin
single gene/QTL: !edits! phytohormone pyramiding
single gene/QTL: !regulates! cross talk among multiple phytohormones
