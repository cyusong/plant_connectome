Phytopathogen <i>Dickeya oryzae</i> is a causal agent of rice foot rot disease and the pathogen has an array of virulence factors, such as phytotoxin zeamines, plant cell wall degrading enzymes, cell motility, and biofilms, collectively contributing to the bacterial pathogenesis. In this study, through deletion analysis of predicted regulatory genes in <i>D. oryzae</i> EC1, we identified a two-component system associated with the regulation of bacterial virulence. The two-component system contains a histidine kinase ArcB and a response regulator ArcA, and deletion of their coding genes resulted in changed phenotypes in cell motility, biofilm formation, and bacterial virulence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that ArcA bound to the promoters of the <i>bcs</i> operon and <i>bssS</i>, which respectively encode enzymes for the synthesis of celluloses and a biofilm formation regulatory protein. ArcA could also bind to the promoters of three virulence associated transcriptional regulatory genes, i.e., <i>fis</i>, <i>slyA</i> and <i>ohrR</i>. Surprisingly, although these three regulators were shown to modulate the production of cell wall degrading enzymes and zeamines, deletion of <i>arcB</i> and <i>arcA</i> did not seem to affect these phenotypes. Taken together, the findings from this study unveiled a new two-component system associated with the bacterial pathogenesis, which contributes to the virulence of <i>D. oryzae</i> mainly through its action on bacterial motility and biofilm formation.
