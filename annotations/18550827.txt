['18550827', 'SKP1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin-ligases regulate numerous aspects of  eukaryotic growth and development. Cullin-Associated and Neddylation-Dissociated  (CAND1) modulates SCF function through its interactions with the CUL1 subunit.  Although biochemical studies with human CAND1 suggested that CAND1 plays a  negative regulatory role by sequestering CUL1 and preventing SCF complex  assembly, genetic studies in Arabidopsis have shown that cand1 mutants exhibit  reduced SCF activity, demonstrating that CAND1 is required for optimal SCF  function in vivo. Together, these genetic and biochemical studies have suggested  a model of CAND1-mediated cycles of SCF complex assembly and disassembly. Here,  using the SCF(TIR1) complex of the Arabidopsis auxin response pathway, we test  the SCF cycling model with Arabidopsis mutant derivatives of CAND1 and CUL1 that  have opposing effects on the CAND1-CUL1 interaction. We find that the disruption  of the CAND1-CUL1 interaction results in an increased abundance of assembled  SCF(TIR1) complex. In contrast, stabilization of the CAND1-CUL1 interaction  diminishes SCF(TIR1) complex abundance. The fact that both decreased and  increased CAND1-CUL1 interactions result in reduced SCF(TIR1) activity in vivo  strongly supports the hypothesis that CAND1-mediated cycling is required for  optimal SCF function.', '2008 Jun 17', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0804144105', 'Gray']
