['10500191', 'The yeast and human SKP1 genes regulate the mitotic cell cycle but are not yet  known to be required for meiosis. Nine Arabidopsis SKP1 homologues have been  uncovered and are named ASK1 through ASK9. Here, we report the isolation and  characterization of a male sterile Arabidopsis mutant and show that the mutant  defect was caused by a Ds transposon insertion into the ASK1 gene. In the ask1-1  mutant, abnormal microspores exhibit a range of sizes. Furthermore, during mutant  male meiosis, although homologous chromosome pairing appeared normal at metaphase  I, chromosome segregation at anaphase I is unequal, and some chromosomes are  abnormally extended. Therefore, in ask1-1, at least some homologues remain  associated after metaphase I. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy  indicates that the mutant spindle morphology at both metaphase I and early  anaphase I is normal; thus, the abnormal chromosome segregation is not likely  caused by a spindle defect. Because the yeast Skp1p is required for targeting  specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, we propose that ASK1  controls homologue separation by degrading or otherwise removing a protein that  is required directly or indirectly for homologue association before anaphase I.', '1999 Sep 28', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.96.20.11416', 'Ma']
