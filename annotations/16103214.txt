['16103214', 'Land plants evolved xylem vessels to conduct water and nutrients, and to support  the plant. Microarray analysis with a newly established Arabidopsis in vitro  xylem vessel element formation system and promoter analysis revealed the possible  involvement of some plant-specific NAC-domain transcription factors in xylem  formation. VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN6 (VND6) and VND7 can induce  transdifferentiation of various cells into metaxylem- and protoxylem-like vessel  elements, respectively, in Arabidopsis and poplar. A dominant repression of VND6  and VND7 specifically inhibits metaxylem and protoxylem vessel formation in  roots, respectively. These findings suggest that these genes are transcription  switches for plant metaxylem and protoxylem vessel formation.', '2005 Aug 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1331305', 'Demura']
