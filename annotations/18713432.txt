The transcription factor WRKY70 was previously reported to be a common component in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonate (JA) mediated signal pathways in Arabidopsis. Here, we present that the inactivation of the WRKY70 gene in wrky70-1 mutant does not alter the responses of both JA and SA, and that wrky70 mutation is unable to restore the coi1 mutant in JA responses. However, overexpression of WRKY70 reduces JA responses such as expression of JA-induced genes and JA-inhibitory root growth, and activates expression of SA-inducible PR1. These data indicate that the WRKY70 is important but not indispensable for JA and SA signaling, and that other regulators may display the redundant role with WRKY70 in modulation of JA and SA responses in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we showed that JA inhibits expression of WRKY70 and PR1 by both COI1-dependent and COI1-independent pathways.
