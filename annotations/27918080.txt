A number of genes that confer resistance to coffee leaf rust (S<sub>H</sub> 1-S<sub>H</sub> 9) have been identified within the genus Coffea, but despite many years of research on this pathosystem, the complementary avirulence genes of Hemileia vastatrix have not been reported. After identification of H. vastatrix effector candidate genes (HvECs) expressed at different stages of its lifecycle, we established an assay to characterize HvEC proteins by delivering them into coffee cells via the type-three secretion system (T3SS) of Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae (Psgc). Employing a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase assay, we demonstrate that Psgc recognizes a heterologous P. syringae T3SS secretion signal which enables us to translocate HvECs into the cytoplasm of coffee cells. Using this Psgc-adapted effector detector vector (EDV) system, we found that HvEC-016 suppresses the growth of Psgc on coffee genotypes with the S<sub>H</sub> 1 resistance gene. Suppression of bacterial blight symptoms in S<sub>H</sub> 1 plants was associated with reduced bacterial multiplication. By contrast, HvEC-016 enhanced bacterial multiplication in S<sub>H</sub> 1-lacking plants. Our findings suggest that HvEC-016 may be recognized by the plant immune system in a S<sub>H</sub> 1-dependent manner. Thus, our experimental approach is an effective tool for the characterization of effector/avirulence proteins of this important pathogen.

S<sub>H</sub> 1: !recognized by! plant immune system
Psgc: !delivers! HvECs into coffee cells
Psgc: !recognizes! heterologous P. syringae T3SS secretion signal
