Huanglongbing (HLB), the most destructive citrus disease, is associated with unculturable, phloem-limited <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter species, mainly <i>Ca.</i> L. asiaticus (Las). Las is transmitted naturally by the insect <i>Diaphorina citri</i>. In a previous study, we determined that the Oceanian citrus relatives <i>Eremocitrus glauca</i>, <i>Microcitrus warburgiana</i>, <i>Microcitrus papuana</i>, and <i>Microcitrus australis</i> and three hybrids among them and <i>Citrus</i> were full-resistant to Las. After 2 years of evaluations, leaves of those seven genotypes remained Las-free even with their susceptible rootstock being infected. However, Las was detected in their stem bark above the scion-rootstock graft union. Aiming to gain an understanding of the full-resistance phenotype, new experiments were carried out with the challenge-inoculated Oceanian citrus genotypes through which we evaluated: (1) Las acquisition by <i>D. citri</i> fed onto them; (2) Las infection in sweet orange plants grafted with bark or budwood from them; (3) Las infection in sweet orange plants top-grafted onto them; (4) Las infection in new shoots from rooted plants of them; and (5) Las infection in new shoots of them after drastic back-pruning. Overall, results showed that insects that fed on plants from the Oceanian citrus genotypes, their canopies, new flushes, and leaves from rooted cuttings evaluated remained quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-negative. Moreover, their budwood pieces were unable to infect sweet orange through grafting. Furthermore, sweet orange control leaves resulted infected when insects fed onto them and graft-receptor susceptible plants. Genomic and morphological analysis of the Oceanian genotypes corroborated that <i>E. glauca</i> and <i>M. warburgiana</i> are pure species while our <i>M. australis</i> accession is an <i>M. australis</i> × <i>M. inodora</i> hybrid and <i>M. papuana is</i> probably a <i>M. papuana</i> × <i>M. warburgiana</i> hybrid. <i>E. glauca</i> × <i>C. sinensis</i> hybrid was found coming from a cross between <i>E. glauca</i> and mandarin or tangor. <i>Eremocitrus</i> × <i>Microcitrus</i> hybrid is a complex admixture of <i>M. australasica</i>, <i>M. australis</i>, and <i>E. glauca</i> while the last hybrid is an <i>M. australasica</i> × <i>M. australis</i> admixture. Confirmation of consistent full resistance in these genotypes with proper validation of their genomic parentages is essential to map properly genomic regions for breeding programs aimed to generate new <i>Citrus</i>-like cultivars yielding immunity to HLB.
