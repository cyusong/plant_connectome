Adventitious roots (ARs) are produced from non-root tissues in response to different environmental signals, such as abiotic stresses, or after wounding, in a complex developmental process that requires hormonal crosstalk. Here, we characterized AR formation in young seedlings of Solanum lycopersicum cv. 'Micro-Tom' after whole root excision by means of physiological, genetic and molecular approaches. We found that a regulated basipetal auxin transport from the shoot and local auxin biosynthesis triggered by wounding are both required for the re-establishment of internal auxin gradients within the vasculature. This promotes cell proliferation at the distal cambium near the wound in well-defined positions of the basal hypocotyl and during a narrow developmental window. In addition, a pre-established pattern of differential auxin responses along the apical-basal axis of the hypocotyl and an as of yet unknown cell-autonomous inhibitory pathway contribute to the temporal and spatial patterning of the newly formed ARs on isolated hypocotyl explants. Our work provides an experimental outline for the dissection of wound-induced AR formation in tomato, a species that is suitable for molecular identification of gene regulatory networks via forward and reverse genetics approaches.
