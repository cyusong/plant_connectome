Plants show an unparalleled regenerative capacity, allowing them to survive severe stress conditions, such as injury, herbivory attack, and harsh weather conditions. This potential not only replenishes tissues and restores damaged organs but can also give rise to whole plant bodies. Despite the intertwined nature of development and regeneration, common upstream cues and signaling mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to being activators of regeneration, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 114 (ERF114) and ERF115 govern developmental growth in the absence of wounding or injury. Increased ERF114 and ERF115 activity enhances auxin sensitivity, which is correlated with enhanced xylem maturation and lateral root formation, whereas their knockout results in a decrease in lateral roots. Moreover, we provide evidence that mechanical cues contribute to ERF114 and ERF115 expression in correlation with BZR1-mediated brassinosteroid signaling under both regenerative and developmental conditions. Antagonistically, cell wall integrity surveillance via mechanosensory FERONIA signaling suppresses their expression under both conditions. Taken together, our data suggest a molecular framework in which cell wall signals and mechanical strains regulate organ development and regenerative responses via ERF114- and ERF115-mediated auxin signaling.
