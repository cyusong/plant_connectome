Sieve tubes are comprised of sieve elements, enucleated cells that are incapable of RNA and protein synthesis. The proteins in sieve elements are supplied from the neighboring companion cells through plasmodesmata. In rice plants, it was unclear whether or not all proteins produced in companion cells had the same distribution pattern in the sieve element-companion cell complex. In this study, the distribution pattern of four proteins, beta-glucuronidase (GUS), green fluorescent protein (GFP), thioredoxin h (TRXh) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were analyzed. The foreign proteins GUS and GFP were expressed in transgenic rice plants under the control of the TRXh gene promoter (PTRXh), a companion cell-specific promoter. Analysis of leaf cross-sections of PTRXh-GUS and PTRXh-GFP plants indicated high accumulation of GUS and GFP, respectively, in companion cells rather than in sieve elements. GUS and GFP were also detected in phloem sap collected from leaf sheaths of the transgenic rice plants, suggesting these proteins could enter sieve elements. Relative amounts of GFP and endogenous phloem proteins, TRXh and GST, in phloem sap and total leaf extracts were compared. Compared to TRXh and GST, GFP content was higher in total leaf extracts, but lower in phloem sap, suggesting that GFP accumulated mainly in companion cells rather than in sieve elements. On the other hand, TRXh and GST appeared to accumulate in sieve elements rather than in companion cells. These results indicate the evidence for differential distribution of proteins between sieve elements and companion cells in rice plants.
