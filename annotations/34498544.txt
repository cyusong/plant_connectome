WRKYs represent an important family of transcription factors that are widely involved in plant development, defense regulation and stress response. Transgenic rice that constitutively expressed <i>ZmWRKY114</i> had shorter plant height and showed less sensitivity to gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>). Further investigation proved that transgenic rice accumulated lower levels of bioactive GAs than that in wild-type plants. Application of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> fully rescued the semi-dwarf phenotype of <i>ZmWRKY114</i> transgenic plants. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses indicated that the expression of <i>OsGA2ox4</i>, encoding the repressor of GA biosynthesis, was markedly increased. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that ZmWRKY114 directly binds to a W-box motif in the <i>OsGA2ox4</i> promoter. Taken together, these results confirm that <i>ZmWRKY114</i> is a GA-responsive gene and is participated in the regulation of plant height in rice.
