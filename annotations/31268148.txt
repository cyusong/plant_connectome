ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE4 (RUS4) encodes a protein with no known function that contains a conserved Domain of Unknown Function 647 (DUF647). The DUF647-containing proteins RUS1 and RUS2 have previously been associated with root UV-B-sensing pathway that plays a major role in Arabidopsis early seedling morphogenesis and development. Here, we show that RUS4 knockdown Arabidopsis plants, referred to as amiR-RUS4, were severely reduced in male fertility with indehiscent anthers. Light microscopy of anther sections revealed a significantly reduced secondary wall thickening in the endothecium of amiR-RUS4 anthers. We further show that the transcript abundance of the NAC domain genes NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (NST1) and NST2, which have been shown to regulate the secondary cell wall thickenings in the anther endothecium, were dramatically reduced in the amiR-RUS4 floral buds. Expression of the secondary cell wall-associated MYB transcription factor genes MYB103 and MYB85 were also strongly reduced in floral buds of the amiR-RUS4 plants. Overexpression of RUS4 led to increased secondary thickening in the endothecium. However, the rus4-2 mutant exhibited no obvious phenotype. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that the RUS4 promoter was highly active in the anthers, supporting its role in anther development. Taken together, these results suggest that RUS4, probably functions redundantly with other genes, may play an important role in the secondary thickening formation in the anther endothecium by indirectly affecting the expression of secondary cell wall biosynthetic genes.
