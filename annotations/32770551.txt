It is known that nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) transcription factors play an important role in flowering time regulation and hormone response (ABA, GA) in angiosperms, but, little known in conifers. Moreover, the NF-Y gene family has not been comprehensively reported in conifers. Here, we identified 9 NF-YA, 9 NF-YB and 10 NF-YC genes in Pinus tabuliformis using Arabidopsis NF-Y protein sequences as queries. Additionally, by comparing conserved regions and phylogenetic relationships of the PtNF-Ys, we found that NF-Ys were both conserved and altered during evolution. PtTFL2, PtCO, PtNF-YC1 and PtNF-YC4 were exploited by expression profile in male cone development and correlation analysis. Furthermore, NF-YC1/4 and DPL (DELLA protein of P. tabuliformis) were interacted by yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays, which suggested that NF-YC1/4 may be involved in gibberellins signaling pathway. Moreover, the multiple types of phytohormones-responsive cis-elements (ABA, JA, IAA, SA) have been found, and gene expression profile analysis showed that many NF-Y genes responded positively to SA and as opposed to IAA and JA, revealing the potential role of NF-Ys in conifers resistance. In summary, this study provided the basis for further investigation of the function of NF-Y genes in conifers.
