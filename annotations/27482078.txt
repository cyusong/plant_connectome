Trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P), the intermediate of trehalose biosynthesis, is an essential signal metabolite in plants, linking growth and development to carbon status. The Suc-Tre6P nexus model postulates that Tre6P is both a signal and negative feedback regulator of Suc levels, forming part of a mechanism to maintain Suc levels within an optimal range and functionally comparable to the insulin-glucagon system for regulating blood Glc levels in animals. The target range and sensitivity of the Tre6P-Suc feedback control circuit can be adjusted according to the cell type, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. In source leaves, Tre6P modulates Suc levels by affecting Suc synthesis, whereas in sink organs it regulates Suc consumption. In illuminated leaves, Tre6P influences the partitioning of photoassimilates between Suc, organic acids, and amino acids via posttranslational regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and nitrate reductase. At night, Tre6P regulates the remobilization of leaf starch reserves to Suc, potentially linking starch turnover in source leaves to carbon demand from developing sink organs. Use of Suc for growth in developing tissues is strongly influenced by the antagonistic activities of two protein kinases: SUC-NON-FERMENTING-1-RELATED KINASE1 (SnRK1) and TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR). The relationship between Tre6P and SnRK1 in developing tissues is complex and not yet fully resolved, involving both direct and indirect mechanisms, and positive and negative effects. No direct connection between Tre6P and TOR has yet been described. The roles of Tre6P in abiotic stress tolerance and stomatal regulation are also discussed.
