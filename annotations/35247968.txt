Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) has been proposed to exert anti-oxidative effect under many environmental stresses; however, how it influences oxidative stress remains largely unclear. Here, we assessed the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on oxidative stress responses such as salicylic acid (SA)-dependent cell death, which triggered by increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> availability in Arabidopsis thaliana catalase-deficient mutants cat2 displaying around 20% wild-type catalase activity. H<sub>2</sub>S generation and its producing enzyme <sub>L</sub>-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD/DES) were found to transient increase in response to intracellular oxidative stress. Although introducing the mutation of des1, an important LCD, into the cat2 background produced little effect, H<sub>2</sub>S fumigation not only rescued the cell death phenotype of cat2 plant, but also attenuated SA accumulation and oxidation of the glutathione pool. Unexpectedly, the activities of major components of ascorbate-glutathione pathway were less affected by the presence of H<sub>2</sub>S treatment, but decreased glycolate oxidase (GOX) in combination with accumulation of glycolate implied H<sub>2</sub>S treatment impacts the cellular redox homeostasis by repressing the GOX-catalyzed reaction likely via altering the major GOX transcript levels. Our findings reveal a link between H<sub>2</sub>S and peroxisomal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production that has implications for the understanding of the multifaceted roles of H<sub>2</sub>S in the regulation of oxidative stress responses.
