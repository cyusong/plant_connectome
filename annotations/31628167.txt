['31628167', 'Flowers are essential but vulnerable plant organs, exposed to pollinators and  florivores; however, flower chemical defenses are rarely investigated. We show  here that two clustered terpene synthase and cytochrome P450 encoding genes  (TPS11 and CYP706A3) on chromosome 5 of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) are  tightly coexpressed in floral tissues, upon anthesis and during floral bud  development. TPS11 was previously reported to generate a blend of sesquiterpenes.  By heterologous coexpression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 in yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) and Nicotiana benthamiana, we demonstrate that CYP706A3 is active on  TPS11 products and also further oxidizes its own primary oxidation products.  Analysis of headspace and soluble metabolites in cyp706a3 and 35S:CYP706A3  mutants indicate that CYP706A3-mediated metabolism largely suppresses  sesquiterpene and most monoterpene emissions from opening flowers, and generates  terpene oxides that are retained in floral tissues. In flower buds, the combined  expression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 also suppresses volatile emissions and generates  soluble sesquiterpene oxides. Florivory assays with the Brassicaceae specialist  Plutella xylostella demonstrate that insect larvae avoid feeding on buds  expressing CYP706A3 and accumulating terpene oxides. Composition of the floral  microbiome appears also to be modulated by CYP706A3 expression. TPS11 and  CYP706A3 simultaneously evolved within Brassicaceae and form the most versatile  functional gene cluster described in higher plants so  far.plantcell;31/12/2947/FX1F1fx1.', '2019 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00320', 'ORCID:']
