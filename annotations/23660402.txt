['23660402', 'We have characterized the function of a plant R2R3-MYB transcription factor,  Arabidopsis thaliana MYB20 (AtMYB20). Transgenic plants overexpressing AtMYB20  (AtMYB20-OX) enhanced salt stress tolerance while repression lines (AtMYB20-SRDX)  were more vulnerable to NaCl than wild-type plants. Following NaCl treatment, the  expressions of ABI1, ABI2 and AtPP2CA, which encode type 2C serine/threonine  protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) that act as negative regulators in abscisic acid  (ABA) signaling, were suppressed in AtMYB20-OX but induced in AtMYB20-SRDX. The  electrophoretic mobility shift assay results revealed that AtMYB20 binds to the  promoter regions containing the MYB recognition sequence (TAACTG) and an ACGT  core element of ABI1 and AtPP2CA. These findings suggest that AtMYB20  down-regulates the expression of PP2Cs, the negative regulator of ABA signaling,  and enhances salt tolerance.', '2013 Jun 19', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2013.04.028', 'Shin']
