Salt stress, causing serious loss on crop productions, is one of the most important environmental stresses throughout the world. The aim of this study is to select salt-tolerant traditional rice resources collected from Lei-Qiong area of South China and investigate their physiological performances and biochemical regulations during salt stress response, together with two well-known international varieties, Nona Bokra (salt-tolerant sample) and IR29 (salt-sensitive sample). After comprehensive analyses, we discovered that two Lei-Qiong traditional salt-tolerant rice samples showed less growth inhibition by salt stress during both germination and seedling stage, in comparison with other rice samples. Moreover, there were less chlorosis symptoms in these two kinds of salt tolerant rice under salt stress, corresponding to their better water-holding capacity. We measured malondialdehyde and proline contents, and activities of CAT and POD of seedlings treated with 100 mM NaCl for 5 dand 10 d, respectively. Interestingly, less cellular membrane damage and stronger antioxidant enzyme system were found in the two Lei-Qiong rice samples. Our study suggests that traditional rice landrace growing onshore of Lei-Qiong area in China possesses good salt-tolerant capacity, which could be attributed to their efficient antioxidant enzyme system.
