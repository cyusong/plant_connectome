Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that regulates a diverse range of cellular and molecular processes during development and in response to osmotic stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three Suc nonfermenting-1-related protein kinase2s (SnRK2s), SRK2D, SRK2E, and SRK2I, are key positive regulators involved in ABA signaling whose substrates have been well studied. Besides reduced drought-stress tolerance, the <i>srk2d srk2e srk2i</i> mutant shows abnormal growth phenotypes, such as an increased number of leaves, under nonstress conditions. However, it remains unclear whether, and if so how, SnRK2-mediated ABA signaling regulates growth and development. Here, we show that the primary metabolite profile of <i>srk2d srk2e srk2i</i> grown under nonstress conditions was considerably different from that of wild-type plants. The metabolic changes observed in the <i>srk2d srk2e srk2i</i> were similar to those in an ABA-biosynthesis mutant, <i>aba2-1</i>, and both mutants showed a higher leaf emergence rate than wild type. Consistent with the increased amounts of citrate, isotope-labeling experiments revealed that respiration through the tricarboxylic acid cycle was enhanced in <i>srk2d srk2e srk2i</i> These results, together with transcriptome data, indicate that the SnRK2s involved in ABA signaling modulate metabolism and leaf growth under nonstress conditions by fine-tuning flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
