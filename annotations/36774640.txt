Small secreted proteins play an important role in plant development, as well as in reactions to changes in the environment. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, they are predominantly members of highly expanded families, such as the pathogenesis-related (PR) 1-like protein family, whose most studied member PR1 is involved in plant defense responses by a so far unknown mechanism, or Clavata3/Endosperm Surrounding Region (CLE) protein family, whose members' functions in the development are well described. Our survey of the existing literature for the two families showed a lack of details on their localization, trafficking, and exocytosis. Therefore, in order to uncover the modes of their secretion, we tested the hypothesis that a direct link between the secreted cargoes and the secretion regulators such as Rab GTPases, SNAREs, and exocyst subunits could be established using <i>in silico</i> co-expression and clustering approaches. We employed several independent techniques to uncover that only weak co-expression links could be found for limited numbers of secreted cargoes and regulators. We propose that there might be particular spatio-temporal requirements for PR1 and CLE proteins to be synthesized and secreted, and efforts to experimentally cover these discrepancies should be invested along with functional studies.
