Plant responses to abiotic stress include various modifications in amino acid metabolism. By using a hydroponic culture system, we systematically investigate modification in amino acid profiles and the proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves during initial recovery from low water potential or high salinity. Both treatments elicited oxidative stress leading to a biphasic stress response during recovery. Degradation of highly abundant proteins such as subunits of photosystems and ribosomes contributed to an accumulation of free amino acids. Catabolic pathways for several low abundant amino acids were induced indicating their usage as an alternative respiratory substrate to compensate for the decreased photosynthesis. Our results demonstrate that rapid detoxification of potentially detrimental amino acids such as Lys is a priority during the initial stress recovery period. The content of Pro, which acts as a compatible osmolyte during stress, was adjusted by balancing its synthesis and catabolism both of which were induced both during and after stress treatments. The production of amino acid derived secondary metabolites was up-regulated specifically during the recovery period, and our dataset also indicates increased synthesis rates of the precursor amino acids. Overall, our results support a tight relationship between amino acid metabolism and stress responses.
