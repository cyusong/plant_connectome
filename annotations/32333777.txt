As sessile organisms, plants face versatile environmental challenges and require proper responses at multiple levels for survival. Epigenetic modification of DNA and histones is a conserved gene-regulatory mechanism and plays critical roles in diverse aspects of biological processes, ranging from genome defense and imprinting to development and physiology. In recent years, emerging studies have revealed the interplay between signaling transduction pathways, epigenetic modifications, and chromatin cascades. Specifically, histone acetylation and deacetylation dictate plant responses to environmental cues by modulating chromatin dynamics to regulate downstream gene expression as signaling outputs. In this review, we summarize current understandings of the link between plant signaling pathways and epigenetic modifications with a focus on histone acetylation and deacetylation.

Signaling pathways: !modulate! chromatin dynamics
Histone acetylation/deacetylation: !dictate! plant responses
Signaling pathways: !regulate! downstream gene expression
Epigenetic modifications: !play critical roles in! diverse biological processes
