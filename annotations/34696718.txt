Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is one of the most important economic crops and is susceptible to various abiotic stresses. The valine-glutamine (VQ) motif-containing proteins are plant-specific proteins with a conserved "FxxhVQxhTG" amino acid sequence that regulates plant growth and development. However, little is known about the function of VQ proteins in cucumber. In this study, a total of 32 CsVQ proteins from cucumber were confirmed and characterized using comprehensive genome-wide analysis, and they all contain a conserved motif with 10 variations. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these CsVQ proteins were classified into nine groups by comparing the CsVQ proteins with those of Arabidopsis thaliana, melon and rice. CsVQ genes were distributed on seven chromosomes. Most of these genes were predicted to be localized in the nucleus. In addition, cis-elements in response to different stresses and hormones were observed in the promoters of the CsVQ genes. A network of CsVQ proteins interacting with WRKY transcription factors (CsWRKYs) was proposed. Moreover, the transcripts of CsVQ gene were spatio-temporal specific and were induced by abiotic adversities. CsVQ4, CsVQ6, CsVQ16-2, CsVQ19, CsVQ24, CsVQ30, CsVQ32, CsVQ33, and CsVQ34 were expressed in the range of organs and tissues at higher levels and could respond to multiple hormones and different stresses, indicating that these genes were involved in the response to stimuli. Together, our results reveal novel VQ resistance gene resources, and provide critical information on CsVQ genes and their encoded proteins, which supplies important genetic basis for VQ resistance breeding of cucumber plants.
