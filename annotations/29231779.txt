The nomenclature of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) takes different formats composed of symbols, prefixes, suffixes, or descriptive acronyms of their functions that sometimes lead to confusion and make the indexed information redundant and inconsistent. To avoid such redundancy and reduce confusion, a curation of the terminology of MAP kinase families, and that of other protein families that present similar nomenclature issues, is required. Some arguable suggestions are presented here toward this goal.

Gene: !affects! Process 
Gene: !synthesizes! Protein 
Gene: !reduces! Confusion 
Gene: !cures! Nomenclature
