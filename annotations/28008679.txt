The inward-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel AKT1 constitutes an important pathway for K<sup>+</sup> acquisition in plant roots. In glycophytes, excessive accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> is accompanied by K<sup>+</sup> deficiency under salt stress. However, in the succulent xerophyte Zygophyllum xanthoxylum, which exhibits excellent adaptability to adverse environments, K<sup>+</sup> concentration remains at a relatively constant level despite increased levels of Na<sup>+</sup> under salinity and drought conditions. In this study, the contribution of ZxAKT1 to maintaining K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in Z.맞anthoxylum was investigated. Expression of ZxAKT1 rescued the K<sup>+</sup> -uptake-defective phenotype of yeast strain CY162, suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast strain G19, and complemented the low-K<sup>+</sup> -sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis akt1 mutant, indicating that ZxAKT1 functions as an inward-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel. ZxAKT1 was predominantly expressed in roots, and was induced under high concentrations of either KCl or NaCl. By using RNA interference technique, we found that ZxAKT1-silenced plants exhibited stunted growth compared to wild-type Z.맞anthoxylum. Further experiments showed that ZxAKT1-silenced plants exhibited a significant decline in net uptake of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> , resulting in decreased concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> , as compared to wild-type Z.맞anthoxylum grown under 50맔m NaCl. Compared with wild-type, the expression levels of genes encoding several transporters/channels related to K<sup>+</sup> /Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, including ZxSKOR, ZxNHX, ZxSOS1 and ZxHKT1;1, were reduced in various tissues of a ZxAKT1-silenced line. These findings suggest that ZxAKT1 not only plays a crucial role in K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also functions in modulating Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and transport systems in Z.맞anthoxylum, thereby affecting its normal growth.
