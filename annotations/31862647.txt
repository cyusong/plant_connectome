Contamination with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has become a worldwide concern owing to their the toxicity to humans and wildlife. Pumpkin, cucumber, and squash (Cucurbitaceae) accumulate POPs in their shoots in concentrations higher than those in non-cucurbits; to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of this accumulation, POP transporters were analyzed in the xylem sap of cucurbits and non-cucurbits. The 17-kDa xylem sap proteins detected in all cucurbits but not in non-cucurbits readily bound polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in all tested cucurbits, except in cucumber and loofah, and to dieldrin in all tested cucurbits. Ten genes encoding major latex-like proteins (MLPs) responsible for the accumulation of PCBs in zucchini plants were cloned from cucurbits. Phylogenetic analysis using MLP sequences identified two separate clades, one containing Cucurbitaceae MLPs and the other containing those of non-cucurbit members. Recombinant MLPs bound PCB and dieldrin. Western blotting with anti-MLP antibodies identified translocatable and non-translocatable MLPs between root and stem xylem vessels. Translocation of MLPs from the root to stem xylem vessels and POP-binding ability of MLPs are important for selective accumulation of MLPs in cucurbits. This study provides basic knowledge about phytoremediation through overexpression of MLP genes and for breeding cucurbits that accumulate less contaminants.
