GCR2 was recently proposed to represent a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for the plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA). We and others provided evidence that GCR2 is unlikely to be a bona fide GPCR because it is not clearly predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains, a structural hallmark for classical GPCRs. Instead, GCR2 shows significant sequence similarity to homologs of bacterial lanthionine synthetase component C (LanC). Here, we provide additional analysis of GCR2 and LanC-like (LANCL) proteins in plants, and propose that GCR2 is a new member of the eukaryotic LANCL protein family.
