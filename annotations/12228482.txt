['12228482', 'Wild-type Arabidopsis leaf epicuticular wax (EW) occurs as a smooth layer over  the epidermal surface, whereas stem EW has a crystalline microstructure.  Wild-type EW load was more than 10-fold lower on leaves than on stems. Compared  with the EW on wild-type stems, EW on wild-type leaves had a much higher  proportion of their total EW load in the form of alkanes and 1-alcohols; a large  reduction in secondary alcohols, ketones, and esters; and a chain-length  distribution for major EW classes that was skewed toward longer lengths. The  eceriferum (cer) mutations often differentially affected leaf and stem EW  chemical compositions. For example, the cer2 mutant EW phenotype was expressed on  the stem but not on the leaf. Compared to wild type, the amount of primary  alcohols on cer9 mutants was reduced on leaves but elevated on stems, whereas an  opposite differential effect for primary alcohols was observed on cer16 leaves  and stems. Putative functions for CER gene products are discussed. The CER4 and  CER6 gene products may be involved in fatty aldehyde reduction and C26 fatty  acylcoenzyme A elongation, respectively. CER1, CER8, CER9, and CER16 gene  products may be involved in EW substrate transfer. The CER3 gene product may be  involved in release of fatty acids from elongase complexes. CER2 gene product may  have regulatory functions.', '1995 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.1.369', 'Feldmann']
