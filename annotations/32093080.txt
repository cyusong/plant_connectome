Wounding is a serious environmental stress in plants. Oxylipins such as jasmonic acid play an important role in defense against wounding. Mechanisms to adapt to wounding have been investigated in vascular plants; however, those mechanisms in nonvascular plants remain elusive. To examine the response to wounding in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>, a model moss, a proteomic analysis of wounded <i>P. patens</i> was conducted. Proteomic analysis showed that wounding increased the abundance of proteins related to protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism, protein folding, photosystem, glycolysis, and energy synthesis. 12-Oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) was induced by wounding and inhibited growth. Therefore, OPDA is considered a signaling molecule in this plant. Proteomic analysis of a <i>P. patens</i> mutant in which the <i>PpAOS1</i> and <i>PpAOS2</i> genes, which are involved in OPDA biosynthesis, are disrupted showed accumulation of proteins involved in protein synthesis in response to wounding in a similar way to the wild-type plant. In contrast, the fold-changes of the proteins in the wild-type plant were significantly different from those in the <i>aos</i> mutant. This study suggests that <i>PpAOS</i> gene expression enhances photosynthesis and effective energy utilization in response to wounding in <i>P. patens.</i>
