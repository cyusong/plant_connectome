Changes in phenolics (PhC) measured as UV-absorbing compounds (UVAC) and their localization as well as growth, lipid peroxidation (TBARS level), H(2)O(2) and Cu accumulation and other ions content in roots of two lentil cultivars (cv. Krak and cv. Tina) contrasting in Cu sensitivity were examined. The aim of this study was to reveal the importance of PhC in Cu tolerance. During Cu treatment, inhibition of growth and increases in lipid peroxidation in roots of both cultivars were observed, but the effects were more pronounced in cv. Tina (more sensitive) than in cv. Krak (less sensitive). Cu at 0.5 mM caused higher Cu and H(2)O(2) accumulation, but lower K(+) content and UVAC levels in the root tips of cv. Tina. Opposite changes were recorded in cv. Krak. Fluorescence microscopic analyses confirmed greater PhC accumulation in cv. Krak (less sensitive) than in cv. Tina (more sensitive) after Cu treatment and showed that these compounds accumulated particularly in vacuoles and the cell wall. Taken together, these results show that, in spite of the high concentration of Cu-stimulated PhC accumulation in cv. Krak, it was not sufficient to counteract the amount of ROS generated by the metal. The role of PhC in different reactions to Cu stress in lentil roots is discussed.
