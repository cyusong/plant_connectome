Cold stress seriously affects plant development, resulting in heavy agricultural losses. L-ascorbic acid (AsA, vitamin C) is an antioxidant implicated in abiotic stress tolerance and metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Understanding whether and how cold stress elicits AsA biosynthesis to reduce oxidative damage is important for developing cold-resistant plants. Here, we show that the accumulation of AsA in response to cold stress is a common mechanism conserved across the plant kingdom, from single-cell algae to angiosperms. We identified a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) of kiwifruit (Actinidia eriantha Benth.), AcePosF21, which was triggered by cold and is involved in the regulation of kiwifruit AsA biosynthesis and defense responses against cold stress. AcePosF21 interacted with the R2R3-MYB TF AceMYB102 and directly bound to the promoter of the gene encoding GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase 3 (AceGGP3), a key conduit for regulating AsA biosynthesis, to upregulate AceGGP3 expression and produce more AsA, which neutralized the excess ROS induced by cold stress. On the contrary, VIGS or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated editing of AcePosF21 decreased AsA content and increased the generation of ROS in kiwifruit under cold stress. Taken together, we illustrated a model for the regulatory mechanism of AcePosF21-mediated regulation of AceGGP3 expression and AsA biosynthesis to reduce oxidative damage by cold stress, which provides valuable clues for manipulating the cold resistance of kiwifruit.
