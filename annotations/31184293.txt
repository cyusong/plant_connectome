It is widely recognized that different parts of a plant can communicate with each other via light-dependent long-distance signaling under heterogeneous light conditions. However, the mechanism of such systemic signaling has not been revealed yet. Our studies on different species suggest the involvement of carbohydrates in light-dependent systemic regulation between different parts of a plant under both short- and long-term light heterogeneity. Leaves exposed to better light condition perform enhanced photosynthetic capacity, and act to compensate for the decline in photosynthesis of other leaves under bad light condition within the same plant. This kind of compensatory photosynthesis has a close relationship to the distribution of carbohydrates, and can be regarded as an integrative strategy to make efficient use of sunlight at the whole-plant level.
