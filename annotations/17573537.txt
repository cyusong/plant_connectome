['17573537', 'A transient rise in chlorophyll fluorescence after turning off actinic light  reflects nonphotochemical reduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool. This process  is dependent on the activity of the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH)  complex, which mediates electron flow from stromal reductants to the PQ pool. In  this study, we characterized an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) T-DNA  insertion mutant pifi (for postillumination chlorophyll fluorescence increase),  which possesses an intact NDH complex, but lacks the NDH-dependent chlorophyll  fluorescence increase after turning off actinic light. The nuclear gene PIFI  (At3g15840) containing the T-DNA insertion encodes a chloroplast-targeted protein  localized in the stroma and is annotated as a protein of unknown function. The  pifi mutant exhibited a lower capacity for nonphotochemical quenching, but  similar CO(2) assimilation rates, photosystem II (PSII) quantum efficiencies  (PhiPSII), and reduction levels of the primary electron acceptor of PSII (1 - qL)  as compared with the wild type. The pifi mutant grows normally under optimal  conditions, but exhibits greater sensitivity to photoinhibition and long-term  mild heat stress than wild-type plants, which is consistent with lower capacity  of nonphotochemical quenching. We conclude that PIFI is a novel component  essential for NDH-mediated nonphotochemical reduction of the PQ pool in  chlororespiratory electron transport.', '2007 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.103218', 'Portis']
