Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is essential for plant growth and stress responses. A deficiency in soil K<sup>+</sup> contents can result in decreased wheat quality and productivity. Thus, clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying wheat responses to low-K<sup>+</sup> (LK) stress is critical. In this study, a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to investigate the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in roots of the LK-tolerant wheat cultivar "KN9204" at the seedling stage after exposure to LK stress. A total of 104 DAPs were identified in the LK-treated roots. The DAPs related to carbohydrate and energy metabolism, transport, stress responses and defense, and post-translational modifications under LK conditions were highlighted. We identified a high-affinity potassium transporter (TaHAK1-4A) that was significantly up-regulated after the LK treatment. Additionally, <i>TaHAK1-4A</i> was mainly expressed in roots, and the encoded protein was localized in the plasma membrane. The complementation assay in yeast suggested that TaHAK1-4A mediates K<sup>+</sup> uptake under extreme LK conditions. The overexpression of <i>TaHAK1-4A</i> increased the fresh weight and root length of Arabidopsis under LK conditions and improved the growth of Arabidopsis <i>athak5</i> mutant seedlings, which grow poorly under LK conditions. Moreover, silencing of <i>TaHAK1-4A</i> in wheat roots treated with LK stress decreased the root length, dry weight, K<sup>+</sup> concentration, and K<sup>+</sup> influx. Accordingly, TaHAK1-4A is important for the uptake of K<sup>+</sup> by roots exposed to LK stress. Our results reveal the protein metabolic changes in wheat induced by LK stress. Furthermore, we identified a candidate gene potentially relevant for developing wheat lines with increased K<sup>+</sup> use efficiency.
