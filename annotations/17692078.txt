Root-knot nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne are obligate biotrophic parasites able to infest > 2000 plant species. The nematode effectors responsible for disease development are involved in the adaptation of the parasite to its host environment and host response modulation. Here, the differences between the transcriptomes of preparasitic exophytic second-stage juveniles (J2) and parasitic endophytic third-stage juveniles (J3) of Meloidogyne incognita were investigated. Genes up-regulated at the endophytic stage were isolated by suppression subtractive hybridization and validated by dot blots and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Up-regulation was demonstrated for genes involved in detoxification and protein degradation, for a gene encoding a putative secreted protein and for genes of unknown function. Transcripts of the glutathione S-transferase gene Mi-gsts-1 were 27 times more abundant in J3 than in J2. The observed Mi-gsts-1 expression in the oesophageal secretory glands and the results of functional analyses based on RNA interference suggest that glutathione S-transferases are secreted during parasitism and are required for completion of the nematode life cycle in its host. Secreted glutathione S-transferases may protect the parasite against reactive oxygen species or modulate the plant responses triggered by pathogen attack.
