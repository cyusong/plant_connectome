Unique ecosystems distributed in alpine areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau play important roles in climate change mitigation, local food supply, and conservation of species diversity. To understand the water use efficiency (WUE) of this fragile and sensitive region, this study combined observed data from the eddy covariance system and the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model to measure the continuous mass exchange, including gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and canopy transpiration (T) throughout 2 or 3 years (2016-2018) in three common alpine ecosystems (i.e., alpine steppe, alpine meadow, and alpine swamp). These ecosystems represent a water availability gradient and thus provide the opportunity to quantify environmental and biological controls on WUE at various spatiotemporal scales. We analyzed the ecosystem WUE (WUEe; defined as the ratio of GPP to ET) and canopy WUE (WUEc; defined as the ratio of GPP and canopy T). It was found that the yearly WUEe was 1.40, 1.63, and 2.16 g C kg<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O, and the yearly WUEc was 8.93, 2.46, and 5.19 g C kg<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O in the three typical ecosystems, respectively. The controlling factors of yearly WUE diverged between WUEe and WUEc. We found that plant functional group proportion (e.g., gramineous and Cyperaceae) highly explained the yearly WUEe variation across sites, and a good correlation was observed between community species diversity and WUEc. These findings suggest that community composition and trait change are critical in regulating WUEe and WUEc across different alpine ecosystems and that the regulation mechanisms may differ fundamentally between WUEe and WUEc.
