The alkaloid patterns in Leucojum aestivum L. shoot culture cultivated at temporary immersion conditions were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 18 alkaloids were identified, and galanthamine, hamayne and lycorine were dominant. The L. aestivum 80 shoot culture, cultivated at temporary immersion conditions, is a prospective biological matrix for obtaining wide range Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, showing valuable biological and pharmacological activities. The temperature of cultivation influenced enzyme activities, catalyzing phenol oxidative coupling of 4'-O-methylnorbelladine and formation of the different groups Amaryllidaceae alkaloids. Decreasing the temperature of cultivation of L. aestivum 80 shoot culture led to activation of para-ortho' phenol oxidative coupling (formation of galanthamine type alkaloids) and inhibited ortho-para' and para-para' phenol oxidative coupling (formation of lycorine and haemanthamine types alkaloids).
