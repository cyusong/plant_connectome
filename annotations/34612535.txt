Maize leaf angle (LA) is a complex quantitative trait that is controlled by developmental signals, hormones, and environmental factors. However, the connection between histone methylation and LAs in maize remains unclear. Here, we reported that SET domain protein 128 (SDG128) is involved in leaf inclination in maize. Knockdown of SDG128 using an RNA interference approach resulted in an expanded architecture, less large vascular bundles, more small vascular bundles, and larger spacing of large vascular bundles in the auricles. SDG128 interacts with ZmGID2 both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of ZmGID2 also showed a larger LA with less large vascular bundles and larger spacing of vascular bundles. In addition, the transcription level of cell wall expansion family genes ZmEXPA1, ZmEXPB2, and GRMZM2G005887; transcriptional factor genes Lg1, ZmTAC1, and ZmCLA4; and auxin pathway genes ZmYUCCA7, ZmYUCCA8, and ZmARF22 was reduced in SDG128 and ZmGID2 knockdown plants. SDG128 directly targets ZmEXPA1, ZmEXPB2, LG1, and ZmTAC1 and is required for H3K4me3 deposition at these genes. Together, the results of the present study suggest that SDG128 and ZmGID2 are involved in the maize leaf inclination.
