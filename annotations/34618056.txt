The brassinosteroid pathway promotes a variety of physiological processes in plants and the brassinosteroid insensitive1-ethylmethane sulfonate suppressor (BES)/brassinazole-resistant (BZR) functions as one of its key regulators. We previously showed that the BES/BZR-type transcription factor TaBZR2 mediates the drought stress response in wheat (Triticum aestivum) by directly upregulating the transcriptional activity of glutathione S-transferase 1. However, the function of TaBZR2 in plants under biotic stresses is unknown. In this study, we found that transcript levels of TaBZR2 were upregulated in response to inoculation with wheat stripe rust fungus (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) and treatment with flg22 or an elicitor-like protein of Pst, Pst322. Wheat lines overexpressing TaBZR2 conferred increased resistance, whereas TaBZR2-RNAi lines exhibited decreased resistance to multiple races of Pst. TaBZR2 targeted the promoter of the chitinase gene TaCht20.2, activating its transcription. Knockdown of TaCht20.2 in wheat resulted in enhanced susceptibility to Pst, indicating the positive role of TaCht20.2 in wheat resistance. Upon Pst infection in vivo, the overexpression of TaBZR2 increased total chitinase activity, whereas RNAi-mediated silencing of TaBZR2 reduced total chitinase activity. Taken together, our results suggest that TaBZR2 confers broad-spectrum resistance to the stripe rust fungus by increasing total chitinase activity in wheat.
