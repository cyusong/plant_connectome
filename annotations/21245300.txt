['21245300', 'We identify a gene, organ boundary1 (OBO1), by its unique pattern of enhancer-  driven GFP expression at the boundaries between the apical meristems and lateral  organs in Arabidopsis embryos, seedlings, and mature plants. OBO1 also is  expressed at the root apical meristem and in distinct cell files surrounding this  area. OBO1 is one of a 10-member plant-specific gene family encoding a single  small domain (133 amino acids) with unknown function. One member of this gene  family, OBO2, is identical to a previously studied gene, light-sensitive  hypocotyl1. Overexpression of OBO1 causes an abnormal number and size of petals  and petal-stamen fusions. The patterns of OBO1 gene expression are distinct but  overlap with other genes involved in boundary formation in the Arabidopsis shoot  apical meristem, including cup-shaped cotyledon, lateral organ boundaries,  blade-on-petiole, asymmetric leaves, and lateral organ fusion. Nuclear  localization of OBO1 suggests that it might act with one or more of the  transcription factors encoded by the foregoing genes. Ablation of the specific  cells expressing OBO1 leads to loss of the shoot apical meristem and lateral  organs. Thus, the cells expressing OBO1 are important for meristem maintenance  and organogenesis in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Feb 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1018542108', 'Zambryski']
