Plants usually suffer from phosphorus starvation because of the low inorganic phosphate (Pi) status of most soils. To cope with this, plants have evolved an adaptive phosphate starvation response (PSR) which involves both developmental and metabolic changes regulated mainly by PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and its homologs. Here, we elucidated how perennial woody plants, such as poplars (Populus spp.), respond to low-Pi stress. We first performed RNA-seq analysis of low-Pi-treated poplars and identified PtoWRKY40 is rapidly downregulated and protein degraded after stress. Overexpressing and knocking-down PtoWRKY40 downregulated and upregulated the expression of Pi starvation signaling genes, respectively, such as PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1)-type genes and PURPLE ACID PHOSPHATASE genes. PtoWRKY40 bound to the W box in the promoter of several PtoPHT1s and repressed their expression. Moreover, PtoWRKY40 interacted with PtoPHR1-LIKE3 (PtoPHL3), a PHR1 homolog in poplar, to inhibit the latter binding to the P1BS element and thus reduced PtoPHT1s' transcription under Pi-sufficient conditions. However, Pi deficiency decreased PtoWRKY40 abundance and therefore released its inhibition on PHT1s. In conclusion, we have uncovered a PSR mechanism mediated by PtoWRKY40 and PtoPHL3 which regulates Pi content in poplars, deepening our understanding of how poplars adapt to diverse Pi conditions and regulate appropriate responses to maintain Pi homeostasis.
