Proteomics approach was used to elucidate the molecular interactions taking place at the stem cell wall level when tomato species were inoculated with Ralstonia solanacearum, a causative agent of bacterial wilt. Cell wall proteins from both resistant and susceptible plants before and after the bacterial inoculation were extracted from purified cell wall with salt buffers and separated with 2-D IEF/SDS-PAGE and with 3-D IEF/SDS/SDS-PAGE for basic proteins. The gels stained with colloidal Coomassie revealed varied abundance of protein spots between two species (eight proteins in higher abundance in resistant and six other in susceptible). Moreover, proteins were regulated differentially in response to bacterial inoculation in resistant (seven proteins increased and eight other decreased) as well as in susceptible plants (five proteins elevated and eight other suppressed). Combination of MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and LC-ESI-IonTrap MS/MS lead to the identification of those proteins. Plants responded to pathogen inoculation by elevating the expression of pathogenesis related, other defense related and glycolytic proteins in both species. However, cell wall metabolic proteins in susceptible, and antioxidant, stress related as well as energy metabolism proteins in resistant lines were suppressed. Most of the proteins of the comparative analysis and other randomly picked spots were predicted to have secretion signals except some classical cytosolic proteins.
