The Arabidopsis protein EARLY BOLTING IN SHORT DAYS (EBS), a plant-specific transcriptional regulator, is involved in the control of flowering time by repressing the floral integrator FT. The EBS protein binds the H3K4me3 histone mark and interacts with histone deacetylases to modulate gene expression. Here, we show that EBS also participates in the regulation of seed dormancy. ebs mutations cause a reduction in seed dormancy, and the concurrent loss of function of the EBS homologue SHORT LIFE (SHL) enhances this dormancy alteration. Transcriptomic analyses in ebs mutant seeds uncovered the misregulation of several regulators of seed dormancy including the MADS box gene AGAMOUS-LIKE67 (AGL67). AGL67 interacts genetically with EBS in seed dormancy regulation, indicating that both loci act in the same pathway. Interestingly, EBS functions independently of the master regulator gene of dormancy DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) and other genes encoding chromatin remodelling factors involved in the control of seed dormancy. Altogether, these data show that EBS is a central repressor of germination during seed dormancy and that SHL acts redundantly with EBS in the control of this developmental process. Our observations suggest that a tightly regulated crosstalk among histone modifications is necessary for a proper control of seed dormancy.
