The carotenoids are the most widely distributed secondary metabolites in plants and can be degraded by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) to form apocarotenoids including an important C13 compound beta-ionone. Volatile beta-ionone can confer the violet and woody fragrance to plant essential oils, flowers, fruits, and vegetables, which therefore has been used in various industries. <i>Dendrobium officinale</i> is a traditional medicinal plant. However, there was limited information on the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of beta-ionone in <i>D. officinale</i>. In the present study, beta-ionone was detected in stems and leaves of <i>D. officinale</i> and genome-wide identification and expression profiles of <i>CCD</i> genes were subsequently carried out. There were nine DoCCD members in <i>D. officinale</i>. According to the phylogenetic relationship, DoCCD proteins were classified into six subfamilies including CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and zaxinone synthase (ZAS). <i>DoCCD</i> genes showed distinctive expression profiles and <i>DoCCD1</i> gene was abundantly expressed in eight tissues. Induced expression of <i>DoCCD1</i> gene resulted in discoloration of <i>Escerichia coli</i> strains that can accumulate carotenoids. Analysis of Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer showed that DoCCD1 enzyme can cleave lycopene to produce 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and pseudoionone and also catalyze beta-carotene to form beta-ionone. Expression of <i>DoCCD1</i> gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf resulted in production of abundant beta-ionone. Overall, the present study first provides valuable information on the CCD gene family in <i>D. officinale</i>, function of <i>DoCCD1</i> gene as well as production of beta-ionone through genetic modification.
