['17922773', 'Calcium signalling involves sensor proteins that decode temporal and spatial  changes in cellular Ca2+ concentration. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs)  represent a unique family of plant calcium sensors that relay signals by  interacting with a family of protein kinases, designated as CBL-interacting  protein kinases (CIPKs). In a reverse genetic screen for altered drought  tolerance, we identified a loss-of-function allele of CIPK23 as exhibiting a  drought-tolerant phenotype. In the cipk23 mutant, reduced transpirational water  loss from leaves coincides with enhanced ABA sensitivity of guard cells during  opening as well as closing reactions, without noticeable alterations in ABA  content in the plant. We identified the calcium sensors CBL1 and CBL9 as  CIPK23-interacting proteins that targeted CIPK23 to the plasma membrane in vivo.  Expression analysis of the CIPK23, CBL1 and CBL9 genes suggested that they may  function together in diverse tissues, including guard cells and root hairs. In  addition, expression of the CIPK23 gene was induced by low-potassium conditions,  implicating a function of this gene product in potassium nutrition. Indeed,  cipk23 mutants displayed severe growth impairment on media with low  concentrations of potassium. This phenotype correlates with a reduced efficiency  of K+ uptake into the roots. In support of the conclusion that CBL1 and CBL9  interact with and synergistically serve as upstream regulators of CIPK23, the  cbl1 cbl9 double mutant, but not the cbl1 or cbl9 single mutants, exhibit altered  phenotypes for stomatal responses and low-potassium sensitivity. Together with  the recent identification of the potassium channel AKT1 as a target of CIPK23,  these results imply that plasma membrane-localized CBL1- and CBL9-CIPK23  complexes simultaneously regulate K+ transport processes in roots and in stomatal  guard cells.', '2007 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03236.x', 'Luan']
