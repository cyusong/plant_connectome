In flowering plants, pollen development is a critical step for reproductive success and necessarily involves complex genetic regulatory networks. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are plant-specific calcium sensors involved in the regulation of plant development and adaption to the environment; however, whether they play a role in regulating male reproduction remains elusive. Here, we found that the knockdown of spikelet-specific OsCPK21 causes pollen abortion in OsCPK21-RNAi transgenic plants. Severe defects in pollen development initiated at stage 10 of anther development and simultaneous cell death occurred in the pollen cells of OsCPK21-RNAi plants. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR revealed that the transcription of OsCPK21 is coordinated with that of MIKC*-type MADS box transcription factors OsMADS62, OsMADS63, and OsMADS68 during rice anther development. We further showed that OsCPK21 indirectly up-regulates the transcription of OsMADS62, OsMADS63, and OsMADS68 through the potential MYB binding site, DRE/CRT element, and/or new ERF binding motif localised in the promoter region of these three MADS genes. These findings suggest that OsCPK21 plays an essential role in pollengenesis, possibly via indirectly regulating the transcription of MIKC*-type MADS box proteins.
