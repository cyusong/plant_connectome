The application of phosphorus (P) fertilizer effectively improves soil P availability, but it also affects soil microbial communities. However, the responses of soil bacterial communities and P forms to long-term P fertilization, and the relationships of bacterial communities with soil P forms remain unclear in P-deficient field. In this study, the impacts of different P fertilization treatments (chemical nitrogen and potassium (NK); chemical N, P and K (NPK); and NPK plus straw (NPKS)) on the bacterial communities and P forms in sugarcane rhizosphere (RS) and bulk soils (BS) were evaluated. Compared with the NK, the NPK and NPKS treatments significantly (<i>P</i><0.05) increased the yield and quality characters of sugarcane, especially under NPKS. Additionally, P fertilization significantly increased the available P (AP), soluble inorganic P (Pi) and retained Pi in both the RS and BS, but they significantly increased the Chao1 and Shannon index only in the BS; and almost all these indices were significantly higher in the RS than in the BS. The bacterial community compositions were also significantly altered by P fertilization, with major changes in the RS and minor changes in the BS. The bacterial genera that were enriched in the sugarcane rhizosphere mainly included <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Rhodanobacter</i>, <i>Pseudolabrys</i>, <i>Conexibacter</i>, and <i>Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia</i>, some of which potentially promote the plant growth. Compared to NK, functional groups involved in the cycling of carbon, N, and sulfur significantly increased or decreased with fertilizer P application. Moreover, the relative abundances of many bacterial species were significantly correlated with the soil P forms. In conclusion, long-term P fertilization altered bacterial structure and functions in P-deficient sugarcane soil, which could help the soil P cycling and suppling. The results provide useful information to stimulate the power of the microbes by fertilization measures to improve soil nutrients and crop production.
