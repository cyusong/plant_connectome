Many processes influence PSF, including changes in nutrient availability and the accumulation of natural enemies, mutualists or secondary chemicals. Typically, these mechanisms are investigated in isolation, yet no single mechanism is likely to be completely responsible for PSF as these processes can interact. Further, the outcome depends on which resources are limiting and the other plants and soil biota in the surrounding environment. As such, understanding the mechanisms of PSF and their role within plant communities requires quantification of the interactions among the processes influencing PSF and the associated abiotic and biotic contexts.
