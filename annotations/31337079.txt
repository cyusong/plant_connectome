Extensive research over several decades in plant light signaling mediated by photoreceptors has identified the molecular mechanisms for how phytochromes regulate photomorphogenic development, which includes degradation of phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) and inactivation of COP1-SPA complexes with the accumulation of master transcription factors for photomorphogenesis, such as HY5. However, the initial biochemical mechanism for the function of phytochromes has not been fully elucidated. Plant phytochromes have long been known as phosphoproteins, and a few protein phosphatases that directly interact with and dephosphorylate phytochromes have been identified. However, there is no report thus far of a protein kinase that acts on phytochromes. On the other hand, plant phytochromes have been suggested as autophosphorylating serine/threonine protein kinases, proposing that the kinase activity might be important for their functions. Indeed, the autophosphorylation of phytochromes has been reported to play an important role in the regulation of plant light signaling. More recently, evidence that phytochromes function as protein kinases in plant light signaling has been provided using phytochrome mutants displaying reduced kinase activities. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the reversible phosphorylation of phytochromes and their functions as protein kinases in plant light signaling.
