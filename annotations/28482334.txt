The agriculture industry is frequently affected by various abiotic stresses limiting plant productivity. To decrease the negative effect of salinity and improve growth performance, some strategies have been used, such as exogenous application of plant growth regulators (i.e. gibberellic acid, GA<sub>3</sub>), or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation. To gain insights about the cross-talk effect of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> application and AMF inoculation on growth under salinity conditions, tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum, cv. TT-115) were inoculated or not with the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis and exposed to different treatments during two weeks: 0M GA<sub>3</sub>+0mM NaCl, 10<sup>-6</sup>M GA<sub>3</sub>+0mM NaCl, 0M GA<sub>3</sub>+100mM NaCl and 10<sup>-6</sup>M GA<sub>3</sub>+100mM NaCl. Results have revealed that AMF inoculation or GA<sub>3</sub> application alone, but especially their interaction, resulted in growth improvement under salinity conditions. The growth improvement observed in AMF-inoculated tomato plants under salinity conditions was mainly associated to ionic factors (higherK concentration and K/Na ratio) while the alleviating effect of GA<sub>3</sub> application and its interaction with AMF appear to be due to changes in the hormonal balance. Foliar GA<sub>3</sub> application was found to increase the active gibberellins (GAs), resulting in a positive correlation between GA<sub>3</sub> and the growth-related parameters. Furthermore, cytokinins, indoleacetic acid and abscisic acid concentrations increased in AMF inoculated or GA<sub>3</sub> treated plants but, notably, in AMF plants treated with GA<sub>3</sub>, which showed improved growth under salinity conditions. This suggests that there is an interactive positive effect between GAs and AMF which alleviates growth impairment under salinity conditions by modifying the hormonal balance of the plant.
