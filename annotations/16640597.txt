['16640597', 'Leaf senescence is a unique developmental process that is characterized by  massive programmed cell death and nutrient recycling. The underlying molecular  regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report the functional  analysis of AtNAP, a gene encoding a NAC family transcription factor. Expression  of this gene is closely associated with the senescence process of Arabidopsis  rosette leaves. Leaf senescence in two T-DNA insertion lines of this gene is  significantly delayed. The T-DNA knockout plants are otherwise normal. The mutant  phenotype can be restored to wild-type by the intact AtNAP, as well as by its  homologs in rice and kidney bean plants that are also upregulated during leaf  senescence. Furthermore, inducible overexpression of AtNAP causes precocious  senescence. These data strongly suggest that AtNAP and its homologs play an  important role in leaf senescence in Arabidopsis and possibly in other plant  species.', '2006 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02723.x', 'Gan']
