['16332538', 'The phytochrome family of red/far-red (R/FR)-responsive photoreceptors plays a  key role throughout the life cycle of plants . Arabidopsis has five phytochromes,  phyA-phyE, among which phyA and phyB play the most predominant functions .  Light-regulated nuclear accumulation of the phytochromes is an important  regulatory step of this pathway, but to this date no factor specifically required  for this event has been identified . Among all phyA signaling mutants, fhy1 and  fhy3 (far-red elongated hypocotyl 1 and 3) have the most severe hyposensitive  phenotype, indicating that they play particularly important roles . FHY1 is a  small plant-specific protein of unknown function localized both in the nucleus  and the cytoplasm . Here we show that FHY1 is specifically required for the  light-regulated nuclear accumulation of phyA but not phyB. Moreover, phyA  accumulation is only slightly affected in fhy3, indicating that the diminished  nuclear accumulation of phyA observed in fhy1 seedlings is not simply a general  consequence of reduced phyA signaling. By in vitro pull-down and yeast two-hybrid  analyses, we demonstrate that FHY1 physically interacts with phyA, preferentially  in its active Pfr form. Furthermore, FHY1 and phyA colocalize in planta. We  therefore identify the first component required for light-regulated phytochrome  nuclear accumulation.', '2005 Dec 6', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.042', 'Schafer']
