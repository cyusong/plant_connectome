Plants must balance both beneficial (symbiotic) and pathogenic challenges from microorganisms, the former benefitting the plant and agriculture and the latter causing disease and economic harm. Plant innate immunity describes a highly conserved set of defense mechanisms that play pivotal roles in sensing immunogenic signals associated with both symbiotic and pathogenic microbes and subsequent downstream activation of signaling effector networks that protect the plant. An intriguing question is how the innate immune system distinguishes "friends" from "foes". Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the role and spectrum of innate immunity in recognizing and responding to different microbes. In addition, we also review some of the strategies used by microbes to manipulate plant signaling pathways and thus evade immunity, with emphasis on the use of effector proteins and micro-RNAs (miRNAs). Furthermore, we discuss potential questions that need addressing to advance the field of plant-microbe interactions.

Plants: !balance! beneficial/pathogenic microorganisms
Innate immunity: !senses! immunogenic signals
Innate immunity: !activates! signaling effector networks
