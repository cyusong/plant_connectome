Cellulose synthesis is precisely regulated by internal and external cues, and emerging evidence suggests that light regulates cellulose biosynthesis through specific light receptors. Recently, the blue light receptor CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1) was shown to positively regulate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we characterize the role of <i>FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT</i>, <i>F-BOX 1</i> (<i>FKF1</i>), another blue light receptor and well-known photoperiodic flowering time regulator, in cellulose biosynthesis. A phenotype suppression screen using a cellulose deficient mutant <i>cesa1<sup>aegeus</sup>,cesa3<sup>ixr1-2</sup></i> (<i>c1,c3</i>), which carries nonlethal point mutations in <i>CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A 1</i> (<i>CESA1</i>) and <i>CESA3</i>, resulted in identification of the phenotype-restoring <i>large leaf</i> (<i>llf</i>) mutant. Next-generation mapping using the whole genome resequencing method identified the <i>llf</i> locus as <i>FKF1</i> <i>FKF1</i> was confirmed as the causal gene through observation of the <i>llf</i> phenotype in an independent triple mutant <i>c1,c3,fkf1-t</i> carrying a <i>FKF1</i> T-DNA insertion mutant. Moreover, overexpression of <i>FKF1</i> in <i>llf</i> plants restored the <i>c1,c3</i> phenotype. The <i>fkf1</i> mutants showed significant increases in cellulose content and <i>CESA</i> gene expression compared with that in wild-type Columbia-0 plants, suggesting a negative role of FKF1 in cellulose biosynthesis. Using genetic, molecular, and phenocopy and biochemical evidence, we have firmly established the role of FKF1 in regulation of cellulose biosynthesis. In addition, <i>CESA</i> expression analysis showed that diurnal expression patterns of <i>CESA</i>s are FKF1 independent, whereas their circadian expression patterns are FKF1 dependent. Overall, our work establishes a role of FKF1 in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
