Cofactors are fundamental to the catalytic activity of enzymes. Additionally, because plants are a critical source of several cofactors (i.e., including their vitamin precursors) within the context of human nutrition, there have been several studies aiming to understand the metabolism of coenzymes and vitamins in plants in detail. For example, compelling evidence has been brought forth regarding the role of cofactors in plants; specifically, it is becoming increasingly clear that an adequate supply of cofactors in plants directly affects their development, metabolism, and stress responses. Here, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge on the significance of coenzymes and their precursors with regard to general plant physiology and discuss the emerging functions attributed to them. Furthermore, we discuss how our understanding of the complex relationship between cofactors and plant metabolism can be used for crop improvement.
