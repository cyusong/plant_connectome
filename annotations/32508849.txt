Strigolactones (SLs) are essential host recognition signals for both root-parasitic plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the rhizosphere, and <i>in planta</i> SLs or their metabolites function as a novel class of plant hormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth through crosstalk with other hormones. Although nutrient availability is one of the important factors influencing SL production and exudation, and phosphate (Pi) deficiency significantly promotes SL production and exudation in host plants of AM fungi, how nutrient availability modulates SL production and exudation remains elusive. Cytokinin (CK), a canonical plant hormone, has extensively been studied as a shoot branching promoter and its biosynthesis is also influenced by mineral nutrients, especially nitrate, indicating that CK might be another key factor that affect SL production and exudation. In the present study, we show that CKs (<i>t</i>-zeatin, benzyladenine, kinetin, and CPPU) applied to hydroponic culture media significantly suppressed the SL levels in both the root exudates and the root tissues of rice plants grown under Pi deficiency. In a split-root system, CK suppressed SL production locally, while Pi affected SL production systemically, suggesting that Pi and CK act on SL production independently in rice plants.
