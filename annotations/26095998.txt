['26095998', 'During growth and development, plants undergo a series of phase transitions from  the juvenile-to-adult vegetative phase to the reproductive phase. In Arabidopsis,  vegetative phase transitions and flowering are regulated by SQUAMOSA PROMOTER  BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) factors. SPL mRNAs are post-transcriptionally  regulated by miR156 in an age-dependent manner; however, the role of other  mechanisms in this process is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that the  HAG1/GCN5- and PRZ1/ADA2b-containing SAGA-like histone acetyltransferase (HAT)  complex directly controls the transcription of SPLs and determines the time for  juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Thus, epigenetic control by the SAGA-like HAT  complex determines the transcriptional output of SPLs, which might be a  prerequisite for the subsequent post-transcriptional regulation by miR156.  Importantly, this epigenetic control mechanism is also crucial for  miR156-independent induction of SPLs and acceleration of phase transition by  light and photoperiod or during post-embryonic growth.', '2015 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12908', 'Noh']
