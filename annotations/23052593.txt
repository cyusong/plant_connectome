['23052593', 'KEY MESSAGE : Reduced levels of profilin 3 do not have a noticeable phenotypic  effect; however, elevated profilin 3 levels result in decreased hypocotyl length  due to a reduction in cell elongation and F-actin reorganization. The actin  cytoskeleton is critical for a variety of cellular processes. The small actin  monomer proteins, profilins (PRFs), are encoded by five highly conserved isoforms  in Arabidopsis thaliana. PRF3, one of the vegetative isoforms, has 36 more  N-terminal amino acid residues than the other four PRFs; however, the functions  of PRF3 are mostly unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that PRF3 was strongly  expressed in young seedlings, rosette leaves, and cauline leaves, but was weakly  expressed in 14-day-old seedlings and flowers. Our data also showed that PRF3  could increase the critical concentration (Cc) of actin assembly in vitro.  Overexpression of the full-length PRF3 cDNA resulted in a decrease in the lengths  of roots and hypocotyls and delayed seed germination, but PRF3-DeltaN36 transgenic  plants and prf3 mutant plants showed normal growth when compared with wild-type  plants. Microscopy observation revealed that cell elongation was inhibited in the  hypocotyl and that F-actin was reorganized by destabilizing microfilaments. These  results suggest that the dwarf phenotype of the PRF3 overexpression seedlings may  be related to a reduction in cell length and F-actin rearrangement.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-012-1349-2', 'An']
