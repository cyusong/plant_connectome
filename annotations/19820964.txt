Localization of the 49-kDa apyrase (ATP diphosphohydrolase, EC3.6.1.5; DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank BAB40230) was investigated during early stages of germination of pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska) at the organ, tissue, cellular, and sub-cellular level using light-microscopical immunohistochemistry. Whole mount tissues were immuno-reacted with anti-APY1 serum, pre-immune serum or anti-actin antibody for control. Antigen to the anti-APY1 serum was not detected until 16 h after sowing (26 h after start of imbibition), when the antigen was detected throughout the tissue, especially in the epidermis and cortex. At 35 h after sowing, the younger regions including the root tip and the tip of the stele were more strongly stained than the control. Both, epidermal and cortical cells of the epicotyl and root tip were stained. The stain was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and around nuclei in the apical meristem and the root tip, while vacuoles and cell walls were not stained. At 62 h, there was major staining in the plumule, hook, and elongating regions of the epicotyl and in the region between cotyledons and the epicotyl. After 84 h, lateral root primordia were stained. The pre-immune serum showed virtually no staining while the anti-actin antibody reacted solely with the cytoplasm. Since the antigen to the anti-APY1 serum was primarily found in the cytoplasm and around nuclei in elongating and differentiating tissues and labeling declined in mature tissues, it is suggested that apyrases may play a role in growth and development of tissues, for example, lateral roots.
