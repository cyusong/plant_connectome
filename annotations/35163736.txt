The barley chloroplast mutator (<i>cpm</i>) is a nuclear gene mutant that induces a wide spectrum of cytoplasmically inherited chlorophyll deficiencies. Plastome instability of <i>cpm</i> seedlings was determined by identification of a particular landscape of polymorphisms that suggests failures in a plastome mismatch repair (MMR) protein. In Arabidopsis, <i>MSH</i> genes encode proteins that are in charge of mismatch repair and have anti-recombination activity. In this work, barley homologs of these genes were identified, and their sequences were analyzed in control and <i>cpm</i> mutant seedlings. A substitution, leading to a premature stop codon and a truncated MSH1 protein, was identified in the <i>Msh</i>1 gene of <i>cpm</i> plants. The relationship between this mutation and the presence of chlorophyll deficiencies was established in progenies from crosses and backcrosses. These results strongly suggest that the mutation identified in the <i>Msh</i>1 gene of the <i>cpm</i> mutant is responsible for the observed plastome instabilities. Interestingly, comparison of mutant phenotypes and molecular changes induced by the barley <i>cpm</i> mutant with those of Arabidopsis <i>MSH</i>1 mutants revealed marked differences.
