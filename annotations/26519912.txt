eHALOPH (http://www.sussex.ac.uk/affiliates/halophytes/) is a database of salt-tolerant plants-halophytes. Records of plant species tolerant of salt concentrations of around 80 mM sodium chloride or more have been collected, along with data on plant type, life form, ecotypes, maximum salinity tolerated, the presence or absence of salt glands, photosynthetic pathway, antioxidants, secondary metabolites, compatible solutes, habitat, economic use and whether there are publications on germination, microbial interactions and mycorrhizal status, bioremediation and of molecular data. The database eHALOPH can be used in the analysis of traits associated with tolerance and for informing choice of species that might be used for saline agriculture, bioremediation or ecological restoration and rehabilitation of degraded wetlands or other areas.
