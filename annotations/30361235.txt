Ribosome biogenesis is fundamental to growth and development in eukaryotes and is linked to human diseases and cancer. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> MORPHOLOGY OF ARGONAUTE1-52 SUPPRESSED 2 (MAS2) participates in splicing and 45S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) expression. In a screen for MAS2 interactors, we identified RIBOSOMAL RNA PROCESSING 7 (RRP7), an ortholog of yeast rRNA processing protein 7 (Rrp7), which is required for 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation. Arabidopsis <i>rrp7</i> mutants exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype including slow growth, altered shoot phyllotaxy, aberrant venation in lateral organs, partial infertility, and abscisic acid hypersensitivity in seedlings. In Arabidopsis, RRP7 localizes mainly to the nucleolus, the site of the 45S rDNA transcription that produces a 45S pre-rRNA primary transcript, precursor of the 25S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs. Lack of RRP7 function perturbs 18S rRNA maturation, causes nucleolar hypertrophy, and results in an increased 25S/18S rRNA ratio. Arabidopsis contains hundreds of 45S rDNA genes whose expression is epigenetically regulated, and deregulated, in <i>rrp7</i> mutants. Double mutant analysis revealed synergistic interactions between <i>RRP7</i> alleles and alleles of <i>MAS2</i>, <i>NUCLEOLIN1</i> (<i>NUC1</i>), and <i>HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6</i> (<i>HDA6</i>), which encode epigenetic regulators of 45S rDNA transcription. Our results reveal the evolutionarily conserved but divergent roles of RRP7 as a ribosome biogenesis factor.
