['34197643', 'Dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is associated with  heterochromatinization and transcriptional gene silencing in plants. The  activation of sets of genes by drought stress is correlated with reduced H3K9me2  levels, but the role of H3K9 methylation in the regulation of drought-stress  responses remains elusive. Here, we show that the Jumonji domain-containing H3K9  demethylase JMJ27 positively regulates drought-stress responses through its  histone demethylase activity. RNA-seq analysis identified JMJ27-regulated genes,  including positive regulators of drought stress GALACTINOL SYNTHASE 2 (GOLS2) and  RESPONSE TO DESICCATION 20 (RD20). Genetic analysis demonstrated that JMJ27  positively regulates drought-stress responses at least partly through GOLS2 and  RD20. JMJ27 directly associated with GOLS2 and RD20, and protected these loci  from silencing by reducing H3K9me2 levels under normal conditions. REGULATORY  PARTICLE NON-ATPASE 1a (RPN1a), a subunit of the 26S proteasome, interacted with  JMJ27 and negatively regulated JMJ27 accumulation. Drought stress diminished  RPN1a abundance, resulting in increased JMJ27 abundance. The drought  stress-promoted occupancy of JMJ27 at GOLS2 and RD20 chromatin may reinforce  their transcriptional induction by locally reducing the H3K9me2 levels. These  results indicate that the RPN1a-JMJ27 module precisely regulates dynamic H3K9me2  deposition plasticity, ensuring proper adaptation to drought stress in  Arabidopsis.', '2021 Oct', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.17593', 'ORCID:']
