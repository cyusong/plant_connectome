We tested the hypothesis that peroxisomal citrate synthase (CSY) is required for carbon transfer from peroxisomes to mitochondria during respiration of triacylglycerol in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Two genes encoding peroxisomal CSY are expressed in Arabidopsis seedlings, and seeds from plants with both CSY genes disrupted were dormant and did not metabolize triacylglycerol. Germination was achieved by removing the seed coat and supplying sucrose, but the seedlings still did not use triacylglycerol. The mutant seedlings were resistant to 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid, indicating a block in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and were unable to develop further after transfer to soil. The mutant phenotype was complemented with a cDNA encoding CSY with either its native peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS2) or a heterologous PTS1 sequence from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) malate synthase. These results suggest that peroxisomal CSY in Arabidopsis is not only a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle but also catalyzes an essential step in the respiration of fatty acids. We conclude that citrate is exported from the peroxisome during fatty acid respiration, whereas in yeast, acetylcarnitine is exported.
