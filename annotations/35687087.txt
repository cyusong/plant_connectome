Most mosses are colonized by nitrogen (N)-fixing cyanobacteria. This discovery is relatively recent, which can explain the large knowledge gaps the field is now tackling. For instance, while we have a good understanding of the abiotic controls (e.g. nutrient availability, increased temperature), we still do not know much about the biotic controls of N<sub>2</sub> fixation in mosses. I propose here that we should endeavour to position moss-cyanobacteria associations along the mutualism-parasitism continuum under varying abiotic conditions (e.g. nutrient availability). This would finally unravel the nature of the relationship between the partners and will be a big leap in our understanding of the evolution of plant-bacteria interactions using moss-cyanobacteria associations as a model system.

N-fixing cyanobacteria: !colonize! Most mosses
Abiotic controls: !influence! N<sub>2</sub> fixation in mosses
Mutualism-parasitism continuum: !position! Moss-cyanobacteria associations
Nutrient availability: !vary! Abiotic conditions
Moss-cyanobacteria associations: !model! Plant-bacteria interactions
