['18434608', 'During microsporogenesis, the microsporocyte (or microspore) plasma membrane  plays multiple roles in pollen wall development, including callose secretion,  primexine deposition, and exine pattern determination. However, plasma membrane  proteins that participate in these processes are still not well known. Here, we  report that a new gene, RUPTURED POLLEN GRAIN1 (RPG1), encodes a plasma membrane  protein and is required for exine pattern formation of microspores in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). The rpg1 mutant exhibits severely reduced male fertility  with an otherwise normal phenotype, which is largely due to the postmeiotic  abortion of microspores. Scanning electron microscopy examination showed that  exine pattern formation in the mutant is impaired, as sporopollenin is randomly  deposited on the pollen surface. Transmission electron microscopy examination  further revealed that the primexine formation of mutant microspores is aberrant  at the tetrad stage, which leads to defective sporopollenin deposition on  microspores and the locule wall. In addition, microspore rupture and cytoplasmic  leakage were evident in the rpg1 mutant, which indicates impaired cell integrity  of the mutant microspores. RPG1 encodes an MtN3/saliva family protein that is  integral to the plasma membrane. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that  RPG1 is strongly expressed in microsporocyte (or microspores) and tapetum during  male meiosis. The possible role of RPG1 in microsporogenesis is discussed.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.118026', 'Yang']
