A significant decrease in the amount of a protein, whose migration in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa and pI = 6.5, was observed in leaves of NaCl-treated Bruguiera parviflora (Roxb.) Wt. & Arn. ex Griff. seedlings. This particular salt-sensitive protein, designated as SSP-23, almost disappeared after 45 days of treatment in 400 mM NaCl as compared to untreated seedlings (0 mM NaCl) where the presence of the protein was significant. A polyclonal antibody raised against the 23-kDa protein was used to determine the subcellular localization of this protein in leaves by cross-reaction with proteins from isolated chloroplasts, mitochondria, peroxisomes and cytosol fractions on Western blots. SSP-23 was confirmed to be localized in the cytosol by immunoblotting. The disappearance of SSP-23 as a result of high NaCl treatment suggests that this protein is salt-sensitive and has a possible role in salt adaptation.
