Like all organisms, plants require energy for growth. They achieve this by absorbing light and fixing it into a usable, chemical form via photosynthesis. The resulting carbohydrate (sugar) energy is then utilized as substrates for growth, or stored as reserves. It is therefore not surprising that modulation of carbohydrate metabolism can have profound effects on plant growth, particularly cell division and expansion. However, recent studies on mutants such as stimpy or ramosa3 have also suggested that sugars can act as signalling molecules that control distinct aspects of plant development. This review will focus on these more specific roles of sugars in development, and will concentrate on two major areas: (i) cross-talk between sugar and hormonal signalling; and (ii) potential direct developmental effects of sugars. In the latter, developmental mutant phenotypes that are modulated by sugars as well as a putative role for trehalose-6-phosphate in inflorescence development are discussed. Because plant growth and development are plastic, and are greatly affected by environmental and nutritional conditions, the distinction between purely metabolic and specific developmental effects is somewhat blurred, but the focus will be on clear examples where sugar-related processes or molecules have been linked to known developmental mechanisms.
