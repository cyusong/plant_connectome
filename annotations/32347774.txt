Several fungal pathogens cause grape white rot disease and <i>Coniella vitis</i> is a predominant pathogen in Chinese vineyards. The disease occurs on leaves, vines, and fruit berries, leading to considerable yield losses and even to total destruction of vineyards. Here, we present the first Pacbio and Illumina-sequenced draft genome assembly of <i>C. vitis</i> QNYT13637 and its annotation. This genome sequence provides a unique resource that will be a powerful foundation for future research on exploring virulence-related genes, investigating the pathogenicity mechanism of the pathogen, and, finally, improvement of white rot disease management strategies.
