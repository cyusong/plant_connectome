Phospholipids make up the bulk of most eukaryotic cell membranes, but how their synthesis is regulated remains relatively poorly understood in plants. In our article1 we provide evidence that two Mg ( 2+) -dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzymes, called PAH1 and PAH2, are capable of repressing phospholipid biosynthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum in Arabidopsis thaliana. The precise mechanism of repression remains unclear and it does appear to vary in several respects from that already described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ( 2,3).

PAH1: !represses! phospholipid biosynthesis
PAH2: !represses! phospholipid biosynthesis
Mg ( 2+): !activates! PAH1 and PAH2
Saccharomyces cerevisiae: !differs from! Arabidopsis thaliana
