['22536829', 'Plant growth is strongly influenced by the presence of neighbors that compete for  light resources. In response to vegetational shading shade-intolerant plants such  as Arabidopsis display a suite of developmental responses known as the  shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS). The phytochrome B (phyB) photoreceptor is the  major light sensor to mediate this adaptive response. Control of the SAS occurs  in part with phyB, which controls protein abundance of phytochrome-interacting  factors 4 and 5 (PIF4 and PIF5) directly. The shade-avoidance response also  requires rapid biosynthesis of auxin and its transport to promote elongation  growth. The identification of genome-wide PIF5-binding sites during shade  avoidance revealed that this bHLH transcription factor regulates the expression  of a subset of previously identified SAS genes. Moreover our study suggests that  PIF4 and PIF5 regulate elongation growth by controlling directly the expression  of genes that code for auxin biosynthesis and auxin signaling components.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05033.x', 'Fankhauser']
