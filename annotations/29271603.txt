['29271603', 'Quantitative disease resistance (QDR) is the predominant form of resistance  against necrotrophic pathogens. The genes and mechanisms underlying QDR are not  well known. In the current study, the Arabidopsis-Alternaria brassicae  pathosystem was used to uncover the genetic architecture underlying resistance to  A. brassicae in a set of geographically diverse Arabidopsis accessions.  Arabidopsis accessions revealed a rich variation in the host responses to the  pathogen, varying from complete resistance to high susceptibility. Genome-wide  association (GWA) mapping revealed multiple regions to be associated with disease  resistance. A subset of genes prioritized on the basis of gene annotations and  evidence of transcriptional regulation in other biotic stresses was analysed  using a reverse genetics approach employing T-DNA insertion mutants. The mutants  of three genes, namely At1g06990 (GDSL-motif lipase), At3g25180 (CYP82G1) and  At5g37500 (GORK), displayed an enhanced susceptibility relative to the wild-type.  These genes are involved in the development of morphological phenotypes (stomatal  aperture) and secondary metabolite synthesis, thus defining some of the diverse  facets of quantitative resistance against A. brassicae.', '2018 Jul', 'Mol Plant Pathol', '10.1111/mpp.12654', 'Kaur']
