The distribution of essential metal ions over subcellular compartments for use as cofactors requires control of membrane transporters. PAA2/HMA8 is a copper-transporting P1B -type ATPase in the thylakoid membrane, required for the maturation of plastocyanin. When copper is highly available to the plant this transporter is degraded, which implies the action of a protease. In order to identify the proteolytic machinery responsible for PAA2/HMA8 turnover in Arabidopsis, mutant lines defective in five different chloroplast protease systems were analyzed. Plants defective in the chloroplast caseinolytic protease (Clp) system were specifically impaired in PAA2/HMA8 protein turnover on media containing elevated copper concentrations. However, the abundance of a core Clp component was not directly affected by copper. Furthermore, the expression and activity of both cytosolic and chloroplast-localized superoxide dismutases (SODs), which are known to be dependent on copper, were not altered in the clp mutants, indicating that the loss of PAA2/HMA8 turnover in these lines was not caused by a lack of stromal copper. The results suggest that copper excess in the stroma triggers selection of the thylakoid-localized PAA2 transporter for degradation by the Clp protease, but not several other chloroplast proteases, and support a novel role for this proteolytic system in cellular copper homeostasis.
