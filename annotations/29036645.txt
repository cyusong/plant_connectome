K+ is widely used by plant cells, whereas Na+ can easily reach toxic levels during plant growth, which typically occurs in saline environments; however, the effects and functions in the chloroplast have been only roughly estimated. Traditionally, the occurrence of ionic fluxes across the chloroplast envelope or the thylakoid membranes has been mostly deduced from physiological measurements or from knowledge of chloroplast metabolism. However, many of the proteins involved in these fluxes have not yet been characterized. Based on genomic and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses, we present a comprehensive compilation of genes encoding putative ion transporters and channels expressed in the chloroplasts of the moss Physcomitrella patens, with a special emphasis on those related to Na+ and K+ fluxes. Based on the functional characterization of nhad mutants, we also discuss the putative role of NHAD transporters in Na+ homeostasis and osmoregulation of this organelle and the putative contribution of chloroplasts to salt tolerance in this moss. We demonstrate that NaCl does not affect the chloroplast functionality in Physcomitrella despite significantly modifying expression of ionic transporters and cellular morphology, specifically the chloroplast ultrastructure, revealing a high starch accumulation. Additionally, NHAD transporters apparently do not play any essential roles in salt tolerance.
