Abscisic acid (ABA), auxin and nitrate are important signaling molecules that affect plant growth responses to the environment. The synthesis or metabolism of these compounds depends on the molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). We show that maize (Zea mays) viviparous10 (vp10) mutants have strong precocious germination and seedling lethal phenotypes that cannot be rescued with tissue culture. We devised a novel PCR-based method to clone a transposon-tagged allele of vp10, and show that Vp10 encodes the ortholog of Cnx1, which catalyzes the final common step of MoCo synthesis. The seedling phenotype of vp10 mutants is consistent with disruptions in ABA and auxin biosynthesis, as well as a disruption in nitrate metabolism. Levels of ABA and auxin are reduced in vp10 mutants, and vp10 seedlings lack MoCo-dependent enzyme activities that are repairable with exogenous molybdenum. vp10 and an Arabidopsis cnx1 mutant, chlorate6 (chl6), have similar defects in aldehyde oxidase (AO) enzyme activity, which is required for ABA synthesis. Surprisingly, chl6 mutants do not show defects in abiotic stress responses. These observations confirm an orthologous function for Cnx1 and Vp10, as well as defining a characteristic viviparous phenotype to identify other maize cnx mutants. Finally, the vp10 mutant phenotype suggests that cnx mutants can have auxin- as well as ABA-biosynthesis defects, while the chl6 mutant phenotype suggests that low levels of AO activity are sufficient for normal abiotic stress responses.
