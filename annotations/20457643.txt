Histone acetylation/deacetylation is a dynamic process and plays an important role in gene regulation. Histone acetylation homeostasis is regulated by antagonist actions of histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and deacetylases (HDAC). Plant genome encodes multiple HATs and HDACs. The Arabidopsis HAT gene AtGCN5/HAG1plays an essential role in many plant development processes, such as meristem function, cell differentiation, leaf and floral organogenesis, and responses to environmental conditions such as light and cold, indicating an important role of this HAT in the regulation of both long-term developmental switches and short-term inducible gene expression. AtGCN5 targets to a large number of promoters and is required for acetylation of several histone H3 lysine residues. Recruitment of AtGCN5 to target promoters is likely to be mediated by direct or indirect interaction with DNA-binding transcription factors and/or by interaction with acetylated histone lysine residues on the targets. Interplay between AtGCN5 and other HAT and HDAC is demonstrated to control specific regulatory pathways. Analysis of the role of AtGCN5 in light-inducible gene expression suggests a function of AtGCN5 in preparing chromatin commitment for priming inducible gene activation in plants.
