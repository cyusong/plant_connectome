We studied the transcriptional profiles of leaves and roots of three-leaf stage seedlings of the maize inbred line YQ7-96 under conditions of salt stress (100 mM NaCl) and removal of salt stress (RSS). A total of 296 genes were regulated specifically by the stress, of which 206 were specific to leaves and 90 were specific to roots. Stress-regulated genes were classified into eight and seven expression patterns for leaves and roots, respectively. There were 60 genes which were regulated specifically by RSS, 27 of which were specific to leaves and 33 specific to roots. No genes were found to be co-regulated in tissues and to be regulated commonly by the stress and RSS. It can be concluded that (i) at the early stage of the stress, transcriptional responses are directed at water deficit in maize leaves but at both water deficit and Na+ accumulation in roots; (ii) at the later stage, the responses in leaves and roots result from dual effects of both water deficit and Na+ accumulation; (iii) the polyamine metabolic pathway is an important linker for the co-ordination between leaves and roots to accomplish the tolerance of the whole maize plant to the stress; (iv) the stress can lead to genomic restructuring and nuclear transport in maize; (v) maize leaves are distinct from roots in terms of molecular mechanisms for responses to and growth recovery from the stress; and (vi) mechanisms for the maize responses to the stress differ from those for their growth recovery during RSS.
