Fruits of persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) accumulate large amounts of proanthocyanidins (PAs) in the early stages of development. Astringent (A)-type fruits remain rich in soluble PAs even after they reach full-mature stage, whereas non-astringent (NA)-type fruits lose these compounds before full maturation. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism of PA accumulation in this non-model species, we used suppression subtractive hybridization to identify transcripts accumulating differently in young fruits of A- and NA-type. Interestingly, only a few clones involved in PA biosynthesis were identified in A-NA libraries. Represented by multiple clones were those encoding a novel 1-Cys peroxiredoxin and a new member of family 1 glycosyltransferases. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed correlation of the amount of PAs and accumulation of transcripts encoding these proteins in young persimmon fruits. Furthermore, the new family 1 glycosyltransferase was produced in Escherichia coli and shown to efficiently catalyze galactosylation at 3-hydroxyl groups of several anthocyanidins and flavonols. These findings suggest a complex mechanism of PA accumulation in persimmon fruits.
