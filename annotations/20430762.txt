['20430762', 'Nitrate is frequently the major nitrogen source for plants and is generally  assimilated during the day. In the absence of light, nitrate can transiently  accumulate in the vacuolar lumen via tonoplast transporters. CLC-a, a member of  the CLC family of anion transporters, is critically involved in this nitrate  storage in the vacuole, while other CLC family members apparently have different  roles in diverse cell organelles. Here, CLC-b, a close relative of CLC-a, was  functionally expressed in oocytes and analyzed. CLC-b conducted strongly  outwardly rectifying anionic currents that were largest in the presence of  nitrate. Fluorescence ratio changes of oocytes loaded with a pH-dependent  fluorescent dye suggested that NO(-)(3) transport is associated with H(+)  exchange. CLC-b was localized at the tonoplast, as was CLC-c, when tagged with  the green fluorescent protein. CLC-b expression was strongest in young roots,  hypocotyl and cotyledons. The physiological role of CLC-b was analyzed using two  independent knock-out alleles. Both lines grew as the wild type in various  conditions. The total chloride and nitrate content was identical in clcb lines  and the wild type, potentially suggesting that mutants were able to compensate  the loss of CLC-b.', '2010 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcq062', 'Ludewig']
