Metabolite transport processes and primary metabolism are highly interconnected. This study examined the importance of source-to-sink nitrogen partitioning, and associated nitrogen metabolism for carbon capture, transport and usage. Specifically, Arabidopsis aap8 (AMINO ACID PERMEASE 8) mutant lines were analyzed to resolve the consequences of reduced amino acid phloem loading for source leaf carbon metabolism, sucrose phloem transport and sink development during vegetative and reproductive growth phase. Results showed that decreased amino acid transport had a negative effect on sink development of aap8 lines throughout the life cycle, leading to an overall decrease in plant biomass. During vegetative stage, photosynthesis and carbohydrate levels were decreased in aap8 leaves, while expression of carbon metabolism and transport genes, as well as sucrose phloem transport were not affected despite reduced sink strength. However, when aap8 plants transitioned to reproductive phase, carbon fixation and assimilation as well as sucrose partitioning to siliques were strongly decreased. Overall, this work demonstrates that phloem loading of nitrogen has varying implications for carbon fixation, assimilation and source-to-sink allocation depending on plant growth stage. It further suggests alterations in source-sink relationships, and regulation of carbon metabolism and transport by sink strength in a development-dependent manner.
