The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is a major phase change in angiosperms. In annual plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), this change is irreversible, and as such, the regulation of its timing must be tightly controlled. Plant hormone (phytohormone) signalling is known to regulate suites of morphogenic processes in Arabidopsis a role in flowering-time control is starting to emerge as one key-controlling step. This review focuses on experimental evidence in the Arabidopsis that both classical and newly described phytohormones serve within the signal network leading to a reproductive phase transition, as both positive and repressive elements, depending on the phytohormone and growth conditions. Examples of genetic and pharmacological experiments that implicate phytohormones as components of the floral-timing syndrome will be described. I hope that this review will serve as a primer for future research on the mechanisms of action for each respective phytohormone on the floral transition in Arabidopsis, and lead to further experimentation on the crosstalk that likely bridges between them.
