Root meristem activity is essential for root morphogenesis and adaptation, but the molecular mechanism regulating root meristem activity is not fully understood. Here, we identify an F-box family E3 ubiquitin ligase named SHORT PRIMARY ROOT (SHPR) that regulates primary root (PR) meristem activity and cell proliferation in rice. SHPR loss-of-function mutations impair PR elongation in rice. SHPR is involved in the formation of a SCF complex with the Oryza sativa SKP1-like protein OSK1/20. We show that SHPR interacts with Oryza sativa SEUSS-LIKE (OsSLK) in the nucleus and is required for OsSLK polyubiquitination and degradation by the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome system (UPS). Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSLK display a shorter PR phenotype, which are similar to the SHPR loss-of-function mutants. Genetic analysis suggests that SHPR promotes PR elongation in an OsSLK-dependent manner. Collectively, our study establishes SHPR as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets OsSLK for degradation, and uncovers a protein ubiquitination pathway as a mechanism for modulating root meristem activity in rice.
