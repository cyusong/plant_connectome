Hosts and pathogens are engaged in a continuous evolutionary struggle for physiological dominance. A major site of this struggle is the apoplast. In <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>-soybean interactions, PsXEG1, a pathogen-secreted apoplastic endoglucanase, is a key focal point of this struggle, and the subject of two layers of host defense and pathogen counterdefense. Here, we show that N-glycosylation of PsXEG1 represents an additional layer of this coevolutionary struggle, protecting PsXEG1 against a host apoplastic aspartic protease, GmAP5, that specifically targets PsXEG1. This posttranslational modification also attenuated binding by the previously described host inhibitor, GmGIP1. N-glycosylation of PsXEG1 at N174 and N190 inhibited binding and degradation by GmAP5 and was essential for <i>PsXEG1</i>'s full virulence contribution, except in GmAP5-silenced soybeans. Silencing of GmAP5 reduced soybean resistance against WT <i>P. sojae</i> but not against <i>PsXEG1</i> deletion strains of <i>P. sojae.</i> The crucial role of N-glycosylation within the three layers of defense and counterdefense centered on PsXEG1 highlight the critical importance of this conserved apoplastic effector and its posttranslational modification in <i>Phytophthora</i>-host coevolutionary conflict.
