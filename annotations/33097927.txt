In flowering plants, cell-cell communication between the compatible pollen grain/growing pollen tube and the pistil is an essential component for successful sexual reproduction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the later stages of this dialogue are mediated by several peptide ligands and receptors that guide pollen tubes to the ovules for the release of sperm cells. Despite a detailed understanding of these processes, a key gap remains regarding the nature of the regulators that function at the earlier stages which are essential steps leading to fertilization. Here, we report on new functions for A. thaliana Receptor-Like Kinase (RLK) genes belonging to the LRR-II and LRR-VIII-2 RLK subgroups in the female reproductive tract to regulate compatible pollen hydration and the early stages of pollen tube growth. Mutant pistils for the A. thaliana RKF1 gene cluster were observed to support reduced wild-type pollen hydration and, when combined with the SERK1 and SERK3/BAK1 mutations, reduced pollen tube travel distances occurred. As these mutant pistils displayed a wild-type morphology, we propose that the observed altered compatible pollen responses result from an impaired pollen-pistil dialogue at these early stages.

A. thaliana RLK genes: !regulate! compatible pollen hydration 
A. thaliana RKF1 gene cluster: !impairs! pollen-pistil dialogue 
SERK1 and SERK3/BAK1 mutations: !reduce! pollen tube travel distances
