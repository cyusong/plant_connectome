We investigated the promoter region of atx1, which encodes a copper chaperone in response to iron deficiency induction. Deletion analysis of the promoter region from the 5' and 3' ends revealed that the -532/-461 and -320/-276 regions were necessary and sufficient for iron deficiency-inducible expression. Further deletion analysis showed that two of the Fe deficiency-responsive elements (FeREs) localized within the -532/-511 and -306/-276 regions, in which AtxFeRE1 at -529/-515 (GTCGCACTGGCATGT) and AtxFeRE2 at -300/-286 (GCAGCGATGGCATTT) had been identified, respectively, with a conserved sequence of GNNGCNNTGGCATNT, differing from all known FeREs found in other organisms.
