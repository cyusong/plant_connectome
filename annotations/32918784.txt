['32918784', 'Gametophyte development is a pre-requisite for plant reproduction and seed yield;  therefore, studies of gametophyte development help us understand fundamental  biological questions and have potential applications in agriculture. The  biogenesis and dynamics of endomembrane compartments are critical for cell  survival, and their regulatory mechanisms are just beginning to be revealed.  Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide  sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein YKT61 is essential for both  male and female gametogenesis. By using clustered regularly interspaced short  palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based genome  editing, we demonstrated that male and female gametophytes carrying YKT61  loss-of-function alleles do not survive. Specifically, loss of YKT61 function  resulted in the arrest of male gametophytic development at pollen mitosis I and  the degeneration of female gametophytes. A three-base-pair deletion in YKT61 in  the ykt61-3 mutant resulted in a single-amino acid deletion in the longin domain  of YKT61; the resulting mutant protein does not interact with multiple SNAREs and  showed substantially reduced membrane association, suggesting that the N-terminal  longin domain of YKT61 plays multiple roles in its function. This study  demonstrates that Arabidopsis YKT61 is essential for male and female  gametogenesis and sets an example for functional characterization of essential  genes with the combination of Cas9-mediated editing and expression from a  Cas9-resistant transgene.', '2021 Apr', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13017', 'Zhang']
