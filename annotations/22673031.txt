Host-selective toxins (HSTs) produced by some strains of Alternaria alternata are selectively toxic to certain cultivars of plants. However, the role of HSTs in toxin-insensitive plants is currently unknown. Here, we studied the role of ACT-toxin using an ACT-toxin producing A. alternata strain SH20 and the ACT-toxin-insensitive plant rough lemon. Induction of some defense related genes in response to SH20 were faster or stronger than in response to the ACT-toxin deficient SH20 mutant. By sequencing subtractive PCR clones obtained from mRNA of rough lemon leaves inoculated with SH20 after subtraction with that of the ACT-toxin deficient SH20 mutant, we isolated the SH20-responsive genes in rough lemon. Among the SH20-responsive genes analyzed in this study, we isolated a terpene synthase (TPS) gene, RlemTPS3. We also determined that RlemTPS3 localizes to the chloroplast and produces the monoterpene geraniol.
