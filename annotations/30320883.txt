Timing (phenology) and amount (production) are two integral facets of root growth, and their shifts have profound influences on below-ground resource acquisition. However, the environmental control and the effects of nitrogen (N) deposition on the production and phenology of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots remain unclear. Using a 4 yr minirhizotron experiment, we explored the control of the production and three phenophases (initiation, peak, and cessation of growth) of ECM roots in two soil layers and investigated their dynamic responses to N addition in a seasonally dry subtropical Pinus elliottii forest. We found a stronger control of water availability on the production and a stronger control of temperature on the phenology of ECM roots under ambient conditions. Temperature was correlated positively with initiation and negatively with cessation, especially in the shallow layer. N addition did not affect the phenology of ECM roots but increased their production by modifying N and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry in the soil and foliage. Our findings suggest a greater sensitivity of production than phenology of ECM roots to N addition. The increased production of ECM roots under N addition could be driven by N-induced P limitation or some combination of below-ground resources (P, N, water).

water availability: !controls! production of ECM roots 
temperature: !controls! phenology of ECM roots 
N addition: !increases! production of ECM roots 
N addition: !does not affect! phenology of ECM roots 
N-induced P limitation: !drives! increased production of ECM roots 
combination of below-ground resources: !drives! increased production of ECM roots
