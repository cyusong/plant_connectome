The Arabidopsis thaliana inward-rectifier K(+) channel AKT1 plays an important role in root K(+) uptake. Recent results show that the calcineurin B-like (CBL)-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) 23-CBL1/9 complex activates AKT1 in the root to enhance K(+) uptake. In addition, this CIPK-CBL complex has been demonstrated to regulate stomatal movements and plant transpiration. However, a role for AKT1 in plant transpiration has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that disruption of AKT1 conferred an enhanced response to water stress in plants. Experiments performed in hydroponics showed that, when water potential was diminished by adding polyethylene glycol, akt1 adult plants lost less water than wild-type (WT) plants. Under long-term water stress in soil, adult akt1 plants displayed lower transpiration and less water consumption than WT plants. Finally, akt1 stomata closed more efficiently in response to ABA. Such results were also observed in cipk23 plants. The similar responses shown by cipk23 and akt1 plants to water stress denote that the regulation of AKT1 by CIPK23 may also take place in stomata and has a negative impact on plant performance under water stress conditions.
