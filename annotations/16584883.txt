['16584883', 'The actin cytoskeleton dynamically reorganizes the cytoplasm during cell  morphogenesis. The actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex is a potent nucleator  of actin filaments that controls a variety of endomembrane functions including  the endocytic internalization of plasma membrane , vacuole biogenesis ,  plasma-membrane protrusion in crawling cells , and membrane trafficking from the  Golgi . Therefore, Arp2/3 is an important signaling target during morphogenesis.  The evolutionarily conserved Rac-WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway links actin filament  nucleation to cell morphogenesis . WAVE translates Rac-GTP signals into Arp2/3  activation by regulating the stability and/or localization of the activator  subunit Scar/WAVE . The WAVE complex includes Sra1/PIR121/CYFIP1, Nap1/NAP125,  Abi-1/Abi-2, Brick1(Brk1)/HSPC300, and Scar/WAVE : Defining the in vivo function  of each subunit is an important step toward understanding this complicated  signaling pathway. Brk1/HSPC300 has been the most recalcitrant WAVE-complex  protein and has no known function. In this paper, we report that Arabidopsis  brick1 (brk1) is a member of the "distorted group" of trichome morphology  mutants, a group that defines a WAVE-ARP2/3 morphogenesis pathway . In this paper  we provide the first strong genetic and biochemical evidence that BRK1 is a  critical WAVE-complex subunit that selectively stabilizes the Arp2/3 activator  SCAR2.', '2006 May 9', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.061', 'Szymanski']
