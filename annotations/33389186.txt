We reviewed recent advances related to RIN4, including its involvement in the immune process through posttranslational modifications, PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity regulation, interaction with EXO70 and identification of RIN4-associated NLR proteins. RPM1-interacting protein 4 (RIN4) is a conserved plant immunity regulator that has been extensively studied and can be modified by pathogenic effector proteins. RIN4 plays an important role in both PTI and ETI. In this article, we review the functions of the two conserved NOI domains of RIN4, the C-terminal cysteine residues required for membrane localization and the sites targeted and modified by effector proteins during plant immunity. In addition, we discuss the effect of RIN4 on the stomatal virulence of pathogens via the regulation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, which is involved in the immune process through interactions with the exocyst subunit EXO70, and progress in the identification of RIN4-related R proteins in multiple species. This review provides new insights enhancing the current understanding of the immune function of RIN4.
