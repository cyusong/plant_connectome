Ensuring faithful homologous recombination in allopolyploids is essential to maintain optimal fertility of the species. Variation in the ability to control aberrant pairing between homoeologous chromosomes in Brassica napus has been identified. The current study exploited the extremes of such variation to identify genetic factors that differentiate newly resynthesised B. napus, which is inherently unstable, and established B. napus, which has adapted to largely control homoeologous recombination. A segregating B. napus mapping population was analysed utilising both cytogenetic observations and high-throughput genotyping to quantify the levels of homoeologous recombination. Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified that contributed to the control of homoeologous recombination in the important oilseed crop B. napus. One major QTL on BnaA9 contributed between 32 and 58% of the observed variation. This study is the first to assess homoeologous recombination and map associated QTLs resulting from deviations in normal pairing in allotetraploid B. napus. The identified QTL regions suggest candidate meiotic genes that could be manipulated in order to control this important trait and further allow the development of molecular markers to utilise this trait to exploit homoeologous recombination in a crop.
