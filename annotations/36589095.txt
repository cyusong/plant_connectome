Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is one of the most important food crops in the world with the greatest global production, and contributes to satiating the demands for human food, animal feed, and biofuels. With population growth and deteriorating environment, efficient and innovative breeding strategies to develop maize varieties with high yield and stress resistance are urgently needed to augment global food security and sustainable agriculture. CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome-editing technology (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated)) has emerged as an effective and powerful tool for plant science and crop improvement, and is likely to accelerate crop breeding in ways dissimilar to crossbreeding and transgenic technologies. In this review, we summarize the current applications and prospects of CRISPR-Cas technology in maize gene-function studies and the generation of new germplasm for increased yield, specialty corns, plant architecture, stress response, haploid induction, and male sterility. Optimization of gene editing and genetic transformation systems for maize is also briefly reviewed. Lastly, the challenges and new opportunities that arise with the use of the CRISPR-Cas technology for maize genetic improvement are discussed.
