Soil nutrient restrictions are the main environmental conditions limiting plant growth, development, yield, and quality. Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient, is one of the most significant factors that vastly restrains the growth and development of plants. Although the total P is rich in soil, its bio-available concentration is still unable to meet the requirements of plants. To maintain P homeostasis, plants have developed lots of intricate responsive and acclimatory mechanisms at different levels, which contribute to administering the acquisition of inorganic phosphate (Pi), translocation, remobilization, and recycling of Pi. In recent years, significant advances have been made in the exploration of the utilization of P in annual plants, while the research progress in woody perennial plants is still vague. In the meanwhile, compared to annual plants, relevant reviews about P utilization in woody perennial plants are scarce. Therefore, based on the importance of P in the growth and development of plants, we briefly reviewed the latest advances on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of plants to uphold P homeostasis, P sensing, and signaling, ion transporting and metabolic regulation, and proposed the possible sustainable management strategies to fasten the P cycle in modern agriculture and new directions for future studies.
