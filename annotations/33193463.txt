Abscisic acid (ABA) is a critical hormone for plant survival under water stress. In this study, large-scale mutants of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) were generated by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenesis, and an <i>improved root elongation under water-stress 1 (irew1)</i> mutant showing significantly enhanced root growth was isolated under a water potential gradient assay. Then, <i>irew1</i> and ABA-related mutants in <i>Arabidopsis</i> or tomato plants were observed under water potential gradient assay or water-deficient conditions. ABA pathway, Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, and primary root (PR) elongation rate were monitored in addition to DNA- and RNA-Seq analyses. We found that based on phenotyping and transcriptional analyses, <i>irew1</i> exhibited enhanced PR growth, ABA, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, compared to wild type subjected to water stress. Interestingly, exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> application enhanced PR growth of <i>irew1</i>, ABA-biosynthesis deficient mutants in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and tomato plants, in response to water potential gradients or water-deficient conditions. In combination with other ABA-related mutants and pharmacological studies, our results suggest that ABA is required for root elongation associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to water stress.
