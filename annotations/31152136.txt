['31152136', 'Tip-focused accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is tightly associated  with pollen tube growth and is thus critical for fertilization. However, it is  unclear how tip-growing cells establish such specific ROS localization.  Polyamines have been proposed to function in tip growth as precursors of the ROS,  hydrogen peroxide. The ABC transporter AtABCG28 may regulate ROS status, as it  contains multiple cysteine residues, a characteristic of proteins involved in ROS  homeostasis. In this study, we found that AtABCG28 was specifically expressed in  the mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. AtABCG28 was localized to secretory  vesicles inside the pollen tube that moved toward and fused with the plasma  membrane of the pollen tube tip. Knocking out AtABCG28 resulted in defective  pollen tube growth, failure to localize polyamine and ROS to the growing pollen  tube tip, and complete male sterility, whereas ectopic expression of this gene in  root hair could recover ROS accumulation at the tip and improved the growth under  high-pH conditions, which normally prevent ROS accumulation and tip growth.  Together, these data suggest that AtABCG28 is critical for localizing polyamine  and ROS at the growing tip. In addition, this function of AtABCG28 is likely to  protect the pollen tube from the cytotoxicity of polyamine and contribute to the  delivery of polyamine to the growing tip for incorporation into the expanding  cell wall.', '2019 Jun 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1902010116', 'ORCID:']
