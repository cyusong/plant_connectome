['20059736', 'Boron (B) is one of the essential nutrients for plant growth and reproduction.  Transcriptome analyses have identified genes regulated by B deficiency, but their  function mostly remains elusive. To identify the functions of B  deficiency-inducible genes, T-DNA insertion mutants of 10 B deficiency-induced  genes were obtained, and their growth properties in response to B conditions were  examined. Among the lines examined, mutants of the transcription factor WRKY6  showed growth defect compared with the wild-type under B deficiency, but not  under normal conditions. This growth defect was commonly observed among three  independently isolated wrky6 mutants. There was no significant difference in B  concentration between wrky6-3 and the wild-type. Promoter activity of WRKY6 was  induced around the root tip under B deficiency. These results established that  WRKY6 is a low-B-induced transcription factor gene that is essential for normal  root growth under low-B conditions. Transcriptome analysis around the root tip  identified WRKY6-regulated genes under B deficiency. Our findings represent the  first identification of a transcription factor involved in the response to B  deficiency.', '2010 May', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2010.01349.x', 'Fujiwara']
