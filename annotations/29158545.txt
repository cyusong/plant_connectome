Overexpression of complementary DNA represents the most commonly used gain-of-function approach for interrogating gene functions and for manipulating biological traits. However, this approach is challenging and inefficient for multigene expression due to increased labour for cloning, limited vector capacity, requirement of multiple promoters and terminators, and variable transgene expression levels. Synthetic transcriptional activators provide a promising alternative strategy for gene activation by tethering an autonomous transcription activation domain (TAD) to an intended gene promoter at the endogenous genomic locus through a programmable DNA-binding module. Among the known custom DNA-binding modules, the nuclease-dead Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (dCas9) protein, which recognizes a specific DNA target through base pairing between a synthetic guide RNA and DNA, outperforms zinc-finger proteins and transcription activator-like effectors, both of which target through protein-DNA interactions <sup>1</sup> . Recently, three potent dCas9-based transcriptional activation systems, namely VPR, SAM and SunTag, have been developed for animal cells <sup>2-6</sup> . However, an efficient dCas9-based transcriptional activation platform is still lacking for plant cells <sup>7-9</sup> . Here, we developed a new potent dCas9-TAD, named dCas9-TV, through plant cell-based screens. dCas9-TV confers far stronger transcriptional activation of single or multiple target genes than the routinely used dCas9-VP64 activator in both plant and mammalian cells.
