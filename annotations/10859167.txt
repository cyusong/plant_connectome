['10859167', 'Here we report a novel Arabidopsis dwarf mutant, fackel-J79, whose adult  morphology resembles that of brassinosteroid-deficient mutants but also displays  distorted embryos, supernumerary cotyledons, multiple shoot meristems, and  stunted roots. We cloned the FACKEL gene and found that it encodes a protein with  sequence similarity to both the human sterol reductase family and yeast C-14  sterol reductase and is preferentially expressed in actively growing cells.  Biochemical analysis indicates that the fk-J79 mutation results in deficient C-14  sterol reductase activity, abnormal sterol composition, and reduction of  brassinosteroids (BRs). Unlike other BR-deficient mutants, the defect of  hypocotyl elongation in fk-J79 cannot be corrected by exogenous BRs. The unique  phenotypes and sterol composition in fk-J79 indicate crucial roles of sterol  regulation and signaling in cell division and cell expansion in embryonic and  post-embryonic development in plants.', '2000 Jun 15', 'Genes Dev', None, 'Sheen']
