Plants growing in any particular geographical location are exposed to variable and diverse environmental conditions throughout their lifespan. The multifactorial environmental pressure resulted into evolution of plant adaptation and survival strategies requiring ability to integrate multiple signals that combine to yield specific responses. These adaptive responses enable plants to maintain their growth and development while acquiring tolerance to a variety of environmental conditions. An essential signaling cascade that incorporates a wide range of exogenous as well as endogenous stimuli is multistep phosphorelay (MSP). MSP mediates the signaling of essential plant hormones that balance growth, development, and environmental adaptation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which specific signals are recognized by a commonly-occurring pathway are not yet clearly understood. Here we summarize our knowledge on the latest model of multistep phosphorelay signaling in plants and the molecular mechanisms underlying the integration of multiple inputs including both hormonal (cytokinins, ethylene and abscisic acid) and environmental (light and temperature) signals into a common pathway. We provide an overview of abiotic stress responses mediated via MSP signaling that are both hormone-dependent and independent. We highlight the mutual interactions of key players such as sensor kinases of various substrate specificities including their downstream targets. These constitute a tightly interconnected signaling network, enabling timely adaptation by the plant to an ever-changing environment. Finally, we propose possible future directions in stress-oriented research on MSP signaling and highlight its potential importance for targeted crop breeding.
