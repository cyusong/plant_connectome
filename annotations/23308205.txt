['23308205', 'The Arabidopsis rugosa1 (rug1) mutant has irregularly shaped leaves and reduced  growth. In the absence of pathogens, leaves of rug1 plants have spontaneous  lesions reminiscent of those seen in lesion-mimic mutants; rug1 plants also  express cytological and molecular markers associated with defence against  pathogens. These rug1 phenotypes are made stronger by dark/light transitions. The  rug1 mutant also has delayed flowering time, upregulation of the floral repressor  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and downregulation of the flowering promoters FT and  SOC1/AGL20. Vernalization suppresses the late flowering phenotype of rug1 by  repressing FLC. Microarray analysis revealed that 280 nuclear genes are  differentially expressed between rug1 and wild type; almost a quarter of these  genes are involved in plant defence. In rug1, the auxin response is also affected  and several auxin-responsive genes are downregulated. We identified the RUG1 gene  by map-based cloning and found that it encodes porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD),  also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase, an enzyme of the tetrapyrrole  biosynthesis pathway, which produces chlorophyll, heme, siroheme and  phytochromobilin in plants. PBGD activity is reduced in rug1 plants, which  accumulate porphobilinogen. Our results indicate that Arabidopsis PBGD deficiency  impairs the porphyrin pathway and triggers constitutive activation of plant  defence mechanisms leading to leaf lesions and affecting vegetative and  reproductive development.', '2013', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0053378', 'Micol']
