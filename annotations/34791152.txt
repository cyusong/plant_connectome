Hydrated silica (SiO2·nH2O) aggregates in the root endodermis of grasses. Application of soluble silicates (Si) to roots is associated with variations in the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased tolerance to a broad range of stresses affecting ROS concentrations, and early lignin deposition. In sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), silica aggregation is patterned in an active silicification zone (ASZ) by a special type of aromatic material forming a spotted pattern. The deposition has a signature typical of lignin. Since lignin polymerization is mediated by ROS, we studied the formation of root lignin and silica controlled by ROS via modulating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations in the growth medium. Sorghum seedlings were grown hydroponically and supplemented with Si, H2O2, and KI, an ionic compound that catalyses H2O2 decomposition. Lignin and silica deposits in the endodermis were studied by histology, scanning electron and Raman microscopies. Cell wall composition was quantified by thermal gravimetric analysis. Endodermal H2O2 concentration correlated to the extent of lignin-like deposition along the root, but did not affect its patterning in spots. Our results show that the ASZ spots were necessary for root silica aggregation, and suggest that silicification is intensified under oxidative stress as a result of increased ASZ lignin-like deposition.
