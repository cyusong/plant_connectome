['18660432', 'CARM1/PRMT4 (for COACTIVATOR-ASSOCIATED ARGININE METHYLTRANSFERASE1/PROTEIN  ARGININE METHYLTRANSFERASE4) catalyzes asymmetric dimethylation on arginine  (Arg), and its functions in gene regulation is understood only in animal systems.  Here, we describe AtPRMT4a and AtPRMT4b as a pair of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) homologs of mammalian CARM1/PRMT4. Recombinant AtPRMT4a and AtPRMT4b  could asymmetrically dimethylate histone H3 at Arg-2, Arg-17, Arg-26, and myelin  basic protein in vitro. Both AtPRMT4a and AtPRMT4b exhibited nuclear as well as  cytoplasmic distribution and were expressed ubiquitously in all tissues  throughout development. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that  AtPRMT4a and AtPRMT4b could form homodimers and heterodimers in vitro, and  formation of the heterodimer was further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence  complementation. Simultaneous lesions in AtPRMT4a and AtPRMT4b genes led to  delayed flowering, whereas single mutations in either AtPRMT4a or AtPRMT4b did  not cause major developmental defects, indicating the redundancy of AtPRMT4a and  AtPRMT4b. Genetic analysis also indicated that atprmt4a atprmt4b double mutants  phenocopied autonomous pathway mutants. Finally, we found that asymmetric  methylation at Arg-17 of histone H3 was greatly reduced in atprmt4a atprmt4b  double mutants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AtPRMT4a and  AtPRMT4b are required for proper regulation of flowering time mainly through the  FLOWERING LOCUS C-dependent pathway.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.124727', 'Cao']
