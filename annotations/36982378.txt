Heavy-metal pollution represents a problem which has been widely discussed in recent years. The biological effects of heavy metals have been studied in both animals and plants, ranging from oxidative stress to genotoxicity. Plants, above all metal-tolerant species, have evolved a wide spectrum of strategies to counteract exposure to toxic metal concentrations. Among these strategies, the chelation and vacuolar sequestration of heavy metals are, after cell-wall immobilization, the first line of defence that prevent heavy metals from interacting with cell components. Furthermore, bryophytes activate a series of antioxidant non-enzymatic and enzymatic responses to counteract the effects of heavy metal in the cellular compartments. In this review, the role of non-protein thiol compounds and antioxidant molecules in bryophytes will be discussed.
