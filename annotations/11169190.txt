['11169190', 'Mutants at the BOTERO1 locus are affected in anisotropic growth in all  non-tip-growing cell types examined. Mutant cells are shorter and broader than  those of the wild type. Mutant inflorescence stems show a dramatically reduced  bending modulus and maximum stress at yield. Our observations of root epidermis  cells show that the cell expansion defect in bot1 is correlated with a defect in  the orientation of the cortical microtubules. We found that in cells within the  apical portion of the root, which roughly corresponds to the meristem,  microtubules were loosely organized and became much more highly aligned in  transverse arrays with increasing distance from the tip. Such a transition was  not observed in bot1. No defect in microtubule organization was observed in  kor-1, another mutant with a radial cell expansion defect. We also found that in  wild-type root epidermal cells, cessation of radial expansion precedes the  increased alignment of cortical microtubules into transverse arrays. Bot1 roots  still show a gravitropic response, which indicates that ordered cortical  microtubules are not required for differential growth during gravitropism.  Interestingly, the fact that in the mutant, these major changes in microtubule  organization cause relatively subtle changes in cell morphology, suggest that  other levels of control of growth anisotropy remain to be discovered. Together,  these observations suggest that BOT1 is required for organizing cortical  microtubules into transverse arrays in interphase cells, and that this  organization is required for consolidating, rather than initiating, changes in  the direction of cell expansion.', '2001 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.00946.x', 'Hofte']
