Porteresia coarctata (Syn = Oryza coarctata) is a tetraploid wild rice growing abundantly in the coastal region of India and some other Asian countries. The salt tolerance property of this mangrove associate has been dealt with by a number of workers earlier. The distinct morphology and leaf architecture enabling the plant to exclude salt is a characteristic feature of Porteresia in comparison with Oryza sp. A number of genes have been isolated and characterized from Porteresia that are related to the salt-tolerance property of the plant. Evidence have accumulated that some pathways critical to salt tolerance are in operation in Porteresia of which the inositol metabolic pathway has been recently elaborated. Some of the enzymes of Porteresia have been shown to function as salt-tolerant under in vitro studies giving a clue that this wild halophytic rice may have evolved genes and proteins capable of functioning under a salt environment. Bioprospecting of such genes and proteins coupled with genomic and proteomic approaches remain an exciting area of research in evaluating this plant as a model for salt tolerance for the rice plant.
