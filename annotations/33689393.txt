Alternaria brown spot (ABS), caused by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>, is an economically important fungal disease of citrus worldwide. The ABS pathogen <i>A. alternata</i> tangerine pathotype can produce a host-specific ACT toxin, which is regulated by ACT toxin gene cluster located in the conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC). Previously, we have assembled a draft genome of <i>A. alternata</i> tangerine pathotype strain Z7, which comprises 165 contigs. In this study, we report a chromosome-level genome assembly of <i>A. alternata</i> Z7 through the combination of Oxford Nanopore sequencing and Illumina sequencing technologies. The assembly of <i>A. alternata</i> Z7 had a total size of 34.28 Mb, with a GC content of 51.01% and contig N<sub>50</sub> of 3.08 Mb. The genome is encompassed 12,067 protein-coding genes, 34 ribosomal RNAs, and 107 transfer RNAs. Interestingly, <i>A. alternata</i> Z7 is composed of 10 essential chromosomes and 2 CDCs, which is consistent with the experimental evidences of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. To our best knowledge, this is the first chromosome-level genome assembly of <i>A. alternata</i>. In addition, a database for citrus-related <i>Alternaria</i> genomes has been established to provide public resources for the sequences, annotation and comparative genomics data of <i>Alternaria</i> spp. The improved genome sequence and annotation at the chromosome level is a significant step toward a better understanding of the pathogenicity of <i>A. alternata</i>. The database will be updated regularly whenever the genomes of newly isolated <i>Alternaria</i> spp. are available. The citrus-related <i>Alternaria</i> genomes database is open accessible through the Citrus Fungal Disease Database.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
