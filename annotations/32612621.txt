['32612621', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, the heterodimeric isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI) is  composed of a single large (IPMI LSU1) and one of three different small subunits  (IPMI SSU1 to 3). The function of IPMI is defined by the small subunits. IPMI  SSU1 is required for Leu biosynthesis and has previously also been proposed to be  involved in the first cycle of Met chain elongation, the first phase of the  synthesis of Met-derived glucosinolates. IPMI SSU2 and IPMI SSU3 participate in  the Met chain elongation pathway. Here, we investigate the role of the three IPMI  SSUs through the analysis of the role of the substrate recognition region  spanning five amino acids on the substrate specificity of IPMI SSU1. Furthermore,  we analyze in detail the expression pattern of fluorophore-tagged IPMI SSUs  throughout plant development. Our study shows that the substrate recognition  region that differs between IPMI SSU1 and the other two IMPI SSUs determines the  substrate preference of IPMI. Expression of IPMI SSU1 is spatially separated from  the expression of IPMI SSU2 and IPMI SSU3, and IPMI SSU1 is found in small  plastids, whereas IMPI SSU2 and SSU3 are found in chloroplasts. Our data show a  distinct role for IMPI SSU1 in Leu biosynthesis and for IMPI SSU2 and SSU3 in the  Met chain elongation pathway.', '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.00808', 'Binder']
