C(4) photosynthesis involves alterations to leaf development, cell biology and biochemistry. Different lineages of C(4) plants use varying mechanisms to generate the C(4) pathway. Although the biochemistry of C(4) photosynthesis was described around 20 years ago, the phylogenetic distance between Arabidopsis and the traditional C(4) models has not facilitated the transfer of knowledge from Arabidopsis research to understanding C(4) systems. We show that Cleome, a genus closely related to Arabidopsis, contains species spanning a developmental progression from C(3) to C(4) photosynthesis. The majority of species we assessed are C(3) plants but have increased venation in leaves. Three C(3) species have both increased venation and enlarged bundle sheath cells, and there is also a tendency to accumulate proteins and transcripts needed for C(4) photosynthesis. Cleome gynandra shows all the characteristics needed for efficient C(4) photosynthesis, including alterations to leaf biochemistry, cell biology and development, and belongs to the NAD-dependent malic enzyme subtype. Combined with its phylogenetic proximity to Arabidopsis, the developmental progression from C(3) to C(4) photosynthesis within the genus provides a potentially excellent new model to increase our understanding of C(4) photosynthesis, and provide insights into its evolution.
