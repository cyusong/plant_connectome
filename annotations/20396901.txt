['20396901', 'The 4SN-Tudor domain protein is an almost ubiquitous eukaryotic protein with four  Staphylococcal nuclease domains at the N terminus and a Tudor domain towards the  C terminus. It has been found that Tudor-SN protein has multiple roles in  governing gene expression during cell growth and development in animals. In  plant, although Tudor-SN orthologs have been found in rice, pea and Arabidopsis,  and are associated with cytoskeleton, their roles in growth and development are  poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the function of Arabidopsis  Tudor-SN protein, AtTudor. Our results indicated that the expression of AtTudor2  in seeds was evidently higher than in other tissues. Furthermore, we found that  the expression of a key enzyme for GA biosynthesis, AtGA20ox3, was downregulated  obviously in AtTudor2 T-DNA insertion mutant and AtTudor1/AtTudor2 RNAi  transgenic lines. Together, our results suggest that AtTudor2 is involved in GA  biosynthesis and seed germination of Arabidopsis.', '2010 Jun', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1167-0', 'Han']
