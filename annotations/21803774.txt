['21803774', 'AT1G78690, a gene found in Arabidopsis thaliana, has been reported to encode a  N-acyltransferase that transfers an acyl chain from acyl-CoA to the headgroup of  phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (N-acyl-PE).  Our investigation suggests that At1g78690p is not a PE-dependent  N-acyltransferase but is instead a lysoglycerophospholipid O-acyltransferase. We  overexpressed AT1G78690 in Escherichia coli, extracted the cellular lipids, and  identified the accumulating glycerophospholipid as acylphosphatidylglycerol  (acyl-PG). Electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry  (ESI-MS) analysis yielded [M - H](-) ions, corresponding by exact mass to acyl-PG  rather than N-acyl-PE. Collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (MS/MS)  yielded product ions consistent with acyl-PG. In addition, in vitro enzyme assays  using both (32)P- and (14)C-radiolabeled substrates showed that AT1G78690  acylates 1-acyllysophosphatidylethanolamine (1-acyllyso-PE) and  1-acyllysophosphatidylglycerol (1-acyllyso-PG), but not PE or  phosphatidylglycerol (PG), to form a diacylated product that co-migrates with PE  and PG, respectively. We analyzed the diacylated product formed by AT1G78690  using a combination of base hydrolysis, phospholipase D treatment, ESI-MS, and  MS/MS to show that AT1G78690 acylates the sn-2-position of 1-acyllyso-PE and  1-acyllyso-PG.', '2011 Sep 30', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111.269779', 'Garrett']
