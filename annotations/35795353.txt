MYB transcription factors (TFs) represent one of the biggest TF families in plants, being involved in various specific plant processes, such as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The implication of MYB TFs in the tolerance mechanisms to abiotic stress is particularly interesting for crop breeding, since environmental conditions can negatively affect growth and productivity. Wheat is a worldwide-cultivated cereal, and is a major source of plant-based proteins in human food. In particular, durum wheat plays an important role in global food security improvement, since its adaptation to hot and dry conditions constitutes the base for the success of wheat breeding programs in future. In the present study, a genome-wide identification of R2R3-MYB TFs in durum wheat was performed. MYB profile search and phylogenetic analyses based on homology with Arabidopsis and rice MYB TFs led to the identification of 233 R2R3-TdMYB (<i>Triticum durum</i> MYB). Three Poaceae-specific MYB clusters were detected, one of which had never been described before. The expression of eight selected genes under different abiotic stress conditions, revealed that most of them responded especially to salt and drought stress. Finally, gene regulatory network analyses led to the identification of 41 gene targets for three TdR2R3-MYBs that represent novel candidates for functional analyses. This study provides a detailed description of durum wheat R2R3-MYB genes and contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular response of durum wheat to unfavorable climate conditions.
