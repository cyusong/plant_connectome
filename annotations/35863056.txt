Plants utilize localized cell-surface and intracellular receptors to sense microbes and activate the influx of calcium, which serves as an important second messenger in eukaryotes to regulate cellular responses. However, the mechanisms through which plants decipher calcium influx to activate immune responses remain largely unknown. Here, we show that pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) trigger calcium-dependent phosphorylation of CAM-BINDING PROTEIN 60-LIKE G (CBP60g) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE5 (CPK5) phosphorylates CBP60g directly, thereby enhancing its transcription factor activity. TOUCH 3 (TCH3) and its homologs CALMODULIN (CAM) 1/4/6 and CPK4/5/6/11 are required for PAMP-induced CBP60g phosphorylation. TCH3 interferes with the auto-inhibitory region of CPK5 and promotes CPK5-mediated CBP60g phosphorylation. Furthermore, CPKs-mediated CBP60g phosphorylation positively regulates plant resistance to soil-borne fungal pathogens. These lines of evidence uncover a novel calcium signal decoding mechanism during plant immunity through which TCH3 relieves auto-inhibition of CPK5 to phosphorylate and activate CBP60g. The findings reveal cooperative interconnections between different types of calcium sensors in eukaryotes.
