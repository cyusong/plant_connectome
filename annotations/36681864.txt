Alkali stress is a major constraint for crop production in many regions of saline-alkali land. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which wheat responds to alkali stress. In this study, we identified a calcium ion-binding protein from wheat, TaCCD1, which is critical for regulating the plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated alkali stress response. PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity is closely related to alkali tolerance in the wheat variety Shanrong 4 (SR4). We found that two D-clade type 2C protein phosphatases, TaPP2C.D1 and TaPP2C.D8 (TaPP2C.D1/8), negatively modulate alkali stress tolerance by dephosphorylating the penultimate threonine residue (Thr926) of TaHA2 and thereby inhibiting PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Alkali stress induces the expression of TaCCD1 in SR4, and TaCCD1 interacts with TaSAUR215, an early auxin-responsive protein. These responses are both dependent on calcium signaling triggered by alkali stress. TaCCD1 enhances the inhibitory effect of TaSAUR215 on TaPP2C.D1/8 activity, thereby promoting the activity of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase TaHA2 and alkali stress tolerance in wheat. Functional and genetic analyses verified the effects of these genes in response to alkali stress, indicating that TaPP2C.D1/8 function downstream of TaSAUR215 and TaCCD1. Collectively, this study uncovers a new signaling pathway that regulates wheat responses to alkali stress, in which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent TaCCD1 cooperates with TaSAUR215 to enhance PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and alkali stress tolerance by inhibiting TaPP2C.D1/8-mediated dephosphorylation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase TaHA2 in wheat.
