In previous studies, we have shown that annual expression profiles of cambial and wood tissue with respect to the Shaker K+ channel PTORK correlate with cambial activity. To follow PTORK-gene activity on the cellular level, we isolated the respective promoter regions and generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the GUS gene under the control of the PTORK promoter. Cross-sections of petioles showed PTORK-driven signals predominantly in the xylem parenchyma surrounding the vessels and in the phloem. Antibodies raised against a unique N-terminal region of PTORK in histo-immunochemical analyses recognised this K+-release channel in growth-active poplar plants only. PTORK labelling was found in differentiating xylem cells (young fibres) and mature xylem (vessel-associated cells of the ray parenchyma). Patch-clamp measurements on fibre cell protoplasts, derived from young poplar twigs, identified outward-rectifying K+ channels as the major K+ conductance of this cell type, which resembled the biophysical properties of PTORK when expressed in Xenopus oocytes.
