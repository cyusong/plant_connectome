Pear is an important fruit tree that is widely distributed around the world. The first pear genome map was reported from our laboratory approximately 10 years ago. To further study global protein expression patterns in pear, we generated pear proteome data based on 24 major tissues. The tissue-resolved profiles provided evidence of the expression of 17 953 proteins. We identified 4294 new coding events and improved the pear genome annotation via the proteogenomic strategy based on 18 090 peptide spectra with peptide spectrum matches >1. Among the eight randomly selected new short coding open reading frames that were expressed in the style, four promoted and one inhibited the growth of pear pollen tubes. Based on gene coexpression module analysis, we explored the key genes associated with important agronomic traits, such as stone cell formation in fruits. The network regulating the synthesis of lignin, a major component of stone cells, was reconstructed, and receptor-like kinases were implicated as core factors in this regulatory network. Moreover, we constructed the online database PearEXP (http://www.peardb.org.cn) to enable access to the pear proteogenomic resources. This study provides a paradigm for in-depth proteogenomic studies of woody plants.
