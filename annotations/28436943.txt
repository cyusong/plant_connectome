['28436943', 'In a striking case of evolutionary convergence, polarized cell layers with  ring-like diffusion barriers have evolved in both plant and animal lineages  independently. In plants, ring-like Casparian strips become localized by the  CASPARIAN STRIP MEMBRANE DOMAIN PROTEINS (CASPs). The mechanism of this striking  localization, however, has remained enigmatic. Here we present a genetic screen  aimed at isolating determinants of CASP localization. One of the mutants, lord of  the rings 2 (lotr2)/exo70a1, displays dramatic de-localization of CASPs into  randomly localized microdomains. EXO70A1 is a subunit of the exocyst complex, a  central component of secretion in eukaryotes. Irradiation of EXO70 subunit genes  in plants has suggested specialization of this conserved complex. Intriguingly,  lotr2/exo70a1 does neither affect secretion of the CASPs, nor that of other  membrane proteins in the endodermis, thus separating exocyst activity in  localization from a general defect in secretion. Our results establish EXO70A1 as  a central player in Casparian strip formation, generating a transient positional  information that will be translated into a precisely localized cell wall  modification.', '2017 Apr 24', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/nplants.2017.58', 'Geldner']
