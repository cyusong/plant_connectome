['20023165', 'Cell proliferation is an important determinant of plant form, but little is known  about how developmental programs control cell division. Here, we describe the  role of microRNA miR396 in the coordination of cell proliferation in Arabidopsis  leaves. In leaf primordia, miR396 is expressed at low levels that steadily  increase during organ development. We found that miR396 antagonizes the  expression pattern of its targets, the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF)  transcription factors. miR396 accumulates preferentially in the distal part of  young developing leaves, restricting the expression of GRF2 to the proximal part  of the organ. This, in turn, coincides with the activity of the cell  proliferation marker CYCLINB1;1. We show that miR396 attenuates cell  proliferation in developing leaves, through the repression of GRF activity and a  decrease in the expression of cell cycle genes. We observed that the balance  between miR396 and the GRFs controls the final number of cells in leaves.  Furthermore, overexpression of miR396 in a mutant lacking GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR  1 severely compromises the shoot meristem. We found that miR396 is expressed at  low levels throughout the meristem, overlapping with the expression of its  target, GRF2. In addition, we show that miR396 can regulate cell proliferation  and the size of the meristem. Arabidopsis plants with an increased activity of  the transcription factor TCP4, which reduces cell proliferation in leaves, have  higher miR396 and lower GRF levels. These results implicate miR396 as a  significant module in the regulation of cell proliferation in plants.', '2010 Jan', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.043067', 'Palatnik']
