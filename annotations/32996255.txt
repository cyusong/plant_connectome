Allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) are two important members of P450 enzymes metabolizing hydroperoxy fatty acid to produce jasmonates and aldehydes respectively, which function in response to diverse environmental and developmental stimuli. However, their exact roles in soybean have not been clarified. In present study, we identified a lesion-mimic mutant in soybean named NT302, which exhibits etiolated phenotype together with chlorotic and spontaneous lesions on leaves at R3 podding stage. The underlying gene was identified as GmHPL encoding hydroperoxide lyase by map-based cloning strategy. Sequence analysis demonstrated that a single nucleotide mutation created a premature termination codon (Gln20-Ter), which resulted in a truncated GmHPL protein in NT302. GmHPL RNA was significantly reduced in NT302 mutant, while genes in AOS branch of the 13-LOX pathway were up-regulated in NT302. The mutant exhibited higher susceptibility to bacterial leaf pustule (BLP) disease, but increased resistance against common cutworm (CCW) pest. GmHPL was significantly induced in response to MeJA, wounding, and CCW in wild type soybean. Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) of GhHPL genes gave rise to similar lesion-mimic leaf phenotypes in upland cotton, coupled with upregulation of the expression of JA biosynthesis and JA-induced genes. Our study provides evidence that competition exist between HPL and AOS branches in 13-LOX pathway of the oxylipin metabolism in soybean, thereby plays essential roles in modulation of plant development and defense.
