Geminiviruses are ssDNA plant viruses that infect a wide range of crops. Since geminiviruses often infect terminally differentiated cells, they must induce cell cycle re-entry in order to replicate; until recently, only two viral proteins, the replication-associated protein Rep and the curtoviral pathogenicity factor C4, had been assigned a role in the restoration of cell competency. In a recent work, we demonstrated that C2 from Beet curly top virus activates the expression of host genes involved in DNA replication and/or control of the G2/M transition in a manner consistent with cell cycle re-entry. As expected, expression of BCTV C2 results in enhanced replication of DNA viruses. We conclude that BCTV C2 acts as a re-activator of the cell cycle in infected cells, enhancing the DNA replication competency and providing a cell environment favorable for replication of geminiviruses. Potential mechanisms for this novel function are discussed in light of our findings.
