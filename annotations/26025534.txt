['26025534', 'Stems are important for plants to grow erectly. In stems, sclerenchyma cells must  develop secondary cell walls to provide plants with physical support. The  secondary cell walls are mainly composed of lignin, xylan and cellulose.  Deficiency of overall stem development could cause weakened stems. Here we prove  that WRKY13 acts in stem development. The wrky13 mutants take on a weaker stem  phenotype. The number of sclerenchyma cells, stem diameter and the number of  vascular bundles were reduced in wrky13 mutants. Lignin-synthesis-related genes  were repressed in wrky13 mutants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays proved  that WRKY13 could directly bind to the promoter of NST2. Taken together, we  proposed that WRKY13 affected the overall development of stem. Identification of  the role of WRKY13 may help to resolve agricultural problems caused by weaker  stems.', '2015 Jul', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.04.004', 'Yu']
