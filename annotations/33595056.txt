The high-affinity K+ transporter HAK5 from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is essential for K+ acquisition and plant growth at low micromolar K+ concentrations. Despite its functional relevance in plant nutrition, information about functional domains of HAK5 is scarce. Its activity is enhanced by phosphorylation via the AtCIPK23/AtCBL1-9 complex. Based on the recently published three-dimensionalstructure of the bacterial ortholog KimA from Bacillus subtilis, we have modeled AtHAK5 and, by a mutational approach, identified residues G67, Y70, G71, D72, D201, and E312 as essential for transporter function. According to the structural model, residues D72, D201, and E312 may bind K+, whereas residues G67, Y70, and G71 may shape the selective filter for K+, which resembles that of K+shaker-like channels. In addition, we show that phosphorylation of residue S35 by AtCIPK23 is required for reaching maximal transport activity. Serial deletions of the AtHAK5 C-terminus disclosed the presence of an autoinhibitory domain located between residues 571 and 633 together with an AtCIPK23-dependent activation domain downstream of position 633. Presumably, autoinhibition of AtHAK5 is counteracted by phosphorylation of S35 by AtCIPK23. Our results provide a molecular model for K+ transport and describe CIPK-CBL-mediated regulation of plant HAK transporters.
