['25829440', 'Plant cells cannot rearrange their positions; therefore, sharp tissue boundaries  must be accurately programmed. Movement of the cell fate regulator SHORT-ROOT  from the stele to the ground tissue has been associated with transferring  positional information across tissue boundaries. The zinc finger BIRD protein  JACKDAW has been shown to constrain SHORT-ROOT movement to a single layer, and  other BIRD family proteins were postulated to counteract JACKDAW\'s role in  restricting SHORT-ROOT action range. Here, we report that regulation of  SHORT-ROOT movement requires additional BIRD proteins whose action is critical  for the establishment and maintenance of the boundary between stele and ground  tissue. We show that BIRD proteins act in concert and not in opposition. The  exploitation of asymmetric redundancies allows the separation of two BIRD  functions: constraining SHORT-ROOT spread through nuclear retention and  transcriptional regulation of key downstream SHORT-ROOT targets, including  SCARECROW and CYCLIND6. Our data indicate that BIRD proteins promote formative  divisions and tissue specification in the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem  ground tissue by tethering and regulating transcriptional competence of  SHORT-ROOT complexes. As a result, a tissue boundary is not "locked in" after  initial patterning like in many animal systems, but possesses considerable  developmental plasticity due to continuous reliance on mobile transcription  factors.', '2015 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.132407', 'Blilou']
