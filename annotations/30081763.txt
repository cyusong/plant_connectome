Plants have developed an internal timing mechanism, the circadian system, that serves to synchronise physiological and metabolic functions with daily cues such as dawn and dusk, and provides plants with an advantage in adapting to changing and challenging conditions. We have recently shown that the SAL1-PAP-XRN retrograde signalling pathway, which is proposed to regulate plant responses under stress conditions, also acts within the circadian system. Here we provide further evidence of circadian regulation by SAL1-PAP-XRN signalling, thereby affirming a link between molecular timekeeping and abiotic stress response mechanisms.
