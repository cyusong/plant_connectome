Cool season grasses associate asymptomatically with foliar <i>Epichloë</i> endophytic fungi in a symbiosis where <i>Epichloë</i> spp. protects the plant from a number of biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, many grass species can accumulate large quantities of silicon (Si), which also alleviates a similar range of stresses. While <i>Epichloë</i> endophytes may improve uptake of minerals and nutrients, their impact on Si is largely unknown. Likewise, the effect of Si availability on <i>Epichloë</i> colonization remains untested. To assess the bidirectional relationship, we grew tall fescue (<i>Festuca arundinacea</i>) and perennial ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>) hydroponically with or without Si. Grasses were associated with five different <i>Epichloë</i> endophyte strains [tall fescue: AR584 or wild type (WT); perennial ryegrass: AR37, AR1, or WT] or as <i>Epichloë</i>-free controls. Reciprocally beneficial effects were observed for tall fescue associations. Specifically, <i>Epichloë</i> presence increased Si concentration in the foliage of tall fescue by at least 31%, regardless of endophyte strain. In perennial ryegrass, an increase in foliar Si was observed only for plants associated with the AR37. <i>Epichloë</i> promotion of Si was (<i>i</i>) independent of responses in plant growth, and (<i>ii</i>) positively correlated with endophyte colonization, which lends support to an endophyte effect independent of their impacts on root growth. Moreover, <i>Epichloë</i> colonization in tall fescue increased by more than 60% in the presence of silicon; however, this was not observed in perennial ryegrass. The reciprocal benefits of <i>Epichloë</i>-endophytes and foliar Si accumulation reported here, especially for tall fescue, might further increase grass tolerance to stress.
