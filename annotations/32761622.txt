Traits are critical in predicting decomposition that fuels carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. However, our understanding of root trait-decomposition linkage, and especially its dependence on mycorrhizal type and environmental context, remains limited. We explored the control of morphological and chemical (carbon- and nutrient-related) traits over decomposition of absorptive roots in 30 tree species associated with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi in temperate and subtropical forests in China. Carbon-related traits (acid-unhydrolysable residue (AUR) and cellulose concentrations) had predominant control of root decomposition in AM species while nutrient-related traits (magnesium concentration) predominately controlled that in ECM species. Thicker absorptive roots decomposed faster in AM species as a result of their lower AUR concentrations, but more slowly in ECM angiosperm species potentially as a result of their higher magnesium concentrations. Root decomposition was linked to root nutrient economy in both forests while root diameter-decomposition coordination emerged only in the subtropical forest where root diameter and decomposition presented similar cross-species variations. Our findings suggest that root trait-decomposition linkages differ strongly with mycorrhizal type and environment, and that root diameter can predict decomposition but in opposing directions and with contrasting mechanisms for AM and ECM species.

AUR: !controls! root decomposition in AM species
Magnesium concentration: !controls! root decomposition in ECM species
Thicker absorptive roots: !decompose faster! in AM species
Thicker absorptive roots: !decompose slower! in ECM angiosperm species
Root decomposition: !linked to! root nutrient economy 
Root diameter: !predicts! decomposition in subtropical forest
