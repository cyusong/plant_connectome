In the present work, we present a proteomic analysis of weakly bound cell wall proteins (CWPs) in rice. CWPs from rice calli were extracted with mannitol/CaCl(2), followed by back extraction with water-saturated phenol. The isolated CWPs were evaluated for contamination by cytosolic proteins by measuring the enzymatic activity of an intracellular marker (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). This revealed the presence of low levels of intracellular proteins and a significant enrichment of CWPs, as compared to the total extract. Protein samples were digested in gels with trypsin and analyzed using the multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). A total of 292 proteins were identified, which included numerous classical CWPs and antioxidant proteins. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 72.6% of these proteins possessed a signal peptide, and a total of 198 proteins were determined to be CWPs in rice. Functional classification divided the extracellular proteins into different groups, including glycosyl hydrolases (23%), antioxidant proteins (12%), cell wall structure-related proteins (6%), metabolic pathways (9%), protein modifications (4%), defense (4%), and protease inhibitors (3%). Furthermore, comparative analysis of our identified rice CWPs with known Arabidopsis CWPs revealed 25 novel rice-specific CWPs. The study described here is an unprecedented large-scale analysis of CWPs in rice.
