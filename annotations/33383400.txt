Over the last years, the discovery of various natural and the development of a row of engineered CRISPR/Cas nucleases have made almost every site of plant genomes accessible for the induction of specific changes. Newly developed tools open up a wide range of possibilities for the induction of genetic variability, from changing a single bp to Mbps, and thus to fine-tune plant performance. Whereas early approaches focused on targeted mutagenesis, recently developed tools enable the induction of precise and predefined genomic modifications. The use of base editors allows the substitution of single nucleotides, whereas the use of prime editors and gene targeting methods enables the induction of larger sequence modifications from a few bases to several kbp. Recently, through CRISPR/Cas-mediated chromosome engineering, it became possible to induce heritable inversions and translocations in the Mbp range. Thus, a novel way of breaking and fixing genetic linkages has come into reach for breeders. In addition, sequence-specific recruitment of various factors involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation has been shown to provide an additional class of methods for the fine tuning of plant performance. In this review, we provide an overview of the most recent progress in the field of CRISPR/Cas-based tool development for plant genome engineering and try to evaluate the importance of these developments for breeding and biotechnological applications.
