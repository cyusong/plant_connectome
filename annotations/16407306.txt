['16407306', 'Functional characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana GAT1 in heterologous  expression systems, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes,  revealed that AtGAT1 (At1g08230) codes for an H(+)-driven, high affinity  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter. In addition to GABA, other  omega-aminofatty acids and butylamine are recognized. In contrast to the most  closely related proteins of the proline transporter family, proline and glycine  betaine are not transported by AtGAT1. AtGAT1 does not share sequence similarity  with any of the non-plant GABA transporters described so far, and analyses of  substrate selectivity and kinetic properties showed that AtGAT1-mediated  transport is similar but distinct from that of mammalian, bacterial, and S.  cerevisiae GABA transporters. Consistent with a role in GABA uptake into cells,  transient expression of AtGAT1/green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in  tobacco protoplasts revealed localization at the plasma membrane. In planta,  AtGAT1 expression was highest in flowers and under conditions of elevated GABA  concentrations such as wounding or senescence.', '2006 Mar 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M510766200', 'Rentsch']
