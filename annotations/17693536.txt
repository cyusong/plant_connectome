['17693536', 'Sugars such as glucose function as signal molecules that regulate gene  expression, growth, and development in plants, animals, and yeast. To understand  the molecular mechanisms of sugar responses, we isolated and characterized an  Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, high sugar response8 (hsr8), which enhances  sugar-responsive growth and gene expression. Light-grown hsr8 plants exhibited  increased starch and anthocyanin and reduced chlorophyll content in response to  glucose treatment. Dark-grown hsr8 seedlings showed glucose-hypersensitive  hypocotyl elongation and development. The HSR8 gene, isolated using map-based  cloning, was allelic to the MURUS4 (MUR4) gene involved in arabinose synthesis.  Dark-grown mur1 and mur3 seedlings also exhibited similar sugar responses to  hsr8/mur4. The sugar-hypersensitive phenotypes of hsr8/mur4, mur1, and mur3 were  rescued by boric acid, suggesting that alterations in the cell wall cause  hypersensitive sugar-responsive phenotypes. Genetic analysis showed that  sugar-hypersensitive responses in hsr8 mutants were suppressed by pleiotropic  regulatory locus1 (prl1), indicating that nucleus-localized PRL1 is required for  enhanced sugar responses in hsr8 mutant plants. Microarray analysis revealed that  the expression of many cell wall-related and sugar-responsive genes was altered  in mur4-1, and the expression of a significant proportion of these genes was  restored to wild-type levels in the mur4-1 prl1 double mutant. These findings  reveal a pathway that signals changes in the cell wall through PRL1 to altered  gene expression and sugar-responsive metabolic, growth, and developmental  changes.', '2007 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.049965', 'Bevan']
