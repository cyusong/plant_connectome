['32371543', 'Phytochromes are red (R) and far-red (FR) light photoreceptors in plants, and  PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are a group of basic helix-loop-helix  family transcription factors that play central roles in repressing  photomorphogenesis. Here, we report that MYB30, an R2R3-MYB family transcription  factor, acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that MYB30 preferentially interacts with the Pfr  (active) forms of the phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) holoproteins  and that MYB30 levels are induced by phyA and phyB in the light. It was  previously shown that phytochromes induce rapid phosphorylation and degradation  of PIFs upon R light exposure. Our current data indicate that MYB30 promotes PIF4  and PIF5 protein reaccumulation under prolonged R light irradiation by directly  binding to their promoters to induce their expression and by inhibiting the  interaction of PIF4 and PIF5 with the Pfr form of phyB. In addition, our data  indicate that MYB30 interacts with PIFs and that they act additively to repress  photomorphogenesis. In summary, our study demonstrates that MYB30 negatively  regulates Arabidopsis photomorphogenic development by acting to promote PIF4 and  PIF5 protein accumulation under prolonged R light irradiation, thus providing new  insights into the complicated but delicate control of PIFs in the responses of  plants to their dynamic light environment.', '2020 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00645', 'ORCID:']
