Here, the leaf photoacclimatory plasticity and efficiency of the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum were examined. Mesocosms were used to compare the variability induced by three light conditions, two leaf sections and the variability observed at the collection site. The study revealed an efficient photosynthetic light use at low irradiances, but limited photoacclimatory plasticity to increase maximum photosynthetic rates (P(max)) and saturation (E(k)) and compensation (E(c)) irradiances under high light irradiance. A strong, positive and linear association between the percentage of daylight hours above saturation and the relative maximum photochemical efficiency (F(V)/F(M)) reduction observed between basal and apical leaf sections was also found. The results indicate that T. testudinum leaves have a shade-adapted physiology. However, the large amount of heterotrophic biomass that this seagrass maintains may considerably increase plant respiratory demands and their minimum quantum requirements for growth (MQR). Although the MQR still needs to be quantified, it is hypothesized that the ecological success of this climax species in the oligotrophic and highly illuminated waters of the Caribbean may rely on the ability of the canopy to regulate the optimal leaf light environment and the morphological plasticity of the whole plant to enhance total leaf area and to reduce carbon respiratory losses.
