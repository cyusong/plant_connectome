Fleshy fruit undergo a novel developmental program that ends in the irreversible process of ripening and eventual tissue senescence. During this maturation process, fruit undergo numerous physiological, biochemical and structural alterations, making them more attractive to seed dispersal organisms. In addition, advanced or over-ripening and senescence, especially through tissue softening and eventual decay, render fruit susceptible to invasion by opportunistic pathogens. While ripening and senescence are often used interchangeably, the specific metabolic activities of each would suggest that ripening is a distinct process of fleshy fruits that precedes and may predispose the fruit to subsequent senescence.
