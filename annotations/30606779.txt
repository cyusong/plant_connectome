Chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling is essential for the coupled expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs) and plastid genes (PhAPGs) to ensure the functional status of chloroplasts (Cp) in plants. Although various signaling components involved in the process have been identified in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the biological relevance of such coordination remains an enigma. Here, we show that the uncoupled expression of PhANGs and PhAPGs contributes to the cell death in the <i>lesion simulating disease1</i> (<i>lsd1</i>) mutant of Arabidopsis. A daylength-dependent increase of salicylic acid (SA) appears to rapidly up-regulate a gene encoding SIGMA FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN1 (SIB1), a transcriptional coregulator, in <i>lsd1</i> before the onset of cell death. The dual targeting of SIB1 to the nucleus and the Cps leads to a simultaneous up-regulation of PhANGs and down-regulation of PhAPGs. Consequently, this disrupts the stoichiometry of photosynthetic proteins, especially in PSII, resulting in the generation of the highly reactive species singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) in Cps. Accordingly, inactivation of the nuclear-encoded Cp protein EXECUTER1, a putative <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> sensor, significantly attenuates the <i>lsd1</i>-conferred cell death. Together, these results provide a pathway from the SA- to the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-signaling pathway, which are intertwined via the uncoupled expression of PhANGs and PhAPGs, contributing to the lesion-mimicking cell death in <i>lsd1</i>.
