Encroachment of shrubs over large regions of arid and semi-arid grassland can affect grassland traits and growth under a background of increasing nitrogen (N) deposition. However, the effects of N input rates on species traits and the growth of shrubs on grasslands remain unclear. We examined the effects of six different N addition rates on the traits of <i>Leymus chinensis</i> in an Inner Mongolia grassland encroached by the leguminous shrub, <i>Caragana microphylla</i>. We randomly selected 20 healthy <i>L. chinensis</i> tillers within shrubs and 20 tillers between shrubs in each plot, measuring the plant height, number of leaves, leaf area, leaf N concentration per unit mass (LNC<sub>mass</sub>), and aboveground biomass. Our results showed that N addition significantly enhanced the LNC<sub>mass</sub> of <i>L. chinensis</i>. The aboveground biomass, heights, LNC<sub>mass</sub>, leaf area, and leaf number of plants within the shrubs were higher than those between shrubs. For <i>L. chinensis</i> growing between shrubs, the LNC<sub>mass</sub> and leaf area increased with N addition rates, leaf number and plant height had binomial linear relationships to N addition rates. However, the number of leaves, leaf areas and heights of plants within shrubs did not vary under various N addition rates. Structural Equation Modelling revealed N addition had an indirect effect on the leaf dry mass through the accumulation of LNC<sub>mass</sub>. These results indicate that the response of dominant species to N addition could be regulated by shrub encroachment and provide new insights into management of shrub encroached grassland in the context of N deposition.
