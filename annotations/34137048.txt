Recent studies on fine root functional traits proposed a root economics hypothesis where adaptations associated with mycorrhizal dependency strongly influence the organization of root traits, forming a dominant axis of trait covariation unique to roots. This conclusion, however, is based on tradeoffs of a few widely studied root traits. It is unknown how other functional traits fit into this mycorrhizal-collaboration gradient. Here, we provide a significant extension to the field of root ecology by examining how fine root secondary compounds coordinate with other root traits. We analyzed a dataset integrating compound-specific chemistry, morphology and anatomy of fine roots and leaves from 34 temperate tree species spanning major angiosperm lineages. Our data uncovered previously undocumented coordination where root chemistry, morphology and anatomy covary with each other. This coordination, aligned with mycorrhizal colonization, reflects tradeoffs between chemical protection and mycorrhizal dependency, and provides mechanistic support for the mycorrhizal-collaboration gradient. We also found remarkable phylogenetic structuring in root chemistry. These patterns were not mirrored by leaves. Furthermore, chemical protection was largely decoupled from the leaf economics spectrum. Our results unveil broad organization of root chemistry, demonstrate unique belowground adaptions, and suggest that root strategies and phylogeny could impact biogeochemical cycles through their links with root chemistry.
