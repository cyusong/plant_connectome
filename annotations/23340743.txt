Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. The rice-M. oryzae pathosystem has become a model in the study of plant-fungal interactions because of its scientific advancement and economic importance. Recent studies have identified a number of new pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and effectors from the blast fungus that trigger rice immune responses upon perception. Interaction analyses between avirulence effectors and their cognate resistance proteins have provided new insights into the molecular basis of plant-fungal interactions. In this review, we summarize the recent research on the characterization of those genes in both M. oryzae and rice that are important for the PAMP- and effector-triggered immunity recognition and signaling processes. We also discuss future directions for research that will further our understanding of this pathosystem.
