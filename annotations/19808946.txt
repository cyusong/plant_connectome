['19808946', 'To sense ambient light conditions in order to optimize their growth and  development, plants employ a battery of photoreceptors responsive to light  quality and quantity. Essential for the sensing of red and far-red (FR) light is  the phytochrome family of photoreceptors. Among them, phytochrome A is special  because it mediates responses to different light conditions, including both very  low fluences (very low fluence response [VLFR]) and high irradiances (high  irradiance response [HIR]). In contrast with the FR-HIR signaling pathway, in  which several intermediates of the signaling pathway have been identified,  specific components of the VLFR pathway remain unknown. Here, we describe owl1  (for orientation under very low fluences of light), a mutant that is specific for  the VLFR, suggesting that VLFR and HIR pathways are genetically distinct,  although some common mechanisms can be observed. OWL1 codes for a ubiquitous  J-domain protein essential for germination, cotyledon opening, hypocotyl  elongation, and deviation of the direction of hypocotyl growth from the vertical  under very low light conditions. Additionally, we observed a flowering phenotype  suggesting a role for the VLFR during the whole life cycle of a plant. OWL1  interacts with the basic helix-loop-helix HFR1 (LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED)  transcription factor, previously characterized as a component of the FR-HIR  pathway. Both proteins are involved in the agravitropic response under FR light.  We propose a central function of OWL1 in the VLFR pathway, which is essential for  plant survival under unfavorable light conditions.', '2009 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.066472', 'Bolle']
