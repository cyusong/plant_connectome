Rate of photosynthesis and related plant carbohydrate status are crucial factors affecting plant vigor. Sugars providing carbon and energy sources serve also as important signaling molecules governing plant growth and development through a complex regulatory network. These facts are often neglected when mixotrophic cultivation of plants in vitro is used, where artificial exogenous sugar supply hinders studies of metabolism as well as sugar-driven developmental processes. We compared the growth, selected gas-exchange parameters and sugar metabolism characteristics in four model plants, potato (Solanum tuberosum 'Lada'), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum 'Samsun'), rapeseed (Brassica napus 'Asgard') and strawberry (Fragaria vesca), under both photomixotrophic (PM) and photoautotrophic (PA) conditions. To ensure PA conditions, we used our improved sun caps that serve as gas and light permeable covers for cultivation vessels. We found bigger biomass accumulation, larger leaf areas, higher stomatal conductance and higher instantaneous water use efficiency and lower root sugar contents in PA plants compared to PM ones. However, for other characteristics (root biomass, root/shoot ratio, pigment contents, leaf sugar and starch levels and transpiration rates), a strong species-dependent reactions to the exogenous sugar supply was noted, which does not allow to create a general view on the overall impact of PM nutrition under in vitro conditions.
