We studied the production of xyloglucanase enzymes of pea and lettuce roots in the presence of saprobe and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The AM fungus Glomus mosseae and the saprobe fungi Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium oxysporum-126, Trichoderma harzianum, Penicillium chrysogenum, Pleurotus ostreatus and Aspergillus niger were used. G. mosseae increased the shoot and root dry weight of pea but not of lettuce. Most of the saprobe fungi increased the level of mycorrhization of pea and lettuce, but only P. chrysogenum and T. harzianum inoculated together with G. mosseae increased the dry weight of pea and lettuce respectively. The AM and saprobe fungi increased the production of xyloglucanases by plant roots. The level of xyloglucanase activities and the number of xyloglucanolytic isozymes in plants inoculated with G. mosseae and most of the saprobe fungi tested were higher than when both microorganisms were inoculated separately. The possible relationship between xylogucanase activities and the ability of AM and saprobe fungi to improve the dry weight and AM root colonization of plants was discussed.

G. mosseae: !increases! shoot and root dry weight of pea
G. mosseae: !increases! level of mycorrhization of pea and lettuce
P. chrysogenum, T. harzianum: !increase! dry weight of pea and lettuce respectively
AM, saprobe fungi: !increase! production of xyloglucanases by plant roots
AM, saprobe fungi: !increase! xylogucanase activities and number of isozymes in plants
xylogucanase activities: !related to! ability of AM and saprobe fungi to improve dry weight and AM root colonization of plants
