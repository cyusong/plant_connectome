['9774405', 'We report a novel plastidic NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1.1.37),  which is not redox-regulated in contrast to its NADP-specific counterpart (EC  1.1.1.82). Analysis of isoenzyme patterns revealed a single NAD-MDH associated  with highly purified chloroplasts isolated from Arabidopsis and spinach. A cDNA  clone encoding the novel enzyme was found in the Arabidopsis EST data base by  sorting all putative clones for NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase. A derived  amino acid sequence is very similar to mitochondrial and peroxisomal NAD-MDHs  within the region coding for the mature protein but possesses a 80-amino acid  long N-terminal domain with typical characteristics of a chloroplast transit  peptide. In vitro synthesized labeled precursor protein was imported into the  stroma of spinach chloroplasts and processed to a mature enzyme subunit of 34  kDa. Expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant enzyme exhibited the same  distinctive isoelectric point of 5.35 as the original enzyme from Arabidopsis  chloroplasts. Northern analysis revealed that the protein is expressed in both  autotrophic and heterotrophic tissues. The findings reported here indicate that  the "malate valve" operates not only in the illuminated chloroplasts but also in  dark chloroplasts and in heterotrophic plastids and is therefore a general  mechanism to maintain the optimal ratio between ATP and reducing equivalents in  plastids.', '1998 Oct 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.273.43.27927', 'Ocheretina']
