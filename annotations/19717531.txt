The waterlogging tolerance and the physiological responses to this stress were tested in seedlings of Fraxinus angustifolia, an ash tree inhabiting riparian forests, and two provenances of the closely related Fraxinus excelsior, one derived from a riparian forest (FER) and one from a mountainous region (FEM). Besides visible damage, physiological parameters reflecting adaptations of plants to waterlogging such as net CO(2) assimilation, alcoholic fermentation, and the concentrations of metabolites related to flooding responses were studied. Consistent with the higher flooding tolerance of F. angustifolia and FER compared with FEM, net assimilation remained unaffected in F. angustifolia, was slightly reduced in FER, but was strongly affected in FEM. Altered carbohydrate concentrations in the roots of the seedlings suggest differences in the ability to supply alcoholic fermentation with substrate during prolonged periods of soil anoxia. Another difference between the seedlings was connected to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt which resulted in alanine accumulation in the flooding-tolerant trees, but strong GABA accumulation in the more sensitive FEM seedlings. This finding indicates differences in GABA conversion into alanine which might result in an accumulation of phytotoxic levels of intermediates. Such provenance-specific differences in Common ash suggest that the selection of appropriate provenances is essential for forest management in flood-prone areas.

FER/FEM: !differ in! ability to supply alcoholic fermentation with substrate 
FER/FEM: !differ in! GABA conversion into alanine 
GABA shunt: !results in! alanine accumulation in tolerant trees 
GABA shunt: !results in! GABA accumulation in sensitive seedlings
