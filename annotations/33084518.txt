Heavy metal pollution is a major environmental stress affecting plant growth and development. The heavy metal cadmium inhibits various physiological processes in plants, including seed germination and seedling growth, photosynthesis, and antioxidation. Extensive research has been conducted on the toxic effects of Cd<sup>2+</sup> on plants and the mechanisms of Cd<sup>2+</sup> tolerance. Here, we review recent advancements in our understanding of the absorption, transport, and accumulation of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in plants and the mechanisms of Cd<sup>2+</sup> tolerance.
