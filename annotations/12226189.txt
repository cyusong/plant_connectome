['12226189', 'We report eight new mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana possessing altered leaf  morphology and epicuticular wax. These were isolated from a T-DNA-mutagenized  population using a visual screen for altered leaf reflectance, i.e. increased  glaucousness or glossiness. The mutants were placed into three distinct classes  based on alterations in overall plant morphology: knobhead (knb), bicentifolia  (bcf), and wax. The four knb mutants formed callus-like growths in the axillary  region of the rosette leaves and apical meristem, the two bcf mutants produced  hundreds of narrow leaves, and the two wax mutants had leaves and stems that were  more glossy than wild type and organs that fused during early development. Leaves  of knb and bcf were more glaucous and abnormally shaped than wild type.  Epicuticular wax crystals over knb and bcf leaf surfaces (where none were present  on wild type) likely contributed to their more glaucous appearance. In contrast,  the glossy appearance of the wax mutants was associated with a reduced  epicuticular wax load on both leaves and stems. One representative from each  phenotypic class was selected for detailed analyses of epicuticular wax  chemistry. All three lines, knb1, bcf1, and wax1, had dramatic alterations in the  total amounts and relative proportions of their leaf epicuticular wax  constituents.', '1996 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.2.377', 'Feldmann']
