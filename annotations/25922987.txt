['25922987', 'The acetylation level of histones on lysine residues regulated by histone  acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases plays an important but under-studied  role in the control of gene expression in plants. With the aim of characterizing  the Arabidopsis RPD3/HDA1 family histone deacetylase HDA5, we present evidence  showing that HDA5 displays deacetylase activity. Mutants defective in the  expression of HDA5 displayed a late-flowering phenotype. Expression of the  flowering repressor genes FLC and MAF1 was up-regulated in hda5 mutants.  Furthermore, the gene activation markers, histone H3 acetylation and H3K4  trimethylation on FLC and MAF1 chromatin were increased in hda5-1 mutants.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that HDA5 binds to the chromatin of  FLC and MAF1. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays and  co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that HDA5 interacts with FVE, FLD and HDA6,  indicating that these proteins are present in a protein complex involved in the  regulation of flowering time. Comparing gene expression profiles of hda5 and hda6  mutants by RNA-seq revealed that HDA5 and HDA6 co-regulate gene expression in  multiple development processes and pathways.', '2015 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12868', 'Wu']
