The first seedling or all-stage resistance (R) R gene against stripe rust isolated from Moro wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a map-based cloning approach was identified as Yr10. Clone 4B of this gene encodes a highly evolutionary-conserved and unique CC-NBS-LRR sequence. Clone 4E, a homolog of Yr10, but lacking transcription start site (TSS) and putative TATA-box and CAAT-box, is likely a non-expressed pseudogene. Clones 4B and 4E are 84% identical and divergent in the intron and the LRR domain. Gene silencing and transgenesis were used in conjunction with inoculation with differentially avirulent and virulent stripe rust strains to demonstrate Yr10 functionality. The Yr10 CC-NBS-LRR sequence is unique among known CC-NBS-LRR R genes in wheat but highly conserved homologs (E = 0.0) were identified in Aegilops tauschii and other monocots including Hordeum vulgare and Brachypodium distachyon. Related sequences were also identified in genomic databases of maize, rice, and in sorghum. This is the first report of a CC-NBS-LRR resistance gene in plants with limited homologies in its native host, but with numerous homologous R genes in related monocots that are either host or non-hosts for stripe rust. These results represent a unique example of gene evolution and dispersion across species.
