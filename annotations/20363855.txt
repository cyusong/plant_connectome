['20363855', 'The human Paf1 complex (Paf1C) subunit Parafibromin assists in mediating output  from the Wingless/Int signaling pathway, and dysfunction of the encoding gene  HRPT2 conditions specific cancer-related disease phenotypes. Here, we  characterize the organismal and molecular roles of PLANT HOMOLOGOUS TO  PARAFIBROMIN (PHP), the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog of  Parafibromin. PHP resides in an approximately 670-kD protein complex in nuclear  extracts, and physically interacts with other known Paf1C-related proteins in  vivo. In striking contrast to the developmental pleiotropy conferred by mutation  in other plant Paf1C component genes in Arabidopsis, loss of PHP specifically  conditioned accelerated phase transition from vegetative growth to flowering and  resulted in misregulation of a very limited subset of genes that included the  flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C. Those genes targeted by PHP were  distinguished from the bulk of Arabidopsis genes and other plant Paf1C targets by  strong enrichment for trimethylation of lysine-27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) within  chromatin. These findings suggest that PHP is a component of a plant Paf1C  protein in Arabidopsis, but has a more specialized role in modulating expression  of a subset of Paf1C targets.', '2010 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.155838', 'van']
