['9445479', 'Cellulose, an abundant, crystalline polysaccharide, is central to plant  morphogenesis and to many industries. Chemical and ultrastructural analyses  together with map-based cloning indicate that the RSW1 locus of Arabidopsis  encodes the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase. The cloned gene complements  the rsw1 mutant whose temperature-sensitive allele is changed in one amino acid.  The mutant allele causes a specific reduction in cellulose synthesis,  accumulation of noncrystalline beta-1,4-glucan, disassembly of cellulose  synthase, and widespread morphological abnormalities. Microfibril crystallization  may require proper assembly of the RSW1 gene product into synthase complexes  whereas glucan biosynthesis per se does not.', '1998 Jan 30', 'Science', '10.1126/science.279.5351.717', 'Williamson']
