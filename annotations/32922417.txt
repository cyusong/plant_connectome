It is well studied that potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) deficiency induced aberrant growth and development of plant and altered the expression of protein-coding genes. However, there are not too many systematic investigations on root development affected by K<sup>+</sup> deficiency, and there is no report on miRNA expression during K<sup>+</sup> deficiency in wheat. In this study, we found that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency significantly affected wheat seedling growth and development, evidenced by reduced plant biomass and small plant size. In wheat cultivar AK-58, up-ground shoots were more sensitive to K<sup>+</sup> deficiency than roots. K<sup>+</sup> deficiency did not significantly affect root vitality but affected root development, including root branching, root area, and root size. K<sup>+</sup> deficiency delayed seminal root emergence but enhanced seminal root elongation, total root length, and correspondingly total root surface area. K<sup>+</sup> deficiency also affected root and leaf respiration at the early exposure stage, but these effects were not observed at the later stage. One potential mechanism causing K<sup>+</sup> deficiency impacts is microRNAs (miRNAs), one important class of small regulatory RNAs. K<sup>+</sup> deficiency induced the aberrant expression of miRNAs and their targets, which further affected plant growth, development, and response to abiotic stresses, including K<sup>+</sup> deficiency. Thereby, this positive root adaption to K<sup>+</sup> deficiency is likely associated with the miRNA-involved regulation of root development.
