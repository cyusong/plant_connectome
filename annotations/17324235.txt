HKT-type transporters appear to play key roles in Na(+) accumulation and salt sensitivity in plants. In Arabidopsis HKT1;1 has been proposed to influx Na(+) into roots, recirculate Na(+) in the phloem and control root : shoot allocation of Na(+). We tested these hypotheses using (22)Na(+) flux measurements and ion accumulation assays in an hkt1;1 mutant and demonstrated that AtHKT1;1 contributes to the control of both root accumulation of Na(+) and retrieval of Na(+) from the xylem, but is not involved in root influx or recirculation in the phloem. Mathematical modelling indicated that the effects of the hkt1;1 mutation on root accumulation and xylem retrieval were independent. Although AtHKT1;1 has been implicated in regulation of K(+) transport and the hkt1;1 mutant showed altered net K(+) accumulation, (86)Rb(+) uptake was unaffected by the hkt1;1 mutation. The hkt1;1 mutation has been shown previously to rescue growth of the sos1 mutant on low K(+); however, HKT1;1 knockout did not alter K(+) or (86)Rb(+) accumulation in sos1.
