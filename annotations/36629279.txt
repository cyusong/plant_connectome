In a previous study we used asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation to determine the polymer mass (Mw), gyration radius (Rw) and the polydispersity index of glutenin polymers (GPs) in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Here, using the same multi-location trials (4 years, 11 locations, and 192 cultivars), we report the factors that are associated with the conformation (Conf) of the polymers, which is the slope of Log(Rw) versus a function of Log(Mw). We found that Conf varied between 0.285 and 0.740, it had low broad-sense heritability (H2=16.8), and it was significantly influenced by the temperature occurring over the last month of grain filling. Higher temperatures were found to increase Rw and the compactness and sphericity of GPs. Alleles for both high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits had a significant influence on the Conf value. Assuming a Gaussian distribution for Mw, the number of polymers present in wheat grains was computed for different kernel weights and protein concentrations, and it was found to exceed 1012 GPs per grain. Using atomic force microscopy and cryo-TEM, images of GPs were obtained for the first time. Under higher average temperature, GPs became larger and more spherical and consequently less prone to rapid hydrolysis. We propose some orientations that could be aimed at potentially reducing the impact of numerous GPs on people suffering from non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
