['9811794', 'Pathogen resistance (R) genes of the NBS-LRR class (for nucleotide binding site  and leucine-rich repeat) are found in many plant species and confer resistance to  a diverse spectrum of pathogens. Little is known about the mechanisms that drive  NBS-LRR gene evolution in the host-pathogen arms race. We cloned the RPP8 gene  (for resistance to Peronospora parasitica) and compared the structure of alleles  at this locus in resistant Landsberg erecta (Ler-0) and susceptible Columbia  (Col-0) accessions. RPP8-Ler encodes an NBS-LRR protein with a putative  N-terminal leucine zipper and is more closely related to previously cloned R  genes that confer resistance to bacterial pathogens than it is to other known RPP  genes. The RPP8 haplotype in Ler-0 contains the functional RPP8-Ler gene and a  nonfunctional homolog, RPH8A. In contrast, the rpp8 locus in Col-0 contains a  single chimeric gene, which was likely derived from unequal crossing over between  RPP8-Ler and RPH8A ancestors within a Ler-like haplotype. Sequence divergence  among RPP8 family members has been accelerated by positive selection on the  putative ligand binding region in the LRRs. These observations indicate that  NBS-LRR molecular evolution is driven by the same mechanisms that promote rapid  sequence diversification among other genes involved in non-self-recognition.', '1998 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.11.1861', 'Dangl']
