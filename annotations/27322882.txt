The large dynamic range of gene expression changes accompanying floral organ abscission can be explained by a molecular positive feedback loop that regulates the process. In short, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, positioned genetically downstream from the abscission receptor HAESA (HAE), phosphorylates the transcription factor, AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15), allowing HAE to be expressed. However, it is unknown which residues of AGL15 are phosphorylated and precisely how phosphorylation alters AGL15 function. Here we report that serine 231 and 257 of AGL15 are phosphorylated in floral receptacles. Effects of phosphorylation on AGL15 are discussed.

HAE: !regulates! AGL15
MAPK: !phosphorylates! AGL15
AGL15: !localizes to! floral receptacles
AGL15: !synthesizes! HAE
Serine 231/257: !phosphorylated by! MAPK
