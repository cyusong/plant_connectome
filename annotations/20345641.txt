['20345641', '*The Arabidopsis heat-intolerant 2 (hit2) mutant was isolated on the basis of its  impaired ability to withstand moderate heat stress (37 degrees C). Determination  of the genetic mutation that underlies the hit2 thermosensitive phenotype allowed  better understanding of the mechanisms by which plants cope with heat stress.  *Genetic analysis revealed that hit2 is a single recessive mutation. Map-based  cloning was used to identify the hit2 locus. The response of hit2 to other types  of heat stress was also investigated to characterize the protective role of HIT2.  *hit2 was defective in basal but not in acquired thermotolerance. hit2 was  sensitive to methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress, and the survival of hit2  seedlings in response to heat stress was affected by light conditions. The  mutated locus was located at the EXPORTIN1A (XPO1A) gene, which encodes a nuclear  transport receptor. Two T-DNA insertion lines, xpo1a-1 and xpo1a-3, exhibited the  same phenotypes as hit2. *The results provide evidence that Arabidopsis XPO1A is  dispensable for normal plant growth and development but is essential for  thermotolerance, in part by mediating the protection of plants against  heat-induced oxidative stress.', '2010 Jun', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03225.x', 'Wu']
