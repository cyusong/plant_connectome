The chloroplast genomes of angiosperms usually have a stable circular quadripartite structure that exhibits high consistency in genome size and gene order. As one of the most diverse genera of angiosperms, <i>Carex</i> is of great value for the study of evolutionary relationships and speciation within its genus, but the study of the structure of its chloroplast genome is limited due to its highly expanded and restructured genome with a large number of repeats. In this study, we provided a more detailed account of the chloroplast genomes of <i>Carex</i> using a hybrid assembly of second- and third-generation sequencing and examined structural variation within this genus. The study revealed that chloroplast genomes of four <i>Carex</i> species are significantly longer than that of most angiosperms and are characterized by high sequence rearrangement rates, low GC content and gene density, and increased repetitive sequences. The location of chloroplast genome structural variation in the species of <i>Carex</i> studied is closely related to the positions of long repeat sequences; this genus provides a typical example of chloroplast structural variation and expansion caused by long repeats. Phylogenetic relationships constructed based on the chloroplast protein-coding genes support the latest taxonomic system of <i>Carex</i>, while revealing that structural variation in the chloroplast genome of <i>Carex</i> may have some phylogenetic significance. Moreover, this study demonstrated a hybrid assembly approach based on long and short reads to analyze complex chloroplast genome assembly and also provided an important reference for the analysis of structural rearrangements of chloroplast genomes in other taxa.
