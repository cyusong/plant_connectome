<i>Colletotrichum siamense</i> causes fruit or foliar disease called anthracnose on a variety of plant hosts such as vegetables, fruits, ornamental plants, and others, including chili pepper, apple, American cranberry, mango, orange, papaya, guava, rubber plant, jasmine, coffee berry, and tea plants. Here, we report the first Illumina-sequenced draft genome assembly of <i>C. siamense</i> strain ICMP 18578 and its annotation. This genome sequence provides a unique resource that will be useful for future research on the evolution of <i>Colletotrichum</i> spp. and improvement of anthracnose management strategies.
