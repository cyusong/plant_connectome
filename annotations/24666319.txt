Adventitious rooting is an essential step in the vegetative propagation of economically important horticultural and woody species. Populus has emerged as an experimental model for studying processes that are important in tree growth and development. It is highly useful for molecular genetic analysis of adventitious roots in trees. In this short review, we will highlight the recent progress made in the identification of transcription factors involved in the control of adventitious rooting in woody species. Their regulation will be discussed.
