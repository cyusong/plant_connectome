Salicylic acid (SA), a defense hormone produced after pathogen challenge, is critical for plant immunity. Arabidopsis NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES 1 (NPR1) and its paralogs NPR3 and NPR4 can bind SA and mediate SA signal transduction. NPR1 functions as a transcriptional co-activator to promote defense gene expression, whereas NPR3 and NPR4 have been shown to function as negative regulators in the SA signaling pathway. Although the mechanism about NPR1 regulation has been well studied, how NPR3/NPR4 proteins are regulated in immune responses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the stability of NPR3/NPR4 is enhanced by SA. In the absence of pathogen challenge, NPR3/NPR4 are unstable and degraded by the 26S proteasome, whereas the increase in cellular SA levels upon pathogen infection suppresses NPR3/NPR4 degradation. We found that UBP12 and UBP13, two homologous deubiquitinases from a ubiquitin-specific protease subfamily, negatively regulate plant immunity by promoting NPR3/NPR4 stability. Our genetic results further showed that UBP12/UBP13-mediated immunity suppression is partially dependent on NPR3/NPR4 functions. By interacting with NPR3 in the nucleus in an SA-dependent manner, UBP12 and UBP13 remove ubiquitin from polyubiquitinated NPR3 to protect it from being degraded. The stabilization of NPR3/NPR4 promoted by UBP12/UBP13 is essential for negative regulation of basal and SA-induced immunity.
