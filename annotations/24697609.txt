K(+) channels are among the best-characterized classes of membrane protein in plants. Nevertheless, in-planta demonstrations of traits emerging from molecular characterizations have often been insufficient or lacking altogether. Such linkages are, however, critical to our basic understanding of plant nutrition and to addressing 'real-world' issues that are faced in environmental and agricultural settings. Here, we cover some of the recent advances in K(+) acquisition with particular focus on voltage-gated K(+) channel functioning and regulation in roots, and highlight where linkages to in-planta behavior have been successfully made and, conversely, where such linkages are yet to be made.
