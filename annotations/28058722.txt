Leaf mass per area (LMA) has been suggested to negatively affect the mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (g<sub>m</sub> ), which is the most limiting factor for area-based photosynthesis (A<sub>N</sub> ) in many Mediterranean sclerophyll species. However, despite their high LMA, these species have similar A<sub>N</sub> to plants from other biomes. Variations in other leaf anatomical traits, such as mesophyll and chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular air space (S<sub>m</sub> /S and S<sub>c</sub> /S), may offset the restrictions imposed by high LMA in g<sub>m</sub> and A<sub>N</sub> in these species. Seven sclerophyllous Mediterranean oaks from Europe/North Africa and North America with contrasting LMA were compared in terms of morphological, anatomical and photosynthetic traits. Mediterranean oaks showed specific differences in A<sub>N</sub> that go beyond the common morphological leaf traits reported for these species (reduced leaf area and thick leaves). These variations resulted mainly from the differences in g<sub>m</sub> , the most limiting factor for carbon assimilation in these species. Species with higher A<sub>N</sub> showed increased S<sub>c</sub> /S, which implies increased g<sub>m</sub> without changes in stomatal conductance. The occurrence of this anatomical adaptation at the cell level allowed evergreen oaks to reach A<sub>N</sub> values comparable to congeneric deciduous species despite their higher LMA.
