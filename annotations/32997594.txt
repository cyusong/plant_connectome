The oomycete <i>Phytopythium vexans</i> is a causative agent of patch canker, damping-off, and crown, stem, and root rot in many economically important plants. <i>P. vexans</i> HF1 was isolated in China, where it caused brown root rot of ramie, a fiber crop broadly cultivated in Asia. The genome of HF1 was sequenced by a combination of technologies producing short (Illumina HiSeq X) and long (PacBio RS) reads. The genome is 41.73 Mbp long, assembled into 44 contigs. It has a GC content of 58.17% and contains 13,051 predicted coding genes, including 1,461 putative virulence genes and 220 putative antimicrobial resistance genes. This genome sequence provides a resource for determining the molecular mechanisms of disease development in this pathosystem.
