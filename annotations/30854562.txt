Environmental stresses induce production of oxylipins synthesized by the two main biosynthetic branches, allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL). Here, we investigate how waterlogging-mediated alteration of AOS- and HPL-derived metabolic profile results in modulation of central metabolism and ultimately enhanced tolerance to this environmental stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. Waterlogging leads to increased levels of AOS- and HPL-derived metabolites, and studies of genotypes lacking either one or both branches further support the key function of these oxylipins in waterlogging tolerance. Targeted quantitative metabolic profiling revealed oxylipin-dependent alterations in selected primary metabolites, and glycolytic and citric acid cycle intermediates, as well as a prominent shift in sucrose cleavage, hexose activation, the methionine salvage pathway, shikimate pathway, antioxidant system, and energy metabolism in genotypes differing in the presence of one or both functional branches of the oxylipin biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, despite some distinct metabolic alterations caused specifically by individual branches, overexpression of HPL partially or fully alleviates the majority of altered metabolic profiles observed in AOS-depleted lines. Collectively, these data identify the key role of AOS- and HPL-derived oxylipins in altering central metabolism, and further provide a metabolic platform targeted at identification of gene candidates for enhancing plant tolerance to waterlogging.
