Extracellular RNA (exRNA) has long been considered as cellular waste that plants can degrade and utilize to recycle nutrients. However, recent findings highlight the need to reconsider the biological significance of RNAs found outside of plant cells. A handful of studies suggest that the exRNA repertoire, which turns out to be an extremely heterogenous group of non-coding RNAs, comprises species as small as a dozen nucleotides to hundreds of nucleotides long. They are found mostly in free form or associated with RNA-binding proteins, while very few are found inside extracellular vesicles (EVs). Despite their low abundance, small RNAs associated with EVs have been a focus of exRNA research due to their putative role in mediating trans-kingdom RNAi. Therefore, non-vesicular exRNAs have remained completely under the radar until very recently. Here we summarize our current knowledge of the RNA species that constitute the extracellular RNAome and discuss mechanisms that could explain the diversity of exRNAs, focusing not only on the potential mechanisms involved in RNA secretion but also on post-release processing of exRNAs. We will also share our thoughts on the putative roles of vesicular and extravesicular exRNAs in plant-pathogen interactions, intercellular communication, and other physiological processes in plants.
