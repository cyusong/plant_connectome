Plants have evolved a lignin-based Casparian strip (CS) in roots that restricts passive diffusion of mineral elements from the soil to the stele. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CS formation in rice (Oryza sativa), which contains a CS at both the exodermis and endodermis, are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CS formation at the rice endodermis is redundantly regulated by three MYELOBLASTOSIS (MYB) transcription factors, OsMYB36a, OsMYB36b, and OsMYB36c, that are highly expressed in root tips. Knockout of all three genes resulted in a complete absence of CS at the endodermis and retarded plant growth in hydroponic conditions and in soil. Compared with the wild-type, the triple mutants showed higher calcium (Ca) levels and lower Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, and Cd levels in shoots. High Ca supply further inhibited mutant growth and increased Ca levels in shoots. Transcriptome analysis identified 1,093 downstream genes regulated by OsMYB36a/b/c, including the key CS formation gene OsCASP1 and other genes that function in CS formation at the endodermis. Three OsMYB36s regulate OsCASP1 and OsESB1 expression by directly binding to MYB-binding motifs in their promoters. Our findings thus provide important insights into the mechanism of CS formation at the endodermis and the selective uptake of mineral elements in roots.
