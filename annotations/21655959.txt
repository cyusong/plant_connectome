['21655959', 'In plants, the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway provides precursors for the formation  of triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phytosterols and primary metabolites important  for cell integrity. Here, we have cloned the cDNA encoding enzymes catalysing the  final three steps of the MVA pathway from Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus  roseus), mevalonate kinase (MVK), 5-phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) and mevalonate  5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD). These cDNA were shown to functionally  complement MVA pathway deletion mutants in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Transient transformations of C. roseus cells with yellow fluorescent protein  (YFP)-fused constructs reveal that PMK and MVD are localised to the peroxisomes,  while MVK was cytosolic. These compartmentalisation results were confirmed using  the Arabidopsis thaliana MVK, PMK and MVD sequences fused to YFP. Based on these  observations and the arguments raised here we conclude that the final steps of  the plant MVA pathway are localised to the peroxisome.', '2011 Nov', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-011-1444-6', 'Clastre']
