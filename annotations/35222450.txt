Aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate the transport of water and small molecules across intrinsic membranes and play a critical role in abiotic stresses. In this study, 111, 54, and 56 candidate <i>AQP</i> genes were identified in <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> (AD<sub>1</sub>), <i>Gossypium arboreum</i> (A<sub>2</sub>), and <i>Gossypium raimondii</i> (D<sub>5</sub>), respectively, and were further classified into five subfamilies, namely, plasma intrinsic protein (PIP), tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP), nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP), small basic intrinsic protein (SIP), and uncategorized X intrinsic protein (XIP). Transcriptome analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed some high-expression <i>GhPIPs</i> and <i>GhTIPs</i> (PIP and TIP genes in <i>G. hirsutum</i>, respectively) in drought and salt stresses. <i>GhPIP2;7</i>-silenced plants decreased in the chlorophyll content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and peroxidase (POD) activity comparing the mock control (empty-vector) under 400 mM NaCl treatment, which indicated a positive regulatory role of <i>GhPIP2;7</i> in salt tolerance of cotton. The <i>GhTIP2;1</i>-silenced cotton plants were more sensitive to osmotic stress. <i>GhTIP2;1</i>-overexpressed plants exhibited less accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and malondialdehyde but higher proline content under osmotic stress. In summary, our study elucidates the positive regulatory roles of two <i>GhAQPs</i> (<i>GhPIP2;7</i> and <i>GhTIP2;1</i>) in salt and osmotic stress responses, respectively, and provides a new gene resource for future research.
