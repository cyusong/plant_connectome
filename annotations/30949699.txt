['30949699', "The DXO family of proteins participates in eukaryotic mRNA 5'-end quality  control, removal of non-canonical NAD+ cap and maturation of fungal rRNA  precursors. In this work, we characterize the Arabidopsis thaliana DXO homolog,  DXO1. We demonstrate that the plant-specific modification within the active site  negatively affects 5'-end capping surveillance properties of DXO1, but has only a  minor impact on its strong deNADding activity. Unexpectedly, catalytic activity  does not contribute to striking morphological and molecular aberrations observed  upon DXO1 knockout in plants, which include growth and pigmentation deficiency,  global transcriptomic changes and accumulation of RNA quality control siRNAs.  Conversely, these phenotypes depend on the plant-specific N-terminal extension of  DXO1. Pale-green coloration of DXO1-deficient plants and our RNA-seq data reveal  that DXO1 affects chloroplast-localized processes. We propose that DXO1 mediates  the connection between RNA turnover and retrograde chloroplast-to-nucleus  signaling independently of its deNADding properties.", '2019 May 21', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkz100', 'Kufel']
