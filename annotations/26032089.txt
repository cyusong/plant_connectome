Ginsenosides, the main pharmacologically active natural compounds in ginseng (Panax ginseng), are mostly the glycosylated products of protopanaxadiol (PPD) and protopanaxatriol (PPT). No uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (UGT), which catalyzes PPT to produce PPT-type ginsenosides, has yet been reported. Here, we show that UGTPg1, which has been demonstrated to regio-specifically glycosylate the C20-OH of PPD, also specifically glycosylates the C20-OH of PPT to produce bioactive ginsenoside F1. We report the characterization of four novel UGT genes isolated from P. ginseng, sharing high deduced amino acid identity (>84%) with UGTPg1. We demonstrate that UGTPg100 specifically glycosylates the C6-OH of PPT to produce bioactive ginsenoside Rh1, and UGTPg101 catalyzes PPT to produce F1, followed by the generation of ginsenoside Rg1 from F1. However, UGTPg102 and UGTPg103 were found to have no detectable activity on PPT. Through structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified several key amino acids of these UGTs that may play important roles in determining their activities and substrate regio-specificities. Moreover, we constructed yeast recombinants to biosynthesize F1 and Rh1 by introducing the genetically engineered PPT-producing pathway and UGTPg1 or UGTPg100. Our study reveals the possible biosynthetic pathways of PPT-type ginsenosides in Panax plants, and provides a sound manufacturing approach for bioactive PPT-type ginsenosides in yeast via synthetic biology strategies.
