['23382192', 'Chloroplast heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90C) represents a highly conserved  subfamily of the Hsp90 family of molecular chaperones whose function has not been  defined. We identified Hsp90C as a component that interacts with import  intermediates of nuclear-encoded preproteins during posttranslational import into  isolated chloroplasts. Hsp90C was specifically coprecipitated with a complex of  protein import components, including Tic110, Tic40, Toc75, Tic22, and the stromal  chaperones, Hsp93 and Hsp70. Radicicol, an inhibitor of Hsp90 ATPase activity,  reversibly inhibited the import of a variety of preproteins during translocation  across the inner envelope membrane, indicating that Hsp90C functions in membrane  translocation into the organelle. Hsp90C is encoded by a single gene in  Arabidopsis thaliana, and insertion mutations in the Hsp90C gene are embryo  lethal, indicating an essential function for the chaperone in plant viability. On  the basis of these results, we propose that Hsp90C functions within a chaperone  complex in the chloroplast stroma to facilitate membrane translocation during  protein import into the organelle.', '2013 Feb 19', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1219229110', 'Schnell']
