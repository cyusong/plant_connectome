['17963727', 'Bacterial cold shock proteins (CSPs) are RNA chaperones that unwind RNA secondary  structures. Arabidopsis COLD SHOCK DOMAIN PROTEIN2 (AtCSP2) contains a domain  that is shared with bacterial CSPs. Here we showed that AtCSP2 binds to RNA and  unwinds nucleic acid duplex. Heterologous expression of AtCSP2 complemented cold  sensitivity of an Escherichia coli csp quadruple mutant, indicating that AtCSP2  function as a RNA chaperone in E. coli. AtCSP2 mRNA and protein levels increased  during cold acclimation, but the protein accumulation was most prominent after 10  days of cold treatment. AtCSP2 promoter::GUS transgenic plants revealed that  AtCSP2 is expressed only in root and shoot apical regions during vegetative  growth but is expressed in reproductive organs such as pollens, ovules and  embryos. These data indicated that AtCSP2 is involved in developmental processes  as well as cold adaptation. Localization of AtCSP2::GFP in nucleolus and  cytoplasm suggested different nuclear and cytosolic RNA targets.', '2007 Dec 21', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.059', 'Imai']
