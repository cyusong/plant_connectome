['8521489', 'The Wassilewskija strain of Arabidopsis has four genes encoding the tryptophan  enzyme phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (PAI) located at three unlinked  sites. These four PAI genes are methylated over their regions of DNA homology.  When PAI copy number is reduced by deletion of two tandemly arrayed genes  (MePAI1-PAI4), a mutant with fluorescent, tryptophan-deficient phenotypes  results, because the two remaining methylated PAI genes (MePAI2 and MePAI3)  supply insufficient PAI activity. These two methylated genes can be inherited  through meiosis, even when they are segregated away from each other in crosses to  a strain with unmethylated PAI genes. However, the mutant phenotypes conferred by  the methylated PAI genes are unstable, and mutant plants yield occasional  revertant somatic sectors and progeny. Revertant lines display coordinately  reduced methylation of both PAI2 and PAI3, implying that this hypomethylation  acts in a concerted manner across the genome rather than at individual sites.', '1995 Dec 1', 'Cell', '10.1016/0092-8674(95)90185-x', 'Fink']
