Dormancy of hazel (Corylus avellana L.) seeds is alleviated by a chilling treatment during which cytological, hormonal, and biochemical changes occur. Phytic acid and phosphate mobilization have been examined during this treatment. Phytic acid accounted for 0.7% and up to 3.2% of dry weight in axiferous and cotyledonary tissue, respectively. Phytic acid levels in embryonic axes were reduced by 60% within the first 3 weeks of chilling, with little subsequent change, in contrast to warm-imbibed tissue where levels did not change significantly. In cotyledons, phytic acid was mobilized to a lesser extent. Phosphate levels expressed on a fresh weight basis remained almost unaltered suggesting either the operation of a homeostatic mechanism for intracellular concentration or rapid utilization due to active metabolism. Phytase activity increased during stratification in both axiferous and cotyledonary tissue. The initial rise observed was associated with dormancy alleviation, since it occurred before the realization of full germination potential by the seeds and not in warm-imbibed tissue. Protein bodies were isolated from hazel seeds by non-aqueous density gradients. Phytase activity was closely associated with the purified organelles, where phytic acid was located by light microscopy. Overall, these findings suggest that phytic acid mobilization by phytase and previously described processes associated with protein bodies, such as considerable proteolysis, are early participants in the plethora of events leading to seed dormancy relief and germination in hazel.
