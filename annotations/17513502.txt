The tomato Leu-rich repeat receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) has been implicated in both peptide (systemin) and steroid (brassinosteroid [BR]) hormone perception. In an attempt to dissect these signaling pathways, we show that transgenic expression of BRI1 can restore the dwarf phenotype of the tomato curl3 (cu3) mutation. Confirmation that BRI1 is involved in BR signaling is highlighted by the lack of BR binding to microsomal fractions made from cu3 mutants and the restoration of BR responsiveness following transformation with BRI1. In addition, wound and systemin responses in the cu3 mutants are functional, as assayed by proteinase inhibitor gene induction and rapid alkalinization of culture medium. However, we observed BRI1-dependent root elongation in response to systemin in Solanum pimpinellifolium. In addition, ethylene perception is required for normal systemin responses in roots. These data taken together suggest that cu3 is not defective in systemin-induced wound signaling and that systemin perception can occur via a non-BRI1 mechanism.
