The root endophytic fungus <i>Piriformospora indica</i> plays an important role in increasing abiotic stress tolerance of its host plants. To explore the impact of <i>P. indica</i> on freezing tolerance, <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings were co-cultivated with <i>P. indica</i> exposed to -6°C for 6 h. Freezing stress decreased the survival rate, electrolyte leakage, leaf temperature, water potential and chlorophyll fluorescence of <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants in comparison to the controls. <i>P. indica</i> colonizion reduced the negative effects of freezing, and the plants contained also higher amounts of soluble proteins, proline and ascorbic acid during the post-thaw recovery period (4°C; 12 h). In contrast, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and malondialdehyde levels were reduced in seedlings colonized by the fungus. The brassinolide (BR) and abscisic acid (ABA) levels dramatically increased and the transcript levels of several crucial freezing-stress related genes (<i>CBF</i>s, <i>COR</i>s, <i>BZR1, SAG1</i> and <i>PYL6</i>) were higher in inoculated plants during the post-thaw recovery period. Finally, inocculated mutants impaired in the freezing tolerance response (such as <i>ice1</i> for INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1, a crucial basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor for the cold-response pathway in <i>Arabidopsis, cbf1</i>, -2, -3 for C-REPEAT-Binding Factor, <i>cor47</i> and <i>-15</i> for COLD-REGULATED and <i>siz1</i> encoding the SUMO E3 LIGASE) showed better survival rates and higher expression levels of freezing-related target genes after freezing compared to the inocculated controls. Our results demonstrate that <i>P. indica</i> confers freezing tolerance and better post-thaw recovery in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and stimulates the expression of several genes involved in the CBF-dependent pathway.
