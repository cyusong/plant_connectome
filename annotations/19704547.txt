In this article, we propose that an organism's general architecture is of primary importance for its ability to perceive electromagnetic radiation. Animals develop mainly as volumes for internal assimilation and appendages to increase their mobility, while plants develop as surfaces to optimize interaction with the environment. As a consequence, the proportion of cells directly interacting with EMF radiation at the organism/environment interface is much higher in plants than it is in animals, making them especially suited to study EMF effects on life.
