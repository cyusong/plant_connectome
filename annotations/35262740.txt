Mitochondrial function depends on the RNA processing of mitochondrial gene transcripts by nucleus-encoded proteins. This posttranscriptional processing involves the large group of nuclear-encoded pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Mitochondrial processes represent a crucial part in animal immunity, but whether mitochondria play similar roles in plants remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of RESISTANCE TO PHYTOPHTHORA PARASITICA 7 (AtRTP7), a P-type PPR protein, in Arabidopsis thaliana and its conserved function in immunity to diverse pathogens across distantly related plant species. RTP7 affects the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) by participating in RNA splicing of nad7, which encodes a critical subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I, the largest of the four major components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. The enhanced resistance of rtp7 plants to Phytophthora parasitica is dependent on an elevated mROS burst, but might be independent from the ROS burst associated with plasma membrane-localized NADPH oxidases. Our study reveals the immune function of RTP7 and the defective processing of Complex I subunits in rtp7 plants resulted in enhanced resistance to both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens without affecting overall plant development.
