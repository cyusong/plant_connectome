WRKY protein is a unique transcription factor (TF) and plays an important role in the physiological processes of various stress responses and plant development. In this research, we obtained a WRKY TF gene from soybean by homologous cloning, and named it <i>GmWRKY45</i>. <i>GmWRKY45</i> is a nuclear protein containing a highly conserved WRKY domain and a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger structure, and mainly expressed in roots, flowers and pods of soybean. The quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that <i>GmWRKY45</i> was induced by phosphate starvation and salt stress. As compared with the wild type (WT), overexpression of <i>GmWRKY45</i> increased the adaptability of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> to phosphate starvation, which might be related to the enhancement of lateral root development. The phosphorus concentration, fresh weight and dry weight of <i>GmWRKY45</i>-overexpressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> were higher than those of WT under Pi-sufficient or Pi-deficient condition. Meantime, the expression of phosphate-responsive genes was affected in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis.</i> Furthermore, <i>GmWRKY45</i> improved the salt tolerance and changed fertility of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Under salt stress, we found the survival rate and soluble sugar content of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> were significantly higher than those of WT. In a conventional soil pot experiment, the transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> produced shorter silique, less and larger seeds than WT, these might be due to partial abortion of pollens. The overall results showed that <i>GmWRKY45</i> was not only involved in response to abiotic stress but also related to fertility, suggested that <i>GmWRKY45</i> had an elaborate regulatory system in plants.
