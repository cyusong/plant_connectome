Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) domain-containing proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome include the TIR-nucleotide binding site (TN) and TIR-unknown site/domain (TX) families. We investigated the function of these proteins. Transient overexpression of five TX and TN genes in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) induced chlorosis. This induced chlorosis was dependent on ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE1, a dependency conserved in both tobacco and Arabidopsis. Stable overexpression transgenic lines of TX and TN genes in Arabidopsis produced a variety of phenotypes associated with basal innate immune responses; these were correlated with elevated levels of salicylic acid. The TN protein AtTN10 interacted with the chloroplastic protein phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid screen; other TX and TN proteins interacted with nucleotide binding-leucine-rich repeat proteins and effector proteins, suggesting that TN proteins might act in guard complexes monitoring pathogen effectors.
