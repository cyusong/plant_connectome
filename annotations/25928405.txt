['25928405', "3' uridylation is increasingly recognized as a conserved RNA modification process  associated with RNA turnover in eukaryotes. 2'-O-methylation on the 3' terminal  ribose protects micro(mi)RNAs from 3' truncation and 3' uridylation in  Arabidopsis. Previously, we identified HESO1 as the nucleotidyl transferase that  uridylates most unmethylated miRNAs in vivo, but substantial 3' tailing of miRNAs  still remains in heso1 loss-of-function mutants. In this study, we found that  among nine other potential nucleotidyl transferases, UTP:RNA uridylyltransferase  1 (URT1) is the single most predominant nucleotidyl transferase that tails  miRNAs. URT1 and HESO1 prefer substrates with different 3' end nucleotides in  vitro and act cooperatively to tail different forms of the same miRNAs in vivo.  Moreover, both HESO1 and URT1 exhibit nucleotidyl transferase activity on  AGO1-bound miRNAs. Although these enzymes are able to add long tails to  AGO1-bound miRNAs, the tailed miRNAs remain associated with AGO1. Moreover,  tailing of AGO1-bound miRNA165/6 drastically reduces the slicing activity of  AGO1-miR165/6, suggesting that tailing reduces miRNA activity. However,  monouridylation of miR171a by URT1 endows the miRNA the ability to trigger the  biogenesis of secondary siRNAs. Therefore, 3' tailing could affect the activities  of miRNAs in addition to leading to miRNA degradation.", '2015 Apr', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005119', 'Chen']
