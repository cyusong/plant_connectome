['32769132', 'Plants have evolved sensitive signaling systems to fine-tune photomorphogenesis  in response to changing light environments. Light and low temperatures are known  to regulate the expression of the COLD REGULATED (COR) genes COR27 and COR28,  which influence the circadian clock, freezing tolerance, and flowering time. Blue  light stabilizes the COR27 and COR28 proteins, but the underlying mechanism is  unknown. We therefore performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using COR27- and COR28  as bait and identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1  (COP1) as an interactor. COR27 and COR28 physically interact with COP1, which is  in turn responsible for their degradation in the dark. Furthermore, COR27 and  COR28 promote hypocotyl elongation and act as negative regulators of  photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Genome-wide gene  expression analysis showed that HY5, COR27, and COR28 co-regulate many common  genes. COR27 interacts directly with HY5 and associates with the promoters of the  HY5 target genes HY5 and PIF4, then regulates their transcription together with  HY5. Our results demonstrate that COR27 and COR28 act as key regulators in the  COP1-HY5 regulatory hub, by regulating the transcription of HY5 target genes  together with HY5 to ensure proper skotomorphogenic growth in the dark and  photomorphogenic development in the light.', '2020 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.20.00195', 'ORCID:']
