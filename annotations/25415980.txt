['25415980', 'Seed dormancy determines germination timing and contributes to crop production  and the adaptation of natural populations to their environment. Our knowledge  about its regulation is limited. In a mutagenesis screen of a highly dormant  Arabidopsis thaliana line, the reduced dormancy5 (rdo5) mutant was isolated based  on its strongly reduced seed dormancy. Cloning of RDO5 showed that it encodes a  PP2C phosphatase. Several PP2C phosphatases belonging to clade A are involved in  abscisic acid signaling and control seed dormancy. However, RDO5 does not cluster  with clade A phosphatases, and abscisic acid levels and sensitivity are unaltered  in the rdo5 mutant. RDO5 transcript could only be detected in seeds and was most  abundant in dry seeds. RDO5 was found in cells throughout the embryo and is  located in the nucleus. A transcriptome analysis revealed that several genes  belonging to the conserved PUF family of RNA binding proteins, in particular  Arabidopsis PUMILIO9 (APUM9) and APUM11, showed strongly enhanced transcript  levels in rdo5 during seed imbibition. Further transgenic analyses indicated that  APUM9 reduces seed dormancy. Interestingly, reduction of APUM transcripts by RNA  interference complemented the reduced dormancy phenotype of rdo5, indicating that  RDO5 functions by suppressing APUM transcript levels.', '2014 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.132811', 'Soppe']
