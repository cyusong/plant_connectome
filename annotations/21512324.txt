Light-harvesting antenna system possesses an inherent property of photoprotection. The single-helix proteins found in cyanobacteria play role in photoprotection and/or pigment metabolism. The photoprotective functions are also manifested by the two- and four-helix proteins. The photoprotection mechanism evolved earlier to the mechanism of light-harvesting of the antenna complex. Here, the light-harvesting complex genes of photosystems I and II from Arabidopsis are enlisted, and almost similar set of genes are identified in rice. Also, the three-helix early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs), two-helix stress-enhanced proteins (SEPs), and one-helix high light-inducible proteins [one-helix proteins (OHPs)] are identified in rice. Interestingly, two independent genomic loci encoding PsbS protein are also identified with implications on additional mode of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanism in rice. A few additional LHC-related genes are also identified in rice (LOC_Os09g12540, LOC_Os02g03330). This is the first report of identification of light-harvesting complex genes and light-inducible genes in rice.
