In this review, we summarize the results of experiments that lead to altered levels of phytohormones in transgenic plants to improve plant productivity. The available data indicate that manipulating the level of phytohormones might also be a promising way to enhance the environmental stress tolerance of crop plants. In the regulation of the level of phytohormones, both biosynthesis and their catabolism pathways can be targeted for engineering purposes. Moreover, the signaling pathways of phytohormones should explored in this respect. In genetic modifications, conditional promoters must be developed to avoid undesired effects on growth. In order to find a practical application, the effects of genetic modifications should be further verified under field conditions and over a longer time scale.
