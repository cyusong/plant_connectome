Interactions of plant retrotransposons with different steps of biotic and abiotic stress-associated signaling cascades are still poorly understood. We perform here a finely tuned comparison of four tobacco retrotransposons (Tnt1, Tnt2, Queenti, and Tto1) responses to the plant elicitor cryptogein. We demonstrate that basal transcript levels in cell suspensions and plant leaves as well as the activation during the steps of defense signaling events are specific to each retrotransposon. Using antisense NtrbohD lines, we show that NtrbohD-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production might act as negative regulator of retrotransposon activation.

Tnt1: !responds to! cryptogein
Tnt2: !responds to! cryptogein
Queenti: !responds to! cryptogein
Tto1: !responds to! cryptogein
NtrbohD: !regulates! ROS production
ROS production: !inhibits! retrotransposon activation
