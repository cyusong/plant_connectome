The phytohormone ethylene plays crucial roles in the negative regulation of plant etiolated hypocotyl elongation. The microtubule cytoskeleton also participates in hypocotyl cell growth. However, it remains unclear if ethylene signaling-mediated etiolated hypocotyl elongation involves the microtubule cytoskeleton. In this study, we functionally identified the previously uncharacterized microtubule-associated protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 (WDL5) as a microtubule-stabilizing protein that plays a positive role in ethylene-regulated etiolated hypocotyl cell elongation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3, a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, directly targets and up-regulates WDL5. Etiolated hypocotyls from a WDL5 loss-of-function mutant (wdl5-1) were more insensitive to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid treatment than the wild type. Decreasing WDL5 expression partially rescued the shorter etiolated hypocotyl phenotype in the ethylene overproduction mutant eto1-1. Reorganization of cortical microtubules in etiolated hypocotyl cells from the wdl5-1 mutant was less sensitive to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid treatment. These findings indicate that WDL5 is an important participant in ethylene signaling inhibition of etiolated hypocotyl growth. This study reveals a mechanism involved in the ethylene regulation of microtubules through WDL5 to inhibit etiolated hypocotyl cell elongation.
