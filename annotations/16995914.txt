Here we examined several physiological properties of two near-isogenic lines of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum) that differ in grain cadmium accumulation, to identify the function of a gene locus that confers differential grain Cd concentrations. Time- and concentration-dependent uptake and translocation studies using 109Cd were conducted on nutrient solution-grown seedlings. Root extracts were analysed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry, gel filtration and capillary electrophoresis to determine the interaction between Cd and phytochelatins (PCs) in storage of Cd in roots. The two isolines did not differ in time- or concentration-dependent root Cd uptake, but the low grain-Cd-accumulating isoline showed decreased movement of Cd from roots to shoots. All buffer-soluble Cd extracted from roots of both isolines was in the form of a low-molecular-weight PC-containing complex. The data suggest that PC synthesis is not a limiting factor in the differential storage of Cd in roots, and that movement of Cd through the root and into the transpiration stream may be the cause of differential Cd partitioning in the two isolines.
