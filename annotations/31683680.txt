Genetic analysis of "InochinoIchi," an exceptionally large grain rice variety, was conducted through five continuous backcrosses with Koshihikari as a recurrent parent using the large grain F<sub>3</sub> plant in Koshihikari × Inochinoichi as a nonrecurrent parent. Thorough the F<sub>2</sub> and all BCnF<sub>2</sub> generations, large, medium, and small grain segregated in a 1:2:1 ratio, indicating that the large grain is controlled by a single allele. Mapping by using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with small grain homozygous segregants in the F<sub>2</sub> of Nipponbare × Inochinoichi, revealed linkage with around 7.7 Mb markers from the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 2. Whole-genome sequencing on a large grain isogenic Koshihikari (BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified a single nucleotide deletion in <i>GW2</i> gene, which is located 8.1 Mb from the end of chromosome 2, encoding a RING protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The <i>GW2</i>-integrated isogenic Koshihikari showed a 34% increase in thousand kernel weight compared to Koshihikari, while retaining a taste score of 80. We further developed a large grain/semi-dwarf isogenic Koshihikari integrated with <i>GW2</i> and the semidwarfing gene <i>d60</i>, which was found to be localized on chromosome 2. The combined genotype secured high yielding while providing robustness to withstand climate change, which can contribute to the New Green Revolution.
