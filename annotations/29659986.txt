In interactions between poleroviruses and their hosts, few cellular proteins have been identified that directly interact with the multifunctional virus P0 protein. To help explore the functions of P0, we identified a Brassica yellows virus genotype A (BrYV-A) P0BrA-interacting protein from Nicotiana benthamiana, Rubisco assembly factor 2 (NbRAF2), which localizes in the nucleus, cell periphery, chloroplasts, and stromules. We found that its C-terminal domain (amino acids 183-211) is required for self-interaction. A split ubiquitin membrane-bound yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that NbRAF2 interacted with P0BrA, and co-localized in the nucleus and at the cell periphery. Interestingly, the nuclear pool of NbRAF2 decreased in the presence of P0BrA and during BrYV-A infection, and the P0BrA-mediated reduction of nuclear NbRAF2 required dual localization of NbRAF2 in the chloroplasts and nucleus. Tobacco rattle virus-based virus-induced gene silencing of NbRAF2 promoted BrYV-A infection in N. benthamiana, and the overexpression of nuclear NbRAF2 inhibited BrYV-A accumulation. Potato leafroll virus P0PL also interacted with NbRAF2 and decreased its nuclear accumulation, indicating that NbRAF2 may be a common target of poleroviruses. These results suggest that nuclear NbRAF2 possesses antiviral activity against BrYV-A infection, and that BrYV-A P0BrA interacts with NbRAF2 and alters its localization pattern to facilitate virus infection.
