['18761637', '* In Arabidopsis, SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2 are two genes proposed to be involved in  high-affinity sulphate uptake from the soil solution. We address here the  specific issue of their functional redundancy for the uptake of sulphate and for  the accumulation of its toxic analogue selenate with regard to plant growth and  selenate tolerance. * Using the complete set of genotypes, including the  wild-type, each one of the single sultr1;1 and sultr1;2 mutants and the resulting  double sultr1;1-sultr1;2 mutant, we performed a detailed phenotypic analysis of  root length, shoot biomass, sulphate uptake, sulphate and selenate accumulation  and selenate tolerance. * The results all ordered the four different genotypes  according to the same functional hierarchy. Wild-type and sultr1;1 mutant plants  displayed similar phenotypes. By contrast, sultr1;1-sultr1;2 double-mutant plants  showed the most extreme phenotype and the sultr1;2 mutant displayed intermediate  performances. Additionally, the degree of selenate tolerance was directly related  to the seedling selenate content according to a single sigmoid regression curve  common to all the genotypes. * The SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2 genes display unequal  functional redundancy, which leaves open for SULTR1;1 the possibility of  displaying an additional function besides its role in sulphate membrane  transport.', '2008', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02604.x', 'Gosti']
