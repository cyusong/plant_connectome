['27559025', 'Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the committed step of de novo fatty  acid biosynthesis. In prokaryotes, green algae, and most plants, this enzyme is a  heteromeric complex requiring four different subunits for activity. The plant  complex is recalcitrant to conventional purification schemes and hence the  structure and composition of the full assembly have been unclear. In vivo  coimmunoprecipitation using subunit-specific antibodies identified a novel family  of proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana annotated as biotin/lipoyl attachment domain  containing (BADC) proteins. Results from yeast two-hybrid and coexpression in  Escherichia coli confirmed that all three BADC isoforms interact with the two  biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) isoforms of Arabidopsis ACCase. These  proteins resemble BCCP subunits but are not biotinylated due to a mutated  biotinylation motif. We demonstrate that BADC proteins significantly inhibit  ACCase activity in both E. coli and Arabidopsis. Targeted gene silencing of BADC  isoform 1 in Arabidopsis significantly increased seed oil content when normalized  to either mass or individual seed. We conclude the BADC proteins are ancestral  BCCPs that gained a new function as negative regulators of ACCase after initial  loss of the biotinylation motif. A functional model is proposed.', '2016 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00317', 'Thelen']
