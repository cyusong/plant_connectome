['32490347', 'As sessile organisms, plants must properly coordinate their growth and  developmental programs with changes in the environment. The integration of  exogenous environmental cues with endogenous plant hormone responses often occurs  through physical protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, a comprehensive  PPI network that mediates environmental and hormonal responses has not been  established. In this study, we initially cloned 113 phytohormone-related genes  and 29 light signaling components of Arabidopsis and then individually tested  their mutual interactions (in total 2,655 tests) using a yeast-two-hybrid  approach to ultimately identify 141 interactions. Based on these interaction  results, we next revealed the signaling cross talk between jasmonate and abscisic  acid by characterizing the JAZ1-PYL4 and JAZ1-ABI1 interactions. Thus, we  generated a useful resource for the community to explore the molecular mechanisms  underlying signaling interactions between plant hormones and/or with light.', '2020 May', 'Plant Direct', '10.1002/pld3.228', 'ORCID:']
