Photoperiod sensitivity is a dominant determinant for the phase transition in cereal crops. <i>CCT</i> (<i>CONSTANS, CO-like, and TOC1</i>) transcription factors (TFs) are involved in many physiological functions including the regulation of the photoperiodic flowering. However, the functional roles of <i>CCT</i> TFs have not been elucidated in the wild progenitors of crops. In this study, we identified 41 <i>CCT</i> TFs, including 19 <i>CMF</i>, 17 <i>COL</i>, and five <i>PRR</i> TFs in <i>Oryza rufipogon</i>, the presumed wild ancestor of Asian cultivated rice. There are thirty-eight orthologous <i>CCT</i> genes in <i>Oryza sativa</i>, of which ten pairs of duplicated <i>CCT</i> TFs are shared with <i>O. rufipogon</i>. We investigated daily expression patterns, showing that 36 <i>OrCCT</i> genes exhibited circadian rhythmic expression. A total of thirteen <i>OrCCT</i> genes were identified as putative flowering suppressors in <i>O. rufipogon</i> based on rhythmic and developmental expression patterns and transgenic phenotypes. We propose that <i>OrCCT08</i>, <i>OrCCT24</i>, and <i>OrCCT26</i> are the strong functional alleles of rice <i>DTH2</i>, <i>Ghd7</i>, and <i>OsPRR37</i>, respectively. The SD treatment at 80 DAG stimulated flowering of the LD-grown <i>O. rufipogon</i> plants. Our results further showed that the nine <i>OrCCT</i> genes were significantly downregulated under the treatment. Our findings would provide valuable information for the construction of photoperiodic flowering regulatory network and functional characterization of the <i>CCT</i> TFs in both <i>O. rufipogon</i> and <i>O. sativa</i>.
