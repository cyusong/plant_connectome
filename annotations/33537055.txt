Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) are channels facilitating the passive diffusion of water and small solutes. Arabidopsis PIP2;7 trafficking occurs through physical interaction with SNARE proteins including the syntaxin SYP121, a plasma membrane Qa-SNARE involved in membrane fusion. To better understand the interaction mechanism, we aimed at identifying the interaction motifs in SYP121 and PIP2;7 using ratiometric bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. SYP121 consists of four regions, N, H, Q, and C, and sequential deletions revealed that the C region, containing the transmembrane domain, as well as the H and Q regions, containing the Habc and Qa-SNARE functional domains, interact with PIP2;7. Neither the linker between the Habc and the Qa-SNARE domains nor the H or Q regions alone could fully restore the interaction with PIP2;7, suggesting that the interacting motif depends on the conformation taken by the HQ region. When investigating the interacting motif(s) in PIP2;7, we observed that deletion of the cytosolic N- and/or C- terminus led to a significant decrease in the interaction with SYP121. Shorter deletions revealed that at the N-terminal amino acid residues 18-26 were involved in the interaction. Domain swapping experiments between PIP2;7 and PIP2;6, a PIP isoform that does not interact with SYP121, showed that PIP2;7 N-terminal part up to the loop C was required to restore the full interaction signal, suggesting that, as it is the case for SYP121, the interaction motif(s) in PIP2;7 depend on the protein conformation. Finally, we also showed that PIP2;7 physically interacted with other Arabidopsis SYP1s and SYP121 orthologs.
