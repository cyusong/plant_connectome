Transferring the genome of distant species to crops is an efficient way to create new germplasms. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. In this study, a new rice restorer line R21 with heat tolerance was created by introgressing the genomic DNA of sorghum into the recipient restorer line Jin Hui 1. Assembly of rice R21 and Jin Hui 1 genomes was performed using PacBio sequencing technology. Comparative genome analysis and coverage statistics showed that the repetitive sequence atr0026 was a candidate introgression fragment of sorghum DNA. Sequence similarity analysis revealed that atr0026 was distributed at different copy numbers on the telomeric position of chromosomes 9 or 10 in R21, Jin Hui 1, and several rice varieties, indicating that the repetitive sequence from sorghum was highly conserved in rice. The repeat annotation in Gramineae indicated that ribosomal DNA loci that existed in atr0026 may be cause a rearrangement of chromosomes 9 and 10 of the R21 genome, resulting in a copy number variation at the 5' end of it. Our study lays the foundation for further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the heat tolerance of sorghum DNA introgression variant line R21, which is of great significance for guiding crop genetic breeding.
