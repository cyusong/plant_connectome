Phenylpropanoid-derived compounds represent a diverse family of secondary metabolites that originate from phenylalanine. These compounds have roles in plant growth and development, and in defense against biotic and abiotic stress. Many of these compounds are also beneficial to human health and welfare. V-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) proteins belong to a large family of transcription factors and are key regulators of the synthesis of phenylpropanoid-derived compounds. This review summarizes the current understanding of MYB proteins and their roles in the regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism in plants.
