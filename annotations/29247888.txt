The resistance of crops to herbicides can be due to target site based resistance or non-target site based resistance mechanisms or a combination of both. In non-target site resistance, the detoxification efficiency plays a major role by involvement of enzymes such as P450s, GTs, GSTs and ABC transporters. The resistance of the first commercial Clearfield sunflower hybrids (Imisun trait) to herbicides of imidazolinone group is based on a combination of both types of resistance. The target site resistance consists of a mutation in Ahasl1 gene, encoding the synthesis of the AHAS enzyme. The non-target site resistance is supposed to be due to intensified herbicide disposal and is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to detect the fast response of the glutathione-mediated detoxification system in IMI-R and IMI-S sunflower hybrids to the herbicide imazamox and to study the possible participation of GSTs in the enhancement of the hybrids' tolerance. The obtained results allow to presume that GSTs are involved in imazamox detoxification in the sunflower Imisun trait and thus contributing to its non-target site resistance.

Ahasl1 gene: !synthesizes! AHAS enzyme 
P450s, GTs, GSTs, ABC transporters: !detoxify! herbicides 
GSTs: !enhance! tolerance of Imisun trait to imazamox
