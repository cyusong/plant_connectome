Glutamate (l-Glu), an animal neurotransmitter, plays an essential role in plant signaling and regulates various plant physiological responses. We previously showed that l-Glu regulates stomatal closure in Arabidopsis via the glutamate receptor-like 3.5 gene (GLR3.5). Here, we showed that l-Glu activates salicylic acid (SA) signaling in Arabidopsis. l-Glu not only promoted stomatal closure but also triggered the expression of the PR1 gene via GLR3.5. These l-Glu-dependent actions were strongly suppressed in SA-insensitive npr1-1 and SA-deficient sid2-2 mutants, indicating that SA is involved in l-Glu signaling. A loss-of-function mutant of the gene encoding the SRK2E/OST1 kinase, which plays a pivotal role in abscisic acid signaling, was insensitive to both l-Glu-induced stomatal closure and PR1 expression. The glr3.5 mutants did not alleviate SA-induced stomatal closure, indicating that SA may function downstream of GLR3.5. These results indicate that l-Glu activates SA signaling, and that SRK2E/OST1 may play pivotal roles in such signaling.
