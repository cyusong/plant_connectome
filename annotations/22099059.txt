['22099059', 'Early embryogenesis is the most fundamental developmental process in biology.  Screening of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized populations of Arabidopsis  thaliana led to the identification of a zygote-lethal mutant embryonic factor 19  (fac19) in which embryo development was arrested at the elongated zygote to  octant stage. The number of endosperm nuclei decreased significantly in fac19  embryos. Genetic analysis showed fac19 was caused by a single recessive mutation  with typical mendelian segregation, suggesting equal maternal and paternal  contributions of FAC19 towards zygotic embryogenesis. Positional cloning showed  that FAC19 encodes a putative mitochondrial protein with 16 conserved  pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs. The fac19 mutation caused a conversion  from hydrophilic serine located in a previously unknown domain to hydrophobic  leucine. Crosses between FAC19/fac19 and the T-DNA insertion mutants in the same  gene failed to complement the fac19 defects, confirming the identity of the gene.  This study revealed the critical importance of a PPR protein-mediated  mitochondrial function in early embryogenesis.', '2012 Jan', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2011.01089.x', 'Liu']
