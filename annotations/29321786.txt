['29321786', "The modulation of glucose (Glc) homeostasis and signaling is crucial for plant  growth and development. Nevertheless, the molecular signaling mechanism by which  a plant senses a cellular Glc level and coordinates the expression of  Glc-responsive genes is still incompletely understood. Previous studies have  shown that Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane Glc-responsive regulator (AtPGR)  is a component of the Glc-responsive pathway. Here, we demonstrated that a  transcription factor bHLH34 binds to 5'-GAGA-3' element of the promoter region of  AtPGR in vitro, and activates beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity upon Glc  treatment in AtPGR promoter-GUS transgenic plants. Gain- and loss-of-function  analyses suggested that the bHLH34 involved in the responses to not only Glc, but  also abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity. These results suggest that bHLH34  functions as a transcription factor in the Glc-mediated stress responsive pathway  as well as an activator of AtPGR transcription. Furthermore, genetic experiments  revealed that in Glc response, the functions of bHLH34 are different from that of  a bHLH104, a homolog of bHLH34. Collectively, our findings indicate that bHLH34  is a positive regulator of Glc, and may affect ABA or salinity response, whereas  bHLH104 is a negative regulator and epistatic to bHLH34 in the Glc response.", '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.02100', 'Kim']
