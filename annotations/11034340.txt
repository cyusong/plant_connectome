['11034340', 'P67, a new protein binding to a specific RNA probe, was purified from radish  seedlings [Echeverria, M. and Lahmy, S. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23, 4963-4970].  Amino acid sequence information obtained from P67 microsequencing allowed the  isolation of genes encoding P67 in radish and Airabidopsis thaliana.  Immunolocalisation experiments in transfected protoplasts demonstrated that this  protein is addressed to the chloroplast. The RNA-binding activity of recombinant  P67 was found to be similar to that of the native protein. A significant  similarity with the maize protein CRP1 [Fisk, D.G., Walker, M.B. and Barkan, A.  (1999) EMBO J. 18, 2621-2630] suggests that P67 belongs to the PPR family and  could be involved in chloroplast RNA processing.', '2000 Sep 1', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01935-9', 'Echeverria']
