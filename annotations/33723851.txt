Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), belonging to the aquaporin family, are transmembrane channels located mostly at the tonoplast of plant cells. The TIPs are known to transport water and many other small solutes such as ammonia, urea, hydrogen peroxide, and glycerol. In the present review, phylogenetic distribution, structure, transport dynamics, gating mechanism, sub-cellular localization, tissue-specific expression, and co-expression of TIPs are discussed to define their versatile role in plants. Based on the phylogenetic distribution, TIPs are classified into five distinct groups with aromatic-arginine (Ar/R) selectivity filters, typical pore-morphology, and tissue-specific gene expression patterns. The tissue-specific expression of TIPs is conserved among diverse plant species, more particularly for TIP3s, which are expressed exclusively in seeds. Studying TIP3 evolution will help to understand seed development and germination. The solute specificity of TIPs plays an imperative role in physiological processes like stomatal movement and vacuolar sequestration as well as in alleviating environmental stress. TIPs also play an important role in growth and developmental processes like radicle protrusion, anther dehiscence, seed germination, cell elongation, and expansion. The gating mechanism of TIPs regulates the solute flow in response to external signals, which helps to maintain the physiological functions of the cell. The information provided in this review is a base to explore TIP's potential in crop improvement programs.
