['26433201', 'The activation of both the SA and JA/ETsignalling pathways may lead to more  efficient general and broad resistance to Pst DC3000 by non-pathogenic  rhizobacteria. However, the mechanisms that govern this simultaneous activation  are unclear. Using Arabidopsis as a model system, two transcription factors,  WRKY11 and WRKY70, were identified as important regulators involved in Induced  Systemic Resistance (ISR) triggered by Bacillus cereus AR156. The results  revealed that AR156 treatment significantly stimulated the transcription of  WRKY70, but suppressed that of WRKY11 in Arabidopsis leaves. Furthermore, they  were shown to be required for AR156 enhancing the activation of cellular defence  responses and the transcription level of the plant defence response gene.  Overexpression of the two transcription factors in Arabidopsis also showed that  they were essential for AR156 to elicit ISR. AR156-triggered ISR was completely  abolished in the double mutant of the two transcription factors, but still  partially retained in the single mutants, indicating that the regulation of the  two transcription factors depend on two different pathways. The target genes of  the two transcription factors and epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY11  regulated AR156-triggered ISR through activating the JA signalling pathway, and  WRKY70 regulated the ISR through activating the SA signalling pathway. In  addition, both WRKY11 and WRKY70 modulated AR156-triggered ISR in a  NPR1-dependent manner. In conclusion, WRKY11 and WRKY70 played an important role  in regulating the signalling transduction pathways involved in AR156-triggered  ISR. This study is the first to illustrate the mechanism by which a single  rhizobacterium elicits ISR by simultaneously activating both the SA and JA/ET  signalling pathways.', '2016 Jan', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erv445', 'Guo']
