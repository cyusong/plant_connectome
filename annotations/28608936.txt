['28608936', 'Floral initiation is regulated by various genetic pathways in response to light,  temperature, hormones and developmental status; however, the molecular mechanisms  underlying the interactions between different genetic pathways are not fully  understood. Here, we show that the photoresponsive gene FOF2 (F-box of flowering  2) negatively regulates flowering. FOF2 encodes a putative F-box protein that  interacts specifically with ASK14, and its overexpression results in later  flowering under both long-day and short-day photoperiods. Conversely, transgenic  plants expressing the F-box domain deletion mutant of FOF2 (FOF2DeltaF), or double  loss of function mutant of FOF2 and FOL1 (FOF2-LIKE 1) present early flowering  phenotypes. The late flowering phenotype of the FOF2 overexpression lines is  suppressed by the flc-3 loss-of-function mutation. Furthermore, FOF2 mRNA  expression is regulated by autonomous pathway gene FCA, and the repressive effect  of FOF2 in flowering can be overcome by vernalization. Interestingly, FOF2  expression is regulated by light. The protein level of FOF2 accumulates in  response to light, whereas it is degraded under dark conditions via the 26S  proteasome pathway. Our findings suggest a possible mechanistic link between  light conditions and the autonomous floral promotion pathway in Arabidopsis.', '2017 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13607', 'Lin']
