Seed germination is an essential step in a plant's life cycle. It is controlled by complex physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms and external factors. Alternative splicing (AS) is a co-transcriptional mechanism that regulates gene expression and produces multiple mRNA variants from a single gene to modulate transcriptome diversity. However, little is known about the effect of AS on the function of generated protein isoforms. The latest reports indicate that alternative splicing (AS), the relevant mechanism controlling gene expression, plays a significant role in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. In this review, we present the current state of the art about the identified AS regulators and the ABA-related changes in AS during seed germination. We show how they are connected with the ABA signaling and the seed germination process. We also discuss changes in the structure of the generated AS isoforms and their impact on the functionality of the generated proteins. Also, we point out that the advances in sequencing technology allow for a better explanation of the role of AS in gene regulation by more accurate detection of AS events and identification of full-length splicing isoforms.
