Plant responses to abiotic stresses are controlled by a complex tier of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We have provided evidence that the DEAD-box RNA helicases, STRESS RESPONSE SUPPRESSOR (STRS) 1 and STRS2 are negative regulators of Arabidopsis thaliana stress-responsive transcription factors. Using GFP-STRS fusion proteins, we have demonstrated that the STRSs are localized to the nucleolus and chromocenters, and are rapidly removed to the nucleoplasm upon application of various abiotic stresses. The STRSs appear to act via RNA-directed DNA methylation to suppress Arabidopsis stress responses; this repressive epigenetic mechanism is abrogated by abiotic stress eventually leading to an open chromatin structure allowing expression of stress-responsive genes.

STRS1: !localizes to! nucleolus 
STRS1: !localizes to! chromocenters 
STRS1: !represses! stress-responsive transcription factors 
STRS2: !localizes to! nucleolus 
STRS2: !localizes to! chromocenters 
STRS2: !represses! stress-responsive transcription factors 
abiotic stress: !removes! STRSs from nucleoplasm 
abiotic stress: !abrogates! repressive epigenetic mechanism 
abiotic stress: !leads to! open chromatin structure
