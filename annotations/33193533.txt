Ankyrin repeat (ANK) proteins are essential in cell growth, development, and response to hormones and environmental stresses. In the present study, 226 <i>ANK</i> genes were identified and classified into nine subfamilies according to conserved domains in the soybean genome (<i>Glycine max</i> L.). Among them, the <i>GmANK114</i> was highly induced by drought, salt, and abscisic acid. The <i>GmANK114</i> encodes a protein that belongs to the ANK-RF subfamily containing a RING finger (RF) domain in addition to the ankyrin repeats. Heterologous overexpression of <i>GmANK114</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> improved the germination rate under drought and salt treatments compared to wild-type. Homologous overexpression of <i>GmANK114</i> improved the survival rate under drought and salt stresses in transgenic soybean hairy roots. In response to drought or salt stress, <i>GmANK114</i> overexpression in soybean hairy root showed higher proline and lower malondialdehyde contents, and lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sup>2-</sup> contents compared control plants. Besides, <i>GmANK114</i> activated transcription of several abiotic stress-related genes, including <i>WRKY13</i>, <i>NAC11</i>, <i>DREB2</i>, <i>MYB84</i>, and <i>bZIP44</i> under drought and salt stresses in soybean. These results provide new insights for functional analysis of soybean ANK proteins and will be helpful for further understanding how ANK proteins in plants adapt to abiotic stress.
