The ability of a plant to maintain an ionic homeostasis is crucial in plant salt tolerance. Direct evidence based on data from the non-invasive measurement of ion fluxes would not only offer new insight about the function of the transporter but also provide a whole plant approach for dissecting salt adaptation mechanisms. Here, we review some reports using the ion-selective microelectrodes to characterize the net ion fluxes of tissues or cells.
