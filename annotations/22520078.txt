['22520078', 'Arabidopsis thaliana MTP1 is a vacuolar membrane Zn(2+)/H(+) antiporter of the  cation diffusion facilitator family. Here we present a structure-function  analysis of AtMTP1-mediated transport and its remarkable Zn(2+) selectivity by  functional complementation tests of more than 50 mutant variants in  metal-sensitive yeast strains. This was combined with homology modeling of AtMTP1  based on the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli broad-specificity divalent  cation transporter YiiP. The Zn(2+)-binding sites of EcYiiP in the cytoplasmic  C-terminus, and the pore formed by transmembrane helices TM2 and TM5, are  conserved in AtMTP1. Although absent in EcYiiP, Cys31 and Cys36 in the extended  N-terminal cytosolic domain of AtMTP1 are necessary for complementation of a  Zn-sensitive yeast strain. On the cytosolic side of the active Zn(2+)-binding  site inside the transmembrane pore, Ala substitution of either Asn258 in TM5 or  Ser101 in TM2 non-selectively enhanced the metal tolerance conferred by AtMTP1.  Modeling predicts that these residues obstruct the movement of cytosolic Zn(2+)  into the intra-membrane Zn(2+)-binding site of AtMTP1. A conformational change in  the immediately preceding His-rich cytosolic loop may displace Asn258 and permit  Zn(2+) entry into the pore. This would allow dynamic coupling of Zn(2+) transport  to the His-rich loop, thus acting as selectivity filter or sensor of cytoplasmic  Zn(2+) levels. Individual mutations at diverse sites within AtMTP1 conferred Co  and Cd tolerance in yeast, and included deletions in N-terminal and His-rich  intra-molecular cytosolic domains, and mutations of single residues flanking the  transmembrane pore or participating in intra- or inter-molecular domain  interactions, all of which are not conserved in the non-selective EcYiiP.', '2012 Jul', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08613.x', 'Maeshima']
