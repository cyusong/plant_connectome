Jasmonate (JA) inhibits root growth of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seedlings. The mutation in <i>COI1</i>, that plays a central role in JA signaling, displays insensitivity to JA inhibition of root growth. To dissect JA signaling pathway, we recently isolated one mutant named <i>psc1</i>, which partially suppresses <i>coi1</i> insensitivity to JA inhibition of root growth. As we identified the <i>PSC1</i> gene as an allele of <i>DWF4</i> that encodes a key enzyme in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, we hypothesized and demonstrated that BR is involved in JA signaling and negatively regulates JA inhibition of root growth. In our <i>Plant Physiology</i> paper, we analyzed effects of <i>psc1</i> or exogenous BR on the inhibition of root growth by JA. Here we show that treatment with brassinazole (Brz), a BR biosynthesis inhibitor, increased JA sensitivity in both <i>coi1-2</i> and wild type, which further confirms that BR negatively regulates JA inhibition of root growth. Since effects of <i>psc1</i>, Brz and exogenous BR on JA inhibition of root growth were mild, we suggests that BR negatively finely regulates JA inhibition of root growth in Arabidopsis.
