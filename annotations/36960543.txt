Leaf spectra are integrated foliar phenotypes that capture a range of traits and can provide insight into ecological processes. Leaf traits, and therefore leaf spectra, may reflect belowground processes such as mycorrhizal associations. However, evidence for the relationship between leaf traits and mycorrhizal association is mixed, and few studies account for shared evolutionary history. We conduct partial least squares discriminant analysis to assess the ability of spectra to predict mycorrhizal type. We model the evolution of leaf spectra for 92 vascular plant species and use phylogenetic comparative methods to assess differences in spectral properties between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plant species. Partial least squares discriminant analysis classified spectra by mycorrhizal type with 90% (arbuscular) and 85% (ectomycorrhizal) accuracy. Univariate models of principal components identified multiple spectral optima corresponding with mycorrhizal type due to the close relationship between mycorrhizal type and phylogeny. Importantly, we found that spectra of arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal species do not statistically differ from each other after accounting for phylogeny. While mycorrhizal type can be predicted from spectra, enabling the use of spectra to identify belowground traits using remote sensing, this is due to evolutionary history and not because of fundamental differences in leaf spectra due to mycorrhizal type.
