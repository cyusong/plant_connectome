MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Extensive studies have revealed that miRNAs have critical functions in plant growth, development, and stress responses and may provide valuable genetic resources for plant breeding research. We herein reviewed the development, mechanisms, and characteristics of miRNA techniques while highlighting widely used approaches, namely, the short tandem target mimic (STTM) approach. We described STTM-based advances in plant science, especially in the model crop rice, and introduced the CRISPR-based transgene-free crop breeding. Finally, we discussed the challenges and unique opportunities related to combining STTM and CRISPR technology for crop improvement and agriculture.
