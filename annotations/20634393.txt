Using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-time of flight technique, we determined major metabolite changes during induction of the carbon-concentrating mechanism in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In total, 128 metabolites with significant differences between high- and low-CO(2)-grown cells were detected, of which 82 were wholly or partially identified, including amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In a 24-h time course experiment, we show that the amino acids serine and phenylalanine increase transiently while aspartate and glutamate decrease after transfer to low CO(2). The biggest differences were typically observed 3 h after transfer to low-CO(2) conditions. Therefore, we made a careful metabolomic examination at the 3-h time point, comparing low-CO(2) treatment to high-CO(2) control. Five metabolites involved in photorespiration, 11 amino acids, and one lipid were increased, while six amino acids and, interestingly, 21 lipids were significantly lower. Our conclusion is that the metabolic pattern during early induction of the carbon-concentrating mechanism fit a model where photorespiration is increasing.
