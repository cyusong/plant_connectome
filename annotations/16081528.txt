Genomic clone coding for the 16R isoform of 14-3-3 proteins from potato plants has recently been described. This paper reports on 20R-gene isolation and analysis, and compares two isoforms. The northern blot analysis of mRNA of the 20R 14-3-3 isoform suggests its similarity to 16R. Vascular tissue-specific expression and age-dependent synthesis in potato leaves has been detected in both promoters. Screening of the potato genomic library using 20R cDNA isoform resulted in identification and isolation of the corresponding gene. This gene contains four exons and three introns. Inspecting the promoter sequence of the 20R isoform revealed several boxes important for the regulation of gene expression. The strongest GUS expression in transgenic potato plants transformed with the uidA reporter gene under the 20R promoter has been found in young leaf and stem vascular tissue, root tips, pollen and ovules. Mature fragments exhibit a significant decrease in GUS staining, which suggests age-dependent promoter activity. The analysis of transgenic plants transformed with 20R-GUS in contrast to 16R-GUS has revealed strong activation of the 20R promoter by metal ions and NaCl. Instead the 16R promoter is strongly affected by virus and salicylic acid treatments. The only factor, which strongly induced both promoters, was abscisic acid. It is thus suggested that promoter domain composition is the main factor differentiating the appearance of 14-3-3 isoforms.
