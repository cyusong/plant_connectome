We isolated cDNAs for Na(+)/H(+) antiporter genes (PhaNHA1s) from salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant reed plants. A phylogenetic analysis and localization analysis using yeast strains expressing PhaNHA1-GFP protein showed that PhaNHA1s were plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. Yeast strains expressing PhaNHA1 from salt-tolerant reed plants (PhaNHA1-n) grew well than yeast strains expressing PhaNHA1 from salt-sensitive reed plants (PhaNHA1-u) in the presence of 100mM NaCl. Furthermore, Na(+) contents of yeast cells expressing PhaNHA1-n were less than half of those of yeast cells expressing PhaNHA1-u. These results suggest that PhaNHA1-n is more efficient at excluding Na(+) from the cells than PhaNHA1-u.
