The usage of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) to indicate carbon (C) limitation in trees requires knowledge of the minimum tissue NSC concentrations at lethal C starvation, and the NSC dynamics during and after severe C limitation. We completely darkened and subsequently released seedlings of two deciduous and two evergreen temperate tree species for varying periods. NSCs were measured in all major organs, allowing assessment of whole-seedling NSC balances. NSCs decreased fast in darkness, but seedlings survived species-specific whole-seedling starch concentrations as low as 0.4-0.8% per dry matter (DM), and sugar (sucrose, glucose and fructose) concentrations as low as 0.5-2.0% DM. After re-illumination, the refilling of NSC pools began within 3 wk, while the resumption of growth was delayed or restricted. All seedlings had died after 12 wk of darkness, and starch and sugar concentrations in most tissues were lower than 1% DM. We conclude that under the applied conditions, tree seedlings can survive several weeks with very low NSC reserves probably also using alternative C sources like lipids, proteins or hemicelluloses; lethal C starvation cannot be assumed, if NSC concentrations are higher than the minimum concentrations found in surviving seedlings; and NSC reformation after re-illumination occurs preferentially over growth.

NSCs: !decrease! in darkness 
seedlings: !survive! species-specific NSC concentrations 
NSC pools: !refill! after re-illumination 
NSC refilling: !preferentially occurs over! growth 
seedlings: !die! after 12 wk of darkness
