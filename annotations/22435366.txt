The growth hormone auxin regulates essentially all aspects of plant developmental processes under optimum condition. However, as a sessile organism, plants encounter both optimal and non-optimal conditions during their life cycle. Various biotic and abiotic stresses affect the growth and development of plants. Although several phytohormones, such as salicylic acid, jasmonate and ethylene, have been shown to play central roles in regulating the plant development under biotic stresses, the knowledge of the role of hormones, particularly auxin, in abiotic stresses is limiting. Among the abiotic stresses, cold stress is one of the major stress in limiting the plant development and crop productivity. This review focuses on the role of auxin in developmental regulation of plants under cold stress. The emerging trend from the recent experiments suggest that cold stress induced change in the plant growth and development is tightly linked to the intracellular auxin gradient, which is regulated by the polar deployment and intracellular trafficking of auxin carriers.
