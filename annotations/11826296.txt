['11826296', 'The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent eukaryotic protease responsible for  degrading many important cell regulators, especially those conjugated with  multiple ubiquitins. Bound on both ends of the 20S core protease is a  multisubunit regulatory particle that plays a crucial role in substrate selection  by an as yet unknown mechanism(s). Here, we show that the RPN12 subunit of the  Arabidopsis regulatory particle is involved in cytokinin responses. A T-DNA  insertion mutant that affects RPN12a has a decreased rate of leaf formation,  reduced root elongation, delayed skotomorphogenesis, and altered growth responses  to exogenous cytokinins, suggesting that the mutant has decreased sensitivity to  the hormone. The cytokinin-inducible genes CYCD3 and NIA1 are upregulated  constitutively in rpn12a-1, indicating that feedback-inhibitory mechanisms also  may be altered. rpn12a-1 seedlings also showed changes in auxin-induced growth  responses, further illustrating the close interaction between auxin and cytokinin  regulation. In yeast, RPN12 is necessary for the G1/S and G2/M transitions of the  cell cycle, phases that have been shown to be under cytokinin control in plants.  We propose that RPN12a is part of the Arabidopsis 26S proteasome that controls  the stability of one or more of the factors involved in cytokinin regulation.', '2002 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010381', 'Vierstra']
