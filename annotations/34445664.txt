The target of rapamycin (TOR) protein kinase is an atypical Ser/Thr protein kinase and evolutionally conserved among yeasts, plants, and mammals. TOR has been established as a central hub for integrating nutrient, energy, hormone, and environmental signals in all the eukaryotes. Despite the conserved functions across eukaryotes, recent research has shed light on the multifaceted roles of TOR signaling in plant-specific functional and mechanistic features. One of the most specific features is the involvement of TOR in plant photosynthesis. The recent development of tools for the functional analysis of plant TOR has helped to uncover the involvement of TOR signaling in several steps preceding photoautotrophy and maintenance of photosynthesis. Here, we present recent novel findings relating to TOR signaling and its roles in regulating plant photosynthesis, including carbon nutrient sense, light absorptions, and leaf and chloroplast development. We also provide some gaps in our understanding of TOR function in photosynthesis that need to be addressed in the future.
