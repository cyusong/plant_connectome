['15545265', 'Higher plant sulfite and nitrite reductases contain siroheme as a prosthetic  group. Siroheme is synthesized from the tetrapyrrole primogenitor  uroporphyrinogen III in three steps involving methylation, oxidation, and  ferrochelation reactions. In this paper we report on the Arabidopsis thaliana  sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase At-SirB. The complete precursor protein of 225  amino acids and shorter constructs in which the first 46 or 79 residues had been  removed were shown to complement a defined Escherichia coli sirohydrochlorin  ferrochelatase mutant. The mature form of the protein appeared to consist of only  150 amino acids, making it much smaller than previously characterized  ferrochelatases. Green fluorescent protein tagging revealed that it is located in  the chloroplast. The enzyme was easily produced in E. coli as a recombinant  protein, and the isolated enzyme was found to have a specific activity of 48.5  nmol/min/mg. Significantly, the protein purified as a brown-colored solution with  a UV-visible spectrum containing maxima at 415 and 455 nm, suggestive of an Fe-S  center. EPR analysis of the recombinant protein produced a rhombic spectrum with  G-values of 2.04, 1.94, and 1.90 and with temperature dependence consistent with  a 2Fe-2S center. Redox titration demonstrated that the Fe-S center is highly  unstable, with an apparent midpoint reduction potential of about -370 mV. This is  the first Fe-S center to be reported in a higher plant ferrochelatase. The  implications of the Fe-S center in an enzyme that is so closely associated with  the metabolism of sulfur and iron are discussed.', '2005 Feb 11', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M411360200', 'Warren']
