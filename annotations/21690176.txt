The stomatal complex of Zea mays is composed of two pore-forming guard cells and two adjacent subsidiary cells. For stomatal movement, potassium ions and anions are thought to shuttle between these two cell types. As potential cation transport pathways, K(+)-selective channels have already been identified and characterized in subsidiary cells and guard cells. However, so far the nature and regulation of anion channels in these cell types have remained unclear. In order to bridge this gap, we performed patch-clamp experiments with subsidiary cell and guard cell protoplasts. Voltage-independent anion channels were identified in both cell types which, surprisingly, exhibited different, cell-type specific dependencies on cytosolic Ca(2+) and pH. After impaling subsidiary cells of intact maize plants with microelectrodes and loading with BCECF [(2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and6)carboxyflurescein] as a fluorescent pH indicator, the regulation of ion channels by the cytosolic pH and the membrane voltage was further examined. Stomatal closure was found to be accompanied by an initial hyperpolarization and cytosolic acidification of subsidiary cells, while opposite responses were observed during stomatal opening. Our findings suggest that specific changes in membrane potential and cytosolic pH are likely to play a role in determining the direction and capacity of ion transport in subsidiary cells.
