Heat stress seriously affects the quality of cut lily flowers. The ethylene response factors (ERFs) participate in heat stress response in many plants. In this study, heat treatment increased the production of ethylene in lily leaves, and exogenous ethylene treatment enhanced the heat resistance of lilies. LlERF110, an important transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, was found in the high-temperature transcriptome. The coding region of LlERF110 (969 bp) encodes 322 amino acids and LlERF110 contains an AP2/ERF typical domain belonging to the ERF subfamily group X. <i>LlERF110</i> was induced by ethylene and was expressed constitutively in all tissues. LlERF110 is localized in the nucleus and has transactivation activity. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>LlERF110</i> in lilies reduced the basal thermotolerance phenotypes and significantly decreased the expression of genes involved in the HSF-HSP pathway, such as <i>LlHsfA2</i>, <i>LlHsfA3A</i>, and <i>LlHsfA5</i>, which may activate other heat stress response genes; and <i>LlHsp17.6</i> and <i>LlHsp22</i>, which may protect proteins under heat stress. LlERF110 could directly bind to the promoter of <i>LlHsfA3A</i> and activate its expression according to the yeast one hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assays. LlERF110 interacts with LlHsfA2 in the nucleus according to BiFC and the yeast two-hybrid assays. In conclusion, these results indicate that LlERF110 plays an important role in the basal thermotolerance of lilies via regulation of the HSF-HSP pathway, which could be the junction of the heat stress response pathway and the ethylene signaling pathway.
