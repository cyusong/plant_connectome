Relationships between xylem anatomical traits and cavitation resistance have always been a major content of plant hydraulics. To know how plants cope with drought, it is extremely important to acquire detailed knowledge about xylem anatomical traits and assess the cavitation resistance accurately. This study aims to increase our knowledge in the methods determining cavitation resistance and xylem anatomical traits. We selected a semi-ring-porous species, Hippophae rhamnoides L., and a diffuse-porous species, Corylus heterophylla F., to clarify the reasons for the difference in cavitation resistance based on detailed xylem anatomical traits and reliable vulnerability curves (VCs). Both Cavitron and bench dehydration (BD) were used to construct VCs. Xylem anatomical traits, including pit membrane ultrastructure of these two species, were determined. The VCs obtained by the two different techniques were of different types for H. rhamnoides, its Cavitron VCs might be unreliable because of open-vessel artifacts. On the basis of BD VCs, H. rhamnoides showed higher cavitation resistance than C. heterophylla, and this is attributed to its low vessel connectivity as well as non-porous and thicker pit membranes.
