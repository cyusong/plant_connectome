['10457020', 'Lateral organs produced by shoot apical and flower meristems exhibit a  fundamental abaxial-adaxial asymmetry. We describe three members of the YABBY  gene family, FILAMENTOUS FLOWER, YABBY2 and YABBY3, isolated on the basis of  homology to CRABS CLAW. Each of these genes is expressed in a polar manner in all  lateral organ primordia produced from the apical and flower meristems. The  expression of these genes is precisely correlated with abaxial cell fate in  mutants in which abaxial cell fates are found ectopically, reduced or eliminated.  Ectopic expression of either FILAMENTOUS FLOWER or YABBY3 is sufficient to  specify the development of ectopic abaxial tissues in lateral organs. Conversely,  loss of polar expression of these two genes results in a loss of polar  differentiation of tissues in lateral organs. Taken together, these observations  indicate that members of this gene family are responsible for the specification  of abaxial cell fate in lateral organs of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, ectopic  expression studies suggest that ubiquitous abaxial cell fate and maintenance of a  functional apical meristem are incompatible.', '1999 Sep', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.126.18.4117', 'Bowman']
