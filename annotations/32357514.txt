Plant cells are frequently challenged with a wide range of adverse environmental conditions that restrict plant growth and limit the productivity of agricultural crops. Rapid development of nanotechnology and unsystematic discharge of metal containing nanoparticles (NPs) into the environment pose a serious threat to the ecological receptors including plants. Engineered nanoparticles are synthesized by physical, chemical, biological, or hybrid methods. In addition, volcanic eruption, mechanical grinding of earthquake-generating faults in Earth's crust, ocean spray, and ultrafine cosmic dust are the natural source of NPs in the atmosphere. Untying the nature of plant interactions with NPs is fundamental for assessing their uptake and distribution, as well as evaluating phytotoxicity. Modern mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques allow precise identification of low abundant proteins, protein-protein interactions, and in-depth analyses of cellular signaling networks. The present review highlights current understanding of plant responses to NPs exploiting high-throughput proteomics techniques. Synthesis of NPs, their morphophysiological effects on crops, and applications of proteomic techniques, are discussed in details to comprehend the underlying mechanism of NPs stress acclimation.
