Solanum chacoense ovule receptor kinase 28 (ScORK28) was found among 30 receptor kinases from an ovule cDNA library enriched for weakly expressed mRNAs. This LRR-RLK displayed high level of tissue specificity at the RNA and protein levels and was predominantly expressed in female reproductive tissues. Protein expression analyses in planta revealed that ScORK28 was N-glycosylated and ScORK28::GFP fusion analyses showed that it was localized at the plasma membrane. Bacterial expression of ScORK28 catalytic domain followed by kinase activity assays revealed that ScORK28 is an active Mg2+-dependent protein kinase and that the juxtamembrane domain is necessary for kinase activity.
