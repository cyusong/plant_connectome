Leaf senescence is regulated by a large number of internal and environmental factors. Here, we report that AtUSR1 (U-box Senescence Related 1) which encodes a plant Ring/U-box protein, is involved in age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. Expression of <i>AtUSR1</i> gene in leaves was up-regulated in darkness and during aging. Plants of <i>usr1</i>, an <i>AtUSR1</i> gene knock-down mutant, showed a significant delay in age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence and the delayed senescence phenotype was rescued when the <i>AtUSR1</i> gene was transferred back to the mutant plants. Meanwhile, overexpression of <i>AtUSR1</i> caused accelerated leaf senescence. Furthermore, the role of AtUSR1 in regulating leaf senescence is related to MYC2-mediuated jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. MeJA treatments promoted the accumulation of <i>AtUSR1</i> transcripts and this expression activation was dependent on the function of MYC2, a key transcription factor in JA signaling. Dual-luciferase assay results indicated that MYC2 promoted the expression of <i>AtUSR1</i>. Overexpression of <i>AtUSR1</i> in <i>myc2</i> mutant plants showed precocious senescence, while <i>myc2</i> mutation alone caused a delay in leaf senescence, suggesting that AtUSR1 functions downstream to MYC2 in the JA signaling pathway in promoting leaf senescence.
