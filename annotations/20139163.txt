Phototropins (phot) sense blue light through the two N-terminal chromophore binding LOV domains and activate the C-terminal kinase domain. The resulting phototropin autophosphorylation is essential for biological activity. We identified the A1 subunit of Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as interacting with full-length phot2 in yeast and also interacting with phot2 in an in vitro protein binding assay. Phenotypic characterizations of a phot1-5 rcn1-1 (for root curling in n-naphthylphthalamic acid1) double mutant, in which phot2 is the only functional phototropin and PP2A activity is reduced, showed enhanced phototropic sensitivity and enhanced blue light-induced stomatal opening, suggesting that PP2A activity is involved in regulating phot2 function. When treated with cantharidin, a chemical inhibitor of PP2A, the phot1-5 mutant exhibited enhanced phot2-mediated phototropic responses like those of the phot1-5 rcn1-1 double mutant. Immunoblot analysis to examine phot2 endogenous phosphorylation levels and in vitro phosphorylation assays of phot2 extracted from plants during dark recovery from blue light exposure confirmed that phot2 is more slowly dephosphorylated in the reduced PP2A activity background than in the wild-type PP2A background, suggesting that phosphorylated phot2 is a substrate of PP2A activity. While reduced PP2A activity enhanced the activity of phot2, it did not enhance either phot1 dephosphorylation or the activity of phot1 in mediating phototropism or stomatal opening.
