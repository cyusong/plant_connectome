Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, is a central component in plant cell walls and highly abundant (up to 50%) in the secondary walls. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the cellulose biosynthesis in the secondary walls is catalyzed by three cellulose synthases CESA4, CESA7 and CESA8. The transcription factor MYB46 and its close homolog MYB83 directly regulate the expression of the three secondary wall cellulose synthases (CESAs). However, it is not known whether MYB46 is the necessary regulator for functional expression of the secondary wall CESAs or one of the multiple transcriptional factors involved in the transcriptional regulatory program. To address this question, we used a series of genetic complementation experiments of the cesa knock-out mutants with the CESA coding sequence driven by either native- or mutated promoter of the genes. The mutant promoters have two nucleotide point mutations in the MYB46 binding cis element (M46RE) such that MYB46 cannot bind to the promoter, while the binding of other known secondary wall transcription factors is not affected. The mutant complementation results showed that MYB46 is essential to restore normal phenotype from the cesa mutants. We conclude that MYB46 is an obligate component of the transcriptional regulatory complex toward the commitment of secondary wall cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis.
