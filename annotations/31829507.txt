Endomembrane trafficking is a fundamental cellular process in all eukaryotic cells and its regulatory mechanisms have been extensively studied. In plants, the endomembrane trafficking system needs to be constantly adjusted to adapt to the ever-changing environment. Evidence has accumulated supporting the idea that endomembrane trafficking is tightly linked to stress signaling pathways to meet the demands of rapid changes in cellular processes and to ensure the correct delivery of stress-related cargo molecules. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on the functional roles of both secretory trafficking and endocytic trafficking in different types of abiotic stresses. We also highlight and discuss the unique properties of specific regulatory molecules beyond their conventional functions in endosomal trafficking during plant growth under stress conditions.

Endomembrane trafficking: !regulates! Stress signaling pathways
Secretory trafficking: !influences! Abiotic stresses
Endocytic trafficking: !affects! Plant growth under stress conditions
Regulatory molecules: !controls! Endosomal trafficking
