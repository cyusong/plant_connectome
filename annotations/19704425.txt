Phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana that carry mutations in CYCLOARTENOL SYNTHASE 1 (CAS1) which is required in sterol biosynthesis have been described. Knockout mutant alleles are responsible of a male-specific transmission defect. Plants carrying a weak mutant allele cas1-1 accumulate 2,3-oxidosqualene, the substrate of CAS1, in all analyzed organs. Mutant cas1-1 plants develop albino inflorescence shoots that contain low amount of carotenoids and chlorophylls. The extent of this albinism, which affects Arabidopsis stems late in development, may be modulated by the light/dark regime. The fact that chloroplast differentiation and pigment accumulation in inflorescence shoots are associated with a low CAS1 expression could suggest the involvement of 2,3-oxidosqualene in a yet unknown regulatory mechanism linking the sterol biosynthetic segment, located in the cytoplasm, and the chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthetic segments, located in the plastids, in the highly complex terpenoid network. CAS1 loss of function in a mosaic analysis of seedlings further demonstrated that leaf albinism associated with an accumulation of 2,3-oxidosqualene is a novel phenotype for plant sterol deficient mutant.
