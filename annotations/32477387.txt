Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is one of the most important fruit species in the Classical Mediterranean world. It is thought to have been domesticated 6,000-8,000 years ago in the Near East. However, the domestication of its wild relative into wine grapes or table grapes remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed 30 table grapes, 30 wine grapes, 30 dual-purpose grape accessions, as well as 30 wild relatives (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> ssp. <i>sylvestris</i>). The phenotypic comparison showed striking differences in berry weight, acidity and the content of aroma. Based on a total of 7,522,958 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we identified several significant selective sweep regions for table and wine grapes. Besides the well-known sex-determination locus on chromosome 2, the other four highest signals shared by table and wine grapes could not be linked to the known QTLs. The identification of these genomic regions under selection sweep may reveal agronomically important traits that have been selected during grape domestication. This information not only sheds light on the mechanisms of adaptions and diversification, but also guide the genetic improvement in breeding programs.
