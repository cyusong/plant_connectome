['16244908', 'Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are metallo-phosphoesterases. Their expression  and function have not been systematically investigated in higher plants. In this  work, we compared the transcript levels of 28 Arabidopsis PAP (AtPAP) genes in  five Arabidopsis organs. The 28 members, although differed in their expression  patterns in vegetative organs, were all transcribed in flower. Furthermore, the  transcription of seven members (AtPAPs 6, 11, 14, 19, 23, 24 and 25) occurred  predominantly in the flower. To begin dissecting the role of AtPAP genes in  flower development, further expression and functional analyses were conducted  using AtPAP23. Histochemical staining of transgenic plants expressing AtPAP23  promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene construct revealed that AtPAP23  transcription was strong in flower apical meristems, but became restricted to  petals and anther filaments in fully developed flower. A GST (glutathione  S-transferase) fusion protein of AtPAP23 (GST:AtPAP23) was expressed in bacterial  cells, and was found to contain significant amounts of Fe and Mn (whereas the  control GST protein contained none). In biochemical tests, GST:AtPAP23 showed  typical acid phosphatase activities. The fusion protein was also highly active on  phosphoserine, but not phosphotyrosine. Despite its highly specific expression  pattern and the demonstrated biochemical function of its protein product, the  RNAi (RNA interference), T-DNA knock-out and overexpression lines of AtPAP23 were  indistinguishable from wild type plants in the development of flower (or other  organs). Interestingly, the Fe and Mn contents were found significantly increased  in AtPAP23 overexpression lines, which may offer a new direction for further  functional studies of AtPAPs in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-0183-0', 'Wang']
