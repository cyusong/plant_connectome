Thylakoid membranes are far from being homogeneous in composition. On the contrary, compositional heterogeneity of lipid and protein content is well known to exist in these membranes. The mechanisms for the confinement of proteins at a particular membrane domain have started to be unveiled, but we are far from a thorough understanding, and many issues remain to be elucidated. During the differentiation of heterocysts in filamentous cyanobacteria of the Anabaena and Nostoc genera, thylakoids undergo a complete reorganization, separating into two membrane domains of different appearance and subcellular localization. Evidence also indicates different functionality and protein composition for these two membrane domains. In this work, we have addressed the mechanisms that govern the specific localization of proteins at a particular membrane domain. Two classes of proteins were distinguished according to their distribution in the thylakoids. Our results indicate that the specific accumulation of proteins of the CURVATURE THYLAKOID 1 (CURT1) family and proteins containing the homologous CAAD domain at subpolar honeycomb thylakoids is mediated by multiple mechanisms including a previously unnoticed phenomenon of thylakoid membrane migration.
