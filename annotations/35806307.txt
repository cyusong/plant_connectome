In all eukaryotes, autophagy is the main pathway for nutrient recycling, which encapsulates parts of the cytoplasm and organelles in double-membrane vesicles, and then fuses with lysosomes/vacuoles to degrade them. Autophagy is a highly dynamic and relatively complex process influenced by multiple factors. Under normal growth conditions, it is maintained at basal levels. However, when plants are subjected to biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogens, drought, waterlogging, nutrient deficiencies, etc., autophagy is activated to help cells to survive under stress conditions. At present, the regulation of autophagy is mainly reflected in hormones, second messengers, post-transcriptional regulation, and protein post-translational modification. In recent years, the degradation mechanism of autophagy-related proteins has attracted much attention. In this review, we have summarized how autophagy-related proteins are degraded in yeast, animals, and plants, which will help us to have a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the regulation mechanisms of autophagy. Moreover, research progress on the degradation of autophagy-related proteins in plants has been discussed.
