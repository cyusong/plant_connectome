['27233612', 'The multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters mediate the  coupled exchange of organic substrates and monovalent cations have been recently  implicated in various plant biological activities. In this work, we isolated a  dominant mutant from an Arabidopsis activation-tagging mutant pool. This mutant  exhibits pleiotropic phenotype including early flowering, dwarf and bushy  architecture, minified lateral organs and early leaf senescence, and is therefore  designated early leaf senescence 1-Dominaint (els1-D). Genotyping assays showed  that els1-D is a gain-of-function mutant of a novel MATE transporter gene, ELS1,  which encodes a close homolog of the previously reported ADP1, BCD1 and DTX50.  Further investigations revealed that the overexpression of ELS1 reduces iron  content in els1-D, and the accelerated senescence of the detached els1-D leaves  can be recovered by exogenous iron supply. In addition, we also found that ELS1  is an iron responsive gene. Based on these findings, we proposed that ELS1 is  related to leaf senescence and iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis.', '2016 Aug 5', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.121', 'Liu']
