NF-Y transcription factors are reported to play diverse roles in a wide range of biological processes in plants. However, only a few active NF-Y complexes are known in plants and the precise functions of NF-Y complexes in flavonoid biosynthesis have not been determined. Using various molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches, we found that NF-YB8a, NF-YB8b and NF-YB8c - a NF-YB subgroup - can interact with a specific subgroup of NF-YC and then recruit either of two distinct NF-YAs to form NF-Y complexes that bind the CCAAT element in the CHS1 promoter. Furthermore, suppressing the expression of particular NF-YB genes increased the levels of H3K27me3 at the CHS1 locus and significantly suppressed the expression of CHS1 during tomato fruit ripening, which led to the development of pink-coloured fruit with colourless peels. Altogether, by demonstrating that NF-Y transcription factors play essential roles in flavonoid biosynthesis and by providing significant molecular insight into the regulatory mechanisms that drive the development of pink-coloured tomato fruit, we provide a major advance to our fundamental knowledge and information that has considerable practical value for horticulture.
