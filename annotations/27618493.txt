['27618493', 'Plant cell walls undergo dynamic structural and chemical changes during plant  development and growth. Floral organ abscission and lateral root emergence are  both accompanied by cell-wall remodeling, which involves the INFLORESCENCE  DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA)-derived peptide and its receptors, HAESA (HAE) and  HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2). Plant cell walls also act as barriers against pathogenic  invaders. Thus, the cell-wall remodeling during plant development could have an  influence on plant resistance to phytopathogens. Here, we identified IDA-like 6  (IDL6), a gene that is prominently expressed in Arabidopsis leaves. IDL6  expression in Arabidopsis leaves is significantly upregulated when the plant is  suffering from attacks of the bacterial Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst)  DC3000. IDL6 overexpression and knockdown lines respectively decrease and  increase the Arabidopsis resistance to Pst DC3000, indicating that the gene  promotes the Arabidopsis susceptibility to Pst DC3000. Moreover, IDL6 promotes  the expression of a polygalacturonase (PG) gene, ADPG2, and increases PG activity  in Arabidopsis leaves, which in turn reduces leaf pectin content and leaf  robustness. ADPG2 overexpression restrains Arabidopsis resistance to Pst DC3000,  whereas ADPG2 loss-of-function mutants increase the resistance to the bacterium.  Pst DC3000 infection elevates the ADPG2 expression partially through HAE and  HSL2. Taken together, our results suggest that IDL6-HAE/HSL2 facilitates the  ingress of Pst DC3000 by promoting pectin degradation in Arabidopsis leaves, and  Pst DC3000 might enhance its infection by manipulating the IDL6-HAE/HSL2-ADPG2  signaling pathway.', '2017 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13380', 'Zhang']
