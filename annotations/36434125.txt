In Magnolia polytepala, the formation of floral organization and color was attributed to tissue-dependent differential expression levels of MADS-box genes and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. In angiosperms, the diversity of floral morphology and organization suggests its value in exploring plant evolution. Magnolia polytepala, an endemic basal angiosperm species in China, possesses three green sepal-like tepals in the outermost whorl and pink petal-like tepals in the inner three whorls, forming unique floral morphology and organization. However, we know little about its underlying molecular regulatory mechanism. Here, we first reported the full-length transcriptome of M. polytepala using PacBio sequencing. A total of 16 MADS-box transcripts were obtained from the transcriptome data, including floral homeotic genes (e.g., MpAPETALA3) and other non-floral homeotic genes (MpAGL6, etc.). Phylogenetic analysis and spatial expression pattern reflected their putative biological function as their homologues in Arabidopsis. In addition, nine structural genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway had been screened out, and tepal color difference was significantly associated with their tissue-dependent differential expression levels. This study provides a relatively comprehensive investigation of the MADS-box family and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in M. polytepala, and will facilitate our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying floral organization and color in basal angiosperms.
