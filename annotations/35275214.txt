The complexity of lignin structure impedes efficient cell wall digestibility. Native lignin is composed of a mixture of three dominant monomers, coupled together through a variety of linkages. Work over the past few decades has demonstrated that lignin composition can be altered through a variety of mutational and transgenic approaches such that the polymer is derived almost entirely from a single monomer. In this study, we investigated changes to lignin structure and digestibility in Arabidopsis thaliana in near-single-monolignol transgenics and mutants and determined whether novel monolignol conjugates, produced by a FERULOYL-CoA MONOLIGNOL TRANSFERASE (FMT) or a p-COUMAROYL-CoA MONOLIGNOL TRANSFERASE (PMT), could be integrated into these novel polymers to further improve saccharification efficiency. Monolignol conjugates, including a new conjugate of interest, p-coumaryl p-coumarate, were successfully integrated into high-H, high-G and high-S lignins in A. thaliana. Regardless of lignin composition, FMT- and PMT-expressing plants produced monolignol ferulates and monolignol p-coumarates, respectively, and incorporated them into their lignin. Through the production and incorporation of monolignol conjugates into near-single-monolignol lignins, we demonstrated that substrate availability, rather than monolignol transferase substrate preference, is the most important determining factor in the production of monolignol conjugates, and lignin composition helps dictate cell wall digestibility.
