Forest canopies can retain nitrogen (N) from atmospheric deposition. However, most empirical and modeling studies do not consider the processing of the N deposited in the canopy. To assess whether N deposition through canopy will alter the plant's N uptake and retention, we conducted a 3-yr mesocosm experiment by applying (<sup>15</sup> NH<sub>4</sub> )<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> solution to aspen sapling canopies or directly to the soil. We found that <sup>15</sup> N-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> applied to the canopy was directly taken up by leaves. Compared with the soil N application, the canopy N application resulted in higher photosynthesis but lower N retention of the plant-soil system in the first growing season. Plant biomass, N concentration, and leaf N resorption were not significantly different between the canopy and soil N applications. The partitioning of retained <sup>15</sup> N among plant components and soil layers was similar between the two treatments 3 yr after the N application. Our findings indicated that the canopy N processing could alter leaf N supply and photosynthesis in the short term but not N retention in the long term. Under natural conditions, the chronic N deposition could continuously refill the canopy N pool, causing a sustained increase in canopy carbon uptake. Canopy N processing needs to be considered for accurately predicting the impact of N deposition.
