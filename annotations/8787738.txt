['8787738', 'The short integument (sin1) mutation causes a female-specific infertility, and a  defect in the control of time to flowering in Arabidopsis. Female sterility of  Sin- plants is due to abnormal ovule integument development and aberrant  differentiation of the megagametophyte in a subset of ovules. An additional  defect of sin1 mutants is the production of an increased number of vegetative  leaf and inflorescence primordia leading to delayed flowering. The delayed  flowering phenotype of sin1-1 is not due to a defect in the perception of day  length periodicity or in gibberellic acid metabolism. Phenotypes of double mutant  combinations of sin1 with terminalflower (tfl1) indicate that SIN1 activity is  required for precocious floral induction typical in a tfl1 mutant. Unexpectedly,  sin1-1 tfl1-1 plants do not make pollen, thus revealing a novel role for TFL1 in  the anther. Early flowers of sin1-1 ap1-1 double mutants are transformed to long  inflorescence-like shoots. A genetic model for the role of SIN1 in flowering time  control is proposed.', '1996 Sep', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.122.9.2631', 'Ray']
