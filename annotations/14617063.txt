['14617063', 'We have recently isolated and identified a novel mitochondrial metalloprotease,  pre-sequence protease (PreP) from potato and shown that it degrades mitochondrial  pre-sequences. PreP belongs to the pitrilysin protease family and contains an  inverted zinc-binding motif. To further investigate the degradation of targeting  peptides, we have overexpressed the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of PreP, zinc  metalloprotease (Zn-MP), in Escherichia coli. We have characterized the  recombinant Zn-MP with respect to its catalytic site, substrate specificity and  intracellular localization. Mutagenesis studies of the residues involved in metal  binding identified the histidines and the proximal glutamate as essential  residues for the proteolytic activity. Substrate specificity studies showed that  the Zn-MP has the ability to degrade both mitochondrial pre-sequences and  chloroplastic transit peptides, as well as other unstructured peptides. The Zn-MP  does not recognize an amino acid sequence per se. Immunological studies and  proteolytic activity measurements in isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts  revealed the presence of the Zn-MP in both organelles. Furthermore, the Zn-MP was  found to be dually imported to both mitochondria and chloroplasts in vitro. In  summary, our data show that the Zn-MP is present and serves the same function in  chloroplasts as in mitochondria--degradation of targeting peptides.', '2003 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01904.x', 'Glaser']
