['7589523', 'Rps10, a gene coding for ribosomal protein S10 of Arabidopsis mitochondria has  been transferred to the nuclear compartment, while in pea and potato the active  rps10 is mitochondrially located. The nuclear rps10 gene contains an intron at  the junction of the target signal sequence and the mitochondrial-derived  sequence, indicating that exon shuffling may have been involved in the addition  of the transit peptide signal. Sequence comparison of Arabidopsis rps10 to the  plant mitochondrial counterparts shows that the edited version is present in the  nucleus of Arabidopsis. This finding corroborates RNA as an intermediate of a  functional gene transfer between mitochondria and the nucleus. In  vitro-translated RPS10 protein is efficiently imported into potato mitochondria  and a presequence of about 7 kDa is removed resulting in a mature protein that is  larger compared to organellar and bacterial RPS10 proteins.', '1995 Oct 30', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/0014-5793(95)01100-s', 'Schuster']
