['31869440', 'Synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) has been recognised as a tethering factor of plant  endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites (EPCSs) and  partially localises to around plasmodesmata (PD). However, other components of  EPCSs associated with SYT1 and functional links between the EPCSs and PD have not  been identified. We explored interactors of SYT1 by immunoprecipitation and mass  analysis. The dynamics, morphology and spatial arrangement of the ER in  Arabidopsis mutants lacking the EPCS components were investigated using confocal  microscopy and electron microscopy. PD permeability of EPCS mutants was assessed  using a virus movement protein and free green fluorescent protein (GFP) as  indicators. We identified two additional components of the EPCSs, SYT5 and SYT7,  that interact with SYT1. The mutants of the three SYTs were defective in the  anchoring of the ER to the PM. The ER near the PD entrance appeared to be weakly  squeezed in the triple mutant compared with the wild-type. The triple mutant  suppressed cell-to-cell movement of the virus movement protein, but not GFP  diffusion. We revealed major additional components of EPCS associated with SYT1  and suggested that the EPCSs arranged around the PD squeeze the ER to regulate  active transport via PD.', '2020 May', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.16391', 'ORCID:']
