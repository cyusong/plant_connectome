['12753580', 'The sfr6 mutant of Arabidopsis displays a deficit in freezing tolerance after  cold acclimation. We previously observed that the transcripts of three cold-,  ABA- and drought-inducible genes, each having a C-repeat motif or the  drought-responsive element (CRT/DRE) in its promoter, failed to normally  accumulate in this mutant. We now report that the effects of sfr6 upon transcript  levels are reflected in the levels of the encoded proteins, confirming that the  cold-inducible protein expression is affected by the sfr6 mutation. Using  microarray analysis, we found not only that this effect may be general to  cold-inducible genes with CRT/DRE promoter elements, but also that it extends to  some other genes whose promoters lack a CRT/DRE element. The role of the CRT/DRE  has been empirically tested by use of a synthetic promoter, confirming that the  CRT/DRE is sufficient to confer the sfr6 effect upon expression. Tolerance of  osmotic stress was also found to be reduced in sfr6, consistent with a role in  osmotic stress tolerance for the cold-, ABA- and drought-inducible genes whose  expression is affected by the sfr6 mutation.', '2003 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01734.x', 'Knight']
