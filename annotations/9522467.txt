['9522467', 'Proper exchange of atmospheric gases is important for normal root and shoot  metabolism in plants. This study was conducted to determine how restricted air  supply affects foliar carbohydrates, while using the marker enzyme alcohol  dehydrogenase (ADH) to report on the oxygenation status of the rootzone.  Fourteen-day-old Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. plants grown singly in 7-ml  tubes containing agarified nutrient medium were placed in coupled Magenta vessels  and exposed for six days to either ambient air or one of six different  air/nitrogen dilutions. Redox potential of the agar medium was measured  immediately after harvesting and freezing leaf tissue, and then root systems were  quickly extracted from the agar and frozen for subsequent analyses. Redox  potential measurements indicated that this series of gas mixtures produced a  transition from hypoxia to anoxia in the root zones. Root ADH activity increased  at higher rates as the redox potential neared anoxic levels. In contrast, ADH  mRNA expression quickly neared its maximum as the medium became hypoxic and  showed little further increase as it became anoxic. Foliar carbohydrate levels  increased 1.5- to 2-fold with decreased availability of metabolic gases, with  starch increasing at higher concentrations of air than soluble carbohydrate. The  results serve as a model for plant performance under microgravity conditions,  where absence of convective air movement prevents replenishment of metabolic  gases.', '1997 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029129', 'Musgrave']
