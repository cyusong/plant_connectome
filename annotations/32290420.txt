Growing interest and recent evidence have identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as the potential regulatory elements for eukaryotes. LncRNAs can activate various transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that impact cellular functions though multiple regulatory functions. Recently, a large number of lncRNAs have also been identified in higher plants, and an understanding of their functional role in plant resistance to infection is just emerging. Here, we focus on their identification in crop plant, and discuss their potential regulatory functions and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in plant pathogen stress responses, referring to possible examples in a model plant. The knowledge gained from a deeper understanding of this colossal special group of plant lncRNAs will help in the biotechnological improvement of crops.
