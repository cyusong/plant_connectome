The rice Dart/nDart transposon system belongs to the hAT superfamily of class II transposons. The nonautonomous element nDart is active in intact rice plants. The autonomous element Dart was identified based on sequence similarity to nDart. Because the rice genome sequence of Nipponbare contains at least 51 Dart elements, it is not clear whether Dart elements are expressed or whether they are transposable. This study characterized for the expression of the predicted ORF of Dart. RNA blotting analysis revealed three transcripts of different lengths. Only the longest transcript (2.5kb) corresponding to the predicted ORF of the Dart element produced a functional TPase. The other transcripts had a frame-shift generating a premature stop codon through alternative splicing. These transcripts were expressed from either of two potentially autonomous Dart elements, Dart01/28 and Dart02. The frequency of alternative splicing differed between the transcripts of the derivative elements. More than 90% of the transcripts from Dart02 were alternatively spliced, compared with only 3% from Dart01/28. The element-specific expression and alternative splicing may control the transposition of nDart.
