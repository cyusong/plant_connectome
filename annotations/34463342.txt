APETALA2 (AP2) subfamily transcription factors participate in plant growth and development, but their roles in plant immunity remain unclear. Here, we discovered that the AP2 transcription factor CaAIL1 functions in immunity against Ralstonia solanacearum infection (RSI) in pepper (Capsicum annuum). CaAIL1 expression was upregulated by RSI, and loss- and gain-of-function assays using virus-induced gene silencing and transient overexpression, respectively, revealed that CaAIL1 plays a positive role in immunity to RSI in pepper. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) uncovered a subset of transcription-factor-encoding genes, including CaRAP2-7, CaGATA17, CaGtf3a and CaTCF25, that were directly targeted by CaAIL1 via their cis-elements, such as GT or AGGCA motifs. ChIP-qPCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed these findings. These genes, encoding transcription factors with negative roles in immunity, were repressed by CaAIL1 during pepper response to RSI, whereas genes encoding positive immune regulators such as CaEAS were derepressed by CaAIL1. Importantly, we showed that the atypical EAR motif (LXXLXXLXX) in CaAIL1 is indispensable for its function in immunity. These findings indicate that CaAIL1 enhances the immunity of pepper against RSI by repressing a subset of negative immune regulators during the RSI response through its binding to several cis-elements in their promoters.
