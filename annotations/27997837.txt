Plants integrate multiple environmental signals to detect and avoid shading from neighbouring vegetation. Two new studies highlight the importance of blue light in the regulation of stem elongation and bending during shade escape.

Gene: !affects! Stem elongation 
Gene: !affects! Bending during shade escape 
Gene: !regulates! Blue light 
Gene: !integrates! Multiple environmental signals
