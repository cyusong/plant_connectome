['26293302', 'The fruit, which develops from the fertilised gynoecium formed in the innermost  whorl of the flower, is the reproductive organ and one of the most complex  structures of an angiosperm plant. Phytohormones play important roles during  flower and fruit patterning, morphogenesis and growth, and there is emerging  evidence for a cross-talk between different classes of plant hormones throughout  these processes. Here, we show that the bHLH transcription factors HECATE 1  (HEC1), HEC2 and HEC3, which have previously been identified as essential  components of transmitting tract formation, affect both auxin and cytokinin  responses during reproductive tissue development. We find that HEC1 interacts  with SPATULA (SPT) to control carpel fusion and that both transcription factors  restrict sensitivity to cytokinin in the gynoecium. In addition, HEC1 is tightly  integrated into the auxin-signalling network at the levels of biosynthesis,  transport and transcriptional response. Based on this data, we propose that HEC1  acts as a local modulator of auxin and cytokinin responses to control gynoecium  development in Arabidopsis.', '2015 Oct 1', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.120444', 'Lohmann']
