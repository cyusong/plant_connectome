We tested to what extent differences in construction costs (CC) and chemical composition of woody species are attributed to leaf habit. Eight evergreen and eight deciduous species belonging to six families were selected to form eight phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs). The plants were grown from seed in a glasshouse. Differences in leaf, stem and root CC between evergreen and deciduous species were minor, the proportion of variance explained by leaf habit generally being less than 6%. Surprisingly, differences in leaf chemical composition between deciduous and evergreen species were small as well. Variation in CC and chemical composition among families was substantial, the factor 'family' explaining 50-85% of variance. We therefore conclude that in this case, phylogeny is a more important factor than functional group. Leaves of the fast-growing species in this experiment showed high levels of minerals, organic acids, proteins and lipids, whereas leaves of the slow-growing species had higher concentrations of soluble phenolics, lignin as well as higher carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. These relationships suggest a trade-off between growth and defence. In contrast, CC of leaves, stems, roots or whole plants showed no or only a weak correlation with relative growth rate (RGR). The C/N ratio of the leaves is an easily measured parameter that correlated strongly in a negative way with the RGR of the plants and reflected better the balance between investment in structure and physiological functioning than CC.
