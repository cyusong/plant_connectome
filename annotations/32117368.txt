Two primary use patterns exist for dsRNA-based products for crop protection: <i>in planta</i> produced dsRNA such as in a genetically engineered (GE) crop; and topically applied dsRNA such as a spray application. To enable effective environmental risk assessments for these products, dsRNA must be successfully measured in relevant environmental compartments (soil, sediment, surface water) to provide information on potential exposure. This perspective reviews results from numerous environmental fate and degradation studies with topically applied unformulated dsRNAs to demonstrate the high lability of these molecules and low potential for persistence in the environment. Additionally, we report on results of a pilot study of topically applied dsRNA on soybean plants demonstrating similar rapid degradation under field conditions. Microbial degradation of nucleic acids in environmental compartments has been shown to be a key driver for this lack of persistence. In fact, the instability of dsRNA in the environment has posed a challenge for the development of commercial topically-applied products. Formulations or other approaches that mitigate environmental degradation may lead to development of commercially successful products but may change the known degradation kinetics of dsRNAs. The formulation of these products and the resultant impacts on the stability of the dsRNA in environmental compartments will need to be addressed using problem formulation and product formulation testing may be required on a case by case basis to ensure an effective risk assessment.
