Flowering occurs in angiosperms during a major developmental transition from vegetative growth to the reproductive phase. <i>Squamosa</i> promoter binding protein (SBP)-box genes have been found to play critical roles in regulating flower and fruit development, but their roles in grapevine have remained unclear. To better understand the functions of the grape SBP-box genes in both vegetative and reproductive growth phases, a full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of the putative SBP-box transcription factor gene, <i>VpSBP11</i>, was obtained from Chinese wild grapevine <i>Vitis pseudoreticulata</i> Wen Tsai Wang (W. T. Wang) clone 'Baihe-35-1'. <i>VpSBP11</i> encoded a putative polypeptide of 170 amino acids with a highly conserved SBP-domain with two zinc-binding sites of the Cx2C-x3-H-x11-C-x6-H (C2HCH) type and a nuclear localization signal. We confirmed that the VpSBP11 protein was targeted to the nucleus and possessed transcriptional activation activity by subcellular localization and <i>trans</i>-activation assay. Over-expression of <i>VpSBP11</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was shown to activate the <i>FUL</i> gene, and subsequently the <i>AP1</i> and <i>LFY</i> genes, all of which were floral meristem identity genes, and to cause earlier flowering than in wild type (WT) plants. The pattern of vegetative growth was also different between the transgenic and WT plants. For example, in the <i>VpSBP11</i> over-expressing transgenic plants, the number of rosette leaves was less than that of WT; the petiole was significantly elongated; and the rosette and cauline leaves curled upwards or downwards. These results were consistent with <i>VpSBP11</i> acting as a transcription factor during the transition from the vegetative stage to the reproductive stage.
