['14504388', 'SOS2 (salt overly sensitive 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase required for  salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we identified the protein  phosphatase 2C ABI2 (abscisic acid-insensitive 2) as a SOS2-interacting protein.  Deletion analysis led to the discovery of a novel protein domain of 37 amino acid  residues, designated as the protein phosphatase interaction (PPI) motif, of SOS2  that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with ABI2. The PPI motif is  conserved in protein kinases of the SOS2 family (i.e., protein kinase S, PKS) and  in the DNA damage repair and replication block checkpoint kinase, Chk1, from  various organisms including humans. Mutations in the conserved amino acid  residues in the PPI motif abolish the interaction of SOS2 with ABI2. We also  identified a protein kinase interaction domain in ABI2 and examined the  interaction specificity between PKS and the ABI phosphatases. We found that some  PKSs interact strongly with ABI2 whereas others interact preferentially with  ABI1. The interaction between SOS2 and ABI2 was disrupted by the abi2-1 mutation,  which causes increased tolerance to salt shock and abscisic acid insensitivity in  plants. Our results establish the PPI motif and the protein kinase interaction  domain as novel protein interaction domains that mediate the binding between the  SOS2 family of protein kinases and the ABI1/2 family of protein phosphatases.', '2003 Sep 30', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2034853100', 'Zhu']
