In plants, the spatiotemporal expression of circadian oscillators provides adaptive advantages in diverse species. However, the molecular basis of circadian clock in soybean is not known. In this study, we used soybean hairy roots expression system to monitor endogenous circadian rhythms and the sensitivity of circadian clock to environmental stimuli. We discovered in experiments with constant light and temperature conditions that the promoters of clock genes GmLCLb2 and GmPRR9b1 drive a self-sustained, robust oscillation of about 24-h in soybean hairy roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that circadian clock is entrainable by ambient light/dark or temperature cycles. Specifically, we show that light and cold temperature pulses can induce phase shifts of circadian rhythm, and we found that the magnitude and direction of phase responses depends on the specific time of these two zeitgeber stimuli. We obtained a quadruple mutant lacking the soybean gene GmLCLa1, LCLa2, LCLb1, and LCLb2 using CRISPR, and found that loss-of-function of these four GmLCL orthologs leads to an extreme short-period circadian rhythm and late-flowering phenotype in transgenic soybean. Our study establishes that the morning-phased GmLCLs genes act constitutively to maintain circadian rhythmicity and demonstrates that their absence delays the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development.
