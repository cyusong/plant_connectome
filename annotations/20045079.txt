['20045079', 'Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acts as a signaling molecule that regulates diverse  cellular processes and it can rapidly be metabolized by phosphatase and  acyltransferase. LPA phosphatase gene has not been identified and characterized  in plants so far. The BLAST search revealed that the At3g03520 is similar to  phospholipase family, and distantly related to bacterial phosphatases. The  conserved motif, (J)4XXXNXSFD, was identified in both At3g03520 like  phospholipases and acid phosphatases. In silico expression analysis of At3g03520  revealed a high expression during phosphate starvation and abiotic stresses. This  gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and shown to posses LPA specific  phosphatase activity. These results suggest that this gene possibly plays a role  in signal transduction and storage lipid synthesis.', '2010 Apr', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbalip.2009.12.005', 'Rajasekharan']
