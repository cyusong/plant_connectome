Increased flavonol accumulation and enhanced drought tolerance in A4-rolB-overexpressing plants can be explained by the cooperative action of the SA and ROS signalling pathways. Clarification of function of the A4-rolB plast gene from pRiA4 of Rhizobium rhizogenes will allow a better understanding of the biological principles of the natural transformation process and its use as a tool for plant bioengineering. In the present study, we investigated whether the overexpression of A4-rolB gene could regulate two important processes, flavonoid biosynthesis and drought tolerance. In addition, we investigated some aspects of the possible machinery of the A4-rolB-induced changes in plant physiology, such as crosstalk of the major signalling systems. Based on the data obtained in this work, it can be presumed that constitutive overexpression of A4-rolB leads to the activation of the salicylic acid signalling system. An increase in flavonol accumulation and enhanced drought tolerance can be explained by the cooperative action of SA and ROS pathways.
