In this study, the effects of the allelochemical coumarin through a metabolomic, proteomic and morpho-physiological approach in Arabidopsis adult plants (25days old) were investigated. Metabolomic analysis evidenced an increment of amino acids and a high accumulation of soluble sugars, after 6days of coumarin treatment. This effect was accompanied by a strong decrease on plant fresh and dry weights, as well as on total protein content. On the contrary, coumarin did not affect leaf number but caused a reduction in leaf area. An alteration of water status was confirmed by a reduction of relative water content and an increase in leaf osmotic potential. Moreover, coumarin impaired plant bio-membranes through an increase of lipid peroxidation and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content suggesting that coumarin treatment might induce oxidative stress. Coumarin reduced the effective quantum yield of the photosystem II, the energy dissipation in the form of heat, the maximum PSII efficiency, the coefficient of the photochemical quenching and the estimated electron transport rate, while it significantly stimulated the fluorescence emission and the coefficient of the non photochemical quenching. Finally, the proteomic characterization of coumarin-treated plants revealed a down-regulation of the ROS detoxifying proteins, responsible of oxidative damage and consequently of physiological cascade effects.
