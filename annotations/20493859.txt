Proteins that specifically bind the single-stranded overhang at the ends of telomeres have been identified in a wide range of eukaryotes and play pivotal roles in chromosome end protection and telomere length regulation. Here we summarize recent findings regarding the functions of POT1 proteins in vertebrates and discuss the functional evolution of POT1 proteins following gene duplication in protozoa, plants, nematodes and mice.

POT1: !protects! Telomeres
POT1: !regulates! Telomere Length
POT1: !evolves following! Gene Duplication
Gene Duplication: !leads to! Evolution of POT1
