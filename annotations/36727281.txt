Heritable fungal endosymbiosis is underinvestigated in plant biology and documented in only three plant families (Convolvulaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae). An estimated 40% of morning glory species in the tribe Ipomoeeae (Convolvulaceae) have associations with one of two distinct heritable, endosymbiotic fungi (Periglandula and Chaetothyriales) that produce the bioactive metabolites ergot alkaloids, indole diterpene alkaloids, and swainsonine, which have been of interest for their toxic effects on animals and potential medical applications. Here, we report the occurrence of ergot alkaloids, indole diterpene alkaloids, and swainsonine in the Convolvulaceae; and the fungi that produce them based on synthesis of previous studies and new indole diterpene alkaloid data from 27 additional species in a phylogenetic, geographic, and life-history context. We find that individual morning glory species host no more than one metabolite-producing fungal endosymbiont (with one possible exception), possibly due to costs to the host and overlapping functions of the alkaloids. The symbiotic morning glory lineages occur in distinct phylogenetic clades, and host species have significantly larger seed size than nonsymbiotic species. The distinct and widely distributed endosymbiotic relationships in the morning glory family and their alkaloids provide an accessible study system for understanding heritable plant-fungal symbiosis evolution and their potential functions for host plants.
