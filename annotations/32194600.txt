DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system is important for maintaining DNA replication fidelity and genome stability by repairing erroneous deletions, insertions and mis-incorporation of bases. With the aim of deciphering the role of the MMR system in genome stability and recombination in rice, we investigated the function of <i>OsMSH6</i> gene, an import component of the MMR system. To achieve this goal, homeologous recombination and endogenous microsatellite stability were evaluated by using rice mutants carrying a <i>Tos17</i> insertion into the <i>OsMSH6</i> gene. Totally 60 microsatellites were analyzed and 15 distributed on chromosome 3, 6, 8, and 10 showed instability in three <i>OsMSH6</i> mutants, D6011, NF7784 and NF9010, compared with the wild type MSH6WT (the control). The disruption of <i>OsMSH6</i> gene is associated with modest increases in homeologous recombination, ranging from 2.0% to 32.5% on chromosome 1, 3, 9, and 10 in the BCF<sub>2</sub> populations of the mutant ND6011 and NF9010. Our results suggest that the <i>OsMSH6</i> plays an important role in ensuring genome stability and genetic recombination, providing the first evidence for the <i>MSH6</i> gene in maintaining microsatellite stability and restricting homeologous recombination in plants.
