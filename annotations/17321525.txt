Until recently the role of cyclic nucleotide monophosphates (cNMPs) in plants had been controversial, with equivocal data about their concentrations, biosynthetic and degrading enzymes, and cellular targets. This review discusses the current knowledge in this field, with focus on the largest class of cNMP targets in plant cells, the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs). Aspects of structure and function are addressed, with reference to studies in heterologous systems and in planta. The picture emerging, albeit still fragmented, is of proteins with diverse functions in the control of ion homeostasis, development, and defense against biotic and abiotic threats.

CNGCs: !control! ion homeostasis 
CNGCs: !regulate! development 
CNGCs: !protect! against biotic and abiotic threats
