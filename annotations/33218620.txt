['33218620', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role at various plant  developmental stages, including seed germination and seedling development, and  regulates stomatal aperture in response to drought. However, the underlying  mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we showed that F-BOX OF FLOWERING 2  (FOF2) is induced by ABA and drought stress. Overexpression of FOF2 led to  reduced ABA sensitivity during seed germination and early seedling development,  whereas the fof2 mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to ABA. Molecular and  genetic analyses revealed that FOF2 negatively affected ABA-mediated seed  germination and early seedling development partially by repressing the expression  of the ABA-signaling genes ABI3 and ABI5. Additionally, we found that  FOF2-overexpressing plants exhibited increased ABA contents, enhanced ABA  sensitivity during stomatal closure, and decreased water loss, thereby improving  tolerance to drought stress, in contrast to the fof2 mutant. Consistent with a  higher ABA content and enhanced drought tolerance, the expression of ABA- and  drought-induced genes and the ABA-biosynthesis gene NCED3 was upregulated in the  FOF2-overexpressing plants but downregulated in fof2 mutant in response to  drought stress. Taken together, our findings revealed that FOF2 plays an  important negative role in ABA-mediated seed germination and early seedling  development, as well as a positive role in ABA-mediated drought tolerance.', '2020 Dec', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2020.110643', 'Zhao']
