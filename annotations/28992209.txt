Protein secretion is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells and its mechanisms have been extensively studied. Proteins with an N-terminal leading sequence or transmembrane domain are delivered through the conventional protein secretion (CPS) pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This feature is conserved in yeast, animals, and plants. In contrast, the transport of leaderless secretory proteins (LSPs) from the cytosol to the cell exterior is accomplished via the unconventional protein secretion (UPS) pathway. So far, the CPS pathway has been well characterized in plants, with several recent studies providing new information about the regulatory mechanisms involved. On the other hand, studies on UPS pathways in plants remain descriptive, although a connection between UPS and the plant defense response is becoming more and more apparent. In this review, we present an update on CPS and UPS. With the emergence of new techniques, a more comprehensive understanding of protein secretion in plants can be expected in the future.
