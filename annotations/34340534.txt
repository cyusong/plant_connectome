Plants resist infection by pathogens using both preexisting barriers and inducible defense responses. Inducible responses are governed in a complex manner by various hormone signaling pathways. The relative contribution of hormone signaling pathways to nonhost resistance to pathogens is not well understood. In this study, we examined the molecular basis of disrupted nonhost resistance to the fungal species <i>Puccinia graminis</i>, which causes stem rust of wheat, in an induced mutant of the model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>. Through bioinformatic analysis, a 1-bp deletion in the mutant genotype was identified that introduces a premature stop codon in the gene <i>Bradi1g24100</i>, which is a homolog of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> gene <i>TIME FOR COFFEE</i> (<i>TIC</i>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, <i>TIC</i> is central to the regulation of the circadian clock and plays a crucial role in jasmonate signaling by attenuating levels of the transcription factor protein MYC2, and its mutational disruption results in enhanced susceptibility to the hemibiotroph <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Our similar finding for an obligate biotroph suggests that the biochemical role of <i>TIC</i> in mediating disease resistance to biotrophs is conserved in grasses, and that the correct modulation of jasmonate signaling during infection by <i>Puccinia graminis</i> may be essential for nonhost resistance to wheat stem rust in <i>B. distachyon</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
