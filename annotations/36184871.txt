Glutathione (GSH) is well known to play a crucial role in imparting resistance against various pathogen invasions. Nevertheless, the role of GSH in regulating miRNA-mediated defense response is yet to be explored. To decipher the GSH-mediated regulation of miRNA expression during necrotrophic infection in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, wild-type Col-0 and <i>AtECS1</i>, the transgenic line exhibiting enhanced GSH content, were infected with necrotrophic pathogen <i>Alternaria brassicicola. AtECS1</i> plants exhibited enhanced resistance as compared to wild-type. MiRNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to compare the miRNA expression in Col-0 and <i>AtECS</i>1 leaves. Under control condition, differentially expressed 96 known miRNAs and 17 novel miRNAs viz. ath-miR8167f, ath-miR1886.3, ath-miR3932b-5p, etc. were identified. However, under infected condition, 73 known and 43 novel differentially expressed miRNAs viz. ath-miR5652, ath-miR160b, ath-miR865-5p, etc. were identified. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis revealed that several miRNAs that target defense-related genes like leucine-rich repeat protein kinase, MYB transcription factors, TCP8, etc. were down regulated in the <i>AtECS1</i> line, which, in turn, relieves the repression of their target gene expression, leading to resistance against infection. Together, the present investigation suggests that GSH plays a decisive role in modulating the miRNA-mediated regulation of defense-related genes during pathogen invasion.
