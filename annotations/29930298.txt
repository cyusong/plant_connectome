['29930298', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules that play a prominent role in plant  response to numerous stresses, including plant interactions with herbivores.  Previous findings indicate that Arabidopsis plants showed an increase in H(2)O(2)  accumulation after Tetranychus urticae infestation. Despite its importance, no  information has been reported on the relationships between ROS-metabolizing  systems and the spider mite-triggered plant-induced responses. In this work, four  ROS-related genes that were differentially expressed between the resistant Bla-2  and the susceptible Kon Arabidopsis accessions were selected for the analysis.  These genes encode proteins putatively involved in the generation (BBE22) and  degradation (GPX7 and GSTU4) of H(2)O(2), and in the degradation of ascorbate  (AO). Overexpressing BBE22 and silencing GPX7, GSTU4 and AO resulted in higher  leaf damage and better mite performance relative to the wild-type plants. Minor  effects on H(2)O(2) accumulation obscure major effects on the expression of genes  related to ROS-metabolism and JA and SA signaling pathways, and on ROS-related  enzymatic activities. In conclusion, the integration of ROS and ROS-related  compounds and enzymes in the response of Arabidopsis to the spider mite T.  urticae was confirmed. However, the complex network involved in ROS signaling  makes difficult to predict the impact of a specific genetic manipulation.', '2018 Jun 21', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-018-27904-1', 'ORCID:']
