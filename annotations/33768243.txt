Lateral roots are important to forage for nutrients due to their ability to increase the uptake area of a root system. Hence, it comes as no surprise that lateral root formation is affected by nutrients or nutrient starvation, and as such contributes to the root system plasticity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating root adaptation dynamics toward nutrient availability is useful to optimize plant nutrient use efficiency. There is at present a profound, though still evolving, knowledge on lateral root pathways. Here, we aimed to review the intersection with nutrient signaling pathways to give an update on the regulation of lateral root development by nutrients, with a particular focus on nitrogen. Remarkably, it is for most nutrients not clear how lateral root formation is controlled. Only for nitrogen, one of the most dominant nutrients in the control of lateral root formation, the crosstalk with multiple key signals determining lateral root development is clearly shown. In this update, we first present a general overview of the current knowledge of how nutrients affect lateral root formation, followed by a deeper discussion on how nitrogen signaling pathways act on different lateral root-mediating mechanisms for which multiple recent studies yield insights.
