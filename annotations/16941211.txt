The wild species Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt (2n = 24, CC) is a valuable genetic resource for rice (O. sativa L., 2n = 24, AA) breeding and genomics research. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and molecular approaches were used to determine the nature and composition of the additional chromosome in a monosomic alien addition line (MAAL) of O. officinalis and its backcross progenies. The extra wild species chromosome in the MAAL (2n = 2x = 25) was a mosaic one, comprising of the long arm of chromosome 4 from O. officinalis and the short arm from O. sativa. Comparative analysis showed that O. sativa and O. officinalis shared high synteny of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and low synteny of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A DNA methylation alteration was revealed at C619 in the MAAL and progenies. Analysis of progenies of the MAAL indicated that introgression segments were small in size and introgression was not evenly distributed along the long arm. One recombination hot spot between C513 and RG177 was identified, which is in a gene-rich region.
