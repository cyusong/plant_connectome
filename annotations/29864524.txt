['29864524', 'Phytophthora pathogens secrete a large arsenal of effectors that manipulate host  processes to create an environment conducive to pathogen colonization. However,  the underlying mechanisms by which Phytophthora effectors manipulate host plant  cells still remain largely unclear. In this study, we report that PcAvr3a12, a  Phytophthora capsici RXLR effector and a member of the Avr3a effector family,  suppresses plant immunity by targeting and inhibiting host plant peptidyl-prolyl  cis-trans isomerase (PPIase). Overexpression of PcAvr3a12 in Arabidopsis thaliana  enhanced plant susceptibility to P. capsici. FKBP15-2, an endoplasmic reticulum  (ER)-localized protein, was identified as a host target of PcAvr3a12 during early  P. capsici infection. Analyses of A. thaliana T-DNA insertion mutant (fkbp15-2),  RNAi, and overexpression lines consistently showed that FKBP15-2 positively  regulates plant immunity in response to Phytophthora infection. FKBP15-2  possesses PPIase activity essential for its contribution to immunity but is  directly suppressed by PcAvr3a12. Interestingly, we found that FKBP15-2 is  involved in ER stress sensing and is required for ER stress-mediated plant  immunity. Taken together, these results suggest that P. capsici deploys an RXLR  effector, PcAvr3a12, to facilitate infection by targeting and suppressing a novel  ER-localized PPIase, FKBP15-2, which is required for ER stress-mediated plant  immunity.', '2018 Aug 6', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2018.05.009', 'Shan']
