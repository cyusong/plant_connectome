Root rot of <i>Populus davidiana</i> × <i>P. alba</i> var. <i>pyramidalis</i> Louche (Pdpap) is caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>. We used RNA sequencing to study the molecular mechanisms and response pattern of Pdpap infected by <i>F. oxysporum</i> CFCC86068. We cloned the <i>PdpapWRKY28</i> transcription factor gene and transformed the recombinant vector pBI121-<i>PdpapWRKY28</i> into Pdpap. The resistance function of <i>PdpapWRKY28</i> was verified using physiological and biochemical methods. By means of RNA sequencing, we detected 1,403 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are common in the different treatments by <i>F. oxysporum</i>. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of the <i>PdpapWRKY28</i> gene may significantly improve the resistance of Pdpap plants to <i>F. oxysporum</i>. Our research reveals a key role for <i>PdpapWRKY28</i> in the resistance response of Pdpap to <i>F. oxysporum</i>. Additionally, our results provide a theoretical basis for in-depth research on resistance breeding to combat root rot.
