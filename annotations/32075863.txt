['32075863', 'Plastids differentiate into various functional types (chloroplasts, leucoplasts,  chromoplasts, etc.) that have distinct proteomes depending on the specific  tissue. Most plastid proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized as  higher molecular mass preproteins with an N-terminal transit peptide, and then  posttranslationally imported from the cytosol. Evidence for tissue-specific  regulation of import into plastids, and subsequent modulation of plastid  proteomes, has been lacking. We quantified protein import into isolated pea  (Pisum sativum) leaf chloroplasts and root leucoplasts and identified two  transit-peptide motifs that specifically enhance preprotein import into root  leucoplasts. Using a plastid preprotein expressed in both leaves and roots of  stable transgenic plants, we showed that losing one of the leucoplast motifs  interfered with its function in root leucoplasts but had no effect on its  function in leaf chloroplasts. We assembled a list of all Arabidopsis (Arabid  opsis thaliana) plastid preproteins encoded by recently duplicated genes and show  that, within a duplicated preprotein pair, the isoform bearing the leucoplast  motif usually has greater root protein abundance. Our findings represent a clear  demonstration of tissue-specific regulation of organelle protein import and  suggest that it operates by selective evolutionary retention of transit-peptide  motifs, which enhances import into specific plastid types.', '2020 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00702', 'ORCID:']
