Lignans are diphenolic compounds produced in plants via coupling of two coniferyl alcohol molecules with the aid of a dirigent protein to form pinoresinol (PINO). The latter is reduced via lariciresinol (LARI) to secoisolariciresinol by the bifunctional pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase (PLR). In this study, we clarified the consequences of altered lignan biosynthesis on amino acids, phenolics compounds and lignin in the hairy roots of Linum album with an ihpRNAi construct to silence PLR gene expression. Down-regulation of PLR-La1 resulted in up to an 8.3 and 3.3-time increased PINO and LARI content respectively, and reduced levels of podophyllotoxin (PTOX) and 6-methoxy podophyllotoxin (6-MPTOX). By Suppression of PLR expression, the metabolites belonging to shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways are conducted to phenolic compounds and lignin accumulations. Although PINO and LARI were induced in response to fungal elicitor, the accumulation of PTOX and 6-MPTOX did not occur in PLR down-regulated roots. Our result also demonstrated variation in amino acids, phenolic compounds and lignin levels in presence of the fungal elicitation in PLR down regulated-roots. This data assert the accumulation of aryltetralin lignans in interactions with plant pathogens by PLR activity and the importance this enzyme for defense against pathogens in L. album.
