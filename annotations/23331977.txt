['23331977', 'Potassium transporters and channels play crucial roles in K+ uptake and  translocation in plant cells. These roles are essential for plant growth and  development. AKT1 is an important K+ channel in Arabidopsis roots that is  involved in K+ uptake. It is known that AKT1 is activated by a protein kinase  CIPK23 interacting with two calcineurin B-like proteins CBL1/CBL9. The present  study showed that another calcineurin B-like protein (CBL10) may also regulate  AKT1 activity. The CBL10-over-expressing lines showed a phenotype as sensitive as  that of the akt1 mutant under low-K+ conditions. In addition, the K+ content of  both CBL10-over-expressing lines and akt1 mutant plants were significantly  reduced compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, CBL10 directly interacted with  AKT1, as verified in yeast two-hybrid, BiFC and co-immunoprecipitation  experiments. The results of electrophysiological analysis in both Xenopus oocytes  and Arabidopsis root cell protoplasts demonstrated that CBL10 impairs  AKT1-mediated inward K+ currents. Furthermore, the results from the yeast  two-hybrid competition assay indicated that CBL10 may compete with CIPK23 for  binding to AKT1 and negatively modulate AKT1 activity. The present study revealed  a CBL-interacting protein kinase-independent regulatory mechanism of calcineurin  B-like proteins in which CBL10 directly regulates AKT1 activity and affects ion  homeostasis in plant cells.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12123', 'Wu']
