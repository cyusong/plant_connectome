Sweet sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench] is a highly productive, gluten-free cereal crop plant that can be used as an alternative energy resource, human food, and livestock feed or for biofuel-ethanol production. Phosphate fertilization is a common practice to optimize sorghum yield but because of high cost, environmental hazards, and soil fertility reduction, the use of chemical P fertilizer is discouraged. Due to this, the impetus to search for an inexpensive and eco-friendly microbiome as an alternative to chemical P biofertilizer has been increased. Microbial formulations, especially phosphate solubilizing microbiome (PSM) either alone or in synergism with other rhizobacteria, modify the soil nutrient pool and augment the growth, P nutrition, and yield of sorghum. The use of PSM in sorghum disease management reduces the dependence on pesticides employed to control the phytopathogens damage. The role of PSM in the sorghum cultivation system is, however, relatively unresearched. In this manuscript, the diversity and the strategies adopted by PSM to expedite sorghum yield are reviewed, including the nutritional importance of sorghum in human health and the mechanism of P solubilization by PSM. Also, the impact of solo or composite inoculations of biological enhancers (PSM) with nitrogen fixers or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is explained. The approaches employed by PSM to control sorghum phytopathogens are highlighted. The simultaneous bio-enhancing and biocontrol activity of the PS microbiome provides better options for the replacement of chemical P fertilizers and pesticide application in sustainable sorghum production practices.
