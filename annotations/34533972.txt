Members of the <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> species complex (FGSC) cause extensive yield losses in cereal production worldwide, and food safety concerns due to the accumulation of <i>Fusarium</i> toxins in infected grains. Among these pathogens, <i>F. meridionale</i> is responsible for Fusarium head blight of wheat and rice, ear and stalk rot of maize, and pod blight of soybean. Here, we present an improved genome assembly of <i>F. meridionale</i> strain SR5 isolated from rice in China based on PacBio long-read sequencing and Illumina short-read sequencing technology. The assembled genome of SR5 has a total size of 36.82 Mb, an N<sub>50</sub> scaffold length of 7.82 Mb, nine scaffolds, and encodes 12,409 predicted genes. These high-quality data expand FGSC genomic resources and provide a valuable resource for better understanding their genetic diversity and the molecular basis of pathogenesis, which will facilitate the development of an effective control strategy.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
