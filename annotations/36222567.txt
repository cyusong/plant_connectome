Fluctuations in nitrogen (N) availability influence protein and starch levels in maize (Zea mays) seeds, yet the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we report that N limitation impacted the expression of many key genes in N and carbon (C) metabolism in the developing endosperm of maize. Notably, the promoter regions of those genes were enriched for P-box sequences, the binding motif of the transcription factor prolamin-box binding factor 1 (PBF1). Loss of PBF1 altered accumulation of starch and proteins in endosperm. Under different N conditions, PBF1 protein levels remained stable but PBF1 bound different sets of target genes, especially genes related to the biosynthesis and accumulation of N and C storage products. Upon N-starvation, the absence of PBF1 from the promoters of some zein genes coincided with their reduced expression, suggesting that PBF1 promotes zein accumulation in the endosperm. In addition, PBF1 repressed the expression of sugary1 (Su1) and starch branching enzyme 2b (Sbe2b) under normal N supply, suggesting that, under N-deficiency, PBF1 redirects the flow of C skeletons for zein toward the formation of C compounds. Overall, our study demonstrates that PBF1 modulates C and N metabolism during endosperm development in an N-dependent manner.
