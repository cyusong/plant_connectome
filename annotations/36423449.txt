The dry-land farming system of China relies on plastic film mulching and natural rainfall to mitigate damage caused by drought. However, the applications of deficit irrigation modes combined with the planting models can significantly increase production of wheat, dry matter translocation and radiation use efficiency (RUE) remains unidentified. Thus, in 2016-2018, we conducted field trials that implemented four deficit irrigation modes (IJF: irrigation at jointing and flowering stages; IF: irrigation at flowering stage; IJ: irrigation at jointing stage; NI: no irrigation) under two cultivation patterns (ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system (RF); traditional flat cultivation (TF)). The results indicated that the effects of RF system with deficit irrigation (IJF: 250 mm) could significantly increase the soil moisture, and thus enhanced LAI, I<sub>n</sub> value, IPAR, RUE, and PAR capture ratio than that of TF-NI planting. This is due to decreased canopy light transmittance (LT), reflection and penetration ratio of PAR, as a result considerable improve the biomass translocation and grain yield. Owing to the very low soil water content after the seed-filling, the LAI, IPAR, and I<sub>n</sub> value decreased during the seed-filling under water stress, ultimately affecting the dry matter translocation efficiency. While the IJF and IF treatments provided water for reproductive growth stage, therefore, the production of wheat and RUE were significantly maximum compared with IJ and NI irrigation mode. Under the RF system with IJF, IF, and IJ treatments the grain yield increased by 81.2%, 56.8%, 45.6% and 17.2%, then that of TF-NI treatment, respectively. The highest RUE (1.93 g MJ<sup>-1</sup>), dry-matter translocation (154.2%) and seed yield (81.2%) were obtained in the RF-IJF treatment compared with TF-NI. Therefore, the RF-IJF treatment significantly improved the earlier development and rapid plant growth, which is a suitable planting model for increasing soil moisture, LAI, RUE, DMT, and winter wheat production.
