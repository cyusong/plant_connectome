['22730405', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates stomatal movement under drought  stress, and this regulation requires hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We isolated GUARD  CELL HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-RESISTANT1 (GHR1), which encodes a receptor-like kinase  localized on the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis thaliana. ghr1 mutants were  defective ABA and H2O2 induction of stomatal closure. Genetic analysis indicates  that GHR1 is a critical early component in ABA signaling. The ghr1 mutation  impaired ABA- and H2O2-regulated activation of S-type anion currents in guard  cells. Furthermore, GHR1 physically interacted with, phosphorylated, and  activated the S-type anion channel SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED1 when  coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and this activation was inhibited by  ABA-INSENSITIVE2 (ABI2) but not ABI1. Our study identifies a critical component  in ABA and H2O2 signaling that is involved in stomatal movement and resolves a  long-standing mystery about the differential functions of ABI1 and ABI2 in this  process.', '2012 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.100107', 'Gong']
