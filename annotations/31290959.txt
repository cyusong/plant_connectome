Chlorophyll biosynthesis plays essential roles in photosynthesis and plant growth in response to environmental conditions. The accumulation of excess chlorophyll biosynthesis intermediates under light results in the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, oxidation under photoperiod (oxp), that displayed photobleached lesions on its leaves, reduced growth and decreased chlorophyll content during light/dark cycles or following a dark-to-light transition. The oxp mutant accumulated more chlorophyll precursors (5-aminolevulinic acid and protochlorophyllide) than the wild type in the dark, and more singlet oxygen following light exposure. Several singlet-oxygen-responsive genes were greatly upregulated in oxp, whereas the expression patterns of OsPORA and OsPORB, two genes encoding the chlorophyll biosynthesis enzyme NADPH:protochlorop hyllide oxidoreductase, were altered in de-etiolated oxp seedlings. Molecular and complementation studies revealed that oxp is a loss-of-function mutant in LOC_Os01g32730, a homolog of FLUORESCENT (FLU) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Rice PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE14 (OsPIL14) transcription factor directly bound to the OsFLU1 promoter and activated its expression. Dark-grown transgenic rice seedlings overexpressing OsPIL14 accumulated more chlorophyll and turned green faster than the wild type upon light illumination. Thus, OsFLU1 is an important regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice.
