['26184543', 'N-terminal acetylation (NTA) catalysed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (Nats) is  among the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes, but its significance  is still enigmatic. Here we characterize the plant NatA complex and reveal  evolutionary conservation of NatA biochemical properties in higher eukaryotes and  uncover specific and essential functions of NatA for development, biosynthetic  pathways and stress responses in plants. We show that NTA decreases significantly  after drought stress, and NatA abundance is rapidly downregulated by the  phytohormone abscisic acid. Accordingly, transgenic downregulation of NatA  induces the drought stress response and results in strikingly drought resistant  plants. Thus, we propose that NTA by the NatA complex acts as a cellular  surveillance mechanism during stress and that imprinting of the proteome by NatA  is an important switch for the control of metabolism, development and cellular  stress responses downstream of abscisic acid.', '2015 Jul 17', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms8640', 'Wirtz']
