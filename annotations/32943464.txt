Wood formation is a complex process that involves cell differentiation, cell expansion, secondary wall deposition, and programmed cell death. We constructed a four-layer wood formation transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) in <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> (black cottonwood) that has four Secondary wall-associated NAC-Domain1 (PtrSND1) transcription factor (TF) family members as the top-layer regulators. We characterized the function of a MYB (PtrMYB161) TF in this PtrSND1-TRN, using transgenic <i>P</i> <i>trichocarpa</i> cells and whole plants. PtrMYB161 is a third-layer regulator that directly transactivates five wood formation genes. Overexpression of <i>PtrMYB161</i> in <i>P. trichocarpa</i> (<i>OE</i>-<i>PtrMYB161</i>) led to reduced wood, altered cell type proportions, and inhibited growth. Integrative analysis of wood cell-based chromatin-binding assays with <i>OE</i>-<i>PtrMYB161</i> transcriptomics revealed a feedback regulation system in the PtrSND1-TRN, where PtrMYB161 represses all four top-layer regulators and one second-layer regulator, PtrMYB021, possibly affecting many downstream TFs in, and likely beyond, the TRN, to generate the observed phenotypic changes. Our data also suggested that the PtrMYB161's repressor function operates through interaction of the base PtrMYB161 target-binding system with gene-silencing cofactors. PtrMYB161 protein does not contain any known negative regulatory domains. CRISPR-based mutants of <i>PtrMYB161</i> in <i>P. trichocarpa</i> exhibited phenotypes similar to the wild type, suggesting that PtrMYB161's activator functions are redundant among many TFs. Our work demonstrated that PtrMYB161 binds to multiple sets of target genes, a feature that allows it to function as an activator as well as a repressor. The balance of the two functions may be important to the establishment of regulatory homeostasis for normal growth and development.
