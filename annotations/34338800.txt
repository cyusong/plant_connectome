['34338800', 'Protein S-acylation is an important post-translational modification in  eukaryotes, regulating the subcellular localization, trafficking, stability, and  activity of substrate proteins. The dynamic regulation of this reversible  modification is mediated inversely by protein S-acyltransferases and  de-S-acylation enzymes, but the de-S-acylation mechanism remains unclear in plant  cells. Here, we characterized a group of putative protein de-S-acylation enzymes  in Arabidopsis thaliana, including 11 members of Alpha/Beta Hydrolase  Domain-containing Protein 17-like acyl protein thioesterases (ABAPTs). A robust  system was then established for the screening of de-S-acylation enzymes of  protein substrates in plant cells, based on the effects of substrate localization  and confirmed via the protein S-acylation levels. Using this system, the ABAPTs,  which specifically reduced the S-acylation levels and disrupted the plasma  membrane localization of five immunity-related proteins, were identified  respectively in Arabidopsis. Further results indicated that the de-S-acylation of  RPM1-Interacting Protein 4, which was mediated by ABAPT8, resulted in an increase  of cell death in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana, supporting the  physiological role of the ABAPTs in plants. Collectively, our current work  provides a powerful and reliable system to identify the pairs of plant protein  substrates and de-S-acylation enzymes for further studies on the dynamic  regulation of plant protein S-acylation.', '2021 Oct 11', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab199', 'ORCID:']
