Sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.) is an important sugar-producing and energy crop worldwide. The sugar beet pure line IMA1 independently bred by Chinese scientists is a standard diploid parent material that is widely used in hybrid-breeding programs. In this study, a high-quality, chromosome-level genome assembly for IMA1was conducted, and 99.1% of genome sequences were assigned to nine chromosomes. A total of 35,003 protein-coding genes were annotated, with 91.56% functionally annotated by public databases. Compared with previously released sugar beet assemblies, the new genome was larger with at least 1.6 times larger N50 size, thereby substantially improving the completeness and continuity of the sugar beet genome. A Genome-Wide Association Studies analysis identified 10 disease-resistance genes associated with three important beet diseases and five genes associated with sugar yield per hectare, which could be key targets to improve sugar productivity. Nine highly expressed genes associated with pollen fertility of sugar beet were also identified. The results of this study provide valuable information to identify and dissect functional genes affecting sugar beet agronomic traits, which can increase sugar beet production and help screen for excellent sugar beet breeding materials. In addition, information is provided that can precisely incorporate biotechnology tools into breeding efforts.
