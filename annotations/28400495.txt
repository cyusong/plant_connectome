Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important regulators of plant immunity. Most of the knowledge about the function of these pathways is derived from loss-of-function approaches. Using a gain-of-function approach, we investigated the responses controlled by a constitutively active (CA) MPK3 in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i><i>CA-MPK3</i> plants are dwarfed and display a massive derepression of defense genes associated with spontaneous cell death as well as the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, phytoalexins, and the stress-related hormones ethylene and salicylic acid (SA). Remarkably <i>CA-MPK3</i>/<i>sid2</i> and <i>CA-MPK3</i>/<i>ein2-50</i> lines, which are impaired in SA synthesis and ethylene signaling, respectively, retain most of the <i>CA-MPK3</i>-associated phenotypes, indicating that the constitutive activity of MPK3 can bypass SA and ethylene signaling to activate defense responses. A comparative analysis of the molecular phenotypes of <i>CA-MPK3</i> and <i>mpk4</i> autoimmunity suggested convergence between the MPK3- and MPK4-guarding modules. In support of this model, <i>CA-MPK3</i> crosses with <i>summ1</i> and <i>summ2</i>, two known suppressors of <i>mpk4</i>, resulted in a partial reversion of the <i>CA-MPK3</i> phenotypes. Overall, our data unravel a novel mechanism by which the MAPK signaling network contributes to a robust defense-response system.
