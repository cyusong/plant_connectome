Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the prevailing plant model systems used for most facets of plant molecular, cell, and evolutionary biology. There are good reasons for that, such as easy cultivation, short generation time, a selfing reproductive system, and a wide geographic distribution with easy access to respective germplasm material. For the last two decades, the entire genus Arabidopsis with its various species has emerged as a model system allowing the study of additional traits and characters not found in A. thaliana. These species grow naturally under very different environmental conditions and mostly underwent independent evolutionary histories. Accordingly, consideration of their respective biogeographic and phylogenetic (taxonomic) context is important for any study aiming to explore fully the potential of comparative studies. Here, we review current understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of Arabidopsis evolutionary history and introduce the various taxa in more detail, including those traits well studied by the scientific community. The significance of polyploidization and interspecies gene flow is also discussed.
