The circadian clock coordinates the physiological responses of a biological system to day and night rhythms through complex loops of transcriptional/translational regulation. It can respond to external stimuli and adjust generated circadian oscillations accordingly to maintain an endogenous period close to 24 h. However, the interaction between nutritional status and circadian rhythms in plants is poorly understood. Magnesium (Mg) is essential for numerous biological processes in plants, and its homeostasis is crucial to maintain optimal development and growth. Magnesium deficiency in young Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings increased the period of circadian oscillations of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) promoter (pCCA1:LUC) activity and dampened their amplitude under constant light in a dose-dependent manner. Although the circadian period increase caused by Mg deficiency was light dependent, it did not depend on active photosynthesis. Mathematical modeling of the Mg input into the circadian clock reproduced the experimental increase of the circadian period and suggested that Mg is likely to affect global transcription/translation levels rather than a single component of the circadian oscillator. Upon addition of a low dose of cycloheximide to perturb translation, the circadian period increased further under Mg deficiency, which was rescued when sufficient Mg was supplied, supporting the model's prediction. These findings suggest that sufficient Mg supply is required to support proper timekeeping in plants.
