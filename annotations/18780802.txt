['18780802', 'Little is known about the molecular and regulatory mechanisms of long-distance  nitrate transport in higher plants. NRT1.5 is one of the 53 Arabidopsis thaliana  nitrate transporter NRT1 (Peptide Transporter PTR) genes, of which two members,  NRT1.1 (CHL1 for Chlorate resistant 1) and NRT1.2, have been shown to be involved  in nitrate uptake. Functional analysis of cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes  showed that NRT1.5 is a low-affinity, pH-dependent bidirectional nitrate  transporter. Subcellular localization in plant protoplasts and in planta  promoter-beta-glucuronidase analysis, as well as in situ hybridization, showed  that NRT1.5 is located in the plasma membrane and is expressed in root pericycle  cells close to the xylem. Knockdown or knockout mutations of NRT1.5 reduced the  amount of nitrate transported from the root to the shoot, suggesting that NRT1.5  participates in root xylem loading of nitrate. However, root-to-shoot nitrate  transport was not completely eliminated in the NRT1.5 knockout mutant, and  reduction of NRT1.5 in the nrt1.1 background did not affect root-to-shoot nitrate  transport. These data suggest that, in addition to that involving NRT1.5, another  mechanism is responsible for xylem loading of nitrate. Further analyses of the  nrt1.5 mutants revealed a regulatory loop between nitrate and potassium at the  xylem transport step.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.060244', 'Tsay']
