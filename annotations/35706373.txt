How mycoheterotrophic plants that obtain carbon and soil nutrients from fungi are integrated in the usually mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal networks is unknown. Here, we compare autotrophic and mycoheterotrophic plant associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and use network analysis to investigate interaction preferences in the tripartite network. We sequenced root tips from autotrophic and mycoheterotrophic plants to assemble the combined tripartite network between autotrophic plants, mycorrhizal fungi and mycoheterotrophic plants. We compared plant-fungi interactions between mutualistic and antagonist networks, and searched for a diamond-like module defined by a mycoheterotrophic and an autotrophic plant interacting with the same pair of fungi to investigate whether pairs of fungi simultaneously linked to plant species from each interaction type were overrepresented throughout the network. Mycoheterotrophic plants as a group interacted with a subset of the fungi detected in autotrophs but are indirectly linked to all autotrophic plants, and fungi with a high overlap in autotrophic partners tended to interact with a similar set of mycoheterotrophs. Moreover, pairs of fungi sharing the same mycoheterotrophic and autotrophic plant species are overrepresented in the network. We hypothesise that the maintenance of antagonistic interactions is maximised by targeting well linked mutualistic fungi, thereby minimising the risk of carbon supply shortages.
