['18830673', 'The BIM1 protein which has been implicated in brassinosteroid (BR) signal  transduction was identified from a two hybrid screen using the N-terminus,  including the AP2 domain, of the transcription factors DORNROESCHEN (DRN) and  DORNROESCHEN-LIKE (DRNL) which control embryonic patterning. The protein-protein  interaction between BIM1 and DRN or DRNL was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation  and for DRN also in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. BIM1 can  also physically interact with PHAVOLUTA (PHV), another interaction partner of DRN  and DRNL. Loss of BIM1 function results in embryo patterning defects at low  penetrance, including cell division defects in the hypophyseal region and apical  domain defects such as cotyledon fusion and polycotyledony, in addition to  polyembryony. BIM1 expression overlaps with that of DRN and DRNL from early  globular embryo stages onwards. Higher order mutants between bim1, drn, drnl and  phv suggest that although BIM1 may act partially redundantly with DRN in early  embryo development, all genes function within the same pathway determining  cotyledon development, supporting the hypothesis that they participate in a  multimeric transcription factor complex. A role of BIM1 in embryonic development  not only implicates a function for brassinosteroids in this process, but the  interaction of BIM1 with DRN, involved with auxin signalling, represents a  possible point of hormonal crosstalk in embryonic patterning and the first  example of an interaction of components of the auxin and BR signalling pathways.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9405-6', 'Werr']
