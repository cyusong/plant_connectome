C4 photosynthesis optimizes plant carbon and water relations, allowing high photosynthetic rates with low stomatal conductance. Stomata have long been considered a part of the C4 syndrome. However, it remains unclear how stomatal traits evolved along the path from C3 to C4. Here, we examined stomata in the Flaveria genus, a model used for C4 evolutionary study. Comparative, transgenic, and semi-in vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular basis that underlies the changes of stomatal traits in C4 evolution. The evolution from C3 to C4 species is accompanied by a gradual rather than an abrupt change in stomatal traits. The initial change appears near the Type I intermediate stage. Co-evolution of the photosynthetic pathway and stomatal traits is supported. On the road to C4, stomata tend to be fewer in number but larger in size and stomatal density dominates changes in anatomical maximum stomatal conductance (gsmax). Reduction of FSTOMAGEN expression underlies decreased gsmax in Flaveria and likely occurs in other C4 lineages. Decreased gsmax contributes to the increase in intrinsic water-use efficiency in C4 evolution. This work highlights the stomatal traits in the current C4 evolutionary model. Our study provides insights into the pattern, mechanism, and role of stomatal evolution along the road toward C4.
