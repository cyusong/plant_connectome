Auxin is associated with the regulation of virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Many previous genetic and biochemical studies revealed that, among the proposed routes for the production of auxin, the so-called indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway is the main source for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in plants. The IPA pathway involves the action of 2 classes of enzymes, tryptophan-pyruvate aminotransferases (TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1(TAA1)/TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED (TAR)) and flavin monooxygenases (YUCCA). Both enzyme classes appear to be encoded by small gene families in Arabidopsis consisting of 5 and 11 members, respectively. We recently showed that it is possible to induce transcript accumulation of 2 YUCCA genes, YUC8 and YUC9, by methyl jasmonate treatment. Both gene products were demonstrated to contribute to auxin biosynthesis in planta. (1) Here we report that the overexpression of YUC8 as well as YUC9 led to strong lignification of plant aerial tissues. Furthermore, new evidence indicates that this abnormally strong secondary growth is linked to increased levels of ethylene production.
