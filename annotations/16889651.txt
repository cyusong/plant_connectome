['16889651', "The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls numerous physiological traits:  dormancy and germination of seeds, senescence and resistance to abiotic stresses.  In order to get more insight into the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)  in ABA signalling, we obtained eight homozygous T-DNA insertion lines in  Arabidopsis thaliana PTP genes. One mutant, named phs1-3, exhibited a strong  ABA-induced inhibition of germination as only 26% of its seeds germinated after 3  days instead of 92% for the Columbia (Col-0) line. Genetic and molecular analyses  of phs1-3 showed that it bears a unique T-DNA insertion in the promoter of the  gene and that the mutation is recessive. PHS1 expression in the mutant is about  half that of the Col-0 line. The upregulation of two ABA-induced genes  (At5g06760, RAB18) and the downregulation of two ABA-repressed genes (AtCLC-A,  ACL) are enhanced in the phs1-3 mutant compared with the wild-type. The 'in  planta' aperture of phs1-3 stomata is reduced and the inhibition of the  light-induced opening of stomata by ABA is stronger in phs1-3 leaves than in  Col-0 leaves. Finally, PHS1 expression is upregulated in the presence of ABA in  both phs1-3 and Col-0 but more intensively in the mutant. Thus, phs1-3 is  hypersensitive to ABA. Taken together, these results show that PHS1, which  encodes a dual-specificity PTP, is a negative regulator of ABA signalling.", '2006 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02823.x', 'Maldiney']
