['16757173', 'At5g52560, a homolog of pea (Pisum sativum) UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (PsUSP)  was functionally annotated by expression in Escherichia coli and subsequent  characterization of substrate specificity and kinetic properties. Arabidopsis  contains a single USP gene (AtUSP) and evaluation of gene databases suggests that  USP is unique to plants. The 69 kDa AtUSP gene product exhibited high activity  with Glc-1-P, GlcA-1-P and Gal-1-P, but low activity with GlcNAc-1-P, Fuc-1-P,  Man-1-P, inositol-1-P or Glc-6-P. AtUSP was activated by magnesium and preferred  UTP as co-substrate. Apparent K(m) values for GlcA-1-P, Glc-1-P and UTP were 0.13  mM, 0.42 mM and 0.14 mM, respectively. In the reverse direction  (pyrophosphorolysis), the apparent K(m) values for UDP-GlcA, UDP-Glc and  pyrophosphate were 0.56 mM, 0.72 mM and 0.15 mM, respectively. USP enzyme  activity (UDP-GlcA --> GlcA-1-P) was detected in Arabidopsis tissues with highest  activity found in the inflorescence. As determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR,  AtUSP transcript is widely expressed with high levels detected in the  inflorescence. To evaluate tissue-specific expression of AtUSP, histochemical GUS  staining of plants transformed with AtUSPprom:GUS constructs was performed. In  7-day-old seedlings, GUS staining was detected in cotyledons, trichomes and  vascular tissues of the primary root. In the inflorescence of older plants, high  levels of GUS staining were detected in cauline leaves, the epidermis of the stem  and in pollen. In silico analysis of AtUSP expression in developing pollen  indicates that transcript levels increase as development proceeds from the  uninucleate to the tricellular stage. The results suggest that AtUSP plays an  important role in pollen development in Arabidopsis.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2006.04.004', 'Somers']
