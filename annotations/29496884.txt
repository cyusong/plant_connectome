['29496884', 'Stomata are ports that facilitate gas and water vapor exchange between plants and  their environment. Stomatal development is strictly regulated by endogenous  signals and environmental cues. Jasmonate is an important signal that modulates  multiple physiological processes in plants, yet the molecular mechanisms  underlying its interactions with other developmental signaling pathways remain  poorly understood. Here, we show that jasmonate negatively regulates stomatal  development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cotyledons. Cotyledons of the  wild type and stomata-overproliferating mutants (such as too many mouths-1 and  stomatal density and distribution1-1) treated with methyl jasmonate exhibit a  clear reduction in stomata number. By contrast, blocking endogenous jasmonate  biosynthesis or perception enhanced stomatal development. Moreover, three MYC  transcription factors involved in jasmonate signaling, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, were  found to redundantly modulate jasmonate-inhibited stomatal development. A genetic  analysis showed that these MYC proteins act upstream of the SPEECHLESS and FAMA  transcription factors to mediate stomatal development. Furthermore, jasmonate  repression of stomatal development is dependent on these three MYC transcription  factors, as stomatal development of the myc2 myc3 myc4 triple mutant was  insensitive to methyl jasmonate treatment. Collectively, our study demonstrates  that jasmonate and MYC transcription factors negatively regulate stomatal  development in Arabidopsis cotyledons.', '2018 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00444', 'ORCID:']
