Banana fruit (Musa acuminate L.) ripening is a complex genetical process affected by multiple phytohormones and expression of various genes. However, whether plant hormone brassinosteroid (BR) is involved in this process remains obscure. In this work, three genes that encode BR core signaling components brassinazole resistant (BZR) proteins, namely MaBZR1 to MaBZR3, were characterized from banana fruit. MaBZR1-MaBZR3 exhibited both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization and behaved as transcription inhibitors. Expression analysis showed that MaBZR1/2/3 were continuously decreased as fruit ripening proceeded, indicating their negative roles in banana ripening. Moreover, gel shift and transient expression assays demonstrated that MaBZR1/2 could suppress the transcription of ethylene biosynthetic genes, including MaACS1, MaACO13 and MaACO14, which increased gradually during the banana ripening, via specifically binding to CGTGT/CG sequence in their promoters. Importantly, exogenous application of BRs promotes banana ripening, which is presumably due to the accelerated expression of MaACS1 and MaACO13/14, and consequently the ethylene production. Our study indicates that MaBZR1/2 act as transcriptional repressors of ethylene biosynthetic genes during banana fruit ripening.
