Within African savannas, elephants often damage individual trees to the extent that they influence tree density. New research shows that mutualistic ants inhabiting certain species of Acacia protect trees from catastrophic herbivory by elephants. Protection by the ants stabilizes tree cover across savannas in what is otherwise a highly dynamic biome.
