Grafting-induced flowering is a key phenomenon to understand systemic floral induction caused by florigen. It can also be used as a breeding technique enabling rapid seed production of crops with long generation times. However, the degree of floral induction in grafted plants is often variable. Moreover, it is difficult in some crop species. Here, we explored the factors promoting variability in the grafting-induced flowering of cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata), an important vegetable crop with a long generation time, via the quantitative analysis of florigen accumulation. Significant variability in the flowering response of grafted cabbage was observed when rootstocks of different genotypes were used. As reported previously, B. oleracea rootstocks did not induce the flowering of grafted cabbage plants, but radish (Raphanus sativus L.) rootstocks unstably did, depending on the accessions used. Immunoblotting analysis of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein, a main component of florigen, revealed that floral induction was quantitatively correlated with the level of accumulated FT protein in the grafted scion. To identify rootstock factors that cause variability in the floral induction of the grafted scion, we investigated FT protein accumulation and flowering response in grafted scions when the transcription levels of FT and the leaf area of rootstocks were altered by vernalization, daylength and leaf trimming treatments. We concluded that increasing the total amount of FT protein produced in the rootstock is important for the stable floral induction of the grafted cabbage, and this can be accomplished by increasing FT transcription and the leaf area of the rootstock.
