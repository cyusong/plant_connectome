['21992944', 'Plant cells frequently undergo endoreduplication, a modified cell cycle in which  genome is repeatedly replicated without cytokinesis. As the key step to achieve  final size and function for cells, endoreduplication is prevalent during plant  development. However, mechanisms to control the balance between endoreduplication  and mitotic cell division are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the  Arabidopsis TCP (CINCINNATA-like TEOSINTE BRANCHED1-CYCLOIDEA-PCF)-family  transcription factor gene AtTCP15 is expressed in trichomes, as well as in  rapidly dividing and vascular tissues. Expression of AtTCP15SRDX, AtTCP15 fused  with a SRDX repressor domain, induces extra endoreduplication in trichomes and  cotyledon cells in transgenic Arabidopsis. On the contrary, overexpression of  AtTCP15 suppresses endoreduplication in trichomes and other examined cells.  Misregulation of AtTCP15 affects the expression of several important genes  involved in cell-cycle regulation. AtTCP15 protein binds directly to the promoter  regions of CYCA2;3 and RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) genes, which play key roles  in endoreduplication. Taken together, AtTCP15 plays an important role in  regulating endoreduplication during Arabidopsis development.', '2012 Jan', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssr086', 'Dong']
