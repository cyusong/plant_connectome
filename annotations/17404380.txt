The present study assesses light-induced variations in phenolic compounds in leaves of saplings of two co-occurring temperate species (Acer platanoides L., and Fraxinus excelsior L.) along a light gradient using a new non-invasive optical method (Dualex). The Dualex-derived UV absorbance of leaf epidermis (the sum of the adaxial and abaxial faces, AUV) increased significantly with increasing light in both species. AUV values were correlated with absorbance of the leaf extract at 305 nm and 375 nm (A305 and A375) in both species with similar slopes for both species. However, a large difference in intercept was observed between the two species when A305 was regressed against AUV. Similarly, AUV values were well correlated with the amount of phenolics in the leaf extracts assessed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, but slopes were significantly different for the two species. Thus, the UV-A epidermal transmittance, despite being a reliable indicator of the UV-screening capacity of the leaf epidermis, cannot be used for any quantitative estimate of UV-B screening capacity or of energetic requirement for leaf construction without a species-specific calibration.
