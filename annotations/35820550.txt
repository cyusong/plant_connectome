['35820550', 'To bear harsh environmental threats, plants have developed complex protection  mechanisms involving phytohormones, counting abscisic acid (ABA). The function of  the F-Box family containing the Domain of Unknown Function 295 (DUF295) has not  yet been comprehensively characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In  this study, we evaluated the function of a putative member of the F-Box/DUF295  family in Arabidopsis, F-box/DUF295 Brassiceae specific 2 (FDB2). We found that  FDB2 expression was suppressed by ABA and abiotic stresses. FDB2 overexpression  (OE) reduced ABA sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth, but  enhanced ABA-sensitivity of seed germination and seedling growth in fdb2 mutants  was scored. When treated with ABA, expressions of ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 showed  decreased in OE lines but increased in fdb2 mutants. In addition, ABA-induced  FDB2 degradation exhibited sensitive to MG132, suggesting that FDB2 degradation  by ABA might be mediated by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system. Moreover,  ABA-induced significant over-accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the  root tips of fdb2 mutants was observed, this phenomenon was correlated to reduced  activities of a set of ROS scavengers in fdb2 mutants relative to Col-0. In  summary, our results suggest that Arabidopsis FDB2 is involved in ABA-mediated  inhibition of seed germination, seedling growth including modulation of ROS  homeostasis in roots.', '2022 Oct', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.111369', 'Wu']
