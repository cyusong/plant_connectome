Warty fruit in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is an important quality trait that greatly affects fruit appearance and market value. The cucumber wart consists of fruit trichomes (spines) and underlying tubercules, in which the existence of spines is prerequisite for tubercule formation. Although several regulators have been reported to mediate spine or tubercule formation, the direct link between spine and tubercule development remains unknown. Here, we found that the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) gene HECATE2 (CsHEC2) was highly expressed in cucumber fruit peels including spines and tubercules. Knockout of CsHEC2 by the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in reduced wart density and decreased cytokinin (CTK) accumulation in the fruit peel, whereas overexpression of CsHEC2 led to elevated wart density and CTK level. CsHEC2 is directly bound to the promoter of the CTK hydroxylase-like1 gene (CsCHL1) that catalyzes CTK biosynthesis, and activated CsCHL1 expression. Moreover, CsHEC2 physically interacted with GLABROUS3 (CsGL3, a key spine regulator) and Tuberculate fruit (CsTu, a core tubercule formation factor), and such interactions further enhanced CsHEC2-mediated CsCHL1 expression. These data suggested that CsHEC2 promotes wart formation by acting as an important cofactor for CsGL3 and CsTu to directly stimulate CTK biosynthesis in cucumber. Thus, CsHEC2 can serve as a valuable target for molecular breeding of cucumber varieties with different wart density requirements.
