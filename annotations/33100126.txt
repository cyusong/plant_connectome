The <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcription factor Myeloblastosis protein 75 (MYB75, AT1G56650) is a well-established transcriptional activator of genes required for anthocyanin and flavonoid production, and a repressor of lignin and other secondary cell wall biosynthesis genes. MYB75 is itself tightly regulated at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels, including protein phosphorylation by <i>Arabidopsis</i> MAP kinases Examination of the behavior of different phosphovariant versions of MYB75 <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> revealed that overexpression of the MYB75<sup>T131E</sup> phosphovariant had a particularly marked effect on global changes in gene expression suggesting that phosphorylated MYB75 could be involved in a broader range of functions than previously recognized. Here, we describe a range of distinct developmental phenotypes observed among <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines expressing various phosphovariant forms of MYB75. Expression of either <i>MYB75<sup>T131E</sup></i> or <i>MYB75<sup>T131A</sup></i> phosphovariants, from the endogenous <i>MYB75</i> promoter, in <i>Arabidopsis myb75<sup>-</sup></i> mutants (Nossen background), resulted in severely impaired germination rates, and developmental arrest at early seedling stages. <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants overexpressing <i>MYB75<sup>T131E</sup></i> from a strong constitutive Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV35S) promoter displayed slower development, with delayed bolting, flowering and onset of senescence. Conversely, <i>MYB75<sup>T131A</sup></i> -overexpressing lines flowered and set seed earlier than either Col-0 WT controls or other <i>MYB75</i>-overexpressors (<i>MYB75<sup>WT</sup></i> and <i>MYB75<sup>T131E</sup></i> ). Histochemical analysis of mature stems also revealed ectopic vessel development in plants overexpressing <i>MYB75</i>; this phenotype was particularly prominent in the <i>MYB75<sup>T131E</sup></i> phosphovariant. These data suggest that MYB75 plays a significant role in plant development, and that this aspect of MYB75 function is influenced by its phosphorylation status.
