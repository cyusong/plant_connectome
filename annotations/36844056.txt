<i>GoSAMTs</i> play a role in the methylation of polysaccharides synthesized by the Golgi. Pectin homogalacturonan (HG) methyl-esterification is essential for the proper function of this polysaccharide in cell walls. In order to better understand the role of <i>GoSAMTs</i> in HG biosynthesis, we analyzed mucilage methyl-esterification in <i>gosamt</i> mutants. To determine the function of <i>GoSAMT1</i> and <i>GoSAMT2</i> in HG methyl-esterification we utilized epidermal cells of seed coats, as these structures produce mucilage, which is a pectic matrix. We evaluated differences in seed surface morphology and quantified mucilage release. We measured methanol release, and used antibodies and confocal microscopy to analyze HG methyl-esterification in mucilage. We observed morphological differences on the seed surface and delayed, uneven mucilage release in <i>gosamt1-1gosamt2-1</i> double mutants. We also found changes in the distal wall length indicating abnormal cell wall breakage in this double mutant. Using methanol release and immunolabeling, we confirmed that <i>GoSAMT1</i> and <i>GoSAMT2</i> are involved in HG methyl-esterification in mucilage. However, we did not find evidence of decreasing HG in the <i>gosamt</i> mutants. Confocal microscopy analyses detected different patterns in the adherent mucilage and a greater number of low-methyl-esterified domains near the seed coat surface, which correlates with a greater number of "egg-box" structures in this region. We also detected a shift in the partitioning between the Rhamnogalacturonan-I soluble and adherent layers of the double mutant, which correlated with increased amounts of arabinose and arabinogalactan-protein in the adherent mucilage. The results show that the HG synthesized in <i>gosamt</i> mutant plants is less methyl esterified, resulting in more egg-box structures, which stiffen the cell walls in epidermal cells and change the rheological properties of the seed surface. The increased amounts of arabinose and arabinogalactan-protein in adherent mucilage, also suggests that compensation mechanisms were triggered in the <i>gosamt</i> mutants.
