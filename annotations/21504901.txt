['21504901', 'Phytosulfokines (PSKs) are sulfated pentapeptides that stimulate plant growth and  differentiation mediated by the PSK receptor (PSKR1), which is a leucine-rich  repeat receptor-like kinase. We identified a putative guanylate cyclase (GC)  catalytic center in PSKR1 that is embedded within the kinase domain and  hypothesized that the GC works in conjunction with the kinase in downstream PSK  signaling. We expressed the recombinant complete kinase (cytoplasmic) domain of  AtPSKR1 and show that it has serine/threonine kinase activity using the Ser/Thr  peptide 1 as a substrate with an approximate K(m) of 7.5 mum and V(max) of 1800  nmol min(-1) mg(-1) of protein. This same recombinant protein also has GC  activity in vitro that is dependent on the presence of either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+).  Overexpression of the full-length AtPSKR1 receptor in Arabidopsis leaf  protoplasts raised the endogenous basal cGMP levels over 20-fold, indicating that  the receptor has GC activity in vivo. In addition, PSK-alpha itself, but not the  non-sulfated backbone, induces rapid increases in cGMP levels in protoplasts.  Together these results indicate that the PSKR1 contains dual GC and kinase  catalytic activities that operate in vivo and that this receptor constitutes a  novel class of enzymes with overlapping catalytic domains.', '2011 Jun 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110.168823', 'Irving']
