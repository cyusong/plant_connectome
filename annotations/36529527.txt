Auxin plays pleiotropic roles in plant development via gene regulation upon its perception by the receptors TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFBs). This auxin-regulated transcriptional control mechanism originated in the common ancestor of land plants. Although the complete loss of TIR1/AFBs causes embryonic lethality in Arabidopsis thaliana, it is unclear whether the requirement for TIR1-mediated auxin perception in cell viability can be generalized. The model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha has a minimal auxin signaling system with only a single TIR1/AFB, MpTIR1. Here we show by genetic, biochemical, and transcriptomic analyses that MpTIR1 functions as an evolutionarily conserved auxin receptor. Null mutants and conditionally knocked-out mutants of MpTIR1 were viable but incapable of forming any organs and grew as cell masses. Principal component analysis performed using transcriptomes at various developmental stages indicated that MpTIR1 is involved in the developmental transition from spores to organized thalli, during which apical notches containing stem cells are established. In Mptir1 cells, stem cell- and differentiation-related genes were up- and downregulated, respectively. Our findings suggest that, in M. polymorpha, auxin signaling is dispensable for cell division but is essential for three-dimensional patterning of the plant body by establishing pluripotent stem cells for organogenesis, a derived trait of land plants.
