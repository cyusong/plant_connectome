['16513846', 'The gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) is required for the initiation and the  maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis and encodes a  MEINOX/three amino acid loop extension (TALE)-HD-type transcription factor.  Translational fusions with the green fluorescent protein showed that STM is not  nuclear by default. In a yeast two-hybrid screen performed with a  meristem-enriched cDNA library, three interacting BLH (Bel1-like homeodomain)  transcription factors were identified. According to bimolecular fluorescence  complementation, STM is targeted into the nuclear compartment through  heterodimerization with BLH partner proteins, which are expressed in distinct SAM  domains from the center to the periphery. On a functional level, overexpression  experiments in transgenic Arabidopsis plants suggest that individual heterodimers  provide distinct contributions. These results contribute to our understanding of  the STM transcription factor function in the SAM and also shed new light on the  evolution of the TALE-HD super gene family in animal and plant lineages.', '2006', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkl016', 'Werr']
