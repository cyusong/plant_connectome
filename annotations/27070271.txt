Plants respond and adapt to temperature changes by many ways. In this article, we provide a supplement to previous work about AtPLC3. The subcellular localization showed that AtPLC3 was located in the plasma membrane and nucleus which differed from AtPLC9 localization. Furthermore, we measured the contents of IP<sub>3</sub> before and after HS in AtPLC3 mutant, complemented and overexpressing lines. The results showed that the increase in IP<sub>3</sub> after HS was partially dependent on AtPLC3 activity. To sum up, the similar expression patterns and phenotypes suggested that AtPLC3 and AtPLC9 may regulate the thermotolerance of Arabidopsis by the same mechanisms.
