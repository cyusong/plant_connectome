The coordinated development of sporophytic and gametophytic tissues is essential for proper ovule patterning and fertility. However, the mechanisms regulating their integrated development remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the Swi2/Snf2-Related1 (SWR1) chromatin-remodeling complex acts with the ERECTA receptor kinase-signaling pathway to control female gametophyte and integument growth in Arabidopsis thaliana by inhibiting transcription of the microRNA gene MIR398c in early-stage megagametogenesis. Moreover, pri-miR398c is transcribed in the female gametophyte but is then translocated to and processed in the ovule sporophytic tissues. Together, SWR1 and ERECTA also activate ARGONAUTE10 (AGO10) expression in the chalaza; AGO10 sequesters miR398, thereby ensuring the expression of three AGAMOUS-LIKE (AGL) genes (AGL51, AGL52, and AGL78) in the female gametophyte. In the context of sexual organ morphogenesis, these findings suggest that the spatiotemporal control of miRNA biogenesis, resulting from coordination between chromatin remodeling and cell signaling, is essential for proper ovule development in Arabidopsis.
