['22202891', 'RADiation sensitive52 (RAD52) mediates RAD51 loading onto single-stranded DNA  ends, thereby initiating homologous recombination and catalyzing DNA annealing.  RAD52 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, including animals and fungi. This  article reports that RAD52 homologs are present in all plants whose genomes have  undergone extensive sequencing. Computational analyses suggest a very early RAD52  gene duplication, followed by later lineage-specific duplications, during the  evolution of higher plants. Plant RAD52 proteins have high sequence similarity to  the oligomerization and DNA binding N-terminal domain of RAD52 proteins.  Remarkably, the two identified Arabidopsis thaliana RAD52 genes encode four open  reading frames (ORFs) through differential splicing, each of which specifically  localized to the nucleus, mitochondria, or chloroplast. The A. thaliana RAD52-1A  ORF provided partial complementation to the yeast rad52 mutant. A. thaliana  mutants and RNA interference lines defective in the expression of RAD52-1 or  RAD52-2 showed reduced fertility, sensitivity to mitomycin C, and decreased  levels of intrachromosomal recombination compared with the wild type. In summary,  computational and experimental analyses provide clear evidence for the presence  of functional RAD52 DNA-repair homologs in plants.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.091744', 'Levy']
