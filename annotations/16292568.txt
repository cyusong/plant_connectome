The phloem-feeding by greenbug (Schizaphis graminum) elicits unique interactions with their host plants. To investigate the expression profiles of sorghum genes responsive to greenbug feeding, two subtractive cDNA libraries were constructed through different combinatorial subtractions in a strong greenbug resistance sorghum M627 line and a susceptible Tx7000 line with or without greenbug infestation. A total of 3,508 cDNAs were selected from the two cDNA libraries, and subsequent cDNA microarray and northern blot analyses were performed for identification of sorghum genes responsive to greenbugs. In total, 157 sorghum transcripts were identified to be differentially expressed by greenbug feeding. The greenbug responsive genes were isolated and classified into nine categories according to the functional roles in plant metabolic pathways, such as defense, signal transduction, cell wall fortification, oxidative burst/stress, photosynthesis, development, cell maintenance, abiotic stress, and unknown function. Overall, the profiles of sorghum genes, responsive to greenbug phloem-feeding shared common identities with other expression profiles known to be elicited by diverse stresses, including pathogenesis, abiotic stress, and wounding. In addition to well-known defense related regulators such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid, auxin and gibberellic acid were also involved in mediation of the defense responses against greenbug phloem-feeding in sorghum.
