The <i>SELF PRUNING</i> (<i>SP</i>) gene is a key regulator of growth habit in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). It is an ortholog of <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i>, a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein with antiflorigenic activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A spontaneous loss-of-function mutation (<i>sp</i>) has been bred into several industrial tomato cultivars, as it produces a suite of pleiotropic effects that are favorable for mechanical harvesting, including determinate growth habit, short plant stature, and simultaneous fruit ripening. However, the physiological basis for these phenotypic differences has not been thoroughly explained. Here, we show that the <i>sp</i> mutation alters polar auxin transport as well as auxin responses, such as gravitropic curvature and elongation of excised hypocotyl segments. We also demonstrate that free auxin levels and auxin-regulated gene expression patterns are altered in <i>sp</i> mutants. Furthermore, <i>diageotropica</i>, a mutation in a gene encoding a cyclophilin A protein, appears to confer epistatic effects with <i>sp</i> Our results indicate that SP affects the tomato growth habit at least in part by influencing auxin transport and responsiveness. These findings suggest potential novel targets that could be manipulated for controlling plant growth habit and improving productivity.
