Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) target homologous genomic DNA sequences for cytosine methylation, known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), plays an important role in transposon control and regulation of gene expression in plants. Repressor of silencing 1 (ROS1) can negatively regulate the RdDM pathway. In this paper, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which an upstream regulator ACD6 in the salicylic acid (SA) defense pathway, an ABA pathway-related gene ACO3, and GSTF14, an endogenous gene of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily, were induced by various abiotic stresses. The results demonstrated that abiotic stresses, including water deficit, cold, and salt stresses, induced demethylation of the repeats in the promoters of ACD6, ACO3, and GSTF14 and transcriptionally activated their expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation plays an important role in the process of transcriptional activation of ACD6 and GSTF14 when Arabidopsis plants are subjected to cold stress. This study revealed that ROS1 plays an important role in the molecular mechanisms associated with genes involved in defense pathways in response to abiotic stresses.
