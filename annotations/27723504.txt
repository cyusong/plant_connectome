APETALA2 (AP2) belongs to the AP2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (ERF) family and regulates expression levels of downstream stress responsive genes as a transcription factor. In this study, we cloned six different isoforms of AhAP2 from peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Four isoforms (AhAP2.1, AhAP2.2, AhAP2.3 and AhAP2.4) had both AP2/ERF DNA binding domains and ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs. Two isoforms (AhAP2.5 and AhAP2.6) only had an EAR suppressor domain. After agroinfiltration, AhAP2.1, AhAP2.3, and AhAP2.4 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) showed localization to the nucleolus, which is the site of transcription and ribosome biogenesis. AhAP2.2-YFP showed a dispersed signal in the nucleus. AhAP2.5 and AhAP2.6 fused to YFP localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In addition, increased levels of AhAP2.1 and AhAP2.2 transcripts were observed in drought-treated peanut leaves, suggesting differential transcriptional regulation under drought stress conditions.
