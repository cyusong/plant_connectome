Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is an important industrial crop for natural rubber production. Ethylene, as a stimulant of latex production in H. brasiliensis, has been widely used in commercial latex production. However, the mechanism of ethylene action are not completely elucidated, especially in molecular aspect. Here, we focus on the molecular biological progression of ethylene stimulation of latex production. Our data and all previous information showed ethylene had little direct effect on accelerating rubber biosynthesis. The prolonged latex flow and acceleration of sucrose metabolism by ethylene may be the main reasons for the stimulation of latex yield by ethylene.

Ethylene: !stimulates! Latex production
Ethylene: !accelerates! Sucrose metabolism
Ethylene: !has little direct effect on! Rubber biosynthesis
