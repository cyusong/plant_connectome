['27789389', 'The unique type of GTPases in plants, termed ROPs, are the small GTP-binding  proteins involved in signal transduction which play important roles in regulation  of hormonal response pathway, cell polarity, defense from plant pathogens, etc.  In order to explore the regulation mechanism of AtROPs involved in, the purified  ROPs were needed to explore the interactions of ROP GTPases with their regulators  and effectors. In this study, the first ROP GTPase from Arabidopsis thaliana,  AtROP6(6-178) was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and obtained in high  quality and purity through affinity chromatography and gel-filtration  chromatography. The resultant protein was identified as a single band of 19 kDa  in SDS-PAGE and was confirmed to be active to interact with guanine nucleotides  through the fluorescence-based assay. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence  intensity of AtROP6(6-178) was enhanced upon interacting with either GDP or GTP.  Meanwhile, the equilibrium dissociation constants of AtROP6(6-178) with  fluorescent guanine nucleotide analogue mantGDP and mantGTP were determined to be  0.0721 muM and 0.0422 muM, respectively, based on fluorescence polarization.', '2017 Mar', 'Protein Expr Purif', '10.1016/j.pep.2016.10.009', 'Dong']
