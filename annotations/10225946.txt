['10225946', 'Phytochrome is a ubiquitous photoreceptor of plants and is encoded by a small  multigene family. We have shown recently that a functional nuclear localization  signal may reside within the COOH-terminal region of a major member of the  family, phytochrome B (phyB) (Sakamoto, K., and A. Nagatani. 1996. Plant J.  10:859-868). In the present study, a fusion protein consisting of full-length  phyB and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was overexpressed in the phyB mutant  of Arabidopsis to examine subcellular localization of phyB in intact tissues. The  resulting transgenic lines exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes reported previously  for phyB overexpressing plants, suggesting that the fusion protein is  biologically active. Immunoblot analysis with anti-phyB and anti-GFP monoclonal  antibodies confirmed that the fusion protein accumulated to high levels in these  lines. Fluorescence microscopy of the seedlings revealed that the phyB-GFP fusion  protein was localized to the nucleus in light grown tissues. Interestingly, the  fusion protein formed speckles in the nucleus. Analysis of confocal optical  sections confirmed that the speckles were distributed within the nucleus. In  contrast, phyB-GFP fluorescence was observed throughout the cell in dark-grown  seedlings. Therefore, phyB translocates to specific sites within the nucleus upon  photoreceptor activation.', '1999 May 3', 'J Cell Biol', '10.1083/jcb.145.3.437', 'Nagatani']
