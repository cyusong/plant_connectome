['35274464', 'Plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an indispensable role in the control of  leaf senescence, during which ABA signaling depends on its biosynthesis.  Nevertheless, the role of ABA transport in leaf senescence remains unknown. Here,  we identified two novel RING-box protein-encoding genes UBIQUITIN LIGASE of  SENESCENCE 1 and 2 (ULS1 and ULS2) involved in leaf senescence. Lack of ULS1 and  ULS2 accelerates leaf senescence, which is specifically promoted by ABA  treatment. Furthermore, the expression of senescence-related genes is  significantly affected in mature leaves of uls1/uls2 double mutant (versus wild  type (WT)) in an ABA-dependent manner, and the ABA content is substantially  increased. ULS1 and ULS2 are mainly expressed in the guard cells and aging  leaves, and the expression is induced by ABA. Further RNA-seq and quantitative  proteomics of ubiquitination reveal that ABA transporter ABCG40 is highly  expressed in uls1/uls2 mutant versus WT, though it is not the direct target of  ULS1/2. Finally, we show that the acceleration of leaf senescence, the increase  of leaf ABA content, and the promotion of stomatal closure in uls1/usl2 mutant  are suppressed by abcg40 loss-of-function mutation. These results indicate that  ULS1 and ULS2 function in feedback inhibition of ABCG40-dependent ABA transport  during ABA-induced leaf senescence and stomatal closure.', '2022 May', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13247', 'ORCID:']
