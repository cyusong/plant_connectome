'Candidatus Phytoplasma tritici' ('Ca. P. tritici') is an insect-borne obligate pathogen that infects wheat (Triticum aestivum) causing wheat blue dwarf disease, and leads to yield losses. SWP12 is a potential effector secreted by 'Ca. P. tritici' that manipulates host processes to create an environment conducive to phytoplasma colonization, but the detailed mechanism of action remains to be investigated. In this study, the expression of SWP12 weakened the basal immunity of Nicotiana benthamiana and promoted leaf colonization by Phytophthora parasitica, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and tobacco mild green mosaic virus. Moreover, the expression of SWP12 in wheat plants promoted phytoplasma colonization. Triticum aestivum WRKY74 and N. benthamiana WRKY17 were identified as host targets of SWP12. The expression of TaWRKY74 triggered reactive oxygen species bursts, upregulated defense-related genes, and decreased TaCRR6 transcription, leading to reductions in NADH dehydrogenase complex (NDH) activity. Expression of TaWRKY74 in wheat increased plant resistance to 'Ca. P. tritici', and silencing of TaWRKY74 enhanced plant susceptibility, which indicates that TaWRKY74 is a positive regulator of wheat resistance to 'Ca. P. tritici'. We showed that SWP12 weakens plant resistance and promotes 'Ca. P. tritici' colonization by destabilizing TaWRKY74.
