Most crops are sensitive to salt stress, but their degree of susceptibility varies among species and cultivars. In order to understand the salt stress adaptability of <i>Brassica napus</i> to salt stress, we collected the phenotypic data of 505 <i>B. napus</i> accessions at the germination stage under 150 or 215 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) and at the seedling stage under 215 mM NaCl. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 16 salt tolerance coefficients (STCs) were applied to investigate the genetic basis of salt stress tolerance of <i>B. napus</i>. In this study, we mapped 31 salts stress-related QTLs and identified 177 and 228 candidate genes related to salt stress tolerance were detected at germination and seedling stages, respectively. Overexpression of two candidate genes, <i>BnCKX5</i> and <i>BnERF3</i> overexpression, were found to increase the sensitivity to salt and mannitol stresses at the germination stage. This study demonstrated that it is a feasible method to dissect the genetic basis of salt stress tolerance at germination and seedling stages in <i>B. napus</i> by GWAS, which provides valuable loci for improving the salt stress tolerance of <i>B. napus</i>. Moreover, these candidate genes are rich genetic resources for the following exploration of molecular mechanisms in adaptation to salt stress in <i>B. napus</i>.
