Unlike in animals, the reproductive lineage cells in plants differentiate from within somatic tissues late in development to produce a specific haploid generation of the life cycle-male and female gametophytes. In flowering plants, the male gametophyte develops within the anthers and the female gametophyte-within the ovule. Both gametophytes consist of only a few cells. There are two major stages of gametophyte development-meiotic and post-meiotic. In the first stage, sporocyte mother cells differentiate within the anther (pollen mother cell) and the ovule (megaspore mother cell). These sporocyte mother cells undergo two meiotic divisions to produce four haploid daughter cells-male spores (microspores) and female spores (megaspores). In the second stage, the haploid spore cells undergo few asymmetric haploid mitotic divisions to produce the 3-cell male or 7-cell female gametophyte. Both stages of gametophyte development involve extensive epigenetic reprogramming, including siRNA dependent changes in DNA methylation and chromatin restructuring. This intricate mosaic of epigenetic changes determines, to a great extent, embryo and endosperm development in the future sporophyte generation.
