Protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination are two reversible processes catalyzed by ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes, respectively. In Arabidopsis, lots of substrates of ubiquitin ligases were found, whereas only a few targets of deubiquitinating enzymes were identified. Recently, we reported that a functional UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE16 (UBP16) was involved in salt tolerance through positively regulating plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiport activity and at least partially modulating SERINE HYDROXYMETHYLTRANSFERASE1 (SHM 1) stability and activity. Here, we report that UBP16 interacts with HEAVY META L ASSOCIATED ISOPRENYLATED PLANT PROTEIN 27 (HI PP27), a metallochaperone containing a predicted heavy-metal-associated domain, which has been reported to play an important role in cadmium detoxification. Meanwhile, the ubp16 mutant showed more sensitive to cadmium than wild-type. Taken together, HI PP27 may be another target of UBP16 in cadmium response.
