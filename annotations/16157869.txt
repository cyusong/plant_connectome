RNA silencing is an evolutionarily conserved process in eukaryotes that represses gene expression by using 21- to 24-nt guide RNAs to mediate mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. Plants have two distinct groups of silencing-associated small RNAs (smRNAs): the micro RNAs (miRNAs) and the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). A recent report by Yu et al. [Yu, B., Yang, Z., Li, J., Minakhina, S., Yang, M., Padgett, R. W., Steward, R. & Chen, X. (2005) Science 307, 932-935] has shown that plant miRNAs are modified at their 3' termini with a methyl group. Here, we show that a large fraction of all silencing-associated smRNAs in tobacco are modified; this modification occurs on the 2' hydroxyl of the terminal ribose and significantly reduces the cloning efficiency of these modified smRNAs. Expression of the strong silencing suppressor P1/helper-component proteinase results in a marked decrease in the 3'-terminal modification of viral siRNAs but does not significantly affect the modification of endogenous miRNAs and 24-nt siRNAs. The differential modification mediated by helper-component proteinase expression implies that exogenous and endogenous smRNAs are processed through independent pathways that are isolated by subcellular compartmentalization and/or the association with distinct Dicer complexes. The degree of terminal modification may play an important role in regulating the extent to which primary smRNA signals can be amplified by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
