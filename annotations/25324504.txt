['25324504', 'We isolated an Arabidopsis ABA-insensitive mutant, ais143, by activation tagging  screen. T-DNA was found to be located in the coding region of a putative  mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) gene, Raf10, thereby  abolishing its expression in the mutant. ais143 exhibited reduced seed dormancy  as well as reduced ABA sensitivity. The phenotypes were complemented by the  wild-type Raf10 gene, and the overexpression (OX) of Raf10 resulted in delayed  seed germination and enhanced ABA sensitivity. Raf10 has high sequence identity  to another MAP3K, Raf11. Parallel analysis of Raf11 knockout (KO) and OX lines  showed that their phenotypes were similar to those of Raf10 KO and OX lines. An  ais143 raf11 double mutant exhibited stronger phenotypes than single mutants,  indicating the functional redundancy between Raf10 and Raf11. Transcript analysis  revealed that the expression of many ABA-associated genes, including the key  regulatory genes ABI3 and ABI5, was altered in the Raf10 and Raf11 OX lines.  Recombinant Raf10 and Raf11 proteins exhibited kinase activity, which was  inhibited by the MAP3K inhibitor BAY 43-9006 but not by the MAP2K inhibitor  U0126. Collectively, our data indicate that Raf10 and Raf11 kinases are important  regulators of seed dormancy and ABA response and that they affect the expression  of ABI3, ABI5 and other ABA-regulated genes.', '2015 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcu148', 'Kim']
