The incorporation of xyloglucan oligosaccharide (XXXG) into the walls of suspension-cultured tobacco cells accelerated cell expansion followed by cell division, changed cell shape from cylindrical to spherical, decreased cell size, and caused cell aggregation. Fluorescent XXXG added to the culture medium was found to be incorporated into the surface of the entire wall, where strong incorporation occurred not only on the surface, but also in the interface walls between cells during cell division. Cell expansion was always greater in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal direction and then, immediately, expansion led to cell division in the presence of XXXG; this process might result in the high level of cell aggregation seen in cultured tobacco cells. We concluded that the integration of this oligosaccharide into the walls could accelerate not only cell expansion, but also cell division in cultured cells.
