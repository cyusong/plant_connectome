N <sup><i>6</i></sup> -methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most abundant modification of eukaryotic mRNA. Although m<sup>6</sup>A has been demonstrated to affect almost all aspects of RNA metabolism, its global contribution to the post-transcriptional balancing of translational efficiency remains elusive in plants. In this study, we performed a parallel analysis of the transcriptome-wide mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A distribution and polysome profiling in two maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines to assess the global correlation of m<sup>6</sup>A modification with translational status. m<sup>6</sup>A sites are widely distributed in thousands of protein-coding genes, confined to a consensus motif and primarily enriched in the 3' untranslated regions, and highly coordinated with alternative polyadenylation usage, suggesting a role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in regulating alternative polyadenylation site choice. More importantly, we identified that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification shows multifaceted correlations with the translational status depending on its strength and genic location. Moreover, we observed a substantial intraspecies variation in m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and this natural variation was shown to be partly driven by gene-specific expression and alternative splicing. Together, these findings provide an invaluable resource for ascertaining transcripts that are subject to m<sup>6</sup>A modification in maize and pave the way to a better understanding of natural m<sup>6</sup>A variation in mediating gene expression regulation.
