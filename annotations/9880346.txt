['9880346', 'Arabidopsis has inducible responses for tolerance of O2 deficiency. Plants  previously exposed to 5% O2 were more tolerant than the controls to hypoxic  stress (0.1% O2 for 48 h) in both roots and shoots, but hypoxic acclimation did  not improve tolerance to anoxia (0% O2). The acclimation of shoots was not  dependent on the roots: increased shoot tolerance was observed when the roots of  the plants were removed. An adh (alcohol dehydrogenase) null mutant did not show  acclimation of the roots but retained the shoot survival response. Abscisic acid  treatment also differentiated the root and shoot responses; pretreatment induced  root survival in hypoxic stress conditions (0.1% O2) but did not induce any  increase in the survival of shoots. Cycloheximide blocked both root and shoot  acclimation, indicating that both acclimation mechanisms are dependent on protein  synthesis.', '1999 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.119.1.57', 'Peacock']
