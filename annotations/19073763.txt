['19073763', 'Several recent proteomic studies of plant peroxisomes indicate that the  peroxisomal matrix harbors multiple ATP-dependent enzymes and chaperones.  However, it is unknown whether plant peroxisomes are able to produce ATP by  substrate-level phosphorylation or whether external ATP fuels the  energy-dependent reactions within peroxisomes. The existence of transport  proteins that supply plant peroxisomes with energy for fatty acid oxidation and  other ATP-dependent processes has not previously been demonstrated. Here, we  describe two Arabidopsis thaliana genes that encode peroxisomal adenine  nucleotide carriers, PNC1 and PNC2. Both proteins, when fused to enhanced yellow  fluorescent protein, are targeted to peroxisomes. Complementation of a yeast  mutant deficient in peroxisomal ATP import and in vitro transport assays using  recombinant transporter proteins revealed that PNC1 and PNC2 catalyze the  counterexchange of ATP with ADP or AMP. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines repressing  both PNC genes were generated using ethanol-inducible RNA interference. A  detailed analysis of these plants showed that an impaired peroxisomal ATP import  inhibits fatty acid breakdown during early seedling growth and other  beta-oxidation reactions, such as auxin biosynthesis. We show conclusively that  PNC1 and PNC2 are essential for supplying peroxisomes with ATP, indicating that  no other ATP generating systems exist inside plant peroxisomes.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062042', 'Weber']
