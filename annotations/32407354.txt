Pollen wall consists of several complex layers which form elaborate species-specific patterns. In Arabidopsis, the transcription factor ABORTED MICROSPORE (AMS) is a master regulator of exine formation, and another transcription factor, TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT SILENCING VIA AT-HOOK (TEK), specifies formation of the nexine layer. However, knowledge regarding the temporal regulatory roles of TEK in pollen wall development is limited. Here, TEK-GFP driven by the AMS promoter was prematurely expressed in the tapetal nuclei, leading to complete male sterility in the pAMS:TEK-GFP (pat) transgenic lines with the wild-type background. Cytological observations in the pat anthers showed impaired callose synthesis and aberrant exine patterning. CALLOSE SYNTHASE5 (CalS5) is required for callose synthesis, and expression of CalS5 in pat plants was significantly reduced. We demonstrated that TEK negatively regulates CalS5 expression after the tetrad stage in wild-type anthers and further discovered that premature TEK-GFP in pat directly represses CalS5 expression through histone modification. Our findings show that TEK flexibly mediates its different functions via different temporal regulation, revealing that the temporal regulation of TEK is essential for exine patterning. Moreover, the result that the repression of CalS5 by TEK after the tetrad stage coincides with the timing of callose wall dissolution suggests that tapetum utilizes temporal regulation of genes to stop callose wall synthesis, which, together with the activation of callase activity, achieves microspore release and pollen wall patterning.
