['11311233', 'Jasmonates (JA) act as a regulator in plant growth as well as a signal in plant  defense. The Arabidopsis vegetative storage protein (AtVSP) and plant  defense-related proteins thionin (Thi2.1) and defensin (PDF1.2) have previously  been shown to accumulate in response to JA induction. In this report, we isolated  and characterized a novel recessive mutant, cex1, conferring constitutive  JA-responsive phenotypes including JA-inhibitory growth and constitutive  expression of JA-regulated AtVSP, Thi2.1 and PDF1.2. The plant morphology and the  gene expression pattern of the cex1 mutant could be phenocopied by treatment of  wild-type plants with exogenous JA, indicating that CEX1 might be a negative  regulator of the JA response pathway.', '2001 Apr 13', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(01)02331-6', 'Xie']
