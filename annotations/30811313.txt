DNA transformation and homology-based transcriptional silencing are frequently used to assess gene function in <i>Phytophthora</i> spp. Since unplanned side-effects of these tools are not well-characterized, we used <i>P. infestans</i> to study plasmid integration sites and whether knockdowns caused by homology-dependent silencing spread to other genes. Insertions occurred both in gene-dense and gene-sparse regions but disproportionately near the 5' ends of genes, which disrupted native coding sequences. Microhomology at the recombination site between plasmid and chromosome was common. Studies of transformants silenced for 12 different gene targets indicated that neighbors within 500 nt were often cosilenced, regardless of whether hairpin or sense constructs were employed and the direction of transcription of the target. However, this <i>cis</i> spreading of silencing did not occur in all transformants obtained with the same plasmid. Genome-wide studies indicated that unlinked genes with partial complementarity with the silencing-inducing transgene were not usually down-regulated. We learned that hairpin or sense transgenes were not cosilenced with the target in all transformants, which informs how screens for silencing should be performed. We conclude that transformation and gene silencing can be reliable tools for functional genomics in <i>Phytophthora</i> spp. but must be used carefully, especially by testing for the spread of silencing to genes flanking the target.
