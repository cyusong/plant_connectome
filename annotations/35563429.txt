Rapid industrialization, mine tailings runoff, and agricultural activities are often detrimental to soil health and can distribute hazardous metal(loid)s into the soil environment, with harmful effects on human and ecosystem health. Plants and their associated microbes can be deployed to clean up and prevent environmental pollution. This green technology has emerged as one of the most attractive and acceptable practices for using natural processes to break down organic contaminants or accumulate and stabilize metal pollutants by acting as filters or traps. This review explores the interactions between plants, their associated microbiomes, and the environment, and discusses how they shape the assembly of plant-associated microbial communities and modulate metal(loid)s remediation. Here, we also overview microbe-heavy-metal(loid)s interactions and discuss microbial bioremediation and plants with advanced phytoremediation properties approaches that have been successfully used, as well as their associated biological processes. We conclude by providing insights into the underlying remediation strategies' mechanisms, key challenges, and future directions for the remediation of metal(loid)s-polluted agricultural soils with environmentally friendly techniques.
