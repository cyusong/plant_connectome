['17425719', 'The gaseous pollutant SO(2) readily reacts with water to form sulfite that  impacts deleteriously on animal and plant health. By modulating the level of  sulfite oxidase (SO) that catalyzes the transformation of sulfites to the  non-toxic sulfate, we show that Arabidopsis and tomato plants can be rendered  resistant or susceptible to SO(2)/sulfite. Plants in which sulfite oxidase  expression was abrogated by RNA interference (RNAi) accumulated relatively less  sulfate after SO(2) application and showed enhanced induction of senescence and  wounding-associated transcripts, leaf necrosis and chlorophyll bleaching. In  contrast, SO overexpression lines accumulated relatively more sulfate and showed  little or no necrosis after SO(2) application. The transcript of sulfite  reductase, a chloroplast-localized enzyme that reduces sulfites to sulfides, was  shown to be rapidly induced by SO(2) in a sulfite oxidase-dependent manner.  Transcripts of other sulfite-requiring enzymatic activities such as  mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferases and UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase 1 were  induced later and to a lesser extent, whereas SO was constitutively expressed and  was not significantly induced by SO(2). The results imply that plants can utilize  sulfite oxidase in a sulfite oxidative pathway to cope with sulfite overflow.', '2007 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03080.x', 'Sagi']
