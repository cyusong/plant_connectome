The chloroplast glutamyl-tRNA (tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>) is unique in that it has two entirely different functions. In addition to acting in translation, it serves as the substrate of glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR), the enzyme catalyzing the committed step in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. How the tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> pool is distributed between the two pathways and whether tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> allocation limits tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and/or protein biosynthesis remains poorly understood. We generated a series of transplastomic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) plants to alter tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> expression levels and introduced a point mutation into the plastid <i>trnE</i> gene, which has been reported to uncouple protein biosynthesis from tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in chloroplasts of the protist <i>Euglena gracilis</i> We show that, rather than comparable uncoupling of the two pathways, the <i>trnE</i> mutation is lethal in tobacco because it inhibits tRNA processing, thus preventing translation of Glu codons. Ectopic expression of the mutated <i>trnE</i> gene uncovered an unexpected inhibition of glutamyl-tRNA reductase by immature tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> We further demonstrate that whereas overexpression of tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> does not affect tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, reduction of GluTR activity through inhibition by tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> precursors causes tetrapyrrole synthesis to become limiting in early plant development when active photosystem biogenesis provokes a high demand for de novo chlorophyll biosynthesis. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the roles of tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> at the intersection of protein biosynthesis and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis.
