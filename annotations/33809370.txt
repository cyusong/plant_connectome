B-box proteins represent diverse zinc finger transcription factors and regulators forming large families in various plants. A unique domain structure defines them-besides the highly conserved B-box domains, some B-box (BBX) proteins also possess CCT domain and VP motif. Based on the presence of these specific domains, they are mostly classified into five structural groups. The particular members widely differ in structure and fulfill distinct functions in regulating plant growth and development, including seedling photomorphogenesis, the anthocyanins biosynthesis, photoperiodic regulation of flowering, and hormonal pathways. Several BBX proteins are additionally involved in biotic and abiotic stress response. Overexpression of some <i>BBX</i> genes stimulates various stress-related genes and enhanced tolerance to different stresses. Moreover, there is evidence of interplay between B-box and the circadian clock mechanism. This review highlights the role of BBX proteins as a part of a broad regulatory network in crop plants, considering their participation in development, physiology, defense, and environmental constraints. A description is also provided of how various BBX regulators involved in stress tolerance were applied in genetic engineering to obtain stress tolerance in transgenic crops.
