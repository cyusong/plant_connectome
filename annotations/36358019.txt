Wheat plants are ubiquitously simultaneously exposed to salinity and limited iron availability caused by soil saline-alkalisation. Through this study, we found that both low Fe and NaCl severely inhibited the growth of seminal roots in wheat seedlings; however, sufficient Fe caused greater growth cessation of seminal roots than low Fe under salt stress. Low Fe improved the root meristematic division activity, not altering the mature cell sizes compared with sufficient Fe under salt stress. Foliar Fe spray and split-root experiments showed that low Fe-alleviating the salinity-induced growth cessation of seminal roots was dependent on local low Fe signals in the roots. Ionomics combined with TEM/X-ray few differences in the root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> sequestration between two Fe levels under salt stress. Phytohormone profiling and metabolomics revealed salinity-induced overaccumulation of ACC/ethylene and tryptophan/auxin in the roots under sufficient Fe than under low Fe. Differential gene expression, pharmacological inhibitor addition and the root growth performance of transgenic wheat plants revealed that the rootward auxin efflux and was responsible for the low Fe-mediated amelioration of the salinity-induced growth cessation of seminal roots. Our findings will provide novel insights into the modulation of crop root growth under salt stress.
