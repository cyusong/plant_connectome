<i>Phomopsis vexans</i>, which causes Phomopsis blight of eggplant, has been reported worldwide. To study the biocontrol of this disease, 162 leaf and fruit samples of eggplant Phomopsis blight were collected from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Anhui Provinces from 2017 to 2019. Eighty-seven pathogenic fungus isolates were identified as <i>P. vexans.</i> The following studies were conducted: screening of sporulation medium, spore morphology analysis, mycovirus detection and identification of novel mycoviruses in these isolates. The results showed that eggplant tissue medium was the most suitable medium for rapid sporulation, and all isolates had mycoviruses consisting of mainly mixed infections. The genome of these mycoviruses varied from 1-15 kb. Five novel mycoviruses infecting <i>P. vexans</i> were obtained, including "<i>Phomopsis vexans</i> fusarivirus 1" (PvFV1), "<i>Phomopsis vexans</i> ourmia-like virus 1" (PvOLV1), "<i>Phomopsis vexans</i> endornavirus 2" (PvEV2), "<i>Phomopsis vexans</i> partitivirus 1" (PvPV1) and "<i>Phomopsis vexans</i> victorivirus L1" (PvVVL1). Thus, PvVVL1 displays a unique genome structure, and this is the first report of a victorivirus consisting of two segments and of a deltapartitivirus infecting the fungus host.

PvFV1: !infects! P. vexans
PvOLV1: !infects! P. vexans
PvEV2: !infects! P. vexans
PvPV1: !infects! P. vexans
PvVVL1: !infects! P. vexans
PvVVL1: !displays unique genome structure!
Eggplant tissue medium: !suitable for rapid sporulation!
