['27216227', 'In natural habitats, plants frequently experience rapid changes in the intensity  of sunlight. To cope with these changes and maximize growth, plants adjust  photosynthetic light utilization in electron transport and photoprotective  mechanisms. This involves a proton motive force (PMF) across the thylakoid  membrane, postulated to be affected by unknown anion (Cl(-)) channels. Here we  report that a bestrophin-like protein from Arabidopsis thaliana functions as a  voltage-dependent Cl(-) channel in electrophysiological experiments. AtVCCN1  localizes to the thylakoid membrane, and fine-tunes PMF by anion influx into the  lumen during illumination, adjusting electron transport and the photoprotective  mechanisms. The activity of AtVCCN1 accelerates the activation of photoprotective  mechanisms on sudden shifts to high light. Our results reveal that AtVCCN1, a  member of a conserved anion channel family, acts as an early component in the  rapid adjustment of photosynthesis in variable light environments.', '2016 May 24', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms11654', 'Lundin']
