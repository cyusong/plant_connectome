['29046690', 'Maintaining lipid membrane integrity is an essential aspect of plant tolerance to  high temperature. P(4)-type ATPases are responsible for flipping and stabilizing  asymmetric phospholipids in membrane systems, though their functions in stress  tolerance are not entirely clear. Aminophospholipid ATPase6 (ALA6) is a member of  the P(4)-type ATPase family, which has 12 members in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here,  we show that a loss-of-function mutant of ALA6 (ala6) exhibits clear sensitivity  to heat stress, including both basal and acquired thermotolerance treatments.  Overexpression of ALA6 improves seedling resistance to heat stress, while mutated  ALA6 transgenic plants, in which the conserved functional site of the ALA family  has a point mutation, are still susceptible to heat stress like ala6  loss-of-function mutant. In addition, ala6 displays higher ion-leakage during  heat treatment, suggesting that the lipid flippase activity of ALA6 plays a vital  role in heat stress responses. Transcriptome analysis reveals differences in gene  expression between ala6 and wild-type plants with or without heat stress. The  differentially expressed genes are involved primarily in the physiological  processes of stress response, cellular compartment maintenance, macromolecule  stability and energy production. Our results suggest that ALA6 is crucial for the  stability of membrane when plants suffer from high temperature stress.', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.01732', 'Xiang']
