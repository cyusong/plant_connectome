Blue light inhibits succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase enzyme activity and gene expression in green leaves of maize (Zea mays L.). Irradiation of maize plants by blue light resulted in the transient decrease of transcripts of genes Sdh1-2 and Sdh2-3 encoding correspondingly the flavoprotein and iron-sulfur protein subunits of succinate dehydrogenase, and of Fum1 encoding the mitochondrial form of fumarase. The blue light effect was probably mediated by transcription factors COP1 and HY5, with the expression of the latter increased upon blue light treatment. This was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of COP1, presumably involved in proteasome degradation of HY5. It was also demonstrated that calcium ions do not participate in this process.
