Plasticity of plant functional traits plays an important role in plant growth and survival under changing climate. However, knowledge about how leaf functional traits respond to the multi-level N addition rates, multiple N compound and duration of N application remains lacking. This study investigated the effects of 2-year and 7-year N addition on the leaf functional traits of <i>Leymus chinensis</i> and <i>Thermopsis lanceolata</i> in a meadow grassland. The results showed that the type of N compounds had no significant effect on leaf functional traits regardless of duration of N application. N addition significantly increased the leaf total N content (LN) and specific leaf area (SLA), and decreased the leaf total P content (LP) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) of the two species. Compared with short-term N addition, long-term N addition increased LN, LP, SLA, and plant height, but decreased the LDMC. In addition, the traits of the two species were differentially responsive to N addition, LN and LP of <i>T. lanceolata</i> were consistently higher than those of <i>L. chinensis.</i> N addition would make <i>L. chinensis</i> and <i>T. lanceolata</i> tend to "quick investment-return" strategy. Our results provide more robust and comprehensive predictions of the effects of N deposition on leaf traits.
