Leaf color is a crucial agronomic trait in ornamental kale. However, the molecular mechanism regulating leaf pigmentation patterns in green and white ornamental kale is not completely understood. To address this, we performed transcriptome and pigment content analyses of green and white kale leaf tissues. A total of 5,404 and 3,605 different expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the green vs. white leaf and the green margin vs. white center samples. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that 24 and 15 common DEGs in two pairwise comparisons were involved in chlorophyll metabolism and carotenoid biosynthesis, respectively. Seventeen genes related to chlorophyll biosynthesis were significantly upregulated in green leaf tissue, especially <i>chlH</i> and <i>por</i>. Of the 15 carotenoid biosynthesis genes, all except <i>CYP707A</i> and <i>BG1</i> were lower expressed in white leaf tissue. Green leaf tissue exhibited higher levels of chlorophyll and carotenoids than white leaf tissue. In addition, the DEGs involved in photosystem and chlorophyll-binding proteins had higher expression in green leaf tissue. The <i>PSBQ</i>, <i>LHCB1.3</i>, <i>LHCB2.4</i>, and <i>HSP70</i> may be key genes of photosynthesis and chloroplast formation. These results demonstrated that green and white coloration in ornamental kale leaves was caused by the combined effects of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, chloroplast development, as well as photosynthesis. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf color development in ornamental kale.
