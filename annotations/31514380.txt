<i>Lonicera japonica</i> Thunb. is a widely used medicinal plant and is rich in a variety of active ingredients. Flavonoids are one of the important components in <i>L. japonica</i> and their content is an important indicator for evaluating the quality of this herb. To study the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in <i>L. japonica</i>, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene <i>LjaMYB12</i> was isolated and characterized. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that <i>LjaMYB12</i> belonged to the subgroup 7, with a typical R2R3 DNA-binding domain and conserved subgroup 7 motifs. The transcriptional level of <i>LjaMYB12</i> was proportional to the total flavonoid content during the development of <i>L. japonica</i> flowers. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that LjaMYB12 localized to the nucleus. Transactivation activity assay indicated that LjaMYB12 was a transcriptional activator. Then, ectopic expression of <i>LjaMYB12</i> in Arabidopsis could increase PAL activity and flavonoid content and promote transcription of a range of flavonoid biosynthetic genes. Interestingly, the fold changes of downstream genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway were significantly higher than that of the upstream genes, which suggested that <i>LjaMYB12</i> may have different regulatory patterns for the upstream and downstream pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis. The results provided here will effectively facilitate the study of subgroup 7 MYBs and transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in <i>L. japonica</i>.
