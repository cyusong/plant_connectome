In an effort to identify genetic regulators for the cell ontogeny around the veins in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, an activation-tagged mutant line with altered leaf morphology and altered bundle sheath anatomy was characterized. This mutant had a small rosette area with wrinkled leaves and chlorotic leaf edges, as well as enhanced chloroplast numbers in the (pre-)bundle sheath tissue. It had a bundle-specific promoter from the gene GLYCINE DECARBOXYLASE SUBUNIT-T from the C4 species Flaveria trinervia (GLDTFt promoter) inserted in the coding region of the transcriptional repressor NAC052, functioning in H3K4 demethylation, in front of an alternative start codon in-frame with the natural start codon. Reconstruction of the mutation event of our activation-tagged line by creating a line expressing an N-terminally truncated sequence of NAC052 under control of the GLDTFt promoter confirmed the involvement of NAC052 in leaf development. Our study not only reveals leaf anatomic and transcriptomic effects of an N-terminally truncated NAC052 under control of the GLDTFt promoter, but also identifies NAC052 as a novel genetic regulator of leaf development.
