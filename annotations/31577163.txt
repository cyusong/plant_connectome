<i>Elsinoë fawcettii</i> and <i>E. australis</i> (phylum Ascomycota) are phytopathogenic fungi causing scab diseases on citrus plants. We report here the high-quality draft genome sequences and ab initio gene predictions of two <i>E. fawcettii</i> strains and one <i>E. australis</i> strain, which differ in their host range. This genome sequence information will provide valuable resources to underpin genomic attributes for determining host range through comparative genomic analyses of citrus scab fungi.
