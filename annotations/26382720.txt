Our previous studies demonstrated that chloroplastic CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Cc) is not sufficient under high-nitrogen (N) supply in rice plants. In this research, we studied how aquaporins- (AQPs) mediated Cc under different N-supply levels. A hydroponic experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with three different N levels (low N, 0.71 mM; intermediate N, 2.86 mM; and high N, 7.14 mM) in a rice cultivar (Oryza sativa cv. Shanyou 63) and with an ospip1;1 mutant (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). The photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) decreased with increasing leaf-N content. Under high-N supply, the estimated Cc was significantly lower than the theoretical Cc and the specific Rubisco activity (carboxylation efficiency/Rubisco content, CE/Rubisco) decreased, because of a decrease of relative CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion conductance (total CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion conductance/leaf-N content, g<sub>t</sub> /N) in mesophyll cells. Real Time Quantitative PCR (Q-RT-PCR) showed that most OsPIP1s and OsPIP2s expression were downregulated under the high-N supply. Furthermore, Cc and g<sub>m</sub> decreased in the ospip1;1 mutant line compared with that of the wild-type plant. It was concluded that under high-N supply, the decreased PNUE was associated with non-sufficient Cc, mediated by AQP in mesophyll conductance.
