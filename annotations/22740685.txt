['22740685', 'Lysin motif (LysM) receptor kinases are unique to plants and serve important  functions in plant-microbe interactions. These proteins recognize microbe-derived  N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-containing ligands, but the molecular mode of ligand  perception and of receptor activation has remained unknown. The three-dimensional  structure of the LysM receptor kinase CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1)  from Arabidopsis thaliana has been reported. CERK1 binds NAG oligomers derived  from chitin-the major constituent of fungal cell walls-and mediates immunity to  fungal infection. The crystal structure of CERK1 complexed with a NAG pentamer  revealed that three NAG moieties attach tightly to one of three lysin motifs  within the CERK1 ectodomain. Receptor activation and immune signaling requires,  however, ligand-induced CERK1 homodimerization. By acting as bivalent ligands,  NAG octamers stabilize CERK1 dimers, providing a structural explanation for why  the immunogenic activity of NAG oligomers is restricted to fragments larger than  those required for receptor binding. Because CERK1 might serve as a paradigm for  the functionality of a whole class of plant LysM proteins, insight into its mode  of action will direct future research on these receptors.', '2012 Jun 26', 'Sci Signal', '10.1126/scisignal.2003274', 'Nurnberger']
