['8341686', 'Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is considered an essential component of a  eukaryotic cell; deletion of the PABP-coding gene in yeast leads to a lethal  phenotype. PABP is implicated in numerous aspects of posttranscriptional  regulation, including mRNA turnover and translational initiation. A nested set of  degenerate PCR primers designed from regions conserved among yeast, Xenopus, and  human PABP sequences was used to amplify genomic DNA fragments from Arabidopsis  thaliana. Hybridization screening of genomic and cDNA libraries with a genomic  PCR probe led to the isolation of three diverse Arabidopsis genes encoding PABPs,  PAB1, PAB3, and PAB5. All three sequences contain the expected four  RNA-recognition motifs. Sequence diversity between these genes equals or exceeds  the diversity among animal and fungal sequences. One of the genes, PAB5, and its  cDNA were completely sequenced. Its open reading frame encodes a 73.2-kDa protein  containing a number of amino acid motifs characteristic of PABPs from different  species. Moreover, in vitro synthesized PAB5 protein bound to poly(A)-Sepharose  with high specificity. All three genes isolated showed organ-specific patterns of  expression. PAB5 and PAB3 RNAs were detected only in floral organs, with the  highest level of expression in immature flowers. PAB1 RNA was observed  predominantly in roots, was less abundant in immature flowers, and was not  detected in any other organ examined (stems, leaves, mature flowers, siliques).  This suggests a potentially unique role for PABPs in organ-specific  posttranscriptional regulation in plants.', '1993 Jul 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.90.14.6686', 'Meagher']
