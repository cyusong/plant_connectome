Heterologous overexpression of Arabidopsis cellulase 1 (<i>Atcel1</i>) results in enhanced yield, early maturity, and increased biomass in dicotyledonous species like poplar and eucalyptus but has not been demonstrated in monocots. We produced transgenic <i>Setaria viridis</i> accession A10.1 plants overexpressing a monocotyledonous codon optimized (<i>MCO) Atcel1</i>. Agronomic characterization of the transgenic events showed that heterologous overexpression of <i>MCOAtcel1</i> caused enhanced grain yield, shoot biomass, and accelerated maturation rate in the model grass species <i>S. viridis</i> under growth chamber conditions. The agronomic trait differences observed were consistent with previous reports in dicots but are here described in a monocot species and associated with increased seed yield. Overexpression of <i>Atcel1</i> in <i>S. viridis</i> was shown to increase the number of panicles and seeds by 24-30%, enhance overall grain yield by up to 26%, and lead to a shoot dry biomass increase of 16-19%. Overexpression also reduced time to plant maturation and senescence by 12.5%. Our findings in <i>S. viridis</i> suggest that manipulation of <i>Atcel1</i> has potential for developing early-maturing and higher-yielding monocotyledonous biomass crops suitable for climate-smart agriculture.
