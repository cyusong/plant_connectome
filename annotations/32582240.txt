RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful technology that offers new opportunities for pest control through silencing of genes that are essential for the survival of arthropod pests. The approach relies on sequence-specificity of applied double-stranded (ds) RNA that can be designed to have a very narrow spectrum of both the target gene product (RNA) as well as the target organism, and thus allowing highly targeted pest control. Successful RNAi has been reported from a number of arthropod species belonging to various orders. Pest control may be achieved by applying dsRNA as foliar sprays. One of the main concerns related to the use of dsRNA is adverse environmental effects particularly on valued non-target species. Arthropods form an important part of the biodiversity in agricultural landscapes and contribute important ecosystem services. Consequently, environmental risk assessment (ERA) for potential impacts that plant protection products may have on valued non-target arthropods is legally required prior to their placement on the market. We describe how problem formulation can be used to set the context and to develop plausible pathways on how the application of dsRNA-based products could harm valued non-target arthropod species, such as those contributing to biological pest control. The current knowledge regarding the exposure to and the hazard posed by dsRNA in spray products for non-target arthropods is reviewed and suggestions are provided on how to select the most suitable test species and to conduct laboratory-based toxicity studies that provide robust, reliable and interpretable results to support the ERA.
