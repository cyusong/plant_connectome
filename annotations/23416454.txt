The photoperiodic control of flowering time is essential for the adaptation of plants to variable environments and for successful reproduction. The identification of genes encoding florigens, which had been elusive but were supposedly synthesized in leaves and then transmitted to shoot apices to induce floral transitions, has greatly advanced our understanding of the photoperiodic regulation of flowering. Studies on the photoperiodism of Arabidopsis, a model long-day plant, revealed the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of the Arabidopsis florigen gene FT, which is gradually induced in response to increase in day length. By contrast, in rice, a model short-day plant, the expression of the florigen gene Hd3a (an FT ortholog in rice) is regulated in an on/off fashion, with strong induction under short-day conditions and repression under long-day conditions. This critical day length dependence of Hd3a expression enables rice to recognize a slight change in the photoperiod as a trigger to initiate floral induction. Rice possesses a second florigen gene, RFT1, which can be expressed to induce floral transition under non-inductive long-day conditions. The complex transcriptional regulation of florigen genes and the resulting precise control over flowering time provides rice with the adaptability required for a crop species of increasing global importance.
