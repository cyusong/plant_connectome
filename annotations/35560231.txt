Salinity and drought stresses affect plant growth worldwide and limit crop production. Auxin is crucial in regulating plants' salinity and drought stress adaptative response. As a chemical messenger, auxin influences gene expression through a family of functionally distinct transcription factors, the DNA-binding AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs). Various studies have revealed the important roles of ARFs in regulating drought and salinity stress responses in plants. Different ARFs regulate soluble sugar content, promote root development, and maintain chlorophyll content under drought and saline stress conditions to help plants adapt to these stresses. The functional characterization of ARFs pertaining to the regulation of drought and salinity stress responses is still in its infancy. Interestingly, the small RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of ARF expression has been shown to influence plant responses to both stresses. The current knowledge on the diverse roles of ARFs in conferring specificity to auxin-mediated drought and salinity stress responses has not been reviewed to date. In this review, we summarize the recent research concerning the role of ARFs in response to drought and salinity stresses: gene expression patterns, functional characterization, and post-transcriptional regulation under drought and salinity stresses. We have also reviewed the modulation of ARF expression by other molecular regulators in the context of drought and salt stress signaling.
