['14563678', 'The balance between the bioactive sphingolipid ceramide and its phosphorylated  derivative has been proposed to modulate the amount of programmed cell death  (PCD) in eukaryotes. We characterized the first ceramide kinase (CERK) mutant in  any organism. The Arabidopsis CERK mutant, called accelerated cell death 5,  accumulates CERK substrates and shows enhanced disease symptoms during pathogen  attack and apoptotic-like cell death dependent on defense signaling late in  development. ACD5 protein shows high specificity for ceramides in vitro.  Strikingly, C2 ceramide induces, whereas its phosphorylated derivative partially  blocks, plant PCD, supporting a role for ceramide phosphorylation in modulating  cell death in plants.', '2003 Nov 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1140503', 'Greenberg']
