['18039180', 'Screening of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome revealed three potential homologues  of mammalian and yeast mitochondrial DICs (dicarboxylate carriers) designated as  DIC1, DIC2 and DIC3, each belonging to the mitochondrial carrier protein family.  DIC1 and DIC2 are broadly expressed at comparable levels in all the tissues  investigated. DIC1-DIC3 have been reported previously as uncoupling proteins, but  direct transport assays with recombinant and reconstituted DIC proteins clearly  demonstrate that their substrate specificity is unique to plants, showing the  combined characteristics of the DIC and oxaloacetate carrier in yeast. Indeed,  the Arabidopsis DICs transported a wide range of dicarboxylic acids including  malate, oxaloacetate and succinate as well as phosphate, sulfate and thiosulfate  at high rates, whereas 2-oxoglutarate was revealed to be a very poor substrate.  The role of these plant mitochondrial DICs is discussed with respect to other  known mitochondrial carrier family members including uncoupling proteins. It is  proposed that plant DICs constitute the membrane component of several metabolic  processes including the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle, the most important redox  connection between the mitochondria and the cytosol.', '2008 Mar 15', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20070867', 'Hodges']
