['12186950', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana ASY1 gene is essential for homologous chromosome  synapsis. Antibodies specific to Asy1 protein and its homologue BoAsy1 from the  related crop species Brassica oleracea have been used to investigate the temporal  expression and localization of the protein in both species. Asy1 is initially  detected in pollen mother cells during meiotic interphase as numerous punctate  foci distributed over the chromatin. As leptotene progresses the signal appears  to be increasingly continuous and is closely associated with the axial elements  but not to the extended chromatin loops associated with them. By the end of  zygotene the signal extends almost the entire length of the synapsed homologues,  although not to the telomeres. The protein begins to disappear as the homologues  desynapse, until by late diplotene it is no longer associated with the  chromosomes. Immunogold labelling in conjunction with electron microscopy  established that Asy1 localizes to regions of chromatin that associate with the  axial/lateral elements of meiotic chromosomes rather than being a component of  the synaptonemal complex itself. These data together with the previously observed  asynaptic phenotype of the asy1 mutant suggest that Asy1 is required for  morphogenesis of the synaptonemal complex, possibly by defining regions of  chromatin that associate with the developing synaptonemal complex structure.', '2002 Sep 15', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.00048', 'Franklin']
