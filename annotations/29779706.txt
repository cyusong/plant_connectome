Oxygen deprivation commonly affects plants exposed to flooding and soil compaction. The resulting root hypoxia has an immediate effect on plant water relations and upsets water balance. Hypoxia inhibits root water transport and triggers stomatal closure. The processes contributing to the inhibition of root hydraulic conductivity and conductance (hydraulic conductivity of the whole root system) are complex and involve changes in root morphology and the functions of aquaporins. Aquaporins (AQPs) comprise a group of membrane intrinsic proteins that are responsible for the transport of water, as well as some small neutral solutes and ions. They respond to a wide range of environmental stresses including O<sub>2</sub> deprivation, but the underlying functional mechanisms are still elusive. The aquaporin-mediated water transport is affected by the acidification of the cytoplasm and depletion of ATP that is required for aquaporin phosphorylation and membrane functions. Cytoplasmic pH, phosphorylation, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration directly control AQP gating, all of which are related to O<sub>2</sub> deprivation. This review addresses the structural determinants that are essential for pore conformational changes in AQPs, to highlight the underlying mechanisms triggered by O<sub>2</sub> deprivation stress. Gene expression of AQPs is modified in hypoxic plants, which may constitute an important, yet little explored, mechanism of hypoxia tolerance. In addition to water transport, AQPs may contribute to hypoxia tolerance by transporting O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and lactic acid. Responses of plants to O<sub>2</sub> deprivation, and especially those that contribute to maintenance of water transport, are highly complex and entail the signals originating in roots and shoots that lead to and follow the stomatal closure. These complex responses may involve ethylene, abscisic acid, and possibly other hormonal factors and signaling molecules in ways that remain to be elucidated.
