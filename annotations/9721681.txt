['9721681', 'A new fld mutant allele, fld-2, which significantly delayed flowering, was  isolated and characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. Even under long-day  conditions after more than 100 days in the greenhouse, the majority of fld-2  mutant plants had not bolted. In addition, mutant inflorescences produced more  than 10 co-florescences that were subtended by a high number of rosette-like  leaves before giving rise to flowers. The late-flowering phenotype of the fld-2  mutation could be partially overcome by both vernalization and GA treatment but  it was not influenced by 5-azaC treatment. Phenotypic analyses of double mutants  indicated that fld-2 is epistatic to early flowering mutants elf1, elf2 and elf3.  In addition, fld-2 could enhance vegetative characteristics in embryonic flower 1  (emf1) mutants by causing many small sessile leaves in fld-2 emf1 double mutants.  The relief of the terminal flower 1 (tfl1) mutant phenotype in fld-2 tfl1 double  mutants, and the enhancement of leafy (lfy) and apetala1 (ap1) mutant phenotypes  in fld-2 lfy and fld-2 ap1 double mutants, suggest that FLD is also likely to be  involved in the floral transition. Our results strongly suggest that the FLD gene  plays a key role in regulating the reproductive competence of the shoot and  results in different developmental phase transitions in Arabidopsis.', '1998 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1998.00204.x', 'Yang']
