<i>Nostoc commune</i> is an edible cyanobacterium that produces a massive gelatinous polysaccharide matrix around the filamentous cells. The polysaccharides, more than 70% of which comprise glucose, are essential for resistance to environmental stresses. In the present study, we collected naturally growing <i>N. commune</i> colonies, dried them for preservation, rehydrated them, and then examined their nitrogen-fixing activity using the acetylene reduction method. As expected, the rehydrated <i>N. commune</i> performed nitrogen fixation after illumination with white light. Notably, under dark, aerobic conditions, the rehydrated <i>N. commune</i> exhibited nitrogen fixation in the presence of glucose. In contrast, under dark, anaerobic conditions, nitrogen fixation was low. Because the natural habitats of <i>N. commune</i> are aerobic but lack carbohydrates, <i>N. commune</i> cells may exhibit glucose utilization activity constitutively.
