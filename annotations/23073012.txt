Penetration resistance against powdery mildews is one of the best-studied processes of plant innate immunity. One vital component is the plant syntaxin, PEN1, which is required for timely deposition of callose and extracellular membrane material, as well as PEN1 itself, at the attack sites. Recently, we reported that the ARF-GEF GNOM also is required for penetration resistance, mediating transport of recycled material, including PEN1, to the site of attack. The close relative of PEN1, SYP122, does not accumulate at the sites of attack nor does it affect penetration resistance. In support of this, we show here that in contrast to PEN1, SYP122 does not continuously recycle. Furthermore, by using a PEN1 transgene that is only transcribed in dividing cells, we show that papillary PEN1 accumulation is not dependent on de-novo protein synthesis. This emphasizes the involvement of recycling in penetration resistance, which possibly relates to the differences in function of the two syntaxins.
