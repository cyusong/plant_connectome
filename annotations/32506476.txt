Fruit development is a complex process that is regulated not only by plant hormones and transcription factors, but also requires epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, chromatin remodeling and noncoding RNAs. Together, these epigenetic modifications, which are controlled during development and in response to the environment, determine the chromatin state of genes and contribute to the transcriptomes of an organism. Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in fleshy fruit ripening. Dysfunction of a DNA demethylase delayed ripening in tomato, and the application of a DNA methylation inhibitor altered ripening process in the fruits of several species. These studies indicated that manipulating the epigenome of fruit crops could open new ways for breeding in the future. In this review, we highlight recent progress and address remaining questions and challenges concerning the epigenetic regulation of fruit development and ripening.
