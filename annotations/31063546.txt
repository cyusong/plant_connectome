Plant vibrations is a wide subject that covers topics ranging from the swaying of trees under wind to elastic waves made by an insect on a leaf to communicate with its neighbors. For this reason, the state of the art is somehow fragmented over several communities. This review aims at giving a general overview of the main results and challenges in plant vibrations. Several scales are considered, from the very small and local, in leaves or fruits, to large canopies of many plants.
