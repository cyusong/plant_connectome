Root-knot nematodes (<i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.) are major pests of many important crops around the world. In the Northwestern region of the United States of America (USA), <i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> causes economic losses in potatoes because the nematodes can infect the tubers, which leads to potato galling and reductions in marketable yield. <i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> is a quarantine pathogen in certain potato export markets, and there is little industry tolerance for the presence of this nematode. Recently, two <i>Meloidogyne</i> species that are not known to be present in agricultural fields in the USA were detected on golf turfgrasses in California and Washington. These species, <i>M. fallax</i> and <i>M. minor</i>, are morphologically similar to <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and can infect potatoes and cause tuber damage. Their detection in the USA means that they could potentially infest potato fields and become a problem in potato production. Additionally, <i>M. fallax</i> is a regulated plant pest in the USA, which makes the correct identification of potato-infecting root-knot nematodes important. Previously, there was no single-tube assay that could determine whether <i>M. chitwoodi</i>, <i>M. fallax</i>, and/or <i>M. minor</i> were present in a sample. Thus, a molecular beacon real-time PCR assay which can reliably detect <i>M. chitwoodi</i>, <i>M. fallax</i>, or <i>M. minor</i> from crude nematode extracts was designed and characterized.
