In endophytes, the abundance of genes coding for enzymes processing reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), argues for a crucial role of ROS metabolism in plant-microbe interaction for plant colonization. Here, we studied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> metabolism of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) seeds and their microbiota during germination and early seedling growth, the most vulnerable stages in the plant life cycle. Treatment with hot steam diminished the seed microbiota, and these seeds produced less extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than untreated seeds. Using a culture-dependent approach, <i>Pantoea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> genera were the most abundant epiphytes of dry untreated seeds. Incubating intact seedlings from hot steam-treated seeds with <i>Pantoea</i> strains triggered H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, whereas <i>Pseudomonas</i> strains dampened H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, attributable to higher catalase activities. The genus <i>Pantoea</i> was much less represented among seedling endophytes than genus <i>Pseudomonas</i>, with other endophytic genera, including <i>Bacillus</i> and <i>Paenibacillus</i>, also possessing high catalase activities. Overall, our results show that certain bacteria of the seed microbiota are able to modulate the extracellular redox environment during germination and early seedling growth, and high catalase activity is proposed as a key trait of seed endophytes.
