In chloroplasts, Hsp70 and Hsp100 chaperones have been long suspected to be the motors that provide the necessary energy for the import of precursor proteins destined to the organelle. The chaperones associate with the import translocon and meet the transit peptides as they emerge through the channel. After decades of active research, recent findings demonstrated that Hsp100 chaperones recognize transit peptides both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Hsp70 also plays a part in precursor import. The updated model of protein translocation into chloroplasts now presents new questions about the role of the chaperones in the process.
