A heterotrophic model system was established in our studies in order to differentiate the effect of high salt concentrations in external medium on growth and sugar metabolism in roots from the effect of reduced sugar availability resulting from decreased photosynthesis under salinity. Soluble sugar content and the activity of acid invertase in root cultures of salt-tolerant (ST) and salt-sensitive (SS) Schenkia spicata (L.) Mansion genotypes were investigated during exposure to different NaCl concentrations (0-200 mM). Their response to severe salinity was characterized by a metabolic adjustment that led to the accumulation of sucrose (Suc) in root tissues. There was clear evidence that cell wall invertase (CW-Inv) is the major contributor to the Suc/hexose ratio in roots during exposure to elevated salinity. The results of CW-Inv activity and immunodetection assays in our study suggest that the regulation of CW-Inv expression is most likely achieved in a salt stress dependent manner. Also, NaCl modulated soluble acid invertase (SA-Inv) expression differentially in SS and ST genotypes of S. spicata. Regardless of the salt treatment, genotype, or the amount of enzyme, SA-Inv activity was generally low, indicating regulation at the posttranslational level. The results suggest no direct role of SA-Inv in the regulation of the root tissue carbohydrate pool and therefore in the control of the availability of glucose and fructose for the primary metabolism and/or osmotic adjustment in the present heterotrophic model system.
