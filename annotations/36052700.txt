The target of rapamycin (TOR) protein kinase is a master regulator of cell growth in all eukaryotes, from unicellular yeast and algae to multicellular animals and plants. Target of rapamycin balances the synthesis and degradation of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids in response to nutrients, growth factors and cellular energy to promote cell growth. Among nutrients, amino acids (AAs) and glucose are central regulators of TOR activity in evolutionary distant eukaryotes such as mammals, plants and algae. However, these organisms obtain the nutrients through totally different metabolic processes. Although photosynthetic eukaryotes can use atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> as the sole carbon (C) source for all reactions in the cell, heterotrophic organisms get nutrients from other sources of organic C including glucose. Here, we discuss the impact of autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism on the nutrient regulation of TOR, focusing on the role of AAs and C sources upstream of this signaling pathway.

Target of rapamycin: !balances! Synthesis and degradation of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids 
Amino acids: !regulate! Target of rapamycin 
CO<sub>2</sub>: !provides! Carbon source for photosynthetic eukaryotes 
Glucose: !provides! Nutrients for heterotrophic organisms
