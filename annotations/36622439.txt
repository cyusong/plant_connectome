The present review illustrates a comprehensive overview of the start codon targeted (SCoT) polymorphism marker and their utilization in various applications related to genetic and genomic studies. Start codon targeted (SCoT) polymorphism marker, a targeted fingerprinting marker technique, has gained considerable importance in plant genetics, genomics, and molecular breeding due to its many desirable features. SCoT marker targets the region flanking the start codon, a highly conserved region in plant genes. Therefore, it can distinguish genetic variations in a specific gene that link to a specific trait. It is a simple, novel, cost-effective, highly polymorphic, and reproducible molecular marker for which there is no need for prior sequence information. In the recent past, SCoT markers have been employed in many commercially important and underutilized plant species for a variety of applications, including genetic diversity analysis, interspecific/generic genetic relationships, cultivar/hybrid/species identification, sex determination, construction of linkage map, association mapping/analysis, differential gene expression, and genetic fidelity analysis of tissue culture-raised plants. The main aim of this review is to provide up-to-date information on SCoT markers and their application in many commercially important and underutilized plant species, mainly progress made in the last 8-10 years.
