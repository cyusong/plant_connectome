Plants have developed complex mechanisms to adapt to changing nitrate (NO3-) concentrations and can recruit microbes to boost nitrogen absorption. However, little is known about the relationship between functional genes and the rhizosphere microbiome in NO3- uptake of apple rootstocks. Here, we found that variation in Malus domestica NO3- transporter (MdNRT2.4) expression contributes to nitrate uptake divergence between two apple rootstocks. Overexpression of MdNRT2.4 in apple seedlings significantly improved tolerance to low nitrogen via increasing net NO3- influx at the root surface. However, inhibiting the root plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity abolished NO3- uptake and led to NO3- release, suggesting that MdNRT2.4 encodes an H+-coupled nitrate transporter. Surprisingly, the nitrogen concentration of MdNRT2.4-overexpressing apple seedlings in unsterilized nitrogen-poor soil was higher than that in sterilized nitrogen-poor soil. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene profiling to characterize the rhizosphere microbiota, we found that MdNRT2.4-overexpressing apple seedlings recruited more bacterial taxa with nitrogen metabolic functions, especially Rhizobiaceae. We isolated a bacterial isolate ARR11 from the apple rhizosphere soil and identified it as Rhizobium. Inoculation with ARR11 improved apple seedling growth in nitrogen-poor soils, compared with uninoculated seedlings. Together, our results highlight the interaction of host plant genes with the rhizosphere microbiota for host plant nutrient uptake.
