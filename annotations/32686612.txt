Electric potential differences in living plants are explained by theories based on sap flow. In order to acquire more advanced knowledge about the spatial distribution of these electric potential measures in trees, this research aims to analyze electrical signals in a population of Aleppo pines (<i>Pinus halepensis</i> Mill.) in a representative Mediterranean forest ecosystem. The specific research objective is to assess some of the most significant factors that influence the distribution pattern of those electric signals: tree age, measurement type and electrode placement. The research has been conducted in representative forest stands, obtaining measurements of different representative trees. After a statistical evaluation of the obtained results, the main conclusions of our research are: A.Tree maturity influences directly on electric potential. B.Maximum electrical signals can be measured in young pines showing values of 0.6 V and 0.6 µA for voltage and current, respectively. C.The distribution patterns of both voltage and short-circuit current depending on electrode placement are uniform.
