['18178669', 'Multigene families encoding class XI myosins are conserved in higher plants,  however, little information is available on specific functions of these  ubiquitous molecular motors. We isolated gene knockout mutants for all 13 class  XI myosins present in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome. Inactivation of  11 myosin genes resulted in no discernible phenotypes under the normal growth  conditions. In contrast, the knockouts of the remaining two myosin genes, XI-2  (formerly MYA2) and XI-K, exhibited similar defects in root hair elongation  suggesting that the myosin-driven motility plays a significant role in a polar  tip growth. Strikingly, inactivation of each of these myosins also reduced  trafficking of Golgi stacks, peroxisomes, and mitochondria in root hairs and in  leaf epidermal cells. These results indicate that myosins XI-K and XI-2 play  major and overlapping roles in the cell dynamics in Arabidopsis and highlight the  redundant nature of myosin function in plants.', '2008 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.113654', 'Dolja']
