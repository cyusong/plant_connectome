The relative contribution of carbon sources generated from leaves and fruits photosynthesis for triacylglycerol biosynthesis in the olive mesocarp and their interaction with water stress was investigated. With this aim, altered carbon source treatments were combined with different irrigation conditions. A higher decrease in mesocarp oil content was observed in fruits under girdled and defoliated shoot treatment compared to darkened fruit conditions, indicating that both leaf and fruit photosynthesis participate in carbon supply for oil biosynthesis being leaves the main source. The carbon supply and water status affected oil synthesis in the mesocarp, regulating the expression of DGAT and PDAT genes and implicating DGAT1-1, DGAT2, PDAT1-1, and PDAT1-2 as the principal genes responsible for triacylglycerol biosynthesis. A major role was indicated for DGAT2 and PDAT1-2 in well-watered conditions. Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acid content together with FAD2-1, FAD2-2 and FAD7-1 expression levels were augmented in response to modified carbon supply in the olive mesocarp. Furthermore, water stress caused an increase in DGAT1-1, DGAT1-2, PDAT1-1, and FAD2-5 gene transcript levels. Overall, these data indicate that oil content and fatty acid composition in olive fruit mesocarp are regulated by carbon supply and water status, affecting the transcription of key genes in both metabolic pathways.
