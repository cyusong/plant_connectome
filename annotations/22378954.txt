Allelochemicals and other metabolites released by plant roots play important roles in rhizosphere signalling, plant defence and responses to abiotic stresses. Plants use a variety of sequestration and transport mechanisms to move and export bioactive products safely into the rhizosphere. The use of mutants and molecular tools to study gene expression has revealed new information regarding the diverse group of transport proteins and conjugation processes employed by higher plants. Transport systems used for moving secondary products into and out of root cells are similar to those used elsewhere in the plant but are closely linked to soil environmental conditions and local root health. Root cells can rapidly generate and release large quantities of allelochemicals in response to stress or local rhizosphere conditions, so the production and transport of these compounds in cells are often closely linked. Plants need to manage the potentially toxic allelochemicals and metabolites they produce by sequestering them to the vacuole or other membrane-bound vesicles. These compartments provide secure storage areas and systems for safely moving bioactive chemicals throughout the cytosol. Release into the apoplast occurs either by exocytosis or through membrane-bound transport proteins. This review discusses the possible transport mechanisms involved in releasing specific root-produced allelochemicals by combining microscopic observations of the specialized root cells with the physical and chemical properties of the exudates.
