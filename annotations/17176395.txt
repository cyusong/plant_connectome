* Floral meristems are generally determinate. Termination of their activity varies with species, occurring after carpel or ovule development, depending on the placentation type. In terminal flowering Impatiens balsamina (cv. Dwarf Bush Flowered) some flowers exhibit meristem indeterminacy; they produce organs from the placenta after ovule development. * Here we provide a detailed description of gynoecium development in this line and explore the basis of the indeterminate nature of some of its floral meristems. * We find that the placenta is sometimes established without complete carpel fusion. Proliferative growth derives from meristematic remnants of the placenta and is more common in the terminal inflorescence. RNA in situ hybridization reveals that IbLFY (Impatiens LFY homologue) is expressed in all meristem states, even in proliferating meristems. Expression of IbAG in axillary flowers is as expected in the meristem, stamens and carpels but absent from the proliferating meristem. * We conclude that I. balsamina has cauline placentation. Incomplete suppression of inflorescence identity in flowers of the terminal inflorescence leads to floral meristem proliferation after ovule development in this species.
