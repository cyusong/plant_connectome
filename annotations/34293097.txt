Plants are unsurpassed biochemists that synthesize a plethora of molecules in response to an ever-changing environment. The majority of these molecules, considered as specialized metabolites, effectively protect the plant against pathogens and herbivores. However, this defense most probably comes at a great expense, leading to reduction of growth (known as the 'growth-defense trade-off'). Plants employ several strategies to reduce the high metabolic costs associated with chemical defense. Production of specialized metabolites is tightly regulated by a network of transcription factors facilitating its fine-tuning in time and space. Multifunctionality of specialized metabolites-their effective recycling system by re-using carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, thus re-introducing them back to the primary metabolite pool-allows further cost reduction. Spatial separation of biosynthetic enzymes and their substrates, and sequestration of potentially toxic substances and conversion to less toxic metabolite forms are the plant's solutions to avoid the detrimental effects of metabolites they produce as well as to reduce production costs. Constant fitness pressure from herbivores, pathogens, and abiotic stressors leads to honing of specialized metabolite biosynthesis reactions to be timely, efficient, and metabolically cost-effective. In this review, we assess the costs of production of specialized metabolites for chemical defense and the different plant mechanisms to reduce the cost of such metabolic activity in terms of self-toxicity and growth.
