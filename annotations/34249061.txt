Molybdenum cofactor containing sulfite oxidase (SO) enzyme is an important player in protecting plants against exogenous toxic sulfite. It was also demonstrated that SO activity is essential to cope with rising dark-induced endogenous sulfite levels and maintain optimal carbon and sulfur metabolism in tomato plants exposed to extended dark stress. The response of SO and sulfite reductase to direct exposure of low and high levels of sulfate and carbon was rarely shown. By employing <i>Arabidopsis</i> wild-type, sulfite reductase, and SO-modulated plants supplied with excess or limited carbon or sulfur supply, the current study demonstrates the important role of SO in carbon and sulfur metabolism. Application of low and excess sucrose, or sulfate levels, led to lower biomass accumulation rates, followed by enhanced sulfite accumulation in SO impaired mutant compared with wild-type. SO-impairment resulted in the channeling of sulfite to the sulfate reduction pathway, resulting in an overflow of organic S accumulation. In addition, sulfite enhancement was followed by oxidative stress contributing as well to the lower biomass accumulation in SO-modulated plants. These results indicate that the role of SO is not limited to protection against elevated sulfite toxicity but to maintaining optimal carbon and sulfur metabolism in <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants.
