['33941907', 'Asymmetric cell division (ACD) requires protein polarization in the mother cell  to produce daughter cells with distinct identities (cell-fate asymmetry). Here,  we define a previously undocumented mechanism for establishing cell-fate  asymmetry in Arabidopsis stomatal stem cells. In particular, we show that  polarization of the protein phosphatase BSL1 promotes stomatal ACD by  establishing kinase-based signalling asymmetry in the two daughter cells. BSL1  polarization in the stomatal ACD mother cell is triggered at the onset of  mitosis. Polarized BSL1 is inherited by the differentiating daughter cell, where  it suppresses cell division and promotes cell-fate determination. Plants lacking  BSL proteins exhibit stomatal overproliferation, which demonstrates that the BSL  family plays an essential role in stomatal development. Our findings establish  that BSL1 polarization provides a spatiotemporal molecular switch that enables  cell-fate asymmetry in stomatal ACD daughter cells. We propose that BSL1  polarization is triggered by an ACD checkpoint in the mother cell that monitors  the establishment of division-plane asymmetry.', '2021 May', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-021-00906-0', 'ORCID:']
