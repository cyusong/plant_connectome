['15247385', 'Pectic cell wall polysaccharides owe their high negative charge to the presence  of D-galacturonate, a monosaccharide that appears to be present only in plants  and some prokaryotes. UDP-D-galacturonate, the activated form of this sugar, is  known to be formed by the 4-epimerization of UDP-D-glucuronate; however, no  coding regions for the epimerase catalyzing this reaction have previously been  described in plants. To better understand the mechanisms by which precursors for  pectin synthesis are produced, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify and  functionally express a UDP-D-glucuronate 4-epimerase (GAE1) from Arabidopsis.  GAE1 is predicted to be a type II membrane protein that belongs to the family of  short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Pichia  pastoris established a 1.3:1 equilibrium between UDP-D-galacturonate and  UDP-D-glucuronate but did not epimerize UDP-D-Glc or UDP-D-Xyl. Enzyme assays on  cell extracts localized total UDP-D-glucuronate 4-epimerase and recombinant GAE1  activity exclusively to the microsomal fractions of Arabidopsis and Pichia,  respectively. GAE1 had a pH optimum of 7.6 and an apparent Km of 0.19 mm. The  recombinant enzyme was strongly inhibited by UDP-D-Xyl but not by UDP, UDP-D-Glc,  or UDP-D-Gal. Analysis of Arabidopsis plants transformed with a GAE1:GUS  construct showed expression in all tissues. The Arabidopsis genome contains five  GAE1 paralogs, all of which are transcribed and predicted to contain a membrane  anchor. This suggests that all of these enzymes are targeted to an endomembrane  system such as the Golgi where they may provide UDP-D-galacturonate to  glycosyltransferases in pectin synthesis.', '2004 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.043745', 'Reiter']
