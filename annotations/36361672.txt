Quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Wild.) has attracted considerable attention owing to its unique nutritional, economic, and medicinal values. Meanwhile, quinoa germplasm resources and grain colors are rich and diverse. In this study, we analyzed the composition of primary and secondary metabolites and the content of the grains of four different high-yield quinoa cultivars (black, red, white, and yellow) harvested 42 days after flowering. The grains were subjected to ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and transcriptome sequencing to identify the differentially expressed genes and metabolites. Analysis of candidate genes regulating the metabolic differences among cultivars found that the metabolite profiles differed between white and black quinoa, and that there were also clear differences between red and yellow quinoa. It also revealed significantly altered amino acid, alkaloid, tannin, phenolic acid, and lipid profiles among the four quinoa cultivars. Six common enrichment pathways, including phenylpropane biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and ABC transporter, were common to metabolites and genes. Moreover, we identified key genes highly correlated with specific metabolites and clarified the relationship between them. Our results provide theoretical and practical references for breeding novel quinoa cultivars with superior quality, yield, and stress tolerance. Furthermore, these findings introduce an original approach of integrating genomics and transcriptomics for screening target genes that regulate the desirable traits of quinoa grain.
