The plant shoot apical meristem is established early during embryogenesis and subsequently gives rise to a shoot through reiterative generation of lateral organs and axillary meristems. In our recent manuscript we reported identification and characterization of a semi-dominant mutation in ribosomal protein RPL27a, which disrupts plant growth and shoot development.1 rpl27ac-1d effects on the shoot are evident from an early stage of embryo development. During embryogenesis rpl27-1d mutants are slow growing and are defective in apical patterning with a delay in establishment of the shoot meristem and outgrowth of cotyledons. Concomitant with this disturbed patterning, the shoot meristem genes SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) are misexpressed in outer cell layers of the rpl27ac-1d embryo and there is a delay in expression of the organ-patterning gene FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL). Genetic interactions between rpl27ac-1d and other ribosomal protein mutants indicates rpl27ac-1d has reduced ribosome function. Our results highlight a role for ribosomal proteins in growth and development and we propose that the ribosome regulates specific patterning events during development.
