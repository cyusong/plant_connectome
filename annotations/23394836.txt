['23394836', 'Epigenetic regulation helps to maintain genomic integrity by suppressing  transposable elements (TEs) and also controls key developmental processes, such  as flowering time. To prevent TEs from causing rearrangements and mutations, TE  and TE-like repetitive DNA sequences are usually methylated, whereas histones are  hypoacetylated and methylated on specific residues (e.g., H3 lysine 9  dimethylation [H3K9me2]). TEs and repeats can also attenuate gene expression.  However, how various histone modifiers are recruited to target loci is not well  understood. Here we show that knockdown of the nuclear matrix protein with  AT-hook DNA binding motifs TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT SILENCING VIA AT-HOOK (TEK) in  Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta results in robust activation of various TEs, the  TE-like repeat-containing floral repressor genes FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FWA.  This derepression is associated with chromatin conformational changes, increased  histone acetylation, reduced H3K9me2, and even TE transposition. TEK directly  binds to an FLC-repressive regulatory region and the silencing repeats of FWA and  associates with Arabidopsis homologs of the Retinoblastoma-associated protein  46/48, FVE and MSI5, which mediate histone deacetylation. We propose that the  nuclear matrix protein TEK acts in the maintenance of genome integrity by  silencing TE and repeat-containing genes.', '2013 Feb 18', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2013.01.030', 'Ito']
