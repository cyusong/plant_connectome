Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling in plant cells is an essential and early event during plant-microbe interactions. The recognition of microbe-derived molecules activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps that trigger a transient increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cytoplasm. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins (such as CBL, CPK, CaM, and CML), known as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, relay the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal into down-stream signaling events, e.g., activating transcription factors in the nucleus. For example, CaM and CML decode the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to the CaM/CML-binding protein, especially CaM-binding transcription factors (AtSRs/CAMTAs), to induce the expressions of immune-related genes. In this review, we discuss the recent breakthroughs in down-stream Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a dynamic process, subjected to continuous variation and gradual change. AtSR1/CAMTA3 is a CaM-mediated transcription factor that represses plant immunity in non-stressful environments. Stress-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes impact the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-AtSR1 complex to control plant immune response. We also discuss other regulatory mechanisms in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activates CPKs and MAPKs cascades followed by regulating the function of AtSR1 by changing its stability, phosphorylation status, and subcellular localization during plant defense.
