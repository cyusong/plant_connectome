A broad range of peroxides generated in subcellular compartments, including chloroplasts, are detoxified with peroxidases which are called as peroxiredoxins (Prx). The Prx are ubiquitously distributed in all organisms including bacteria, fungi, animals, and also in cyanobacteria and plants. Recently, the Prx have emerged as new molecules in antioxidant defense in plants. Here, the members which belong to Prx gene family in Arabidopsis and rice are been identified. Overall, the Prx members constitute a small family with 10 and 11 genes in Arabidopsis and rice respectively. The prx genes of rice are assigned to their functional groups based on homology search against Arabidopsis protein database. Deciphering the Prx functions in rice will add novel information to the mechanism of antioxidant defense in plants. Further, the Prx also forms the part of redox signaling cascade. Here, the Prx family has been described for rice.
