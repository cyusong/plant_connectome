['15299117', 'The P19 protein of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is a multifunctional  pathogenicity determinant involved in suppression of posttranscriptional gene  silencing, virus movement, and symptom induction. Here, we report that P19  interacts with the conserved RNA-binding domain of an as yet uncharacterized  family of plant ALY proteins that, in animals, are involved in export of RNAs  from the nucleus and transcriptional coactivation. We show that the four ALY  proteins encoded by the Arabidopsis genome and two ALY proteins from Nicotiana  benthamiana are localized to the nucleus. Moreover, and in contrast to animal  ALY, all but one of the proteins are also in the nucleolus, with distinct  subnuclear localizations. Infection of plants by TBSV or expression of P19 from  Agrobacterium results in relocation of three of the six ALY proteins from the  nucleus to the cytoplasm demonstrating specific targeting of the ALY proteins by  P19. The differential effects on subcellular localization indicate that, in  plants, the various ALY proteins may have different functions. Interaction with  and relocalization of ALY is prevented by mutation of P19 at residues previously  shown to be important for P19 function in plants. Down-regulation of expression  of two N. benthamiana ALY genes by virus-induced gene silencing did not interfere  with posttranscriptional gene silencing. Targeting of ALY proteins during TBSV  infection may therefore be related to functions of P19 in addition to its  silencing suppression activity.', '2004 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.046086', 'MacFarlane']
