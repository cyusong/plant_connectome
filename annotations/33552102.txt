The <i>Lolium</i> genus encompasses many species that colonize a variety of disturbed and non-disturbed environments. <i>Lolium perenne</i> L. spp. <i>perenne</i>, <i>L</i>. <i>perenne</i> L. spp. <i>multiflorum</i>, and <i>L</i>. <i>rigidum</i> are of particular interest to weed scientists because of their ability to thrive in agricultural and non-agricultural areas. Herbicides are the main tool to control these weeds; however, <i>Lolium</i> spp. populations have evolved multiple- and cross-resistance to at least 14 herbicide mechanisms of action in more than 21 countries, with reports of multiple herbicide resistance to at least seven mechanisms of action in a single population. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about non-target-site resistance in <i>Lolium</i> spp. to acetyl CoA carboxylase, acetohydroxyacid synthase, microtubule assembly, photosystem II, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, glutamine synthetase, very-long chain fatty acids, and photosystem I inhibitors. We suggest research topics that need to be addressed, as well as strategies to further our knowledge and uncover the mechanisms of non-target-site resistance in <i>Lolium</i> spp.
