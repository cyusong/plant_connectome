Expression of ZmCPK11, a member of the maize (Zea mays) calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) family, is induced by mechanical wounding. A rapid increase of the activity of a 56-kDa CDPK has been observed in damaged leaves. In the present work, it is shown that the 56-kDa CDPK, identified as ZmCPK11, is also activated in non-wounded leaves as an element of systemic wound response. Moreover, an increase of the enzyme's activity and induction of ZmCPK11 expression was observed after touching the leaves. To study the role of ZmCPK11 in wound and touch signaling, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants in which c-Myc-ZmCPK11 was expressed under control of the CaMV 35S promoter were generated. Analysis of the transgenic plants showed that c-Myc-ZmCPK11 was activated upon wounding and touching. Furthermore, pre-treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (acSA), an inhibitor of jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent wound signaling, abolished the wound-induced activation of ZmCPK11 in maize and the transgenic A. thaliana plants. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and linolenic acid (LA) stimulated the activity of ZmCPK11 as well as induced the expression of ZmCPK11 and other wound-responsive genes, lipoxygenase 1 (ZmLOX1) and proteinase inhibitor 1 (ZmWIP1). These results indicate that ZmCPK11, regulated at the enzymatic and transcriptional level by LA and MeJA, is a component of touch- and wound-induced pathway(s), participating in early stages of local and systemic responses.
