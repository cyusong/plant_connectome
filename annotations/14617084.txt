['14617084', 'The chloroplast NDH complex, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, reduces the plastoquinone  pool non-photochemically and is involved in cyclic electron flow around  photosystem I (PSI). A transient increase in chlorophyll fluorescence after  turning off actinic light is a result of NDH activity. We focused on this subtle  change in chlorophyll fluorescence to isolate nuclear mutants affected in  chloroplast NDH activity in Arabidopsis by using chlorophyll fluorescence  imaging. crr2-1 and crr2-2 (chlororespiratory reduction) are recessive mutant  alleles in which accumulation of the NDH complex is impaired. Except for the  defect in NDH activity, photosynthetic electron transport was unaffected. CRR2  encodes a member of the plant combinatorial and modular protein (PCMP) family  consisting of more than 200 genes in Arabidopsis. CRR2 functions in the  intergenic processing of chloroplast RNA between rps7 and ndhB, which is possibly  essential for ndhB translation. We have determined the function of a PCMP family  member, indicating that the family is closely related to pentatrico-peptide PPR  proteins involved in the maturation steps of organellar RNA.', '2003 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01900.x', 'Shikanai']
