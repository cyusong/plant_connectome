Gaseous molecules, such as hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S) and nitric oxide (NO), are crucial players in cellular and (patho)physiological processes in biological systems. The biological functions of these gaseous molecules, which were first discovered and identified as gasotransmitters in animals, have received unprecedented attention from plant scientists in recent decades. Researchers have arrived at the consensus that H<sub>2</sub> S is synthesized endogenously and serves as a signaling molecule throughout the plant life cycle. However, the mechanisms of H<sub>2</sub> S action in redox biology is still largely unexplored. This review highlights what we currently know about the characteristics and biosynthesis of H<sub>2</sub> S in plants. Additionally, we summarize the role of H<sub>2</sub> S in plant resistance to abiotic stress. Moreover, we propose and discuss possible redox-dependent mechanisms by which H<sub>2</sub> S regulates plant physiology.
