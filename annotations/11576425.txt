['11576425', 'Owing to their sessile lifestyle, it is crucial for plants to acquire stress  tolerance. The function of heat-shock proteins, including small heat-shock  proteins (smHSPs), in stress tolerance is not fully explored. To gain further  knowledge about the smHSPs, the gene that encoded the cytosolic class II smHSP in  Arabidopsis thaliana (At-HSP17.6A) was characterized. The At-HSP17.6A expression  was induced by heat and osmotic stress, as well as during seed development.  Accumulation of At-HSP17.6A proteins could be detected with heat and at a late  stage of seed development, but not with osmotic stress, suggesting stress-induced  post-transcriptional regulation of At-HSP17.6A expression. Overproduction of  At-HSP17.6A could increase salt and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis. The  chaperone activity of At-HSP17.6A was demonstrated in vitro.', '2001 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01107.x', 'Verbruggen']
