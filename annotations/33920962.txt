The plant hormone auxin acts as a mediator providing positional instructions in a range of developmental processes. Studies in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> L. show that auxin acts in large part via activation of Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) that in turn regulate the expression of downstream genes. The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) gene <i>OsARF11</i> is of interest because of its expression in developing rice organs and its high sequence similarity with <i>MONOPTEROS/ARF5</i>, a gene with prominent roles in <i>A. thaliana</i> development. We have assessed the phenotype of homozygous insertion mutants in the <i>OsARF11</i> gene and found that in relation to wildtype, <i>osarf11</i> seedlings produced fewer and shorter roots as well as shorter and less wide leaves. Leaves developed fewer veins and larger areoles. Mature <i>osarf11</i> plants had a reduced root system, fewer branches per panicle, fewer grains per panicle and fewer filled seeds. Mutants had a reduced sensitivity to auxin-mediated callus formation and inhibition of root elongation, and phenylboronic acid (PBA)-mediated inhibition of vein formation. Taken together, our results implicate <i>OsARF11</i> in auxin-mediated growth of multiple organs and leaf veins. <i>OsARF11</i> also appears to play a central role in the formation of lateral root, panicle branch, and grain meristems.
