Petal blotches are commonly observed in many angiosperm families and not only influence plant-pollinator interactions but also confer high ornamental value. Tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa Andr.) is an important cut flower worldwide, but few studies have focused on its blotch formation. In this study, anthocyanins were found to be the pigment basis for blotch formation of P. suffruticosa, and peonidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside (Pn3G5G) was the most important component of anthocyanins, while the dihydroflavonol-4-reductase gene was the key factor contributing to blotch formation. Then, the R2R3-myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factor PsMYB30 belonging to subgroup 1 was proven as a positive anthocyanin regulator with transcriptional activation and nuclear expression. Furthermore, silencing PsMYB30 in P. suffruticosa petals reduced blotch size by 37.9%, faded blotch color and decreased anthocyanin and Pn3G5G content by 23.6% and 32.9%, respectively. Overexpressing PsMYB30 increased anthocyanin content by 14.5-fold in tobacco petals. In addition, yeast one-hybrid assays, dual-luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that PsMYB30 could bind to the promoter of the anthocyanin synthase (ANS) gene and enhance its expression. Altogether, a novel MYB transcription factor, PsMYB30, was identified to promote petal blotch formation by activating the expression of PsANS involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, which provide new insights for petal blotch formation in plants.
