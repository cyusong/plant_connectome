In this work, we investigated the role of an Arabidopsis protein, AtPDCD5, during senescence after a 24h-dark period. Previously, we demonstrated that AtPDCD5 participates in programmed cell death (PCD) after UV-B exposure and in age-induced senescence. The results presented here, together with previous data, demonstrate that AtPDCD5 not only plays an important role during DNA damage responses induced by UV-B radiation, but also takes part in PCD programs such as dark-induced senescence in Arabidopsis.
