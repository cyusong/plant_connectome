We studied the effect of inoculation with a mixture of three arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith, Glomus deserticola (Trappe, Bloss. & Menge) and Glomus mosseae (Nicol & Gerd.) Gerd. & Trappe) and addition of a composted organic residue on plant growth, nutrient uptake, mycorrhizal colonisation and superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) and total peroxidase (POX, EC 1.11.1.7) activities in shoots of Juniperus oxycedrus seedlings after well-watered, drought and recovery periods. The mycorrhizal inoculation and composted residue addition significantly increased the growth, foliar nutrients (N, P, K) and shoot water content of the plants, independent of the water regime. POX activity in control plants increased during drought (about 250% higher than under well-watered conditions) and returned to initial levels after re-watering. The seedlings inoculated with AM fungi showed the highest values of POX activity, followed by the plants grown in the amended soil, which varied little during the drought and recovery periods. Drought decreased the SOD activity in shoots of both J. oxycedrus seedlings inoculated with AM fungi and those grown with composted residue, but did not affect that of control plants. After re-watering, the SOD activity in mycorrhizal or residue-amended plants increased, showing values similar to control plants.
