['29283991', 'Auxin controls a myriad of plant developmental processes and plant response to  environmental conditions. Precise trafficking of auxin transporters is essential  for auxin homeostasis in plants. Here, we report characterization of Arabidopsis  CTL1, which controls seedling growth and apical hook development by regulating  intracellular trafficking of PIN-type auxin transporters. The CTL1 gene encodes a  choline transporter-like protein with an expression pattern highly correlated  with auxin distribution and is enriched in shoot and root apical meristems,  lateral root primordia, the vascular system, and the concave side of the apical  hook. The choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) protein is localized to the  trans-Golgi network (TGN), prevacuolar compartment (PVC), and plasma membrane  (PM). Disruption of CTL1 gene expression alters the trafficking of 2 auxin efflux  transporters-Arabidopsis PM-located auxin efflux transporter PIN-formed 1 (PIN1)  and Arabidopsis PM-located auxin efflux transporter PIN-formed 3 (PIN3)-to the  PM, thereby affecting auxin distribution and plant growth and development. We  further found that phospholipids, sphingolipids, and other membrane lipids were  significantly altered in the ctl1 mutant, linking CTL1 function to lipid  homeostasis. We propose that CTL1 regulates protein sorting from the TGN to the  PM through its function in lipid homeostasis.', '2017 Dec', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.2004310', 'ORCID:']
