In legume plants, low-nitrogen soils promote symbiotic interactions with rhizobial bacteria, leading to the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Among critical signals regulating this developmental process are bacterial Nod Factors (NFs) and several plant hormones, including cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs). Here, we show in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that GA signaling mediated by DELLA1 decreases the amount of bioactive CKs in roots and negatively impacts the Cytokinin Response1 (CRE1)-dependent NF activation of a subset of CK-signaling genes as well as of the CK-regulated <i>Nodulation Signaling Pathway2</i> and <i>Ethylene Response Factor Required for Nodulation1</i> early nodulation genes. Consistently, a dominant-active DELLA1 protein can partially rescue the reduced nodulation of the <i>cre1</i> mutant and triggers the formation of nodule-like structures when expressed in the root cortex or in the root epidermis. This suggests a model where the DELLA1-mediated GA signaling interplays with the CRE1-dependent CK pathway to regulate early nodulation in response to both NF and CK signals critical for this symbiotic interaction.

NF: !activates! CRE1-dependent CK pathway
GA: !decreases! bioactive CKs
DELLA1: !mediates! GA signaling
DELLA1: !rescues! reduced nodulation of cre1 mutant
NF: !triggers! formation of nodule-like structures
