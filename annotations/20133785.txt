['20133785', 'Synaptotagmins are calcium sensors that regulate synaptic vesicle  exo/endocytosis. Thought to be exclusive to animals, they have recently been  characterized in plants. We show that Arabidopsis synaptotagmin SYTA regulates  endosome recycling and movement protein (MP)-mediated trafficking of plant virus  genomes through plasmodesmata. SYTA localizes to endosomes in plant cells and  directly binds the distinct Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) and Tobacco mosaic  virus (TMV) cell-to-cell movement proteins. In a SYTA knockdown line, CaLCuV  systemic infection is delayed, and cell-to-cell spread of TMV and CaLCuV movement  proteins is inhibited. A dominant-negative SYTA mutant causes depletion of plasma  membrane-derived endosomes, produces large intracellular vesicles attached to  plasma membrane, and inhibits cell-to-cell trafficking of TMV and CaLCuV movement  proteins, when tested in an Agrobacterium-based leaf expression assay. Our  studies show that SYTA regulates endocytosis, and suggest that distinct virus  movement proteins transport their cargos to plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell spread  via an endocytic recycling pathway.', '2010 Feb 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0909080107', 'Lazarowitz']
