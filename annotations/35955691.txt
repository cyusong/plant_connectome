ROPs (Rho-like GTPases from plants) are a unique family of small GTP-binding proteins in plants and play vital roles in numerous cellular processes, including growth and development, abiotic stress signaling, and plant defense. In the case of the latter, the role of ROPs as response regulators to obligate parasitism remains largely enigmatic. Herein, we isolated and identified <i>ShROP</i>7 and show that it plays a critical role in plant immune response to pathogen infection. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the expression of <i>ShROP7</i> was significantly increased during incompatible interactions. To establish its requirement for resistance, we demonstrate that virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of <i>ShROP7</i> resulted in increased susceptibility of tomato to <i>Oidium neolycopersici</i> (<i>On</i>) Lanzhou strain (<i>On</i>-Lz). Downstream resistance signaling through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the induction of the hypersensitive response (HR) in <i>ShROP7</i>-silenced plants were significantly reduced after inoculating with <i>On</i>-Lz. Taken together, with the identification of ShROP7-interacting candidates, including ShSOBIR1, we demonstrate that ShROP7 plays a positive regulatory role in tomato powdery mildew resistance.
