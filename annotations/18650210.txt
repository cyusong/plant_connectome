Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) as well as abscisic acid (ABA) induces stomatal closure with their signal crosstalk. We investigated the function of a regulatory A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, RCN1, in MeJA signaling. Both MeJA and ABA failed to induce stomatal closure in Arabidopsis rcn1 knockout mutants unlike in wild-type plants. Neither MeJA nor ABA induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and suppressed inward-rectifying potassium channel activities in rcn1 mutants but not in wild-type plants. These results suggest that RCN1 functions upstream of ROS production and downstream of the branch point of MeJA signaling and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis guard cells.

MeJA: !induces! stomatal closure
ABA: !induces! stomatal closure
RCN1: !functions upstream of! ROS production
RCN1: !functions downstream of! branch point of MeJA and ABA signaling
