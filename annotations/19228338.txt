['19228338', 'Compared with the well-studied biochemical function of NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY  PROTEIN1 (NAP1) as a histone chaperone in nucleosome assembly/disassembly, the  physiological roles of NAP1 remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we define the  NAP1 gene family members in Arabidopsis, examine their molecular properties, and  use reverse genetics to characterize their biological roles. We show that the  four AtNAP1-group proteins can form homodimers and heterodimers, can bind histone  H2A, and are localized abundantly in the cytoplasm and weakly in the nucleus at  steady state. AtNAP1;4 differs from the others by showing inhibitor-sensitive  nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and tissue-specific expression, restricted to root  segments and pollen grains. The other three AtNAP1 genes are ubiquitously  expressed in plants and the AtNAP1;3 protein is detected as the major isoform in  seedlings. We show that disruption of the AtNAP1-group genes does not affect  normal plant growth under our laboratory conditions. Interestingly, two allelic  triple mutants, Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-1 and Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1  Atnap1;3-2, exhibit perturbed genome transcription, and show hypersensitivity to  DNA damage caused by UV-C irradiation. We show that AtNAP1;3 binds chromatin,  with enrichment at some genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER)  pathway, and that the expression of these genes is downregulated in the triple  mutants. Taken together, our results highlight conserved and isoform-specific  properties of AtNAP1 proteins, and unravel their function in the NER pathway of  DNA damage repair.', '2009 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03844.x', 'Shen']
