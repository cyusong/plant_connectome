The plant hormone auxin is a central regulator of plant growth and development. Because auxin plays critical roles in cell division and cell expansion, plants use a number of cellular mechanisms to regulate auxin levels and response. Among these mechanisms is regulated input from the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) toward the pool of active auxin [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)]. In this review, we cover the mechanisms of IBA transport and conversion, and discuss specific roles for IBA-derived auxin in driving certain developmental events. We further discuss multiple open questions remaining for the IBA field.

IBA: !transports! auxin
IBA: !converts to! IAA
auxin: !regulates! plant growth/development
auxin: !drives! developmental events
