At the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in rice (Oryza sativa), a developmental program change occurs, resulting in panicle (rice inflorescence) formation. The initial event of the transition is the change of the shoot apical meristem to an inflorescence meristem (IM), accompanied by a rapid increase in the meristem size. Suppression of leaf growth also occurs, resulting in the formation of bracts. The IM generates branch meristems (BMs), indeterminate meristems that reiteratively generate next-order meristems. All meristems eventually acquire a determinate spikelet meristem identity and terminate after producing a floret. ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION2 (APO2) is the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) LEAFY (LFY), a plant-specific transcription factor (TF). APO2 is a positive regulator of panicle branch formation. Here, we show that APO2 is also required to increase the meristem size of the IM and suppress bract outgrowth. We identified genes directly and indirectly regulated by APO2 and identified APO2-binding sites. These analyses showed that APO2 directly controls known regulators of panicle development, including SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE14 and NECK LEAF1. Furthermore, we revealed that a set of genes act as downstream regulators of APO2 in controlling meristem cell proliferation during reproductive transition, bract suppression, and panicle branch formation. Our findings indicate that APO2 acts as a master regulator of rice panicle development by regulating multiple steps in the reproductive transition through directly controlling a set of genes.
