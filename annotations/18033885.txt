['18033885', 'Plants use light to optimize growth and development. The photoreceptor  phytochrome A (phyA) mediates various far-red light-induced responses. We show  that Arabidopsis FHY3 and FAR1, which encode two proteins related to Mutator-like  transposases, act together to modulate phyA signaling by directly activating the  transcription of FHY1 and FHL, whose products are essential for light-induced  phyA nuclear accumulation and subsequent light responses. FHY3 and FAR1 have  separable DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains that are highly  conserved in Mutator-like transposases. Further, expression of FHY3 and FAR1 is  negatively regulated by phyA signaling. We propose that FHY3 and FAR1 represent  transcription factors that have been co-opted from an ancient Mutator-like  transposase(s) to modulate phyA-signaling homeostasis in higher plants.', '2007 Nov 23', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1146281', 'Wang']
