['23017898', 'Histone acetylation and complexes associated with this process are directly  involved in chromatin regulation and gene expression. Among these, NuA4 complex  is directly involved in acetylation of histone H4, H2A and H2A.Z. In yeast, the  NuA4 complex contains the catalytic subunit, the histone acetyltransferase ESA1,  and several associated components including YAF9. In this report we explored the  biological role of YAF9a in Arabidopsis thaliana. Homozygous yaf9a-1 and yaf9a-3  mutants show early flowering phenotypes. Moreover, yaf9a-1 mutants displayed  reduced expression of the flowering repressor FLC, whereas the expression of the  flowering activators FT and SOC1 was induced in comparison to wild-type plants.  Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with H4 tetra-acetylated antibodies we  observed a positive correlation with gene expression profile of FLC and FT in  yaf9a-1 mutants under long days. We therefore conclude that YAF9a in Arabidopsis  is a negative regulator of flowering by controlling the H4 acetylation levels in  the FLC and FT chromatin.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2012.07.010', 'Vlachonasios']
