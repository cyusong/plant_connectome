The phosphatidyl ethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) function primarily in regulating flowering in plants. Here, we report a genome-wide identification of PEBPs and functional characterization of a novel FLOWERING LOCUS T homolog (NtFT5) in tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum. Seven new PEBPs were identified by a genome-wide analysis from N. tabacum. Expression profile showed that NtFT5 was mainly expressed in flowers. Overexpression of NtFT5 conferred an early flowering phenotype. By optimizing rooting medium, heritable short life-cycle tobacco lines were obtained by overexpression of NtFT5. Several orthologs of flowering genes downstream of FT gene were up-regulated in the NtFT5-overexpression transgenic plant lines. The NtFT5-overexpressing tobaccos formed fewer flowers and seeds per capsule compared with wild type. The seed-to-seed life cycle of NtFT5 overexpressing tobacco lines was about 2.5 months. Gene identification was effectively undertaken in the short life-cycle tobacco line by a second transformation via a gusA reporter gene and transient expression of Ros1 via PVX (Potato Virus X)system. Our findings indicate that NtFT5 is a novel FT homolog that has potential to induce flowering, which will improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying flowering control in N. tabacum. In addition, the results show that the generated heritable short life-cycle transgenic tobacco line is an effective and stable host system to accelerate gene function study, which promises to provide a better tobacco research model for plants.
