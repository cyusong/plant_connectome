Seed germination is a crucial transition point in plant life and is tightly regulated by environmental conditions through the coordination of two phytohormones, gibberellin and abscisic acid (ABA). To avoid unfavorable conditions, plants have evolved safeguard mechanisms for seed germination. The present contribution reports a novel function of the Arabidopsis MCM1/AGAMOUS/DEFICIENS/SRF(MADS)-box transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS NITRATE REGULATED 1 (ANR1) in seed germination. ANR1 knockout mutant is insensitive to ABA, salt and osmotic stress during the seed germination and early seedling development stages, whereas ANR1-overexpressing lines are hypersensitive. ANR1 is responsive to ABA and abiotic stresses and upregulates the expression of ABA Intolerant (ABI)3 to suppress seed germination. ANR1 and ABI3 have similar expression pattern during seed germination. Genetically, ABI3 acts downstream of ANR1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and yeast-one-hybrid assays showed that ANR1 could bind to the ABI3 promoter to regulate its expression. In addition, ANR1 acts synergistically with AGL21 to suppress seed germination in response to ABA as evidenced by anr1 agl21 double mutant. Taken together, the results herein demonstrate that the ANR1 plays an important role in regulating seed germination and early postgermination growth. ANR1 and AGL21 together constitutes a safeguard mechanism for seed germination to avoid unfavorable conditions.
