Proper stamen development is essential for plants to achieve their life cycles. Defects in stamen development will cause male sterility. A vast array of research efforts have been made to understand stamen developmental processes and regulatory mechanisms over the past decades. It is so far reported that phytohormones, including jasmonate, auxin, gibberellin, brassinosteroid, and cytokinin, play essential roles in regulation of stamen development. This review will briefly summarize the molecular basis for coordinated regulation of stamen development by jasmonate, auxin, and gibberellin in Arabidopsis.

Jasmonate: !regulates! Stamen Development 
Auxin: !regulates! Stamen Development 
Gibberellin: !regulates! Stamen Development 
Phytohormones: !play essential roles in! Regulation of Stamen Development
