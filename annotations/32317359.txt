Programmed cell death (PCD), a highly regulated feature of the plant immune response, involves multiple molecular players. Remorins (REMs) are plant-specific proteins with varied biological functions, but their function in PCD and plant defense remains largely unknown. Here, we report a role for remorin in disease resistance, immune response, and PCD regulation. Overexpression of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>REMORIN1</i> (<i>SlREM1</i>) increased susceptibility of tomato to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and heterologous expression of this gene triggered cell death in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves. Further investigation indicated that amino acids 173 to 187 and phosphorylation of SlREM1 played key roles in SlREM1-triggered cell death. Intriguingly, multiple tomato REMs induced cell death in <i>N</i> <i>benthamiana</i> leaves. Yeast two-hybrid, split luciferase complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated that remorin proteins could form homo- and heterocomplexes. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitative proteomics, we identified that some proteins related to cell death regulation, as well as <i>N</i> <i>benthamiana</i> RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG B (which is essential for reactive oxygen species production), were notably upregulated in <i>SlREM1</i>-expressing leaves. Heterologous expression of <i>SlREM1</i> increased reactive oxygen species accumulation and triggered other cell death regulators. Our findings indicate that SlREM1 is a positive regulator of plant cell death and provide clues for understanding the PCD molecular regulatory network in plants.
