['24553751', 'Three new tmm mutants were isolated and showed differential phenotypes from tmm -  1 , and TMM overexpression led to abnormal leaf trichomes. TOO MANY MOUTH (TMM)  plays a significant role in the stomatal signal transduction pathway, which  involves in the regulation of stomatal distribution and patterning. Three mutants  with clustered stomata were isolated and identified as new alleles of tmm. tmm-4  mutation included a base transversion from adenine to thymidine in position 1,033  of the TMM coding region and resulted in premature termination of translation at  position 345 of TMM. tmm-5 had a base transition from cytosine to thymidine in  244 of TMM and translated 82 amino acids before premature termination. tmm-6  mutation took a base transition from guanine to adenine in 463 of TMM and changed  a glycine (Gly) to an arginine (Arg) in position 155 of the protein. tmm-6 had an  evident reduction of stomatal clusters and fewer stomata in cluster compared with  other tmm alleles, possibly due to decreased level of entry divisions in cells  next to two stomata or their precursors. tmm-5 and tmm-6 were hypersensitive to  abscisic acid (ABA) in seedling growth and seed germination, while tmm-4 was  defective in response to ABA during seed dormancy, suggesting that TMM was  involved in ABA signaling transduction. Interestingly, overexpression of TMM  resulted in the reduction of leaf trichomes and their branches, and this might  reveal a new function of TMM in trichome development.', '2014 May', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-014-1571-1', 'Hou']
