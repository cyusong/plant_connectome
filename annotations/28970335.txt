Plants acquire potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) ions for cell growth and movement via regulated diffusion through K<sup>+</sup> channels. Here, we present crystallographic and functional data showing that the K<sup>+</sup> inward rectifier KAT1 (K<sup>+</sup><i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 1) channel is regulated by 14-3-3 proteins and further modulated by the phytotoxin fusicoccin, in analogy to the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. We identified a 14-3-3 mode III binding site at the very C terminus of KAT1 and cocrystallized it with tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) 14-3-3 proteins to describe the protein complex at atomic detail. Validation of this interaction by electrophysiology shows that 14-3-3 binding augments KAT1 conductance by increasing the maximal current and by positively shifting the voltage dependency of gating. Fusicoccin potentiates the 14-3-3 effect on KAT1 activity by stabilizing their interaction. Crystal structure of the ternary complex reveals a noncanonical binding site for the toxin that adopts a novel conformation. The structural insights underscore the adaptability of fusicoccin, predicting more potential targets than so far anticipated. The data further advocate a common mechanism of regulation of the proton pump and a potassium channel, two essential elements in K<sup>+</sup> uptake in plant cells.
