['35947902', 'Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHM) is one of the hallmarks of one-carbon  metabolism. In plants, isoforms of SHM participate in photorespiration and/or  transfer the one-carbon unit from L-serine to tetrahydrofolate (THF), hence  producing 5,10-CH(2)-THF that is needed, e.g., for biosynthesis of methionine,  thymidylate, and purines. These links highlight the importance of SHM activity in  DNA biogenesis, its epigenetic methylations, and in stress responses. Plant  genomes encode several SHM isoforms that localize to cytosol, mitochondria,  plastids, and nucleus. In this work, we present a thorough functional and  structural characterization of all seven SHM isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana  (AtSHM1-7). In particular, we analyzed tissue-specific expression profiles of the  AtSHM genes. We also compared catalytic properties of the active AtSHM1-4 in  terms of catalytic efficiency in both directions and inhibition by the THF  substrate. Despite numerous attempts to rescue the SHM activity of AtSHM5-7, we  failed, which points towards different physiological functions of these isoforms.  Comparative analysis of experimental and predicted three-dimensional structures  of AtSHM1-7 proteins indicated differences in regions that surround the entrance  to the active site cavity.', '2022 Jul 31', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.07.025', 'Ruszkowski']
