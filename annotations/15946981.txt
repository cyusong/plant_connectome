Open reading frame ssr2016 encodes a protein with substantial sequence similarities to PGR5 identified as a component of the antimycin A-sensitive ferredoxin:plastoquinone reductase (FQR) in PSI cyclic photophosphorylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We studied cyclic electron flow in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in vivo in ssr2016 deletion mutants generated either in a wild-type background or in a ndhB deletion mutant. Our results indicate that ssr2016 is required for FQR and that it operates in a parallel pathway to the NDH1 complex. The ssr2016 deletion mutants are high light sensitive, suggesting that FQR might be important in controlling redox poise under adverse conditions.
