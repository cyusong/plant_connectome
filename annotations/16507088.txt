['16507088', 'Arabidopsis thaliana has nine genes that constitute a family of putative  carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs). While five members of the family are  believed to be involved in synthesis of the phytohormone abscisic acid, the  functions of the other four enzymes are less clear. Recently two of the enzymes,  CCD7/MAX3 and CCD8/MAX4, have been implicated in synthesis of a novel  apocarotenoid hormone that controls lateral shoot growth. Here, we report on the  molecular and genetic interactions between CCD1, CCD7/MAX3 and CCD8/MAX4. CCD1  distinguishes itself from other reported CCDs as being the only member not  targeted to the plastid. Unlike ccd7/max3 and ccd8/max4, both characterized as  having highly branched phenotypes, ccd1 loss-of-function mutants are  indistinguishable from wild-type plants. Thus, even though CCD1 has similar  enzymatic activity to CCD7/MAX3, it does not have a role in synthesis of the  lateral shoot growth inhibitor. Rather, it may have a role in synthesis of  apocarotenoid flavor and aroma volatiles, especially in maturing seeds where loss  of function leads to significantly higher carotenoid levels.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02666.x', 'Klee']
