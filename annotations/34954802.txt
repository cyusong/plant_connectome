Chromatin remodelers act in an ATP-dependent manner to modulate chromatin structure and thus genome function. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) remodeler CHROMATIN REMODELING19 (CHR19) is enriched in gene body regions, and its depletion causes massive changes in nucleosome position and occupancy in the genome. Consistent with these changes, an in vitro assay verified that CHR19 can utilize ATP to slide nucleosomes. A variety of inducible genes, including several important genes in the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways, were transcriptionally upregulated in the chr19 mutant under normal growth conditions, indicative of a role of CHR19 in transcriptional repression. In addition, the chr19 mutation triggered higher susceptibility to the JA pathway-defended necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, but did not affect the growth of the SA pathway-defended hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Expression of CHR19 was tissue-specific and inhibited specifically by SA treatment. Such inhibition significantly decreased the local chromatin enrichment of CHR19 at the associated SA pathway genes, which resulted in their full activation upon SA treatment. Overall, our findings clarify CHR19 to be a novel regulator acting at the chromatin level to impact the transcription of genes underlying plant resistance to different pathogens.
