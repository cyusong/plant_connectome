Nitrate is the preferred form of nitrogen for most plants, acting both as a nutrient and a signaling molecule. However, the components and regulatory factors governing nitrate uptake in bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), one of the world's most important crop species, have remained unclear, largely due to the complexity of its hexaploid genome. Here, based on recently released whole-genome information for bread wheat, the high-affinity nitrate transporter2 (<i>NRT2</i>) and the nitrate-assimilation-related (<i>NAR</i>) gene family are characterized. We show that abscisic acid (ABA)- Glc ester deconjugation is stimulated in bread wheat roots by nitrate resupply following nitrate withdrawal, leading to enhanced root-tissue ABA accumulation, and that this enhancement, in turn, affects the expression of root-type <i>NRT2</i>/<i>NAR</i> genes. TaANR1 is shown to regulate nitrate-mediated ABA accumulation by directly activating <i>TaBG1</i>, while TaWabi5 is involved in ABA-mediated NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> induction of <i>NRT2</i>/<i>NAR</i> genes. Building on previous evidence establishing ABA involvement in the developmental response to high-nitrate stress, our study suggests that ABA also contributes to the optimization of nitrate uptake by regulating the expression of <i>NRT2</i>/<i>NAR</i> genes under limited nitrate supply, offering a new target for improvement of nitrate absorption in crops.
