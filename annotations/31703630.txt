Wheat is a momentous crop and feeds billions of people in the world. The improvement of wheat yield is very important to ensure world food security. Normal development of grain is the essential guarantee for wheat yield formation. The genetic study of grain phenotype and identification of key genes for grain filling are of great significance upon dissecting the molecular mechanism of wheat grain morphogenesis and yield potential. Here we identified a pair of defective kernel (Dek) isogenic lines, BL31 and BL33, with plump and shrunken mature grains, respectively, and constructed a genetic population from the BL31/BL33 cross. Ten chromosomes had higher frequency of polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers between BL31 and BL33 using Wheat660K chip. Totally 783 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were chosen from the above chromosomes and 15 of these were integrated into two linkage groups using the genetic population. Genetic mapping identified three QTL, QDek.caas-3BS.1, QDek.caas-3BS.2 and QDek.caas-4AL, explaining 14.78-18.17%, 16.61-21.83% and 19.08-28.19% of phenotypic variances, respectively. Additionally, five polymorphic SNPs from Wheat660K were successfully converted into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers and enriched the target regions of the above QTL. Biochemical analyses revealed that BL33 has significantly higher grain sucrose contents at filling stages and lower mature grain starch contents than BL31, indicating that the Dek QTL may be involved in carbohydrate metabolism. As such, the candidate genes for each QTL were predicated according to International Wheat Genome Sequence Consortium (IWGSC) RefSeq v1.0. Three major QTL for Dek were identified and their causal genes were predicted, laying a foundation to conduct fine mapping and dissect the regulatory mechanism underlying Dek trait in wheat.
