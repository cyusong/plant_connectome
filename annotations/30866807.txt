MicroRNA (miRNA) are key players in regulating expression of target genes at post-transcriptional level. A number of miRNAs are implicated in modulating tolerance to various abiotic stresses. Waterlogging is an abiotic stress that deters plant growth and productivity by hypoxia. Dozens of reports mention about the miRNAs expressed in response to waterlogging and hypoxia. Despite the fact that tomato is a model vegetable but waterlogging sensitive crop, the role of miRNAs in hypoxia tolerance is poorly understood in tomato. In this study, we investigated the differentially expressed miRNAs between hypoxia-treated and untreated wild tomato root by using high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 33 known miRNAs were lowly expressed, whereas only 3 miRNAs showed higher expression in hypoxia-treated wild tomato root compared with untreated wild tomato root. Then two conserved and lowly expressed miRNAs, miR171 and miR390, were deactivated by Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) technology in Arabidopsis. As the results, the number and length of lateral roots were more in STTM171 and STTM390 transgenic lines compared with that of wild type plant, which partly phenocopy the increase root number and shortening the root length in hypoxia-treated wild tomato root. The differentially expressed miRNAs between hypoxia-treated wild tomato and control root, which contribute to the auxin homeostasis, morphologic change, and stress response, might result in reduction in the biomass and length of the root in hypoxiated conditions.
