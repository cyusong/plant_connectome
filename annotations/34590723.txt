The action of nanoparticles is increasingly being studied in recent years to minimize their toxic impacts. Besides this, efforts are also being made to minimize their toxicity in crop plants by using various chemicals, i.e. nutrients, donors of signaling molecules, plant hormones, and so on. However, associated alleviatory mechanisms are still not well known. Therefore, in the present study, we have investigated the toxicity of CuONPs and its mitigation by exogenously applied calcium (Ca). The focus was on whether indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or endogenous nitric oxide (NO) has any role in accomplishing this task. CuONPs declined wheat growth due to increased accumulation of Cu and oxidative stress markers such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and it was also accompanied by a decline in endogenous NO. CuONPs also altered the redox status of ascorbate and glutathione by inhibiting the activity of their regenerating enzymes. This collectively leads to cell death in wheat seedlings. However, exogenous supplementation of Ca mitigated toxic effects of CuONPs by reducing the excess accumulation of Cu, which caused remarkable enhancement in growth, protein contents, photosynthetic pigments, and endogenous NO; altogether protecting wheat roots from cell death. Interestingly, addition of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) further increased CuONPs toxicity even in the presence of Ca, but the addition of IAA rescued this effect of TIBA. These results clearly show that Ca mitigates CuONPs toxicity in wheat seedlings by involving IAA. Further, the results also showed that endogenous NO has a positive and indispensable role in Ca-mediated mitigation of CuONPs toxicity in wheat seedlings.
