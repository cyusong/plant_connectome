Rubisco, the enzyme that constitutes as much as half of the protein in a leaf, initiates either the photorespiratory pathway that supplies reductant for the assimilation of nitrate into amino acids or the C3 carbon fixation pathway that generates carbohydrates. The relative rates of these two pathways depend both on the relative extent to which O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> occupies the active site of Rubisco and on whether manganese or magnesium is bound to the enzyme. This study quantified the activities of manganese and magnesium in isolated tobacco chloroplasts and the thermodynamics of binding of these metals to Rubisco purified from tobacco or a bacterium. In tobacco chloroplasts, manganese was less active than magnesium, but Rubisco purified from tobacco had a higher affinity for manganese. The activity of each metal in the chloroplast was similar in magnitude to the affinity of tobacco Rubisco for each. This indicates that, in tobacco chloroplasts, Rubisco associates almost equally with both metals and rapidly exchanges one metal for the other. Binding of magnesium was similar in Rubisco from tobacco and a bacterium, whereas binding of manganese differed greatly between the Rubisco from these species. Moreover, the ratio of leaf manganese to magnesium in C3 plants increased as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increased. These results suggest that Rubisco has evolved to improve the energy transfers between photorespiration and nitrate assimilation and that plants regulate manganese and magnesium activities in the chloroplast to mitigate detrimental changes in their nitrogen/carbon balance as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> varies.
