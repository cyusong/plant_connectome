The biomechanical role of the clasping leaf sheath in stalk lodging events has been historically understudied. Results from this study indicate that in some instances the leaf sheath plays an even larger role in reinforcing wheat against stalk lodging than the stem itself. Interestingly, it appears the leaf sheath does not resist bending loads by merely adding more material to the stalk (i.e., increasing the effective diameter). The radial preload of the leaf sheath on the stem, the friction between the sheath and the stem and several other complex biomechanical factors may contribute to increasing the stalk bending strength and stalk flexural rigidity of wheat. Results demonstrated that removal of the leaf sheath induces alternate failure patterns in wheat stalks. In summary the biomechanical role of the leaf sheath is complex and has yet to be fully elucidated. Many future studies are needed to develop high throughput phenotyping methodologies and to determine the genetic underpinnings of the clasping leaf sheath and its relation to stalk lodging resistance. Research in this area is expected to improve the lodging resistance of wheat.
