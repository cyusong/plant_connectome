MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs that recognize target sequences by base complementarity and play a role in the regulation of target gene expression. They are processed from longer precursor molecules that harbor a fold-back structure. Plant miRNA precursors are quite variable in size and shape, and are recognized by the processing machinery in different ways. However, ancient miRNAs and their binding sites in target genes are conserved during evolution. Here, we designed a strategy to systematically analyze <i>MIRNAs</i> from different species generating a graphical representation of the conservation of the primary sequence and secondary structure. We found that plant <i>MIRNAs</i> have evolutionary footprints that go beyond the small RNA sequence itself, yet their location along the precursor depends on the specific <i>MIRNA</i> We show that these conserved regions correspond to structural determinants recognized during the biogenesis of plant miRNAs. Furthermore, we found that the members of the miR166 family have unusual conservation patterns and demonstrated that the recognition of these precursors in vivo differs from other known miRNAs. Our results describe a link between the evolutionary conservation of plant <i>MIRNAs</i> and the mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of these small RNAs and show that the <i>MIRNA</i> pattern of conservation can be used to infer the mode of miRNA biogenesis.
