Regeneration is extremely important to pepper genetic development; however, the molecular mechanisms of how the callus reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cell reprogramming remain elusive in pepper. In the present study, <i>C. baccatum</i> (HNUCB81 and HNUCB226) and <i>C. chinense</i> (HNUCC22 and HNUCC16) were analyzed to reveal callus initiation by <i>in vitro</i> regeneration, histology, and transcriptome. We successfully established an efficient <i>in vitro</i> regeneration system of two cultivars to monitor the callus induction of differential genotypes, and the regenerated plants were obtained. Compared to <i>C. chinense</i>, there was a higher callus induction rate in <i>C. baccatum</i>. The phenotype of <i>C. baccatum</i> changed significantly and formed vascular tissue faster than <i>C. chinense</i>. The KEGG enrichment analysis found that plant hormone transduction and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways were significantly enriched. In addition, we identified that the <i>WOX7</i> gene was significantly up-regulated in HNUCB81 and HNUCB226 than that in HNUCC22 and HNUCC16, which may be a potential function in callus formation. These results provided a promising strategy to improve the regeneration and transformation of pepper plants.
