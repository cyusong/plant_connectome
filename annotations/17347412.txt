['17347412', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many physiological and  developmental processes in plants. The mechanism of ABA perception at the cell  surface is not understood. Here, we report that a G protein-coupled receptor  genetically and physically interacts with the G protein alpha subunit GPA1 to  mediate all known ABA responses in Arabidopsis. Overexpressing this receptor  results in an ABA-hypersensitive phenotype. This receptor binds ABA with high  affinity at physiological concentration with expected kinetics and  stereospecificity. The binding of ABA to the receptor leads to the dissociation  of the receptor-GPA1 complex in yeast. Our results demonstrate that this G  protein-coupled receptor is a plasma membrane ABA receptor.', '2007 Mar 23', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1135882', 'Ma']
