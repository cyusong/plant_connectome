Effector proteins are exported to the interior of host cells by diverse plant pathogens. Many oomycete pathogens maintain large families of candidate effector genes, encoding proteins with a secretory leader followed by an RxLR motif. Although most of these genes are very divergent between oomycete species, several genes are conserved between Phytophthora species and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, suggesting that they play important roles in pathogenicity. We describe a pair of conserved effector candidates, HaRxL23 and PsAvh73, from H. arabidopsidis and P. sojae respectively. We show that HaRxL23 is expressed early during infection of Arabidopsis. HaRxL23 triggers an ecotype-specific defense response in Arabidopsis, suggesting that it is recognized by a host surveillance protein. HaRxL23 and PsAvh73 can suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) in Nicotiana benthamiana and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in soybean. Transgenic Arabidopsis constitutively expressing HaRxL23 or PsAvh73 exhibit suppression of PTI and enhancement of bacterial and oomycete virulence. Together, our experiments demonstrate that these conserved oomycete RxLR effectors suppress PTI and ETI across diverse plant species.
