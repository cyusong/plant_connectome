Hydroxy- and carboxyblumenol C-glucosides specifically accumulate in roots and leaves of plants harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). To explore blumenol function in AMF relationships, we silenced an early key-gene in blumenol biosynthesis, CCD1 (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1), in the ecological model plant, Nicotiana attenuata, and analyzed whole-plant performance in comparison with control and CCaMK-silenced plants, unable to form AMF associations. Root blumenol accumulations reflected a plant's Darwinian fitness, as estimated by capsule production, and were positively correlated with AMF-specific lipid accumulations in roots, with relationships that changed as plants matured when grown without competitors. When grown with wild-type competitors, transformed plants with decreased photosynthetic capacity or increased carbon flux to roots had blumenol accumulations that predicted plant fitness and genotype trends in AMF-specific lipids, but had similar levels of AMF-specific lipids between competing plants, likely reflecting AMF-networks. We propose that when grown in isolation, blumenol accumulations reflect AMF-specific lipid allocations and plant fitness. When grown with competitors, blumenol accumulations predict fitness outcomes, but not the more complicated AMF-specific lipid accumulations. RNA-seq analysis provided candidates for the final biosynthetic steps of these AMF-indicative blumenol C-glucosides; abrogation of these steps will provide valuable tools for understanding blumenol function in this context-dependent mutualism.
