Noccaea caerulescens (formerly Thlaspi caerulescens) is a widely studied metal hyperaccumulator. However, molecular genetic studies are challenging in this species because of its vernal-obligate biennial life cycle of 7-9months. Here, we describe the development of genetically stable, faster cycling lines of N. caerulescens which are nonvernal-obligate. A total of 5500 M(0) seeds from Saint Laurent Le Minier (France) were subjected to fast neutron mutagenesis. Following vernalization of young plants, 79% of plants survived to maturity. In all, 80,000 M(2) lines were screened for flowering in the absence of vernalization. Floral initials were observed in 35 lines, with nine flowering in <12wk. Two lines (A2 and A7) were selfed to the M(4) generation. Floral initials were observed 66 and 87d after sowing (DAS) in A2 and A7, respectively. Silicle development occurred for all A2 and for most A7 at 92 and 123 DAS, respectively. Floral or silicle development was not observed in wild-type (WT) plants. Leaf zinc (Zn) concentration was similar in WT, A2 and A7 lines. These lines should facilitate future genetic studies of this remarkable species. Seed is publicly available through the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC).
