We identified the molecular structures of carotenoids in some Anabaena and Nostoc species. The myxoxanthophyll and ketomyxoxanthophyll in Anabaena (also known as Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120, Anabaena variabilis IAM M-3, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 and Nostoc sp. HK-01 were (3R,2'S)-myxol 2'-fucoside and (3S,2'S)-4-ketomyxol 2'-fucoside, respectively. The glycoside moiety of the pigments was fucose, not rhamnose. The major carotenoids were beta-carotene and echinenone, and the minor ones were beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin and 3'-hydroxyechinenone. Based on the identification of the carotenoids and the completion of the entire nucleotide sequence of the genome in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and N. punctiforme PCC 73102, we proposed a biosynthetic pathway for the carotenoids and the corresponding genes and enzymes. Since only zeta-carotene desaturase (CrtQ) from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and beta-carotene ketolase (CrtW) from N. punctiforme PCC 73102 have been functionally identified, the other genes were searched by sequence homology only from the functionally confirmed genes. Finally, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships among some Anabaena and Nostoc species, including some newly isolated species.
