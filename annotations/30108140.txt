Understanding the distribution of elements within plant tissues is important across a range of fields in plant science. In this review, we examine synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) as an elemental imaging technique in plant sciences, considering both its historical and current uses as well as discussing emerging approaches. XFM offers several unique capabilities of interest to plant scientists, including in vivo analyses at room temperature and pressure, good detection limits (approximately 1-100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and excellent resolution (down to 50 nm). This has permitted its use in a range of studies, including for functional characterization in molecular biology, examining the distribution of nutrients in food products, understanding the movement of foliar fertilizers, investigating the behavior of engineered nanoparticles, elucidating the toxic effects of metal(loid)s in agronomic plant species, and studying the unique properties of hyperaccumulating plants. We anticipate that continuing technological advances at XFM beamlines also will provide new opportunities moving into the future, such as for high-throughput screening in molecular biology, the use of exotic metal tags for protein localization, and enabling time-resolved, in vivo analyses of living plants. By examining current and potential future applications, we hope to encourage further XFM studies in plant sciences by highlighting the versatility of this approach.
