As an essential enzyme in the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-GlcNAc biosynthesis pathway, the significant role of N-acetylglucosamine phosphate mutase (AGM) remains unknown in plants. In the present study, a functional plant AGM (AtAGM) was identified from Arabidopsis thaliana. AtAGM catalyzes the isomerization of GlcNAc-1-P and GlcNAc-6-P, and has broad catalytic activity on different phosphohexoses. UDP-GlcNAc contents were significantly decreased in AtAGM T-DNA insertional mutants, which caused temperature-dependent growth defects in seedlings and vigorous growth in adult plants. Further analysis revealed that protein O-GlcNAcylation but not N-glycosylation was dramatically impaired in Atagm mutants due to UDP-GlcNAc shortage. Combined with the results from O-GlcNAcylation or N-glycosylation deficient mutants, and O-GlcNAcase inhibitor all suggested that protein O-GlcNAcylation impairment mainly leads to the phenotypic variations of Atagm plants. In conclusion, based on the essential role in UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis, AtAGM is important for plant growth mainly via protein O-GlcNAcylation-level regulation.
