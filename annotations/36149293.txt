The plant Ubiquitin Regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing protein 1 (PUX1) functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA) signaling. GAs are plant hormones that stimulate seed germination, the transition to flowering, and cell elongation and division. Loss of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PUX1 resulted in a "GA-overdose" phenotype including early flowering, increased stem and root elongation, and partial resistance to the GA-biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol during seed germination and root elongation. Furthermore, GA application failed to stimulate further stem elongation or flowering onset suggesting that elongation and flowering response to GA had reached its maximum. GA hormone partially repressed PUX1 protein accumulation, and PUX1 showed a GA-independent interaction with the GA receptor GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF-1 (GID1). This suggests that PUX1 is GA regulated and/or regulates elements of the GA signaling pathway. Consistent with PUX1 function as a negative regulator of GA signaling, the pux1 mutant caused increased GID1 expression and decreased accumulation of the DELLA REPRESSOR OF GA1-3, RGA. PUX1 is a negative regulator of the hexameric AAA+ ATPase CDC48, a protein that functions in diverse cellular processes including unfolding proteins in preparation for proteasomal degradation, cell division, and expansion. PUX1 binding to GID1 required the UBX domain, a binding motif necessary for CDC48 interaction. Moreover, PUX1 overexpression in cell culture not only stimulated the disassembly of CDC48 hexamer but also resulted in co-fractionation of GID1, PUX1, and CDC48 subunits in velocity sedimentation assays. Based on our results, we propose that PUX1 and CDC48 are additional factors that need to be incorporated into our understanding of GA signaling.
