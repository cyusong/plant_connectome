['24177687', 'Water is the most abundant molecule in almost all living organisms. Aquaporins  are channel proteins that play critical roles in controlling the water content of  cells. Here, we report the identification of an AP2/EREBP family transcription  factor in Arabidopsis thaliana, TRANSLUCENT GREEN (TG), whose overexpression in  transgenic plants gave enhanced drought tolerance and vitrified leaves. TG  protein is localized in the nucleus, binds DRE and GCC elements in vitro, and  acts as a transcriptional activator in yeast cells. Microarray analysis revealed  a total of 330 genes regulated by TG, among which five genes encode aquaporins. A  transient expression assay showed that TG directly binds to the promoters of  three aquaporin genes, such as AtTIP1;1, AtTIP2;3, and AtPIP2;2, indicating that  TG directly regulates the expression of these genes. Moreover, overexpression of  AtTIP1;1 resulted in vitrified phenotypes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants,  similar to those observed in TG overexpression lines. Water injection into  wild-type leaves recapitulated the vitrified leaf phenotypes, which was reversed  by cutting off the water supply from vascular bundles. Taken together, our data  support that TG controls water balance in Arabidopsis through directly activating  the expression of aquaporin genes.', '2014 Apr', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sst152', 'Qu']
