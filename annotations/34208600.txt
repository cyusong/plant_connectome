Coumarins belong to a group of secondary metabolites well known for their high biological activities including antibacterial and antifungal properties. Recently, an important role of coumarins in plant resistance to pathogens and their release into the rhizosphere upon pathogen infection was discovered. It is also well documented that coumarins play a crucial role in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> growth under Fe-limited conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying interplay between plant resistance, accumulation of coumarins and Fe status, remain largely unknown. In this work, we investigated the effect of both mentioned factors on the disease severity using the model system of Arabidopsis/<i>Dickeya</i> spp. molecular interactions. We evaluated the disease symptoms in Arabidopsis plants, wild-type Col-0 and its mutants defective in coumarin accumulation, grown in hydroponic cultures with contrasting Fe regimes and in soil mixes. Under all tested conditions, Arabidopsis plants inoculated with <i>Dickeya solani</i> IFB0099 strain developed more severe disease symptoms compared to lines inoculated with <i>Dickeya dadantii</i> 3937. We also showed that the expression of genes encoding plant stress markers were strongly affected by <i>D. solani</i> IFB0099 infection. Interestingly, the response of plants to <i>D. dadantii</i> 3937 infection was genotype-dependent in Fe-deficient hydroponic solution.
