The salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway is the only mechanism known for Na<sup>+</sup> extrusion in plant cells. SOS pathway activation involves Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing proteins, such as calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins, and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). In this signalling mechanism, a transit increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration triggered by Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation is perceived by CBL (also known as SOS3). Afterward, SOS3 physically interacts with a CIPK (also known as SOS2), forming the SOS2/SOS3 complex, which can regulate the number downstream targets, controlling ionic homeostasis. For instance, the SOS2/SOS3 complex phosphorylates and activates the SOS1 plasmalemma protein, which is a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter that extrudes Na<sup>+</sup> out of the cell. The CBL-CIPK networking system displays specificity, complexity and diversity, constituting a critical response against salt stress and other abiotic stresses. In a study reported in the journal Plant and Cell Physiology, we showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> induces the robust activation of transporters for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in root cells, especially the SOS1 antiporter and plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, differently than does NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Despite some studies having shown that external NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ameliorates salt-induced effects on ionic homeostasis, there is no evidence that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> per se or some product of its assimilation is responsible for these responses. Here, we speculate about the signalling role behind glutamine in CBL-CIPK modulation, which could effectively activate the SOS pathway in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-fed stressed plants.
