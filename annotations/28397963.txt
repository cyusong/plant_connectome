The currently favoured model of the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis relies heavily on the interpretation of the broad phenotypic range of naturally growing C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> intermediates as proxies for evolutionary intermediate steps. On the other hand, C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> intermediates had earlier been interpreted as hybrids or hybrid derivates. By first comparing experimentally generated with naturally growing C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> intermediates, and second summarising either direct or circumstantial evidence for hybridisation in lineages comprising C<sub>3</sub> , C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> intermediates, we conclude that a possible hybrid origin of C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> intermediates deserves careful examination. While we acknowledge that the current model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis evolution is clearly the best available, C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> intermediates of hybrid origin, if existing, should not be used for further analysis of this model. However, experimental C<sub>3</sub>  × C<sub>4</sub> hybrids potentially are excellent systems to analyse the genetic differences between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species and, also using segregating progeny, to study the relationship between individual photosynthetic traits and environmental factors.
