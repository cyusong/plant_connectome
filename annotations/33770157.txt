Before the introduction of genetically modified insect-tolerant maize (Zea mays L.) in 1997, most of the production of this staple in Argentina was concentrated in humid and sub-humid temperate regions. Early spring sowings minimized the risk of water deficit around flowering and yield reduction due to pests. Use of genetically modified maize allowed optimization of sowing dates to synchronize critical periods for kernel set determination with the times of the year when water deficits are less likely, reducing large interannual variations in grain yield. This change in sowing date did not start until 2009, after the occurrence of two successive dry phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The area of land cropped to maize in Argentina has expanded dramatically since then, particularly beyond the humid areas. Currently, maize is sown in an almost 50%/50% distribution between early and late sowings, including double cropping. Changes in agronomic practices such as sowing date and production area can lead to changes in the timing and intensity of water deficits along the maize growth cycle. This review provides an overview of new patterns of water deficit across humid, sub-humid, and semi-arid mid-latitude environments of Argentina, and their effects on grain yield and yield components.
