Frequency, density and branching of plasmodesmata were counted in successive tangential and transverse walls in the cambial zone of tomato stems in order to examine development of the plasmodesmal network in a chronological order. Coincident with progress of cell development, plasmodesmal connectivity increased, both at the xylem- and phloem-side. In transverse walls, the number of secondary plasmodesmata enhanced considerably. The same held for tangential walls, with a superimposed plasmodesmal doubling during the first phase of phloem development. This plasmodesmal doubling was interpreted to result from the deposition of wall material between branched plasmodesmal strands. Structural plasmodesmal development was correlated with production of hydroxyl radicals which control local cell wall alterations. Successive phases of plasmodesmal deployment and modification were distinguished which may coincide with differential functional capacities as documented by intracellular injection of fluorochromes. Diffusion-driven symplasmic transport appeared to be transiently interrupted during cell maturation.
