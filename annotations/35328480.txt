['35328480', 'Chloroplast biogenesis depends on a complex transcriptional program involving  coordinated expression of plastid and nuclear genes. In particular,  photosynthesis-associated plastid genes are expressed by the plastid-encoded  polymerase (PEP) that undergoes a structural rearrangement during chloroplast  formation. The prokaryotic-type core enzyme is rebuilt into a larger complex by  the addition of nuclear-encoded PEP-associated proteins (PAP1 to PAP12). Among  the PAPs, some have been detected in the nucleus (PAP5 and PAP8), where they  could serve a nuclear function required for efficient chloroplast biogenesis.  Here, we detected PAP8 in a large nuclear subcomplex that may include other  subunits of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase. We have made use of PAP8  recombinant proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana to decouple its nucleus- and  chloroplast-associated functions and found hypomorphic mutants pointing at  essential amino acids. While the origin of the PAP8 gene remained elusive, we  have found in its sequence a micro-homologous domain located within a large  structural homology with a rhinoviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, highlighting  potential RNA recognition motifs in PAP8. PAP8 in vitro RNA binding activity  suggests that this domain is functional. Hence, we propose that the acquisition  of PAPs may have occurred during evolution by different routes, including lateral  gene transfer.', '2022 Mar 11', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms23063059', 'ORCID:']
