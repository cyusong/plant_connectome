Aroma is an essential trait for apple fruit quality, but the understanding of biochemical mechanisms underlying aroma formation is still limited. To better characterize and assess the genetic potential for improving aroma quality for breeding, many efforts have been paid to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using a saturated molecular linkage map. In the present study, aroma profiles in ripe fruit of F<sub>1</sub> population between 'Fuji' and 'Cripps Pink' were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) over 2019 and 2020 years, and the genetics of volatile compounds were dissected. In total, 38 volatile compounds were identified in 'Fuji' × 'Cripps Pink' population, including 23 esters, 3 alcohols, 7 aldehydes and 5 others. With the combination of aroma phenotypic data and constructed genetic linkage map, 87 QTLs were detected for 15 volatile compounds on 14 linkage groups (LGs). Among them, a set of QTLs associated with ester production identified and confirmed on LG 6. A candidate gene <i>MdAAT6</i> in the QTL mapping interval was detected. Over-expression of <i>MdAAT6</i> in tomato and apple fruits showed significantly higher esters accumulation compared to the control, indicating it was critical for the ester production. Our results give light on the mode of inheritance of the apple volatilome and provide new insights for apple flavor improvement in the future.
