Information on photoperiod and temperature sensitivity of sorghum germplasm is important to identify appropriate sources for developing cultivars with a broad adaptation. The sorghum mini core collection consisting of 242 accessions along with three control cultivars were evaluated for days to 50% flowering (DFL) and plant height in two long-day rainy and two short-day post-rainy seasons, and for grain yield and 100-seed weight in the two post-rainy seasons. Differences in DFL and cumulative growing degree days (CGDD) in the rainy and post-rainy seasons were used to classify the accessions for photoperiod and temperature sensitivity. Results revealed 18 mini core landraces as photoperiod and temperature insensitive (PTINS), 205 as photoperiod sensitive and temperature insensitive (PSTINS), and 19 as photoperiod and temperature-sensitive (PTS) sources. The 19 PTS sources and 80 PSTINS sources took less DFL in the long-day rainy seasons than in the short-day post-rainy season indicating their adaptation to the rainy season and a possible different mechanism than that trigger flowering in the short-day sorghums. In all three groups, several accessions with desirable combinations of agronomic traits were identified for use in the breeding programs to develop climate-resilient cultivars and for genomic studies to identify genes responsible for the photoperiod and temperature responses.
