NAC transcription factors (TFs) play critical roles in plant immunity by modulating the expression of downstream genes via binding to specific cis-elements in promoters. Here, we report the function and regulatory network of a pathogen- and defense phytohormone-inducible NAC TF gene, ONAC083, in rice (Oryza sativa) immunity. ONAC083 localizes to the nucleus and exhibits transcriptional activation activity that depends on its C-terminal region. Knockout of ONAC083 enhances rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae, strengthening pathogen-induced defense responses, and boosting chitin-induced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), whereas ONAC083 overexpression has opposite effects. We identified ONAC083-binding sites in the promoters of 82 genes, and showed that ONAC083 specifically binds to a conserved element with the core sequence ACGCAA. ONAC083 activated the transcription of the genes OsRFPH2-6, OsTrx1, and OsPUP4 by directly binding to the ACGCAA element. OsRFPH2-6, encoding a RING-H2 protein with an N-terminal transmembrane region and a C-terminal typical RING domain, negatively regulated rice immunity against M. oryzae and chitin-triggered PTI. These data demonstrate that ONAC083 negatively contributes to rice immunity against M. oryzae by directly activating the transcription of OsRFPH2-6 through the ACGCAA element in its promoter. Overall, our study provides new insight into the molecular regulatory network of NAC TFs in rice immunity.
