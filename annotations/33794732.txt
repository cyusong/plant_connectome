CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are core components of the circadian clock in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that impacts plant response to biotic stresses. Their clock-regulating functions are believed to be partially redundant, and mutation of either gene leads to shortened periods of the circadian cycle. Our recent study has demonstrated that CCA1 promotes plant resistance to the green peach aphid (<i>Myzus persicae</i>) through modulation of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis, but the role of LHY remains to be elucidated. Here we showed that, similar to <i>cca1-11</i>, single mutant <i>lhy-21</i> became more susceptible to aphid infestation. Damage to the <i>cca1-11 lhy-21</i> double mutant by aphids was most pronounced, indicating that the defensive roles of CCA1 and LHY were not entirely redundant. Also, the cyclic expression pattern of key indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes was considerably disturbed in both single mutants and this was more severe in the double mutant. Apparently, both CCA1 and LHY were necessary for circadian-regulated indole glucosinolate biosynthesis. Taken together, LHY-CCA1 coordination in transcriptional regulation of indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes most likely contributed to plant defensive capacity against aphids.
