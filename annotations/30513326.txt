Terrestrial frogs and toads produce conspicuous vocalizations that may be accompanied by substrate-borne vibrations [1]. Unlike airborne sound, these substrate-borne components are relatively understudied in animal communication. Some anurans exploit the forest floor as a relatively noiseless communication channel in which to propagate call-derived vibrations [2]. Insects on vegetation often use leaves and stems as substrates through which they transmit and receive seismic signals [3]. Here we report that golden rocket frogs calling from their natural substrate generate plant-borne vibrations, and we show that these vibrations can change the frog's behavior. This suggests that plant-borne vibrations can play a role in both modifying the call structure of a vertebrate and directing its movements on the substrate.
