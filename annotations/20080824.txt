Small RNAs (smRNAs) including miRNAs and siRNAs are critical for gene regulation and plant development. Among the highly diverse siRNAs, trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) have been shown to be plant-specific. In Arabidopsis, eight TAS loci belonging to four families (TAS1, TAS2, TAS3, and TAS4) have been identified, and bioinformatics analysis reveals that the sequence of TAS3 is highly conserved in plants. In this study, the function of TAS3 ta-siRNA (tasiR-ARF) has been revealed in rice (Oryza sativa L.) on polarity establishment and stage transition from vegetative to reproductive development by over-expressing Osta-siR2141. Osta-siR2141 replaced miR390 in the miR390 backbone for ectopic expression in rice, and overexpression of Osta-siR2141 caused disturbed vascular bundle development and adaxialization in polarity establishment. Transgenic lines also displayed abnormal shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and retarded growth at the vegetative stage. Molecular analysis revealed that overexpression of Osta-siR2141 resulted in the down-regulation of miR166 and the up-regulation of class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes (HD-ZIPIIIs) in the vegetative stage but not in the reproductive stage. Moreover, overexpression of Osta-siR2141 in Arabidopsis disturbed polarity establishment and retarded stage transition, suggesting that tasiR-ARF was functionally conserved in rice and Arabidopsis.
