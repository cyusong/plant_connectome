The Arabidopsis ppGpp-overproducing mutant indicates a larger biomass than wild type by modulated amino-acid metabolism under nitrogen-limiting conditions. The regulatory nucleotide, guanosine 3', 5'-bis(pyrophosphate; ppGpp)-originally identified in Escherichia coli-controls gene expression and enzyme activities in the bacteria and plastids of plant cells. We recently reported that the ppGpp over-producing mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana had a larger shoot weight than wild type (WT), especially under nutrient-deficient conditions. However, the mechanisms behind the influence of ppGpp on plant growth and biomass remain elusive. To understand the impact of the ppGpp accumulation on plant growth, we characterized metabolic changes in the ppGpp-overproducing mutant upon transition from nitrogen-rich to nitrogen-limiting concentrations. We found that the fresh weight of the mutant was significantly larger than WT when the total nitrogen source (KNO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) concentration was below 0.9 mM. When the nitrogen content in the medium decreased, aromatic and branched-chain amino acids increased in WT due to accelerated protein degradation and/or attenuated protein synthesis. These amino-acid levels in the ppGpp over-accumulating mutant decreased upon nitrogen deficiency. The results suggest that the ppGpp-overaccumulation affects amino-acid and protein homeostasis and facilitates growth under nitrogen-limiting conditions.
