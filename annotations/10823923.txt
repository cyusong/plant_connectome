['10823923', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, the SOS1 (Salt Overly Sensitive 1) locus is essential  for Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis, and sos1 mutations render plants more sensitive  to growth inhibition by high Na(+) and low K(+) environments. SOS1 is cloned and  predicted to encode a 127-kDa protein with 12 transmembrane domains in the  N-terminal part and a long hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail in the C-terminal part.  The transmembrane region of SOS1 has significant sequence similarities to plasma  membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporters from bacteria and fungi. Sequence analysis of  various sos1 mutant alleles reveals several residues and regions in the  transmembrane as well as the tail parts that are critical for SOS1 function in  plant salt tolerance. SOS1 gene expression in plants is up-regulated in response  to NaCl stress. This up-regulation is abated in sos3 or sos2 mutant plants,  suggesting that it is controlled by the SOS3/SOS2 regulatory pathway.', '2000 Jun 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.120170197', 'Zhu']
