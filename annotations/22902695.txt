The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) Constitutive Triple-Response1 (CTR1) plays a key role in mediating ethylene receptor signaling via its N-terminal interaction with the ethylene receptor C-terminal histidine kinase (HK) domain. Loss-of-function mutations of CTR1 prevent ethylene receptor signaling, and corresponding ctr1 mutants show a constitutive ethylene response phenotype. We recently reported in Plant Physiology that expression of the truncated ethylene receptor Ethylene Response1 (ETR1) isoforms etr1 ( 1-349) and dominant ethylene-insensitive etr1-1 ( 1-349) , lacking the C-terminal HK and receiver domains, both suppressed the ctr1 mutant phenotype. Therefore, the ETR1 N terminus is capable of receptor signaling independent of CTR1. The constitutive ethylene response phenotype is stronger for ctr1-1 than ctr1-1 lines expressing the etr1 ( 1-349) transgene, so N-terminal signaling by the full-length but not truncated ETR1 is inhibited by ctr1-1. We address possible modulations of ETR1 N-terminal signaling with docking of CTR1 on the ETR1 HK domain.
