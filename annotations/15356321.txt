['15356321', 'The arc3 (accumulation and replication of chloroplast) mutant of Arabidopsis  thaliana has a small number of abnormally large chloroplasts in the cell,  suggesting that chloroplast division is arrested in the mutant and ARC3 has an  important role in the initiation of chloroplast division. To elucidate the role  of ARC3, first we identified the ARC3 gene, and determined the location of ARC3  protein during chloroplast division because the localization and spatial  orientation of such division factors are vital for correct chloroplast division.  Sequencing analysis showed that ARC3 was a fusion of the prokaryotic FtsZ and  part of the eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) genes.  The PIP5K-homologous region of ARC3 had no catalytic domain but a  membrane-occupation-and-recognition-nexus (MORN) repeat motif. Immunofluorescence  microscopy, Western blotting analysis and in vitro chloroplast import and  protease protection assays revealed that ARC3 protein was soluble, and located on  the outer surface of the chloroplast in a ring-like structure at the early stage  of chloroplast division. Prokaryotes have one FtsZ as a gene for division but  have no ARC3 counterparts, the chimera of FtsZ and PIP5K, suggesting that the  ARC3 gene might have been generated from FtsZ as another division factor during  the evolution of chloroplast by endosymbiosis.', '2004 Aug', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pch130', 'Takamiya']
