Due to the present scenario of climate change, plants have to evolve strategies to survive and perform under a plethora of biotic and abiotic stresses, which restrict plant productivity. Maintenance of plant protein functional conformation and preventing non-native proteins from aggregation, which leads to metabolic disruption, are of prime importance. Plant heat shock proteins (HSPs), as chaperones, play a pivotal role in conferring biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Moreover, HSP also enhances membrane stability and detoxifies the reactive oxygen species (ROS) by positively regulating the antioxidant enzymes system. Additionally, it uses ROS as a signal to molecules to induce HSP production. HSP also enhances plant immunity by the accumulation and stability of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins under various biotic stresses. Thus, to unravel the entire plant defense system, the role of HSPs are discussed with a special focus on plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses, which will be helpful in the development of stress tolerance in plant crops.
