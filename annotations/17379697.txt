Cytoplasmic inheritance was investigated in interspecific hybrids of Wisteria sinensis and W. floribunda. Species-specific nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid DNA markers were identified from wild-collected plants of each species in its native range. These markers provide evidence for the bi-parental transmission of plastids in hybrid swarms of these two species in the southeastern USA. These population level molecular data corroborate previous cytological evidence of this phenomenon in Wisteria.
