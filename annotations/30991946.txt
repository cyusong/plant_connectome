Magnesium (Mg) deficiency causes physiological and molecular responses, already dissected in several plant species. The study of these responses among genotypes showing a different tolerance to the Mg shortage can allow identifying the mechanisms underlying the resistance to this nutritional disorder. To this aim, we compared the physiological and molecular responses (e.g. changes in root metabolome and transcriptome) of two grapevine rootstocks exhibiting, in field, different behaviors with respect to Mg shortage (1103P, tolerant and SO4 susceptible). The two grapevine rootstocks confirmed, in a controlled growing system, their behavior in relation to the tolerance to Mg deficiency. Differences in metabolite and transcriptional profiles between the roots of the two genotypes were mainly linked to antioxidative compounds and the cell wall constituents. In addition, differences in secondary metabolism, in term of both metabolites (e.g. alkaloids, terpenoids and phenylpropanoids) and transcripts, assessed between 1103P and SO4 suggest a different behavior in relation to stress responses particularly at early stages of Mg deficiency. Our results suggested that the higher ability of 1103P to tolerate Mg shortage is mainly linked to its capability of coping, faster and more efficiently, with the oxidative stress condition caused by the nutritional disorder.
