['21874592', 'Tic20 is a central, membrane-embedded component of the precursor protein  translocon of the inner envelope of chloroplasts (TIC). In Arabidopsis thaliana,  four different isoforms of Tic20 exist. They are annotated as atTic20-I, -II, -IV  and -V and form two distinct phylogenetic subfamilies in embryophyta. Consistent  with atTic20-I being the only essential isoform for chloroplast development, we  show that the protein is exclusively targeted to the chloroplasts inner envelope.  The same result is observed for atTic20-II. In contrast, atTic20-V is localized  in thylakoids and atTic20-IV dually localizes to chloroplasts and mitochondria.  These results together with the previously established expression profiles  explain the recently described phenotypes of Tic20 knockout plants and point  towards a functional diversification of these proteins within the family. For all  Tic20 proteins a 4-helix topology is proposed irrespective of the targeted  membrane, which in part could be confirmed in vivo by application of a  self-assembling GFP-based topology approach. By the same approach we show that  the inner envelope localized Tic20 proteins expose their C-termini to the  chloroplast stroma. This localization would be consistent with the positive  inside rule considering a stromal translocation intermediate as discussed.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-011-9818-5', 'Schleiff']
