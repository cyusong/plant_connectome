The light, oxygen or voltage (LOV) domain belongs to the Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) superfamily of domains, and functions with the flavin chromophore as a module for sensing blue light in plants and fungi. The Arabidopsis thaliana PAS/LOV proteins (PLPs), of unknown function, possess an N-terminal PAS domain and a C-terminal LOV domain. Our recent analysis using yeast two-hybrid and Escherichia coli protein production systems reveals that the interactions of Arabidopsis PLPs with several proteins diminish under blue light illumination and that the PLP LOV domain may bind to a flavin chromophore. These results suggest that PLP functions as a blue light receptor. Homologs of PLP exist in rice, tomato and moss. The LOV domains of these PLP homologs form a distinct group in phylogenetic analysis. These facts suggest that PLP belongs to a new class of plant blue light receptor.
