<i>Thinopyrum intermedium</i> (2<i>n</i> = 6<i>x</i> = 42, JJJ<sup>S</sup>J<sup>S</sup>StSt) is one of the important resources for the wheat improvement. So far, a few <i>Th. intermedium</i> (<i>Thi</i>)-specific molecular markers have been reported, but the number is far from enough to meet the need of identifying alien fragments in wheat-<i>Th. intermedium</i> hybrids. In this study, 5,877,409 contigs were assembled using the <i>Th. intermedium</i> genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. We obtained 5,452 non-redundant contigs containing mapped <i>Thi</i>-GBS markers with less than 20% similarity to the wheat genome and developed 2,019 sequence-tagged site (STS) molecular markers. Among the markers designed, 745 <i>Thi</i>-specific markers with amplification products in <i>Th. intermedium</i> but not in eight wheat landraces were further selected. The distribution of these markers in different homologous groups of <i>Th. intermedium</i> varied from 47 (7/12/28 on 6J/6St/6J<sup>S</sup>) to 183 (54/62/67 on 7J/7St/7J<sup>S</sup>). Furthermore, the effectiveness of these <i>Thi</i>-specific markers was verified using wheat-<i>Th. intermedium</i> partial amphidiploids, addition lines, substitution lines, and translocation lines. Markers developed in this study provide a convenient, rapid, reliable, and economical method for identifying <i>Th. intermedium</i> chromosomes in wheat. In addition, this set of <i>Thi</i>-specific markers can also be used to estimate genetic and physical locations of <i>Th. intermedium</i> chromatin in the introgression lines, thus providing valuable information for follow-up studies such as alien gene mining.
