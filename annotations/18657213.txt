Upon appropriate stimulation, plants can develop an enhanced capacity to express infection-induced cellular defense responses, a phenomenon known as the primed state. Colonization of the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana by the beneficial rhizobacterial strain Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r primes the leaf tissue for enhanced pathogen- and insect-induced expression of jasmonate (JA)-responsive genes, resulting in an induced systemic resistance (ISR) that is effective against different types of pathogens and insect herbivores. Here the molecular mechanism of this rhizobacteria-induced priming response was investigated using a whole-genome transcript profiling approach. Out of the 1879 putative methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-responsive genes, 442 genes displayed a primed expression pattern in ISR-expressing plants. Promoter analysis of ISR-primed, MeJA-responsive genes and ISR-primed, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000)-responsive genes revealed over-representation of the G-box-like motif 5'-CACATG-3'. This motif is a binding site for the transcription factor MYC2, which plays a central role in JA- and abscisic acid-regulated signaling. MYC2 expression was consistently up-regulated in ISR-expressing plants. Moreover, mutants impaired in the JASMONATE-INSENSITIVE1/MYC2 gene (jin1-1 and jin1-2) were unable to mount WCS417r-ISR against Pst DC3000 and the downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica. Together, these results pinpoint MYC2 as a potential regulator in priming for enhanced JA-responsive gene expression during rhizobacteria-mediated ISR.
