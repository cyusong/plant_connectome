Food insecurity and malnutrition have reached critical levels with increased human population, climate fluctuations, water shortage; therefore, higher-yielding crops are in the spotlight of numerous studies. Abiotic factors affect the yield of staple food crops; among all, wheat stem sawfly (<i>Cephus cinctus</i> Norton) and orange wheat blossom midge (<i>Sitodiplosis mosellana</i>) are two of the most economically and agronomically harmful insect pests which cause yield loss in cereals, especially in wheat in North America. There is no effective strategy for suppressing this pest damage yet, and only the plants with intrinsic tolerance mechanisms such as solid stem phenotypes for <i>WSS</i> and antixenosis and/or antibiosis mechanisms for <i>OWBM</i> can limit damage. A major QTL and a causal gene for <i>WSS</i> resistance were previously identified in wheat, and 3 major QTLs and a causal gene for <i>OWBM</i> resistance. Here, we present a comparative analysis of coding and non-coding features of these loci of wheat across important cereal crops, barley, rye, oat, and rice. This research paves the way for our cloning and editing of additional <i>WSS</i> and <i>OWBM</i> tolerance gene(s), proteins, and metabolites.
