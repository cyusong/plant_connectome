Nickel (Ni) is an essential trace element for plant growth and a component of the plant body that has many different functions in plants. Although it has been confirmed that nickel ions (Ni<sup>2+</sup>) havea certain regulatory effect on nitrogen (N) metabolism, there are not enough data to prove whether exogenous Ni<sup>2+</sup> can increase the carbon (C) and N metabolism in the roots of tomato seedlingsunder low-nitrogen (LN) conditions. Therefore, through the present experiment, we revealed the key mechanism of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-mediated tomato root tolerance to LN levels. Tomato plants were cultured at two different N levels (7.66 and 0.383 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>) and two different Ni<sup>2+</sup> levels (0 and 0.1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> NiSO<sub>4</sub> 6H<sub>2</sub>O) under hydroponic conditions. After nine days, we collected roots for physiological, biochemical, and transcriptome sequencing analyses and found that the activities of N assimilation-related enzymes decreased at LN levels. In contrast, Ni<sup>2+</sup> significantly increased the activities of N assimilation-related enzymes and increased the contents of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), and total amino acids. Through root transcriptomic analysis, 3738 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. DEGs related to C and N metabolism were downregulated after LN application. However, after Ni<sup>2+</sup> treatment, <i>PK</i>, <i>PDHB</i>, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>NR</i>, <i>NiR</i>, <i>GS</i>, <i>GOGAT</i>, and other DEGs related to C and N metabolism were significantly upregulated. In conclusion, our results suggest that Ni<sup>2+</sup> can regulate the C and N metabolism pathways in tomato roots to alleviate the impact of LN levels.
