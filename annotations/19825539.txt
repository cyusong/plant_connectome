We describe an inexpensive and reliable detector for measuring NO emitted in the gas phase from plants. The method relies on the use of a strong oxidizer to convert NO to NO2 and subsequent capture of NO2 by a Griess reagent trap. The set-up approaches the sensitivity for NO comparable to that of instruments based on chemiluminescence and photoacoustic detectors. We demonstrate the utility of our set-up by measuring NO produced by a variety of well established plant sources. NO produced by nitrate reductase (NR) in tobacco leaves and barley aleurone was readily detected, as was the production of NO from nitrite by the incubation medium of barley aleurone. Arabidopsis mutants that overproduce NO or lack NO-synthase (AtNOS1) also displayed the expected NO synthesis phenotype when assayed by our set-up. We could also measure NO production from elicitor-treated suspension cultured cells using this set-up. Further, we have focused on the detection of NO by a widely used fluorescent probe 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM). Our work points to the pitfalls that must be avoided when using DAF-FM to detect the production of NO by plant tissues. In addition to the dramatic effects that pH can have on fluorescence from DAF-FM, the widely used NO scavengers 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) can produce anomalous and unexpected results. Perhaps the most serious drawback of DAF-FM is its ability to bind to dead cells and remain NO-sensitive.
