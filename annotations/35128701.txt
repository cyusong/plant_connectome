Phosphorus (P) is one of the macronutrients indispensable for crop production, and therefore it is important to understand the potential of plants to adapt to low P conditions. We compared growth and leaf genome-wide transcriptome of four rice cultivars during growth between two fields with different amount of available phosphate and further analysed the acceptable range of P levels for normal growth from the view of both appearance traits and internal P nutrient status, which was measured by profiling the expression of the P indicator gene. This demonstrated that rice plants have a robustness to moderate P-deficient conditions expressing a system for P acquisition and usage without any effects on yield potential and that P indicator gene expression could be a useful index for early diagnosis of P status in plants. To develop a simple method for assessment of P status, we tried to predict the expression level using reflectance spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging, thereby providing models with good performance. Our findings suggest that rice plants have the potential to adapt to moderate low P conditions in the field and showed that the hyperspectral technique is one of the useful tools for simple measurement of molecular-level dynamics reflecting internal nutrient conditions.
