Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) is emerging as a potential lipid messenger involved in several cell types, from plants to mammals. Expression of IpgD, a PtdIns(4,5)P(2) 4-phosphatase induces Src kinase and Akt, but not ERK activation and enhances interleukin II promoter activity in T-cells. Expression of a new PtdIns5P interacting domain blocks IpgD-induced T-cell activation and selective signaling molecules downstream of TCR triggering. Altogether, these data suggest that PtdIns5P may play a sensor function in setting the threshold of T-cell activation and contributing to maintain T-cell homeostasis.
