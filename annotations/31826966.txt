Rapid pollen tube growth requires uptake of Suc or its hydrolytic products, hexoses, from the apoplast of surrounding tissues in the style. Due to species-specific sugar requirements, reliance of pollen germination and tube growth on cell wall invertase and Suc or hexose transporters varies between species, but it is not known if plants have a sugar transporter that mediates the uptake of both hexose and Suc for pollen tube growth. Here, we show that a sugar transporter protein in apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), MdSTP13a, takes up both hexose and Suc when expressed in yeast, and is essential for pollen tube growth on Glc and Suc but not on maltose. MdSTP13a-mediated direct uptake of Suc is primarily responsible for apple pollen tube growth on Suc medium. Sorbitol, a major photosynthate and transport carbohydrate in apple, modulates pollen tube growth via the MYB transcription factor MdMYB39L, which binds to the promoter of <i>MdSTP13a</i> to activate its expression. Antisense repression of <i>MdSTP13a</i> blocks sorbitol-modulated pollen tube growth. These findings demonstrate that MdSTP13a takes up both hexose and Suc for sorbitol-modulated pollen tube growth in apple, revealing a situation where acquisition of sugars for pollen tube growth is regulated by a sugar alcohol.
