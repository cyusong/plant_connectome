Assessing cell proliferation dynamics is crucial to understand the spatiotemporal control of organogenesis. Here we have generated a versatile fluorescent sensor, PlaCCI (plant cell cycle indicator) on the basis of the expression of CDT1a-CFP, H3.1-mCherry and CYCB1;1-YFP, that identifies cell cycle phases in Arabidopsis thaliana. This tool works in a variety of organs, and all markers and the antibiotic resistance are expressed from a single cassette, facilitating the selection in mutant backgrounds. We also show the robustness of PlaCCI line in live-imaging experiments to follow and quantify cell cycle phase progression.
