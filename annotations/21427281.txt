['21427281', 'DNA polymerases play a central role in the process of DNA replication. Yet, the  proteins in charge of the replication of plant organelle DNA have not been  unambiguously identified. There are however many indications that a family of  proteins homologous to bacterial DNA polymerase I (PolI) is implicated in  organelle DNA replication. Here, we have isolated mutant lines of the PolIA and  PolIB genes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to test this hypothesis. We  find that mutation of both genes is lethal, thus confirming an essential and  redundant role for these two proteins. However, the mutation of a single gene is  sufficient to cause a reduction in the levels of DNA in both mitochondria and  plastids. We also demonstrate that polIb, but not polIa mutant lines, are  hypersensitive to ciprofloxacin, a small molecule that specifically induces DNA  double-strand breaks in plant organelles, suggesting a function for PolIB in DNA  repair. In agreement with this result, a cross between polIb and a plastid Whirly  mutant line yielded plants with high levels of DNA rearrangements and severe  growth defects, indicating impairments in plastid DNA repair pathways. Taken  together, this work provides further evidences for the involvement of the plant  PolI-like genes in organelle DNA replication and suggests an additional role for  PolIB in DNA repair.', '2011 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.173849', 'Brisson']
