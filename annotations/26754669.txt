['26754669', "Gene duplications generate new genes that can acquire similar but often  diversified functions. Recent studies of gene coexpression networks have  indicated that, not only genes, but also pathways can be multiplied and  diversified to perform related functions in different parts of an organism.  Identification of such diversified pathways, or modules, is needed to expand our  knowledge of biological processes in plants and to understand how biological  functions evolve. However, systematic explorations of modules remain scarce, and  no user-friendly platform to identify them exists. We have established a  statistical framework to identify modules and show that approximately one-third  of the genes of a plant's genome participate in hundreds of multiplied modules.  Using this framework as a basis, we implemented a platform that can explore and  visualize multiplied modules in coexpression networks of eight plant species. To  validate the usefulness of the platform, we identified and functionally  characterized pollen- and root-specific cell wall modules that multiplied to  confer tip growth in pollen tubes and root hairs, respectively. Furthermore, we  identified multiplied modules involved in secondary metabolite synthesis and  corroborated them by metabolite profiling of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) tissues.  The interactive platform, referred to as FamNet, is available at  http://www.gene2function.de/famnet.html.", '2016 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01281', 'ORCID:']
