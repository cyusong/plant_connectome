Seed dormancy is an important agronomic trait in cereals and leguminous crops as low levels of seed dormancy during harvest season, coupled with high humidity, can cause preharvest sprouting. Seed longevity is another critical trait for commercial crop propagation and production, directly influencing seed germination and early seedling establishment. Both traits are precisely regulated by the integration of genetic and environmental cues. Despite the significance of these two traits in crop production, the relationship between them at the molecular level is still elusive, even with contradictory conclusions being reported. Some studies have proposed a positive correlation between seed dormancy and longevity in association with differences in seed coat permeability or seed reserve accumulation, whereas an increasing number of studies have highlighted a negative relationship, largely with respect to phytohormone-dependent pathways. In this review paper, we try to provide some insights into the interactions between regulatory mechanisms of genetic and environmental cues, which result in positive or negative relationships between seed dormancy and longevity. Finally, we conclude that further dissection of the molecular mechanism responsible for this apparently contradictory relationship between them is needed.
