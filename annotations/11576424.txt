['11576424', 'The ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway is a major route for selectively degrading  cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotes. In this pathway, chains of  ubiquitins become attached to short-lived proteins, signalling recognition and  breakdown of the modified protein by the 26S proteasome. During or following  target degradation, the attached multi-ubiquitin chains are released and  subsequently disassembled by ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) to regenerate  free ubiquitin monomers for re-use. Here, we describe Arabidopsis thaliana UBP14  that may participate in this recycling process. Its amino acid sequence is most  similar to yeast UBP14 and its orthologues, human IsoT1-3 and Dictyostelium UbpA,  and it can functionally replace yeast UBP14 in a ubp14Delta mutant. Like its  orthologues, AtUBP14 can disassemble multi-ubiquitin chains linked internally via  epsilon-amino isopeptide bonds using Lys48 and can process some, but not all,  translational fusions of ubiquitin linked via alpha-amino peptide bonds. However,  unlike its yeast and Dictyostelium orthologues, AtUBP14 is essential in  Arabidopsis. T-DNA insertion mutations in the single gene that encodes AtUBP14  cause an embryonic lethal phenotype, with the homozygous embryos arresting at the  globular stage. The arrested seeds have substantially increased levels of  multi-ubiquitin chains, indicative of a defect in ubiquitin recycling. Taken  together, the data demonstrate an essential role for the ubiquitin/26S proteasome  pathway in general and for AtUBP14 in particular during early plant development.', '2001 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01106.x', 'Vierstra']
