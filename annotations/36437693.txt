The rapid softening of sweet cherry fruits during ripening results in the deterioration of fruit quality. However, few genes related to sweet cherry fruit ripening and softening have been identified, and the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we identified and functionally characterized PavNAC56, a NAC transcription factor that positively regulates sweet cherry fruit ripening and softening. Gene expression analyses showed that PavNAC56 was specifically and abundantly expressed in the fruit, and its transcript levels increased in response to abscisic acid (ABA). A subcellular localization analysis revealed that PavNAC56 is a nucleus-localized protein. Virus-induced gene silencing of PavNAC56 inhibited fruit ripening, enhanced fruit firmness, decreased the contents of ABA, anthocyanins, and soluble solids, and down-regulated several fruit ripening-related genes. Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays showed that PavNAC56 directly binds to the promoters of several genes related to cell wall metabolism (PavPG2, PavEXPA4, PavPL18, and PavCEL8) and activates their expression. Overall, our findings show that PavNAC56 plays an indispensable role in controlling the ripening and softening of sweet cherry fruit and provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms by which NAC transcription factors affect nonclimacteric fruit ripening and softening.
