Phalaris arundinacea, with its characteristics of rapid growth and high biological yield, is regarded as an excellent forage grass in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region of China. To explore the physiological and molecular response mechanism of Phalaris arundinacea under salt stress, we monitored the biomass and physiological indexes of two locally grown strains under conditions of exposure to 150 and 300 mM NaCl solution. Z0611 exhibited better salt stress tolerance than YS. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that YS and Z0611 had 1713 and 4290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, including on metabolic processes, single-organism process, catalytic activity, and plant hormone signal transduction in the GO and KEGG databases. We also identified a large number of genes involved in hormone signaling, antioxidant systems, ion homeostasis, and photosynthetic systems. Our study provides physiological and molecular insight for establishing a salt resistance database and mining salt tolerance genes in Phalaris arundinacea, and also provides theoretical guidance for the restoration of saline-alkali land on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
