Plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms to overcome their sessile nature. However, if and how volatiles from cold-stressed plants can trigger interplant communication is still unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence for interplant communication via inducible volatiles in cold stress. The volatiles, including nerolidol, geraniol, linalool, and methyl salicylate, emitted from cold-stressed tea plants play key role(s) in priming cold tolerance of their neighbors via a C-repeat-binding factors-dependent pathway. The knowledge will help us to understand how plants respond to volatile cues in cold stress and agricultural ecosystems.

C-repeat-binding factors: !mediates! interplant communication
volatiles: !emitted from! cold-stressed tea plants
volatiles: !prime! cold tolerance of neighbors
nerolidol: !synthesizes! by cold-stressed tea plants
geraniol: !synthesizes! by cold-stressed tea plants
linalool: !synthesizes! by cold-stressed tea plants
methyl salicylate: !synthesizes! by cold-stressed tea plants
