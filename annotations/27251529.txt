['27251529', 'Plant survival is greatly impaired when oxygen levels are limiting, such as  during flooding or when anatomical constraints limit oxygen diffusion. Oxygen  sensing in Arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by Ethylene Responsive Factor  (ERF)-VII transcription factors, which control a core set of hypoxia- and  anoxia-responsive genes responsible for metabolic acclimation to low-oxygen  conditions. Anoxic conditions also induce genes related to reactive oxygen  species (ROS). Whether the oxygen-sensing machinery coordinates ROS production  under anoxia has remained unclear. Here we show that a low-oxygen-responsive  universal stress protein (USP), Hypoxia Responsive Universal Stress Protein 1  (HRU1), is induced by RAP2.12 (Related to Apetala 2.12), an ERF-VII protein, and  modulates ROS production in Arabidopsis. We found that HRU1 is strongly induced  by submergence, but that this induction is abolished in plants lacking RAP2.12.  Mutation of HRU1 through transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion alters hydrogen peroxide  production, and reduces tolerance to submergence and anoxia. Yeast two-hybrid and  bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analyses reveal that HRU1  interacts with proteins that induce ROS production, the GTPase ROP2 and the NADPH  oxidase RbohD, pointing to the existence of a low-oxygen-specific mechanism for  the modulation of ROS levels. We propose that HRU1 coordinates oxygen sensing  with ROS signalling under anoxic conditions.', '2015 Oct 12', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/nplants.2015.151', 'ORCID:']
