['15598798', 'An Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, cryophyte, was isolated and found to have an  enhanced cold stress-induction of the master regulator of cold tolerance,  C-repeat binding factor 2 (CBF2), and its downstream target genes. The mutant is  more tolerant to chilling and freezing stresses but is more sensitive to heat  stress. Under warm but not cold growth temperatures, the mutant has a reduced  stature and flowers earlier. Under long day conditions, flowering of the mutant  is insensitive to vernalization. The mutant is also hypersensitive to the  phytohormone abscisic acid. The mutation was found in a DEAD box RNA helicase  gene that is identical to the previously identified low expression of osmotically  responsive genes 4 (LOS4) locus, which was defined by the los4-1 mutation that  reduces cold regulation of CBFs and their target genes and renders Arabidopsis  plants chilling sensitive. We show evidence suggesting that the CRYOPHYTE/LOS4  protein may be enriched in the nuclear rim. In situ poly(A) hybridization  indicates that the export of poly(A)+ RNAs is blocked in the cryophyte/los4-2  mutant at warm or high temperatures but not at low temperatures, whereas the  los4-1 mutation weakens mRNA export at both low and warm temperatures. These  results demonstrate an important role of the CRYOPHYTE/LOS4 RNA helicase in mRNA  export, plant development, and stress responses.', '2005 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.027557', 'Zhu']
