Knowledge of how insects are actually affected by sex pheromones deployed throughout a crop so as to disrupt mating has lacked a mechanistic framework sufficient for guiding optimization of this environmentally friendly pest-control tactic. Major hypotheses are competitive attraction, desensitization, and camouflage. Working with codling moths, Cydia pomonella, in field cages millions of times larger than laboratory test tubes and at substrate concentrations trillions of times less than those typical for enzymes, we nevertheless demonstrate that mating disruption sufficiently parallels enzyme (ligand) -substrate interactions so as to justify adoption of conceptual and analytical tools of biochemical kinetics. By doing so, we prove that commercial dispensers of codling moth pheromone first competitively attract and then deactivate males probably for the remainder of a night. No evidence was found for camouflage. We generated and now validate simple algebraic equations for attraction and competitive attraction that will guide optimization and broaden implementation of behavioral manipulations of pests. This analysis system also offers a unique approach to quantifying animal foraging behaviors and could find applications across the natural and social sciences.

Pheromone: !competitively attracts! Males 
Pheromone: !deactivates! Males 
Enzyme: !parallels! Ligand-Substrate Interactions 
Commercial Dispensers: !attracts and deactivates! Males
