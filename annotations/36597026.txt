Fruit flesh colour is not only an important commodity attribute of eggplant but is also closely related to maturity. However, very little is known about its formation mechanism in eggplant. Two inbred lines of eggplant, green 'NC7' and white 'BL', were used in this study to explain the differences in flesh colour. Transcriptome sequencing results revealed a total of 3304 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NC7 vs. BL. Of the DEGs obtained, 2050 were higher and 1254 were lower in BL. These DEGs were annotated to 126 pathways, where porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, and photosynthesis-antenna proteins play vital roles in the colour formation of eggplant flesh. At the same time, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment significance analysis showed that a large number of unigenes involved in the formation of chloroplast structure were lower in BL, which indicated that the formation of chloroplasts in white-fleshed eggplant was blocked. This was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which found only leucoplasts but no chloroplasts in the flesh cells of white-fleshed eggplant. Several genes encoding ERF and bHLH transcription factors were predicted to participate in the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes. The results of this study indicated that differences in the gene expression of the chlorophyll metabolic pathway were the main cause of the different flesh colour formations. These findings will increase our understanding of the genetic basis in eggplant flesh colors formation mechanism.
