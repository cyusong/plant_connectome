In order to investigate the possible role of the polyamines spermidine and spermine, in the alternate bearing habit of the olive, a comparative analysis of their content in vegetative and reproductive organs during the flowering period of the 'on' and 'off' years, was conducted. Samples of flowers, ovaries and leaves from two cultivars, the biennial bearer 'Chondrolia Chalkidikis' and the regular cropping 'Koroneiki' were used and the free and conjugated forms of polyamines were detected. In addition, the concentrations of K(+) and Ca(2+) were determined in all samples. Spermidine conjugates were predominant in all samples, while free spermine was not detectable. Conjugated forms of both spermidine and spermine were accumulated in ovaries, rather than in other floral tissues (corolla and stamens). They also, accumulated in significantly higher concentrations in ovaries and leaves of both cultivars, during the 'on' compared with the 'off' year, and in much higher concentrations, during the 'on' year, in ovaries of the strong alternate bearer 'Chondrolia Chalkidikis' than in 'Koroneiki'. Free spermidine was detected in ovaries and leaves of both cultivars, showing a decline during ovule fertilization in both years. Such a decline was not always recorded for the conjugated forms, depending on the organ studied and the flower load. A relation between endogenous spermidine and spermine with the K(+) or Ca(2+) composition was not established.
