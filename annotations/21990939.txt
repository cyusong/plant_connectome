['21990939', 'Structural organization of organs in multicellular organisms occurs through  intricate patterning mechanisms that often involve complex interactions between  transcription factors in regulatory networks. For example, INDEHISCENT (IND), a  basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, specifies formation of the  narrow stripes of valve margin tissue, where Arabidopsis thaliana fruits open on  maturity. Another bHLH transcription factor, SPATULA (SPT), is required for  reproductive tissue development from carpel margins in the Arabidopsis gynoecium  before fertilization. Previous studies have therefore assigned the function of  SPT to early gynoecium stages and IND to later fruit stages of reproductive  development. Here we report that these two transcription factors interact  genetically and via protein-protein contact to mediate both gynoecium development  and fruit opening. We show that IND directly and positively regulates the  expression of SPT, and that spt mutants have partial defects in valve margin  formation. Careful analysis of ind mutant gynoecia revealed slight defects in  apical tissue formation, and combining mutations in IND and SPT dramatically  enhanced both single-mutant phenotypes. Our data show that SPT and IND at least  partially mediate their joint functions in gynoecium and fruit development by  controlling auxin distribution and suggest that this occurs through cooperative  binding to regulatory sequences in downstream target genes.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.090944', 'Ostergaard']
