Wounds in tissues provide a pathway of entry for pathogenic fungi and bacteria in plants. Plants respond to wounding by regulating the expression of genes involved in their defense mechanisms. To analyze this response, we investigated the defense-related genes induced by wounding in the leaves of <i>Senna tora</i> using RNA sequencing. The genes involved in jasmonate and ethylene biosynthesis were strongly induced by wounding, as were a large number of genes encoding transcription factors such as ERFs, WRKYs, MYBs, bHLHs, and NACs. Wounding induced the expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, such as PR-1, chitinase, thaumatin-like protein, cysteine proteinase inhibitor, PR-10, and plant defensin. Furthermore, wounding led to the induction of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and the accumulation of kaempferol and quercetin in <i>S</i>. <i>tora</i> leaves. All these genes were expressed systemically in leaves distant from the wound site. These results demonstrate that mechanical wounding can lead to a systemic defense response in the Caesalpinioideae, a subfamily of the Leguminosae. In addition, a co-expression analysis of genes induced by wounding provides important information about the interactions between genes involved in plant defense responses.
