The production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) is one of the key events occurring during the response of plants to environmental changes, and contributing to establish adaptive signaling pathways. A plasma membrane bound NADPH oxidase enzyme has been evidenced as the ROS producing system in various plant-microorganisms interactions. We very recently reported, that a protein of the 14-3-3 family was able to interact directly with the C-terminus part of this NADPH oxidase, and that modification of its expression in tobacco cells led to reduced amount of ROS production upon elicitation. In this addendum, we summarize this work, present additional results, and propose an hypothetic model of regulation of this oxidase in a plant defense context.

NADPH oxidase: !produces! ROS
14-3-3 protein: !interacts with! NADPH oxidase
14-3-3 protein: !modifies expression of! NADPH oxidase
NADPH oxidase: !regulates! plant defense
