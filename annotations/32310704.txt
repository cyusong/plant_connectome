The fungus <i>Myriosclerotinia sulcatula</i> is a close relative of the notorious polyphagous plant pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> but exhibits a host range restricted to plants from the <i>Carex</i> genus (<i>Cyperaceae</i> family). To date, there are no genomic resources available for fungi in the <i>Myriosclerotinia</i> genus. Here, we present a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly for <i>M. sulcatula</i>. The assembly contains 24 contigs with a total length of 43.53 Mbp, with scaffold N<sub>50</sub> of 2,649.7 kbp and N<sub>90</sub> of 1,133.1 kbp. BRAKER-predicted gene models were manually curated using WebApollo, resulting in 11,275 protein-coding genes that we functionally annotated. We provide a high-quality reference genome assembly and annotation for <i>M. sulcatula</i> as a resource for studying evolution and pathogenicity in fungi from the <i>Sclerotiniaceae</i> family.
