Excessive demand for translation and protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can cause ER stress in plants. Here, we show that CALRETICULIN 1 (CRT1) and CRT2 are critical components in the accumulation of VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 721 (VAMP721) and VAMP722 during ER stress responses. We show that CRT2 interacts with VAMP722 and that CRT1/2 post-translationally maintain elevated VAMP721/722 levels under ER stress. The greater growth inhibition in VAMP721/722-deficient plants, induced by tunicamycin, suggests that plants under ER stress maintain physiological homeostasis, at least in part, by regulating VAMP721/722 levels, as VAMP721/722 are known to participate in various biological processes.

CRT1: !maintains! VAMP721/722
CRT2: !interacts with! VAMP722
VAMP721/722: !participate in! biological processes
ER stress: !induces! greater growth inhibition
