Plant developmental processes are controlled by co-ordinated action of phytohormones and plant genes encoding components of developmental response pathways. ENOD40 was identified as a candidate for such a plant factor with a regulatory role during nodulation. Although its mode of action is poorly understood, several lines of evidence suggest interaction with phytohormone response pathways. This hypothesis was investigated by analysing cytokinin-, auxin-, and ethylene-induced responses on cell growth and cell division in transgenic 35S:NtENOD40 Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) tobacco cell suspensions. It was found that cell division frequency is controlled by the balance between cytokinin and auxin in wild-type cells and that this regulation is not affected in 35S:NtENOD40 lines. Elongation growth, on the other hand, is reduced upon overexpression of NtENOD40. Analysis of ethylene homeostasis shows that ethylene accumulation is accelerated in 35S:NtENOD40 lines. ENOD40 action can be counteracted by an ethylene perception blocker, indicating that ethylene is a negative regulator of elongation growth in 35S:NtENOD40 cells, and that the NtENOD40-induced response is mediated by alteration of ethylene biosynthesis kinetics.
