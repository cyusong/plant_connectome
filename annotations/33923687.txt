<i>TaCKX</i> gene family members (GFMs) play essential roles in the regulation of cytokinin during wheat development and significantly influence yield-related traits. However, detailed function of most of them is not known. To characterize the role of <i>TaCKX2.2</i> genes we silenced all homoeologous copies of both <i>TaCKX2.2.1</i> and <i>TaCKX2.2.2</i> by RNAi technology and observed the effect of silencing in 7 DAP spikes of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> generations. The levels of gene silencing of these developmentally regulated genes were different in both generations, which variously determined particular phenotypes. High silencing of <i>TaCKX2.2.2</i> in T<sub>2</sub> was accompanied by slight down-regulation of <i>TaCKX2.2.1</i> and strong up-regulation of <i>TaCKX5</i> and <i>TaCKX11</i>, and expression of <i>TaCKX1</i>, <i>TaCKX2.1</i>, and <i>TaCKX9</i> was comparable to the non-silenced control. Co-ordinated expression of <i>TaCKX2.2.2</i> with other <i>TaCKX</i> GFMs influenced phytohormonal homeostasis. Contents of isoprenoid, active cytokinins, their conjugates, and auxin in seven DAP spikes of silenced T<sub>2</sub> plants increased from 1.27 to 2.51 times. However, benzyladenine (BA) and abscisic acid (ABA) contents were significantly reduced and GA<sub>3</sub> was not detected. We documented a significant role of <i>TaCKX2.2.2</i> in the regulation of thousand grain weight (TGW), grain number, and chlorophyll content, and demonstrated the formation of a homeostatic feedback loop between the transcription of tested genes and phytohormones. We also discuss the mechanism of regulation of yield-related traits.
