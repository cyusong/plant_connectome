['18703057', 'We found that four type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (ND) in Arabidopsis are  targeted to two locations in the cell; NDC1 was targeted to mitochondria and  chloroplasts, while NDA1, NDA2 and NDB1 were targeted to mitochondria and  peroxisomes. Targeting of NDC1 to chloroplasts as well as mitochondria was shown  using in vitro and in vivo uptake assays and dual targeting of NDC1 to plastids  relies on regions in the mature part of the protein. Accumulation of NDA type  dehydrogenases to peroxisomes and mitochondria was confirmed using Western blot  analysis on highly purified organelle fractions. Targeting of ND proteins to  mitochondria and peroxisomes is achieved by two separate signals, a C-terminal  signal for peroxisomes and an N-terminal signal for mitochondria.', '2008 Sep 3', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2008.07.061', 'Whelan']
