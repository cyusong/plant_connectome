Conclusions 741 Acknowledgements 741 SUMMARY: Investigating the features and implications of epigenetic mechanisms across the breadth of organisms and ecosystems is important for understanding the ecological relevance of epigenetics. Several cost-effective reduced representation bisulfite sequencing approaches (RRBS) have been recently developed and applied to different organisms that lack a well annotated reference genome. These new approaches improve the assessment of epigenetic diversity in ecological settings and may provide functional insights. We assess here the opportunities and limitations of RRBS in nonmodel plant species. Well thought out experimental designs that include complementary gene expression studies, and the improvement of genomics resources for the target group, promise to maximize the effect of future RRBS studies.
