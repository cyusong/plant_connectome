Poplar is an important afforestation and ornamental tree species in Northeast China. The distribution area of saline-alkali land is approximately 765 hm<sup>2</sup> in Northeast China. The breeding of saline-alkali-resistant transgenic trees could be an effective method of afforestation in saline-alkali land. WRKY transcription factors play a crucial role in abiotic stress. In this study, we analyzed the genetic stability of the two-year-old <i>PsnWRKY70</i> transgenic poplars. The results showed that <i>PsnWRKY70</i> of transgenic poplars had been expressed stably and normally at the mRNA level. The gene interference expression (RE) lines had no significant effect on the growth of <i>PsnWRKY70</i> under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress, and the alkali damage index of RE lines was significantly lower than that of WT and overexpression (OE) lines at day 15 under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress. POD activity was significantly higher in RE lines than in WT. The MDA content of the RE line was lower than that of the WT line. Transcriptome analysis showed that RE lines up-regulated genes enriched in cell wall organization or biogenesis pathway-related genes such as <i>EXPA8</i>, <i>EXPA4</i>, <i>EXPA3</i>, <i>EXPA1</i>, <i>EXPB3</i>, <i>EXP10</i>, <i>PME53</i>, <i>PME34</i>, <i>PME36</i>, <i>XTH9</i>, <i>XTH6</i>, <i>XTH23</i>, <i>CESA1</i>, <i>CESA3</i>, <i>CES9</i>; <i>FLA11</i>, <i>FLA16</i> and <i>FLA7</i> genes. These genes play an important role in NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress. Our study showed that the interference expression of the <i>PsnWRKY70</i> gene can enhance the tolerance of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in poplar.
