['9878632', 'The immutans (im) mutant of Arabidopsis shows a variegated phenotype comprising  albino and green somatic sectors. We have cloned the IM gene by transposon  tagging and show that even stable null alleles give rise to a variegated  phenotype. The gene product has amino acid similarity to the mitochondrial  alternative oxidase. We show that the IM protein is synthesized as a precursor  polypeptide that is imported into chloroplasts and inserted into the thylakoid  membrane. The albino sectors of im plants contain reduced levels of carotenoids  and increased levels of the carotenoid precursor phytoene. The data presented  here are consistent with a role for the IM protein as a cofactor for carotenoid  desaturation. The suggested terminal oxidase function of IM appears to be  essential to prevent photooxidative damage during early steps of chloroplast  formation. We propose a model in which IM function is linked to phytoene  desaturation and, possibly, to the respiratory activity of the chloroplast.', '1999 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.1.57', 'Kuntz']
