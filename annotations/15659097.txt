['15659097', 'The HUA2 gene acts as a repressor of floral transition. Lesions in hua2 were  identified through a study of natural variation and through two mutant screens.  An allele of HUA2 from Landsberg erecta (Ler) contains a premature stop codon and  acts as an enhancer of early flowering 4 (elf4) mutants. hua2 single mutants, in  the absence of the elf4 lesion, flower earlier than wild type under short days.  hua2 mutations partially suppress late flowering in FRIGIDA (FRI )-containing  lines, autonomous pathway mutants, and a photoperiod pathway mutant. hua2  mutations suppress late flowering by reducing the expression of several MADS  genes that act as floral repressors including FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC ) and  FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM ).', '2005 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02300.x', 'Amasino']
