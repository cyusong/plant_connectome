Heterosis has been extensively utilized in plant breeding, however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. Maize (Zea mays), which exhibits strong heterosis, is an ideal material for studying heterosis. In this study, there is faster imbibition and development in reciprocal crossing Zhengdan958 hybrids than in their parent lines during seed germination. To investigate the mechanism of heterosis of maize germination, comparative transcriptomic analyses were conducted. The gene expression patterns showed that 1324 (47.27%) and 1592 (66.44%) of the differential expression genes between hybrids and either parental line display parental dominance up or higher levels in the reciprocal cross of Zhengdan958, respectively. Notably, these genes were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways, including carbon metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, etc. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence for the higher expression level genes in hybrid involved in metabolic pathways acting as main contributors to maize seed germinating heterosis. These findings provide new insights into the gene expression variation of maize embryos and improve the understanding of maize seed germination heterosis.
