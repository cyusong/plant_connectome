['16916932', 'Although a complex pattern of interspersed cell proliferation and cell  differentiation is known to occur during leaf blade development in eudicot  plants, the genetic mechanisms coordinating this growth are unclear. In  Arabidopsis, deletion of the PEAPOD (PPD) locus increases leaf lamina size and  results in dome-shaped rather than flat leaves. Siliques are also altered in  shape because of extra lamina growth. The curvature of a Deltappd leaf reflects  the difference between excess growth of the lamina and a limitation to the  extension capacity of its perimeter. Excess lamina growth in Deltappd plants is  due to a prolonged phase of dispersed meristematic cell (DMC) proliferation (for  example, the meristemoid and procambium cells that form stomatal stem cells and  vascular cells, respectively) during blade development. The PPD locus is composed  of two homologous genes, PPD1 and PPD2, which encode plant-specific putative  DNA-binding proteins. Overexpression of PPD reduces lamina size by promoting the  early arrest of DMC proliferation during leaf and silique development. Therefore,  by regulating the arrest of DMC proliferation, the PPD genes coordinate tissue  growth, modulate lamina size, and limit curvature of the leaf blade. I propose a  revised model of leaf development with two cell-cycle arrest fronts progressing  from the tip to the base: the known primary front, which determines arrest of  general cell proliferation, followed by a secondary front that involves PPD and  arrests DMC division.', '2006 Aug 29', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0604349103', 'White']
