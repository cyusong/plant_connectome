Improvement in acid phosphatase (APase) activity is considered as an important approach to enhance phosphorus (P) utilization in crops. Here, <i>GmPAP14</i> was significantly induced by low P (LP), and its transcription level in ZH15 (P efficient soybean) was higher than in NMH (P inefficient soybean) under LP conditions. Further analyses demonstrated that there were several variations in gDNA (<i>G-GmPAP14Z</i> and <i>G-GmPAP14N</i>) and the promoters (<i>P-GmPAP14Z</i> and <i>P-GmPAP14N</i>) of <i>GmPAP14</i>, which might bring about differential transcriptional levels of <i>GmPAP14</i> in ZH15 and NMH. Histochemical staining measurements revealed that a stronger GUS signal was present in transgenic Arabidopsis with <i>P-GmPAP14Z</i> under LP and normal P (NP) conditions compared with the <i>P-GmPAP14N</i> plant. Functional research demonstrated that transgenic Arabidopsis with <i>G-GmPAP14Z</i> had a higher level of <i>GmPAP14</i> expression than the <i>G-GmPAP14N</i> plant. Meanwhile, higher APase activity was also observed in the <i>G-GmPAP14Z</i> plant, which led to increases in shoot weight and P content. Additionally, validation of variation in 68 soybean accessions showed that varieties with Del36 displayed higher APase activities than the del36 plant. Thus, these results uncovered that allelic variation in <i>GmPAP14</i> predominantly altered gene expression to influence APase activity, which provided a possible direction for research of this gene in plants.
