Aluminum (Al) toxicity significantly restricts crop production on acidic soils. Although rice is highly resistant to Al stress, the underlying resistant mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we characterized the function of OsNIP1;2, a plasma membrane-localized nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) in rice. Aluminum stress specifically and quickly induced <i>OsNIP1;2</i> expression in the root. Functional mutations of OsNIP1;2 in two independent rice lines led to significantly enhanced sensitivity to Al but not other metals. Moreover, the <i>Osnip1;2</i> mutants had considerably more Al accumulated in the root cell wall but less in the cytosol than the wild-type rice. In addition, compared with the wild-type rice plants, the <i>Osnip1;2</i> mutants contained more Al in the root but less in the shoot. When expressed in yeast, OsNIP1;2 led to enhanced Al accumulation in the cells and enhanced sensitivity to Al stress, suggesting that OsNIP1;2 facilitated Al uptake in yeast. These results suggest that OsNIP1;2 confers internal Al detoxification <i>via</i> taking out the root cell wall's Al, sequestering it to the root cell's vacuole, and re-distributing it to the above-ground tissues.
