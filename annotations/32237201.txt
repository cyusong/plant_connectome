Iron (Fe) is indispensable for the growth and development of plants. It is well known that FER-LIKE FE DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) is a key regulator of Fe uptake in Arabidopsis. Here, we identify the Oryza sativa FIT (also known as OsbHLH156) as the interacting partner of IRON-RELATED BHLH TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2 (OsIRO2) that is critical for regulating Fe uptake. The OsIRO2 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, but OsFIT facilitates the accumulation of OsIRO2 in the nucleus. Loss-of-function mutations of OsFIT result in decreased Fe accumulation, severe Fe-deficiency symptoms, and disrupted expression of Fe-uptake genes. In contrast, OsFIT overexpression promotes Fe accumulation and the expression of Fe-uptake genes. Genetic analyses indicate that OsFIT and OsIRO2 function in the same genetic node. Further analyses suggest that OsFIT and OsIRO2 form a functional transcription activation complex to initiate the expression of Fe-uptake genes. Our findings provide a mechanism understanding of how rice maintains Fe homeostasis.
