['32765550', 'Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies facilitate the study of plant  molecular functions in detail and with precision. Plant genome and proteome  databases are continually being updated with large transcriptomic or genomic  datasets. With the ever-increasing amount of sequencing data, several thousands  of genes or proteins in public databases remain uncharacterized, and their domain  functions are largely unknown. Such proteins contain domains of unknown function  (DUF). In the present study, we identified 231 upregulated and 206 downregulated  DUF genes from the available RNA-Seq-based transcriptome profiling datasets of  Arabidopsis leaves exposed to a nitric oxide donor, S-nitroso-L-cysteine (CysNO).  In addition, we performed extensive in silico and biological experiments to  determine the potential functions of AtDUF569 and to elucidate its role in plant  growth, development, and defense. We validated the expression pattern of the most  upregulated and the most downregulated DUF genes from the transcriptomic data. In  addition, a loss-of AtDUF569 function mutant was evaluated for growth,  development, and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. According to the  results of the study, AtDUF569 negatively regulates biotic stress responses and  differentially regulates plant growth under nitro-oxidative stress conditions.', '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.01041', 'Yun']
