When plants are infected by <i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i>, their developmental programs are subjected to extensive changes and the resultant clubroot disease is associated with formation of large galls on underground tissue. The pathogen's need to build an efficient feeding site as the disease progresses drives these changes, ensuring successful production of resting spores. This developmental reprogramming is an outcome of interactions between the pathogen and the infected host. During disease progression, we can observe alteration of growth regulator dynamics, patterns of cell proliferation and differentiation, increased cell expansion, and eventual cell wall degradation as well as the redirection of nutrients toward the pathogen. Recently, detailed studies of anatomical changes occurring during infection and studies profiling transcriptional responses have come together to provide a clearer understanding of the sequence of events and processes underlying clubroot disease. Additionally, genome sequencing projects have revealed <i>P. brassicae</i>'s potential for the production of signaling molecules and effectors as well as its requirements and capacities with respect to taking up host nutrients. Integration of these new findings together with physiological studies can significantly advance our understanding of how <i>P. brassicae</i> brings about reprogramming of host development. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on cellular changes induced by <i>P. brassicae</i> infection and aims to explain their impact and importance for both the host and the pathogen.
