Environmental stresses have driven plants to develop various mechanisms to acclimate in adverse conditions. Extensive studies have demonstrated that a significant reprogramming occurs in the plant transcriptome in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The highly conserved and large multi-subunit transcriptional co-activator of eukaryotes, known as the Mediator, has been reported to play a substantial role in the regulation of important genes that help plants respond to environmental perturbances. CDK8 module is a relatively new component of the Mediator complex that has been shown to contribute to plants' defense, development, and stress responses. Previous studies reported that CDK8 module predominantly acts as a transcriptional repressor in eukaryotic cells by reversibly associating with core Mediator. However, growing evidence has demonstrated that depending on the type of biotic and abiotic stress, the CDK8 module may perform a contrasting regulatory role. This review will summarize the current knowledge of CDK8 module as well as other previously documented Mediator subunits in plant cell signaling under stress conditions.
