['33730147', 'The unique apical hook in dicotyledonous plants protects the shoot apical  meristem and cotyledons when seedlings emerge through the soil. Its formation  involves differential cell growth under the coordinated control of plant  hormones, especially ethylene and auxin. Microtubules are essential players in  plant cell growth that are regulated by multiple microtubule-associated proteins  (MAPs). However, the role and underlying mechanisms of MAP-microtubule modules in  differential cell growth are poorly understood. In this study, we found that the  previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis MAP WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE4 (WDL4) protein  plays a positive role in apical hook opening. WDL4 exhibits a temporal expression  pattern during hook development in dark-grown seedlings that is directly  regulated by ethylene signaling. WDL4 mutants showed a delayed hook opening  phenotype while overexpression of WDL4 resulted in enhanced hook opening. In  particular, wdl4-1 mutants exhibited stronger auxin accumulation in the concave  side of the apical hook. Furthermore, the regulation of the auxin maxima and  trafficking of the auxin efflux carriers PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) and PIN7 in the hook  region is critical for WDL4-mediated hook opening. Together, our study  demonstrates that WDL4 positively regulates apical hook opening by modulating  auxin distribution, thus unraveling a mechanism for MAP-mediated differential  plant cell growth.', '2021 Jul 19', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab080', 'ORCID:']
