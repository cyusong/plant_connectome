<i>Phytophthora capsici</i> is an oomycete plant pathogen with a wide host range. Worldwide, <i>P. capsici</i> is known for causing the principal disease of chili pepper crops. Our goal was to expand the available genome resources for this diverse pathogen by generating whole-genome sequences for six isolates of <i>P</i>. <i>capsici</i> from Mexico.

P. capsici: !causes! Disease
P. capsici: !has! Wide host range
Genome: !generates! Whole-genome sequences
Mexico: !hosts! Six isolates of P. capsici
