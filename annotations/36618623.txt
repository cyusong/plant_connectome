Salinity abiotic stress is increasing day by day due to continuous global warming and climate change. This is also becoming one of the major causes behind the reduction in crop production. Plant-bacteria interaction plays an essential role in improving crop yield without using any chemical fertilizers. The present study aims to characterize the interaction between plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and their role in mitigating salinity stress for local variety crops. Therefore, in this work, two PGPB, namely, <i>Bacillus proteolyticus</i> Cyn1 and <i>Bacillus safensis</i> Cyn2, were isolated from rhizospheric soil of the Chilean common bean ecotype "Sapito" (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.), and their PGPB traits were analyzed. Cyn1 can produce NH<sub>3</sub> and HCN and also secrete siderophores, whereas Cyn2 produced NH<sub>3</sub> and siderophores but responded negatively to HCN production. Both the isolated bacteria have shown a positive result for ACC deaminase production, phosphate solubilization, and catalase enzyme secretion. Under all three tested abiotic stresses, i.e., temperature, water, and salinity, both the bacteria and their consortium have demonstrated positive responses. Cyn1 under temperature stress and water stress can produce a biofilm network to combat the stress. While under salinity stress, both the PGPB isolates indicated the production of stress components and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Based on the response, among all other abiotic stresses, salinity stress was chosen for further plant-bacteria interaction study and growth. Visible root colonization of the bacteria has been observed in comparison to the control. The germination index was 100% for all experimental setups of seed bacterization, both under control conditions and salinity stress. Both bacteria responded with good PGP traits that helped in the growth of healthy plants after the bacterial treatment in final pot experiments. Additionally, the consortium and the plants treated with Cyn1 have demonstrated high production of photosynthetic pigments in both experimental setups. Both <i>B</i>. <i>proteolyticus</i> Cyn1 and <i>B</i>. <i>safensis</i> Cyn2 have shown promising PGP characters and efficient response against toxicity related to salinity. Hence, both of these bacteria and consortium can be used for improved agricultural production of Chilean native common beans in the near future.
