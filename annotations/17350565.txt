Innate immunity in plants and animals is mediated through pattern recognition receptors, which were thought to initiate signaling in the cytoplasm to activate defense pathways. Shen et al. (2006) and Burch-Smith et al. (2007) now provide compelling evidence that certain plant disease resistance proteins, which detect specific pathogenic effectors, act in the nucleus to trigger downstream signaling and defense pathways.
