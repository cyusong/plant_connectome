NaCl stress is a major abiotic stress limiting the productivity and the geographical distribution of many plant species. Roots are the primary site of salinity perception. To understand better NaCl stress responses in Arabidopsis roots, a comparative proteomic analysis of roots that had been exposed to 150 mM NaCl for either 6 h or 48 h was conducted. Changes in the abundance of protein species within roots were examined using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Among the >1000 protein spots reproducibly detected on each gel, the abundance of 112 protein spots decreased and 103 increased, at one or both time points, in response to NaCl treatment. Through liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, identity was assigned to 86 of the differentially abundant spots. The proteins identified included many previously characterized stress-responsive proteins and others related to processes including scavenging for reactive oxygen species; signal transduction; translation, cell wall biosynthesis, protein translation, processing and degradation; and metabolism of energy, amino acids, and hormones. At the resolution of individual genes and proteins, poor statistical correlation (6 h, r= -0.13; 48 h, r=0.11) of these protein expression data with previous microarray results was detected, supporting the concept that post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in stress-responsive gene expression, and highlighting the need for combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.
