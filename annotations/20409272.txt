The past 30 years has seen a tremendous increase in our understanding of the light-signaling networks of higher plants. This short review emphasizes the role that Arabidopsis genetics has played in deciphering this complex network. Importantly, it outlines how genetic studies led to the identification of photoreceptors and signaling components that are not only relevant in plants, but play key roles in mammals.
