Improving the crop traits is highly required for the development of superior crop varieties to deal with climate change and the associated abiotic and biotic stress challenges. Climate change-driven global warming can trigger higher insect pest pressures and plant diseases thus affecting crop production sternly. The traits controlling genes for stress or disease tolerance are economically imperative in crop plants. In this scenario, the extensive exploration of available wild, resistant or susceptible germplasms and unraveling the genetic diversity remains vital for breeding programs. The dawn of next-generation sequencing technologies and omics approaches has accelerated plant breeding by providing the genome sequences and transcriptomes of several plants. The availability of decoded plant genomes offers an opportunity at a glance to identify candidate genes, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), molecular markers, and genome-wide association studies that can potentially aid in high throughput marker-assisted breeding. In recent years genomics is coupled with marker-assisted breeding to unravel the mechanisms to harness better better crop yield and quality. In this review, we discuss the aspects of marker-assisted breeding and recent perspectives of breeding approaches in the era of genomics, bioinformatics, high-tech phonemics, genome editing, and new plant breeding technologies for crop improvement. In nutshell, the smart breeding toolkit in the post-genomics era can steadily help in developing climate-smart future food crops.
