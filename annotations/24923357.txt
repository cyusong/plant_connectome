['24923357', 'In flowering plants, male gametes (sperm cells) develop within male gametophytes  (pollen grains) and are delivered to female gametes for double fertilization by  pollen tubes. Therefore, pollen tube growth is crucial for reproduction. The  mechanisms that control pollen tube growth remain poorly understood. In this  study, we demonstrated that the ARID-HMG DNA-binding protein AtHMGB15 plays an  important role in pollen tube growth. This protein is preferentially expressed in  pollen grains and pollen tubes and is localized in the vegetative nuclei of the  tricellular pollen grains and pollen tubes. Knocking down AtHMGB15 expression via  a Ds insertion caused retarded pollen tube growth, leading to a significant  reduction in the seed set. The athmgb15-1 mutation affected the expression of  1686 genes in mature pollen, including those involved in cell wall formation and  modification, cell signaling and cellular transport during pollen tube growth. In  addition, it was observed that AtHMGB15 binds to DNA in vitro and interacts with  the transcription factors AGL66 and AGL104, which are required for pollen  maturation and pollen tube growth. These results suggest that AtHMGB15 functions  in pollen tube growth through the regulation of gene expression.', '2014 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12582', 'Ye']
