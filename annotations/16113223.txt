Lateral diffusion of CO(2) was investigated in photosynthesizing leaves with different anatomy by gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging using grease to block stomata. When one-half of the leaf surface of the heterobaric species Helianthus annuus was covered by 4-mm-diameter patches of grease, the response of net CO(2) assimilation rate (A) to intercellular CO(2) concentration (C(i)) indicated that higher ambient CO(2) concentrations (C(a)) caused only limited lateral diffusion into the greased areas. When single 4-mm patches were applied to leaves of heterobaric Phaseolus vulgaris and homobaric Commelina communis, chlorophyll a fluorescence images showed dramatic declines in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II electron transport (measured as F(q)'/F(m)') across the patch, demonstrating that lateral CO(2) diffusion could not support A. The F(q)'/F(m)' values were used to compute images of C(i) across patches, and their dependence on C(a) was assessed. At high C(a), the patch effect was less in C. communis than P. vulgaris. A finite-volume porous-medium model for assimilation rate and lateral CO(2) diffusion was developed to analyze the patch images. The model estimated that the effective lateral CO(2) diffusion coefficients inside C. communis and P. vulgaris leaves were 22% and 12% of that for free air, respectively. We conclude that, in the light, lateral CO(2) diffusion cannot support appreciable photosynthesis over distances of more than approximately 0.3 mm in normal leaves, irrespective of the presence or absence of bundle sheath extensions, because of the CO(2) assimilation by cells along the diffusion pathway.
