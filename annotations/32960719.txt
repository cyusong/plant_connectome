Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.) is the primary vegetable crop consumed worldwide and is largely affected by bacterial pathogens that can cause soft rot and blackleg disease. Recently, resistance to these diseases has been identified in the wild potato <i>S. chacoense</i>, and the mechanism of resistance is unknown. Here, it was hypothesized that <i>S. chacoense</i> stems or tubers have unique chemistry that confers resistance to the pathogen <i>Pectobacterium brasiliense</i> through bactericidal, bacteriostatic, or antivirulence activity. Stem and tuber metabolite extracts were collected from <i>S. chacoense</i> and tested for effects on <i>Pectobacterium</i> bacterial multiplication rates, and activity and expression of known exoenzymes and virulence genes using <i>S. tuberosum</i> extracts as a comparative control. Comparatively, the <i>S. chacoense</i> extracts did not affect bacterial multiplication rate; however, they did reduce pectinase, cellulase, and protease activities. The chemical extracts were profiled using a bioassay-guided fractionation, and a nontargeted metabolomics comparison of <i>S. chacoense</i> and <i>S. tuberosum</i> stems and tubers was performed. The data showed that selected alkaloids, phenolic amines, phenols, amines, and peptides are integrative chemical sources of resistance against the bacteria.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
