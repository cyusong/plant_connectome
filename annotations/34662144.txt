<i>Colletotrichum</i> species are globally distributed and well known as members of a destructive phytopathogenic genus, causing the anthracnose disease in a wide variety of crops and fruits. <i>Colletotrichum sublineola</i> is the causal agent of the anthracnose disease in sorghum, causing losses of up to 50% in yield. Here, we used PacBio sequencing combined with RNA-seq to generate a chromosome-level assembly and annotation of the <i>Colletotrichum sublineola</i> strain CsGL1.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
