Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an important starchy root crop that provides food for millions of people worldwide, but little is known about the regulation of the development of its tuberous root at the multi-omics level. In this study, the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome were examined in parallel at seven time-points during the development of the tuberous root from the early to late stages of its growth. Overall, highly dynamic and stage-specific changes in the expression of genes/proteins were observed during development. Cell wall and auxin genes, which were regulated exclusively at the transcriptomic level, mainly functioned during the early stages. Starch biosynthesis, which was controlled at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, was mainly activated in the early stages and was greatly restricted during the late stages. Two main branches of lignin biosynthesis, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, also functioned during the early stages of development at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Metabolomic analysis further supported the stage-specific roles of particular genes/proteins. Metabolites related to lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis showed high abundance during the early stages, those related to lipids exhibited high abundance at both the early and middle stages, while those related to amino acids were highly accumulated during the late stages. Our findings provide a comprehensive resource for broadening our understanding of tuberous root development and will facilitate future genetic improvement of cassava.
