We recently demonstrated that accelerating the relaxation of nonphotochemical quenching leads to higher soybean photosynthetic efficiency and yield. In response, Sinclair <i>et al</i>. assert that improved photosynthesis cannot improve crop yields and that there is only one valid experimental design for proving a genetic improvement in yield. We explain here why neither assertion is valid.
