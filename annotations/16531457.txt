Sterols, essential eukaryotic constituents, are biosynthesized through either cyclic triterpenes, lanosterol (fungi and animals) or cycloartenol (plants). The cDNA for OSC7 of Lotus japonicus was shown to encode lanosterol synthase (LAS) by the complementation of a LAS-deficient mutant yeast and structural identification of the accumulated lanosterol. A double site-directed mutant of OSC7, in which amino acid residues crucial for the reaction specificity were changed to the cycloartenol synthase (CAS) type, produced parkeol and cycloartenol. The multiple amino acid sequence alignment of a conserved region suggests that the LAS of different eukaryotic lineages emerged from the ancestral CAS by convergent evolution.

OSC7: !encodes! lanosterol synthase
LAS-deficient mutant yeast: !complemented by! OSC7
