Rare genetic variants are abundant in genomes but less tractable in genome-wide association study. Here we exploit a strategy of rare variation mapping to discover a gene essential for tendril development in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). In a collection of >3000 lines, we discovered a unique tendril-less line that forms branches instead of tendrils and, therefore, loses its climbing ability. We hypothesized that this unusual phenotype was caused by a rare variation and subsequently identified the causative single nucleotide polymorphism. The affected gene TEN encodes a TCP transcription factor conserved within the cucurbits and is expressed specifically in tendrils, representing a new organ identity gene. The variation occurs within a protein motif unique to the cucurbits and impairs its function as a transcriptional activator. Analyses of transcriptomes from near-isogenic lines identified downstream genes required for the tendril's capability to sense and climb a support. This study provides an example to explore rare functional variants in plant genomes.
