Silicon (Si), the second most abundant element on earth, remains unavailable for plants' uptake due to its poor solubility. Microbial interventions to convert it in soluble forms are well documented. However, studies on discrimination of Si and P solubilizing microbes due to common estimation method and sharing of solubilization mechanism are still obscure. A defined differential media, i.e. silicon-solubilizing media (NBRISSM) is developed to screen Si solubilizers. NBRISN13 (<i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i>), a Si solubilizer, exhibiting antagonistic property against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, was further validated for disease resistance. The key finding of the work is that NBRISSM is a novel differential media for screening Si solubilizers, distinct from P solubilizers. Dominance of <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Bacillus</i> spp. for the function of Si solubilization was observed during diversity analysis of Si solubilizers isolated from different rhizospheres. <i>Sphingobacterium</i> sp., a different strain has been identified for silicon solubilization other than <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Bacillus</i> sp. Role of acidic phosphatase during Si solubilization has been firstly reported in our study in addition to other pH dependent phenomenon. Study also showed the combinatorial effect of feldspar and NBRISN13 on elicited immune response through (i) increased Si uptake, (ii) reduced disease severity, (iii) modulation of cell wall degrading and antioxidative enzyme activities, and (iv) induced defense responsive gene expression.
