The potato tuber constitutes a model system for the study of dormancy release and sprouting, suggested to be regulated by endogenous plant hormones and their balance inside the tuber. During dormancy, potato tubers cannot be induced to sprout without some form of stress or exogenous hormone treatment. When dormancy is released, sprouting of the apical bud may be inhibited by sprout control agents or cold temperature. Dominance of the growing apical bud over other lateral buds decreases during storage and is one of the earliest morphophysiological indicators of the tuber's physiological age. Three main types of loss of apical dominance (AD) affect sprouting shape. Hallmarks of programmed cell death (PCD) have been identified in the tuber apical bud meristem (TAB-meristem) during normal growth, and are more extensive when AD is lost following extended cold storage or chemical stress. Nevertheless, the role of hormonal regulation in TAB-meristem PCD remains unclear.
