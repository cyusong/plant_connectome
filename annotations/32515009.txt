Soybean is a high inorganic phosphate (Pi) demanding crop; its production is strongly suppressed when Pi is deficient in soil. However, the regulatory mechanism of Pi deficiency tolerance in soybean is still largely unclear. Here, our findings highlighted the pivotal role of the ethylene-associated pathway in soybean tolerance to Pi deficiency by comparatively studying transcriptome changes between a representative Pi-deficiency-tolerant soybean genotype NN94156 and a sensitive genotype Bogao under different Pi supplies. By further integrating high-confident linkage and association mapping, we identified that Ethylene-Overproduction Protein 1 (GmETO1), an essential ethylene-biosynthesis regulator, underlies the major quantitative trait locus (QTL) q14-2 controlling Pi uptake. GmETO1 was also the representative member of ETO1 family members that was strongly induced by Pi deficiency. Overexpressing GmETO1 significantly enhanced Pi deficiency tolerance by increasing proliferation and elongation of hairy roots, Pi uptake and use efficiency, and conversely, silencing of GmETO1 led to opposite findings. We further demonstrated that Pi-deficiency inducible genes critical for root morphological and physiological traits including GmACP1/2, Pht1;4, Expansin-A7 and Root Primordium Defective 1 functioned downstream of GmETO1. Our study provides comprehensive insight into the complex regulatory mechanism of Pi deficiency tolerance in soybean and a potential way to genetically improve soybean low-Pi tolerance.
