Cerrado has many compounds that have been used as biopesticides, herbicides, medicines, and others due to their highly toxic potential. Thus, this review aims to present information about the toxicity of Cerrado plants. For this purpose, a review was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, and Web Of Science databases. After applying exclusion criteria, 187 articles published in the last 20 years were selected and analyzed. Detailed information about the extract preparation, part of the plant used, dose/concentration tested, model system, and employed assay was provided for different toxic activities described in the literature, namely cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, antiparasitic, and molluscicidal activities. In addition, the steps to execute research on plant toxicity and the more common methods employed were discussed. This review synthesized and organized the available research on the toxic effects of Cerrado plants, which could contribute to the future design of new environmentally safe products.
