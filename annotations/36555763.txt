Anthocyanins are a class of antioxidants that scavenge free radicals in cells and play an important role in promoting human health and preventing many diseases. Here, we characterized a maize <i>Bronze</i> gene (<i>BZ1</i>) from the purple colored W22 introgression line, which encodes an anthocyanin 3-O-glucosyltransferase, a key enzyme in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway. Mutation of <i>ZmBZ1</i> showed bronze-colored seeds and reduced anthocyanins in seeds aleurone layer, seedlings coleoptile, and stem of mature plants by comparison with purple colored W22 (WT). Furthermore, we proved that maize BZ1 is an aleurone layer-specific expressed protein and sub-located in cell nucleus. Real-time tracing of the anthocyanins in developing seeds demonstrated that the pigment was visible from 16 DAP (day after pollination) in field condition, and first deposited in the crown part then spread all over the seed. Additionally, it was transferred along with the embryo cell activity during seed germination, from aleurone layer to cotyledon and coleoptile, as confirmed by microscopy and real-time qRT-PCR. Finally, we demonstrated that the ZmBZ1 contributes to stress tolerance, especially salinity. Further study proved that ZmBZ1 participates in reactive oxygen scavenging (ROS) by accumulating anthocyanins, thereby enhancing the tolerance to abiotic stress.
