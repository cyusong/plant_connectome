The chloride component of NaCl salinity causes the leaf apoplast to transiently alkalinize. This transition in pH reduces stomatal aperture. However, whether this apoplastic pH (pHapo) transient initiates stomatal closure by interacting with other chloride stress-induced responses or whether the pH transient alone initiates stomatal closure is unknown. To clarify the problem, the transient alkalinization of the leaf apoplast was mimicked in intact maize (Zea mays L.) by infiltrating near-neutral pH buffers into the leaf apoplast. Effects of the pHapo transient could thus be investigated independently from other chloride stress-derived effects. Microscopy-based ratiometric live pHapo imaging was used to monitor pHapoin planta. LC-MS/MS and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR leaf analyses showed that the artificially induced pHapo transient led to an increase in the concentrations of the stomata-regulating plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and in transcripts of the key ABA-synthesizing gene ZmVp14 in the leaf. Since stomatal aperture and stomatal conductance decreased according to pHapo, we conclude that the pHapo transient alone initiates stomatal closure. Therefore, the functionality does not depend on interactions with other compounds induced by chloride stress. Overall, our data indicate that the pH of the leaf apoplast links chloride salinity with the control of stomatal aperture via effects exerted on the transcription of ABA.
