Rice phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL15 regulates tiller angle through light and gravity signals in rice. Tiller angle of cereal crops is a key agronomic trait that contributes to grain production. An understanding of how tiller angle is controlled is helpful for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield. Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) are known to regulate seed germination, seedling skotomorphogenesis, shade avoidance, and flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we report that OsPIL15 is, indeed, a rice PIF that negatively regulates tiller angle. Dominant-negative OsPIL15 plants displayed a larger tiller angle, which was associated with reduced shoot gravitropism. Phytochrome B (phyB) is the main photoreceptor perceiving the low red:far-red ratio of shade light. Compared with wild-type rice plants, loss-of-function phyB plants and OsPIL15-overexpressing plants showed smaller tiller angles and enhanced shoot gravitropism. In addition, more OsPIL15 protein accumulated in phyB plants than in wild-type plants. Light regulates the level of the OsPIL15 protein negatively, depending on phyB partially. We propose that OsPIL15 integrates light and gravity signals to regulate tiller angle in rice.

OsPIL15: !regulates! tiller angle
OsPIL15: !negatively regulates! tiller angle
phyB: !perceives! low red:far-red ratio of shade light
phyB: !regulates! level of OsPIL15 protein
OsPIL15: !integrates! light and gravity signals
