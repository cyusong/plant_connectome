Allelic variation in the CETS (CENTRORADIALIS, TERMINAL FLOWER 1, SELF PRUNING) gene family controls agronomically important traits in many crops. CETS genes encode phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins that have a central role in the timing of flowering as florigenic and anti-florigenic signals. The great expansion of CETS genes in many species suggests that the functions of this family go beyond flowering induction and repression. Here, we characterized the tomato SELF PRUNING 3C (SP3C) gene, and show that besides acting as a flowering repressor it also regulates seed germination and modulates root architecture. We show that loss of SP3C function in CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutant lines increases root length and reduces root side branching relative to the wild type. Higher SP3C expression in transgenic lines promotes the opposite effects in roots, represses seed germination, and also improves tolerance to water stress in seedlings. These discoveries provide new insights into the role of SP paralogs in agronomically relevant traits, and support future exploration of the involvement of CETS genes in abiotic stress responses.
