Inhibitors of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) reduce the degradation of cytokinins in plants, and this effect can be exploited in agriculture and in plant tissue culture. In this study, we examine the structure-activity relationship of two series of CKX inhibitors based on diphenylurea. The compounds of Series I were derived from the recently published CKX inhibitors 3TFM-2HM and 3TFM-2HE, and we identified key substituents with increased selectivity for maize ZmCKX1 and ZmCKX4a over AtCKX2 from Arabidopsis. Series II contained compounds that further exceled in CKX inhibitory activity as well as in the ease of their synthesis. The best inhibitors exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in low nanomolar ranges with ZmCKX1 and especially with ZmCKX4a, which is generally more resistant to inhibition. The activity of the key compounds was verified in tobacco and lobelia leaf-disk assays, where N6-isopentenyladenine was protected from degradation and promoted shoot regeneration. All the prepared compounds were further tested for toxicity against Caenorhabditis elegans, and the assays revealed clear differences in toxicity between compounds with and without a hydroxyalkyl group. In a broader perspective, this work increases our understanding of CKX inhibition and provides a more extensive portfolio of compounds suitable for agricultural and biotechnological research.
