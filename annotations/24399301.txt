['24399301', 'Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for integration of endogenous and  exogenous signals to adapt to the changing environment. Both the phytohormones  jasmonate (JA) and ethylene (ET) regulate plant growth, development, and defense.  In addition to synergistic regulation of root hair development and resistance to  necrotrophic fungi, JA and ET act antagonistically to regulate gene expression,  apical hook curvature, and plant defense against insect attack. However, the  molecular mechanism for such antagonism between JA and ET signaling remains  unclear. Here, we demonstrate that interaction between the JA-activated  transcription factor MYC2 and the ET-stabilized transcription factor  ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) modulates JA and ET signaling antagonism in  Arabidopsis thaliana. MYC2 interacts with EIN3 to attenuate the transcriptional  activity of EIN3 and repress ET-enhanced apical hook curvature. Conversely, EIN3  interacts with and represses MYC2 to inhibit JA-induced expression of  wound-responsive genes and herbivory-inducible genes and to attenuate  JA-regulated plant defense against generalist herbivores. Coordinated regulation  of plant responses in both antagonistic and synergistic manners would help plants  adapt to fluctuating environments.', '2014 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.120394', 'Xie']
