['11134419', 'Variegated leaves are often caused by a nuclear recessive mutation in higher  plants. Characterization of the gene responsible for variegation has shown to  provide several pathways involved in plastid differentiation. Here we describe an  Arabidopsis variegated mutant isolated by T-DNA tagging. The mutant displayed  green and yellow sectors in all green tissues except for cotyledons. Cells in the  yellow sector of the mutant contained both normal-appearing and mutant  chloroplasts. The isolated mutant was shown to be an allele of the previously  reported mutant, yellow variegated (var2). Cloning and molecular characterization  of the VAR2 locus revealed that it potentially encodes a chloroplastic homologue  of FtsH, an ATP-dependent metalloprotease that belongs to a large protein family  involved in various cellular functions. ftsH-like genes appear to comprise a  small gene family in Arabidopsis genome, since at least six homologues were found  in addition to VAR2. Dispensability of VAR2 was therefore explained by the  redundancy of genes coding for FstHs. In the yellow regions of the mutant leaves,  accumulation of photosynthetic protein components in the thylakoid membrane  appeared to be impaired. Based on the role of FtsH in a protein degradation  pathway in plastids, we propose a possibility that VAR2 is required for plastid  differentiation by avoiding partial photooxidation of developing chloroplasts.', '2000 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcd067', 'Sakamoto']
