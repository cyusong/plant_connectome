Osmotic stress seriously limits crop yield and quality. Among plant-specific transcription factors families, the NAC family of transcription factors is extensively involved in various growth, development and stress responses. Here we identified a maize NAC family transcription factor ZmNAC2 with inducible gene expression in response to osmotic stress. The subcellular localization showed that it was localized in the nucleus and overexpression of ZmNAC2 in Arabidopsis significantly promoted seed germination and elevated cotyledon greening under osmotic stress. ZmNAC2 also enhanced stomatal closure and decreased water loss in transgenic Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ZmNAC2 activated ROS scavenging and the transgenic lines accumulated less MDA and developed more lateral roots with drought or mannitol treatment. Further RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis showed that ZmNAC2 up-regulated a number of genes related to osmotic stress resistance, as well as plant hormone signaling genes. All together, ZmNAC2 enhances osmotic stress tolerance by regulating multiple physiological processes and molecular mechanisms, and exhibits potential as the target gene in crop breeding to increase osmotic stress resistance.
