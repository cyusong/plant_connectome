The nucleus contains the cell's genetic material, which directs cellular activity via gene regulation. The physical barrier of the nuclear envelope needs to be permeable to a variety of macromolecules and signals. The most prominent gateways for the transport of macromolecules are the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The NPC is the largest multiprotein complex in the cell, and is composed of multiple copies of ~30 different proteins called nucleoporins. Although much progress has been made in dissecting the NPC structure in vertebrates and yeast, the molecular architecture and physiological function of nucleoporins in plants remain poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the plant NPC proteome and address structural and functional aspects of plant nucleoporins, which support the fundamental cellular machinery.
