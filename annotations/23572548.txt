['23572548', 'The epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed coat, which correspond to  the second layer of the outer integument (oi2), contain large quantities of a  pectic polysaccharide called mucilage within the apoplastic space beneath the  outer periclinal cell wall. Immediately after seed imbibition, the mucilage is  extruded and completely envelops the seed in a gel-like capsule. We found that a  class III peroxidase family protein, PEROXIDASE36 (PER36), functions as a  mucilage extrusion factor. Expression of PER36 occurred only in oi2 cells for a  few days around the torpedo stage. A PER36-green fluorescent protein fusion was  secreted into the outer cell wall in a polarized manner. per36 mutants were  defective in mucilage extrusion after seed imbibition due to the failure of outer  cell wall rupture, although the mutants exhibited normal monosaccharide  composition of the mucilage. This abnormal phenotype of per36 was rescued by  pectin solubilization, which promoted cell wall loosening. These results suggest  that PER36 regulates the degradation of the outer cell wall. Taken together, this  work indicates that polarized secretion of PER36 in a developmental  stage-dependent manner plays a role in cell wall modification of oi2 cells.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.110072', 'Hara-Nishimura']
