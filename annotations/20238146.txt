['20238146', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana AtS40-3 gene belongs to a group of genes sharing the  conserved DUF548 sequence motif with up to now unknown function. One member of  this group, the barley HvS40, was shown before to play a role in regulation of  leaf senescence. Similar as the barley gene, AtS40-3 is induced during senescence  and is also regulated in response to dark treatment, ABA, salicylic acid and  pathogen attack. By localization of the GUS fusion protein, the AtS40-3 gene was  shown to encode a nucleus targeted protein. The s40-3a mutant with a T-DNA  insertion in the promoter region of the gene was observed to have a staygreen  phenotype. By quantitative real-time PCR analyses expression of the AtS40-3 gene  in this mutant was observed to be constitutive and not induced during senescence.  This coincided with WRKY53 gene expression in nonsenescent leaves and lowered  expression levels of WRKY53 and SAG12 at later stages of development. While in  the wildtype expression of AtS40-3 was activated by darkness, in the s40-3a  mutant the expression of AtS40-3 stayed at a low level. This coincided with lower  expression of the SEN1 and SAG12 genes. In another promoter mutant with a T-DNA  insertion further upstream of the coding sequence the levels of AtS40-3 and SAG12  transcripts increased in parallel both in a natural light-dark regime and in  darkness. The data on gene expression in promoter T-DNA insertion mutants of the  s40-3 gene indicate that AtS40 regulates senescence either by modulation of  WRKY53 or by activation of SAG12 independent of WRKY53.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-010-9618-3', 'Krupinska']
