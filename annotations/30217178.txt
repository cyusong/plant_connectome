Boron (B) deficiency is an agricultural problem that causes significant losses of crop yield in many areas of the world. However, systematic analysis of BOR family genes for B transport in rapeseed is still lacking. We aimed to identify and characterize BOR transporters in Brassica napus and the potential role of these transporters in B homeostasis in response to B deficiency. Here, we identified 20 BOR transporters from the Brassica napus genome, which were classified into six distinct groups that represent clear orthologous relationships to their family members in Arabidopsis. qRT-PCR revealed distinct expression profiles for BnBORs in different tissues and in response to external B levels. The B-efficient cultivar QY10 accumulated more B in shoots than the B-inefficient cultivar W10, and overexpression of BnaBOR1;1c could alleviate shoot B-deficiency symptoms in W10 by distributing more B from roots to shoots. Additionally, BnBOR1;1c expression was up-regulated by B deficiency, and the induction of BnBOR1;1c was more intense in QY10. Moreover, two conserved InDels were found in the promoter regions of BnBOR1;1c within different B-efficient genotypes. Overall, the molecular characterization of the BnBOR genes of two B-efficient cultivars and their responses to B deficiency highlights the diversity of the family members in B. napus, and BnaC4.BOR1;1c has potential as a candidate gene for improving B nutrition.
