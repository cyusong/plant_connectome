SEC14L-PITPs guide membrane recognition and signaling. An increasingly complex modular structure of SEC14L-PITPs evolved in land plants compared to green algae. SEC14/CRAL-TRIO and GOLD domains govern membrane binding specificity. SEC14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (SEC14L-PITPs) provide cues for membrane identity by exchanging lipophilic substrates, ultimately governing membrane signaling. Flowering plant SEC14L-PITPs often have modular structure and are associated with cell division, development, and stress responses. Yet, structure-function relationships for biochemical-cellular interactions of SEC14L-PITPs are rather enigmatic. Here, we evaluate the phylogenetic relationships of the SEC14L-PITP superfamily in the green lineage. Compared to green algae, land plants have an extended set of SEC14L-PITPs with increasingly complex modular structure. SEC14-GOLD PITPs, present in land plants but not Chara, diverged to three functional subgroups, represented by the six PATELLIN (PATL) proteins in Arabidopsis. Based on the example of Arabidopsis PATL2, we dissect the functional domains for in vitro binding to phosphoinositides and liposomes and for plant cell membrane association. While the SEC14 domain and its CRAL-TRIO-N-terminal extension serve general membrane attachment of the protein, the C-terminal GOLD domain directs it to the plasma membrane by recognizing specific phosphoinositides. We discuss that the different domains of SEC14L-PITPs integrate developmental and environmental signals to control SEC14L-PITP-mediated membrane identity, important to initiate dynamic membrane events.
