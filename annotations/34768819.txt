Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis has become an important tool in plant research, enabling the characterization of genes via gene knock-out. CRISPR genome editing tools can be applied to generate multi-gene knockout lines. Typically, multiple single-stranded, single guide RNAs (gRNAs) must be expressed in an organism to target multiple genes simultaneously; however, a single gRNA can target multiple genes if the target genes share similar sequences. A gene cluster comprising ACQUIRED OSMOTOLERANCE (<i>ACQOS</i>; <i>AT5G46520</i>) and neighboring nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeats (<i>NLR</i>s; <i>AT5G46510</i>) is associated with osmotic tolerance. To investigate the role of <i>ACQOS</i> and the tandemly arranged NLR in osmotic tolerance, we introduced small insertion/deletion mutations into two target genes using a single gRNA and obtained transformant plant lines with three different combinations of mutant alleles. We then tested our mutant lines for osmotic tolerance after a salt-stress acclimation period by determining the chlorophyll contents of the mutant seedlings. Our results strongly suggest that <i>ACQOS</i> is directly associated with salt resistance, while the neighboring NLR is not. Here, we confirmed previous findings suggesting the involvement of <i>ACQOS</i> in salt tolerance and demonstrated the usefulness of CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis in validating the functions of genes in a single genetic background.
