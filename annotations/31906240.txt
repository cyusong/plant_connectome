Being master regulators of gene expression, transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in determining plant growth, development and reproduction. To date, many TFs have been shown to positively mediate plant responses to environmental stresses. In the current study, the biological functions of a stress-responsive NAC [NAM (No Apical Meristem), ATAF1/2 (<i>Arabidopsis</i> Transcription Activation Factor1/2), CUC2 (Cup-shaped Cotyledon2)]-TF encoding gene isolated from soybean (<i>GmNAC019</i>) in relation to plant drought tolerance and abscisic acid (ABA) responses were investigated. By using a heterologous transgenic system, we revealed that transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants constitutively expressing the <i>GmNAC019</i> gene exhibited higher survival rates in a soil-drying assay, which was associated with lower water loss rate in detached leaves, lower cellular hydrogen peroxide content and stronger antioxidant defense under water-stressed conditions. Additionally, the exogenous treatment of transgenic plants with ABA showed their hypersensitivity to this phytohormone, exhibiting lower rates of seed germination and green cotyledons. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that GmNAC019 functions as a positive regulator of ABA-mediated plant response to drought, and thus, it has potential utility for improving plant tolerance through molecular biotechnology.
