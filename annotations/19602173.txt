Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dependent acylation of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol to form triacylglycerol in the terminal step of seed oil formation. Previous work has suggested that the level of DGAT activity may have a substantial effect on the flow of carbon into triacylglycerol, implying that the enzyme may represent a promising target for seed oil modification through biotechnological approaches. In the current study, Brassica napus DH12075 was transformed with an antisense type 1 DGAT construct, resulting in a reduction in DGAT1 gene expression, total DGAT activity and seed oil content. In addition, reduced seed yield and germination rates were observed along with severe developmental abnormalities. These data suggest that in addition to its critical role in seed oil formation, DGAT1 enzyme may also be important for normal seed development in B. napus, although the underlying mechanism(s) remain to be determined.
