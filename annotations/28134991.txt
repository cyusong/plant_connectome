Fruit set is an essential process to ensure successful sexual plant reproduction. The development of the flower into a fruit is actively repressed in the absence of pollination. However, some cultivars from a few species are able to develop seedless fruits overcoming the standard restriction of unpollinated ovaries to growth. We report here the identification of the tomato hydra mutant that produces seedless (parthenocarpic) fruits. Seedless fruit production in hydra plants is linked to the absence of both male and female sporocyte development. The HYDRA gene is therefore essential for the initiation of sporogenesis in tomato. Using positional cloning, virus-induced gene silencing and expression analysis experiments, we identified the HYDRA gene and demonstrated that it encodes the tomato orthologue of SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) of Arabidopsis. We found that the precocious growth of the ovary is associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in gibberellin (GA) metabolism. Our results support the conservation of the function of SPL-like genes in the control of sporogenesis in plants. Moreover, this study uncovers a new function for the tomato SlSPL/HYDRA gene in the control of fruit initiation.
