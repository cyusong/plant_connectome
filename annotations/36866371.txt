The cultivated Peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.), an important oilseed and edible legume, are widely grown worldwide. The R2R3-MYB transcription factor, one of the largest gene families in plants, is involved in various plant developmental processes and responds to multiple stresses. In this study we identified 196 typical <i>R2R3-MYB</i> genes in the genome of cultivated peanut. Comparative phylogenetic analysis with <i>Arabidopsis</i> divided them into 48 subgroups. The motif composition and gene structure independently supported the subgroup delineation. Collinearity analysis indicated polyploidization, tandem, and segmental duplication were the main driver of the <i>R2R3-MYB</i> gene amplification in peanut. Homologous gene pairs between the two subgroups showed tissue specific biased expression. In addition, a total of 90 R2R3-MYB genes showed significant differential expression levels in response to waterlogging stress. Furthermore, we identified an SNP located in the third exon region of <i>AdMYB03-18 (AhMYB033)</i> by association analysis, and the three haplotypes of the SNP were significantly correlated with total branch number (TBN), pod length (PL) and root-shoot ratio (RS ratio), respectively, revealing the potential function of <i>AdMYB03-18 (AhMYB033)</i> in improving peanut yield. Together, these studies provide evidence for functional diversity in the <i>R2R3-MYB</i> genes and will contribute to understanding the function of <i>R2R3-MYB</i> genes in peanut.
