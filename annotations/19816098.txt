Jasmonate- and ABA-mediated signalings are involved in the activation of defense responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. Accumulating evidence has suggested the existence of comprehensive synergistic or antagonistic cross-talks between these two signaling pathways. However, relatively little is known about how these cross-talks are executed at the molecular level. Our recent works have implied that, ANAC019 and ANAC055, two highly related NAC family transcription factors in Arabidopsis, may play a dual role in regulating jasmonate response and ABA response.
