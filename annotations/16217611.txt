The technique of proteome analysis using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) has the power to monitor global changes that occur in the protein complement of tissues and subcellular compartments. In this study, the proteins of rice were cataloged, a rice proteome database was constructed, and a functional characterization of some of the identified proteins was undertaken. Proteins extracted from various tissues and subcellular compartments in rice were separated by 2D-PAGE and an image analyzer was used to construct a display of the proteins. The Rice Proteome Database contains 23 reference maps based on 2D-PAGE of proteins from various rice tissues and subcellular compartments. These reference maps comprise 13129 identified proteins, and the amino acid sequences of 5092 proteins are entered in the database. Major proteins involved in growth or stress responses were identified using the proteome approach. Some of these proteins, including a beta-tubulin, calreticulin, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase in rice, have unexpected functions. The information obtained from the Rice Proteome Database will aid in cloning the genes for and predicting the function of unknown proteins.
