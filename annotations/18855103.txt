Growth and development of plants is controlled by external and internal signals. Key internal signals are those generated by hormones and the circadian clock. We highlight interactions between the circadian clock and hormonal signalling networks in regulating the physiology and growth of plants. Microarray analysis has shown that a significant proportion of transcripts involved in hormonal metabolism, catabolism, perception and signalling are also regulated by the circadian clock. In particular, there are interactions between the clock and abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin and ethylene signalling. We discuss the role of circadian modulation ('gating') of hormonal signals in preventing temporally inappropriate responses. A consideration of the daily changes in physiology provides evidence that circadian gating of hormonal signalling couples the rhythmic regulation of carbon and water utilisation to rhythmic patterns of growth.
