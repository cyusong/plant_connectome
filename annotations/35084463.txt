Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in phosphorus (P) stress in plants, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. In this study, we found root endogenous JA content in rice increased under P deficiency (-P), suggesting that JA might participate in P homeostasis in plants. This hypothesis was further confirmed through the addition of exogenous JA (+JA), as this could increase both the root and shoot soluble P content through regulating root cell wall P reutilization. In addition, -P+JA treatment significantly induced the expression of P transporter gene OsPT2, together with increased xylem P content, implying that JA is also important for P translocation from the root to the shoot in P-deficient rice. Furthermore, the accumulation of the molecular signal nitric oxide (NO) was enhanced under -P+JA treatment when compared with -P treatment alone, while the addition of c-PTIO, a scavenger of NO, could reverse the P-deficient phenotype alleviated by JA. Taken together, our results reveal a JA-NO-cell wall P reutilization pathway under P deficiency in rice.
