In plants, receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the communication between the environment and the interior of the cell. Apoplastic ROS production is a frequent result of RLK signaling in a multitude of cellular processes; thus, by their nature, these two signaling components are inherently linked. However, it is as yet unclear how ROS signaling downstream of receptor activation is executed. In this review, we provide a broad view of the intricate connections between RLKs and ROS signaling and describe the regulatory events that control and coordinate extracellular ROS production. We propose that concurrent initiation of ROS-dependent and -independent signaling linked to RLKs might be a critical element in establishing cellular responses. Furthermore, we discuss the possible ROS sensing mechanisms in the context of the biochemical environment in the apoplast. We suggest that RLK-dependent modulation of apoplastic and intracellular conditions facilitates ROS perception and signaling. Based on data from plant and animal models, we argue that specific RLKs could be components of the ROS sensing machinery or ROS sensors. The importance of the crosstalk between RLK and ROS signaling is discussed in the context of stomatal immunity. Finally, we highlight challenges in the understanding of these signaling processes and provide perspectives for future research.
