['34367201', 'Embryogenesis is a critical developmental process that establishes the body  organization of higher plants. During this process, the biogenesis of  chloroplasts from proplastids is essential. A failure in chloroplast development  during embryogenesis can cause morphologically abnormal embryos or embryonic  lethality. In this study, we isolated a T-DNA insertion mutant of the Arabidopsis  gene EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2726 (EMB2726). Heterozygous emb2726 seedlings produced  about 25% albino seeds with embryos that displayed defects at the 32-cell stage  and that arrested development at the late globular stage. EMB2726 protein was  localized in chloroplasts and was expressed at all stages of development, such as  embryogenesis. Moreover, the two translation elongation factor Ts domains within  the protein were critical for its function. Transmission electron microscopy  revealed that the cells in emb2726 embryos contained undifferentiated proplastids  and that the expression of plastid genome-encoded photosynthesis-related genes  was dramatically reduced. Expression studies of DR5:GFP, pDRN:DRN-GFP, and  pPIN1:PIN1-GFP reporter lines indicated normal auxin biosynthesis but altered  polar auxin transport. The expression of pSHR:SHR-GFP and pSCR:SCR-GFP confirmed  that procambium and ground tissue precursors were lacking in emb2726 embryos. The  results suggest that EMB2726 plays a critical role during Arabidopsis  embryogenesis by affecting chloroplast development, possibly by affecting the  translation process in plastids.', '2021', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2021.675838', 'Sun']
