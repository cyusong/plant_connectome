Cotton is one of the most economically important crops worldwide. Seed size is a vital trait for plants connected with yield and germination. <i>GW2</i> encodes a RING_Ubox E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls seed development by affecting cell growth. Here, are few reports on <i>GW2</i>-like genes in cotton, and the function of <i>GW2</i> in cotton is poorly understood. In the present study, a genome-wide analysis identified 6 and 3 <i>GW2-</i>like genes in each of the two cultivated tetraploids (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> and <i>G. barbadense</i>) and each of their diploid ancestral species (<i>G. arboreum</i>, <i>G. raimondii</i>), respectively. <i>GhGW2-2D</i> has the same functional domain and high sequence similarity with <i>AtDA2</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Overexpression of <i>GhGW2-2D</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> significantly reduced seed and seedling size, suggesting <i>GhGW2-2D</i> is a potential target for regulating cotton seed size. These results provided information on the genetic and molecular basis of <i>GW2</i>-like genes in cotton, thus establishing a foundation for functional studies of cotton seeds.
