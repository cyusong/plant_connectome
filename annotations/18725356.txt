['18725356', 'Genetic evidence suggests that indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is converted to the  active auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by removal of two side-chain methylene  units in a process similar to fatty acid beta-oxidation. Previous studies  implicate peroxisomes as the site of IBA metabolism, although the enzymes that  act in this process are still being identified. Here, we describe two  IBA-response mutants, ibr1 and ibr10. Like the previously described ibr3 mutant,  which disrupts a putative peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase/dehydrogenase, ibr1 and  ibr10 display normal IAA responses and defective IBA responses. These defects  include reduced root elongation inhibition, decreased lateral root initiation,  and reduced IBA-responsive gene expression. However, peroxisomal  energy-generating pathways necessary during early seedling development are  unaffected in the mutants. Positional cloning of the genes responsible for the  mutant defects reveals that IBR1 encodes a member of the short-chain  dehydrogenase/reductase family and that IBR10 resembles enoyl-CoA  hydratases/isomerases. Both enzymes contain C-terminal peroxisomal-targeting  signals, consistent with IBA metabolism occurring in peroxisomes. We present a  model in which IBR3, IBR10, and IBR1 may act sequentially in peroxisomal IBA  beta-oxidation to IAA.', '2008 Sep', 'Genetics', '10.1534/genetics.108.090399', 'Bartel']
