Cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinases (CRKs) are transmembrane proteins containing two domains of unknown function 26 (DUF26) RLKs in their ectodomain. Despite that CRKs control important aspects of plant development, only few proteins have functionally been characterized. In this work, we analyzed the function of CRK33 by characterizing two insertional lines. The stomatal density and stomatal index were decreased in <i>crk33-2</i> and <i>crk33-3</i> plants in comparison to wild-type plants, correlating with a decreased transpiration in transgenic plants and a higher drought tolerance. Furthermore, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance changed. Finally, all four stomata cell fate genes were upregulated, especially the expression of <i>TMM</i> and <i>SPCH</i> in the mutant background, suggesting a role for CRK33 in stomatal spacing.
