The formation of leaf color largely depends on the components of pigment accumulation in plastids, which are involved in chloroplast development and division. Here, we isolated and characterized the rice <i>albino leaf 4</i> (<i>al4</i>) mutant, which exhibited an albino phenotype and eventually died at the three-leaf stage. The chloroplasts in <i>al4</i> mutant were severely damaged and unable to form intact thylakoid structure. Further analysis revealed that the candidate gene encodes 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE), which participates in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that the mutation at the exon-intron junction site cause alternative splicing factors fail to distinguish the origin of the GT-AG intron, leading to exon skipping and producing a truncated <i>OsIspE</i> in the <i>al4</i> mutant. Notably, disruption of <i>OsIspE</i> led to the reduced expression of chloroplast-associated genes, including chloroplast biosynthetic and translation related genes and photosynthetic associated nuclear genes (PhANGs). In summary, these findings reveal that <i>OsIspE</i> plays a crucial role in chloroplast biogenesis and provides novel insights into the function of CMK during chloroplast development in rice.
