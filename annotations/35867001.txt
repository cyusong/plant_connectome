Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental and highly orchestrated process that involves hundreds of ribosome biogenesis factors. Despite advances that have been made in yeast, the molecular mechanism of ribosome biogenesis remains largely unknown in plants. We uncovered a WD40 protein, Shrunken and Embryo Defective Kernel 1 (SHREK1), and showed that it plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and kernel development in maize (Zea mays). The shrek1 mutant shows an aborted embryo and underdeveloped endosperm and embryo-lethal in maize. SHREK1 localizes mainly to the nucleolus and accumulates to high levels in the seed. Depleting SHREK1 perturbs pre-rRNA processing and causes imbalanced profiles of mature rRNA and ribosome. The expression pattern of ribosomal-related genes is significantly altered in shrek1. Like its yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ortholog Periodic tryptophan protein 1 (PWP1), SHREK1 physically interacts with ribosomal protein ZmRPL7a, a transient component of the PWP1-subcomplex involved in pre-rRNA processing in yeast. Additionally, SHREK1 may assist in the A3 cleavage of the pre-rRNA in maize by interacting with the nucleolar protein ZmPOP4, a maize homolog of the yeast RNase mitochondrial RNA-processing complex subunit. Overall, our work demonstrates a vital role of SHREK1 in pre-60S ribosome maturation, and reveals that impaired ribosome function accounts for the embryo lethality in shrek1.
