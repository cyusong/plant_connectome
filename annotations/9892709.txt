['9892709', 'The genetic basis for susceptibility or nonsusceptibility of plants to viruses is  understood poorly. Two selectable tobacco etch virus (TEV) strains were developed  for identification of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with either  gain-of-susceptibility or loss-of-susceptibility phenotypes. These strains  conferred a conditional-survival phenotype to Arabidopsis based on systemic  expression of herbicide resistance or proherbicide sensitivity genes, thereby  facilitating mass selections and screens for Arabidopsis mutants that enhance or  suppress TEV replication, cell-to-cell movement, or long-distance movement. A  multicomponent mechanism that restricts systemic invasion of TEV was identified  through isolation of gain-of-susceptibility mutants with alterations at two loci.', '1999 Jan 19', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.96.2.772', 'Carrington']
