Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are well known signaling molecules in plant signal transduction pathways including the response to abiotic stress. Particular stimuli cause specific transient elevations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) with a stimulus-dependent amplitude and temporal pattern. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, known as Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures, rely on the counteractive activities of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting proteins. Whereas the channels causing an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> were partly identified, direct evidence for the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting proteins in the determination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures was missing. We recently reported on the functional characterization of a stress-responsive P<sub>IIB</sub>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (PCA1) from the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. This study revealed an essential role of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump in the adjustment of salt stress tolerance. Most strikingly, the generation of a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signature in response to salt was abolished in Physcomitrella mutant lines lacking PCA1 activity. Thus, we can provide a direct link for the function of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase in the generation of a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signature in plants.
