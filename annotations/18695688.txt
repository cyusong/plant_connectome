['18695688', 'Formation of somatic embryos from non-germline cells is unique to higher plants  and can be manipulated in a variety of species. Previous studies revealed that  overexpression of several Arabidopsis genes, including WUSCHEL (WUS)/PLANT GROWTH  ACTIVATOR6 (PGA6), BABY BOOM, LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), and LEC2, is able to cause  vegetative-to-embryonic transition or the formation of somatic embryos. Here, we  report that a gain-of-function mutation in the Arabidopsis PGA37 gene, encoding  the MYB118 transcription factor, induced vegetative-to-embryonic transition, the  formation of somatic embryos from root explants, and an elevated LEC1 expression  level. Double mutant analysis showed that WUS was not required for induction of  somatic embryos by PGA37/MYB118. In addition, overexpression of MYB115, a homolog  of PGA37/MYB118, caused a pga37-like phenotype. A myb118 myb115 double mutant did  not show apparent developmental abnormalities. Collectively, these results  suggest that PGA37/MYB118 and MYB115 promote vegetative-to-embryonic transition,  through a signaling pathway independent of WUS.', '2009 Feb', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2008.276', 'Zuo']
