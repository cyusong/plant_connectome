['14508008', 'In yeast and animals, the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is an  essential ubiquitin protein ligase that regulates mitotic progression and exit by  controlling the stability of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as securin and  the mitotic cyclins. In plants, the function, regulation, and substrates of the  APC/C are poorly understood. To gain more insight into the roles of the plant  APC/C, we characterized at the molecular level one of its subunits, APC2, which  is encoded by a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis. We show that the Arabidopsis  gene is able to partially complement a budding yeast apc2 ts mutant. By yeast  two-hybrid assays, we demonstrate an interaction of APC2 with two other APC/C  subunits: APC11 and APC8/CDC23. A reverse-genetic approach identified Arabidopsis  plants carrying T-DNA insertions in the APC2 gene. apc2 null mutants are impaired  in female megagametogenesis and accumulate a cyclin-beta-glucuronidase reporter  protein but do not display metaphase arrest, as observed in other systems. The  APC2 gene is expressed in various plant organs and does not seem to be cell cycle  regulated. Finally, we report intriguing differences in APC2 protein subcellular  localization compared with that in other systems. Our observations support a  conserved function of the APC/C in plants but a different mode of regulation.', '2003 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.013847', 'Genschik']
