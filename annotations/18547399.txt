Endocytosis is an essential process by which the eukaryotic cell internalizes exogenous material. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have revealed that endocytosis is a complex molecular process depending on regulated interactions between a variety of proteins and lipids through specific modules. One such module is the Eps15 homology (EH) domain, a conserved modular protein-interaction domain found in several endocytic proteins. The EH-domain-containing proteins function as regulators of endocytosis through their ability to interact with other proteins involved in this process. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of two Arabidopsis EH-domain-containing proteins (AtEHD1 and AtEHD2). We show that the two proteins are involved in endocytosis in plant systems and demonstrate that the Arabidopsis EHD proteins function similarly to mammalian EHDs. Similarly to hEHD2, over-expression of AtEHD2 has an inhibitory effect on endocytosis. While transgenic plants over-expressing AtEHD1 had no detectable phenotype, downregulation of AtEHD1 caused retardation of entry of endocytosed material into plant cells.
