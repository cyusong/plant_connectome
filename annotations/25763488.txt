In this study we analyzed the relationship between malate valve capacities, N-assimilation, and energy metabolism. We used transgenic plants either lacking the chloroplast NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase or mutants with a decreased transcript level of the plastid-localized NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase. Plants were grown on nitrate or ammonium, respectively, as the sole N-source and transcripts were analyzed by qRT-PCR. We could show that the lack of malate valve capacities enhances N-assimilation and plastidial glycolysis by increasing transcript levels of Fd-GOGATs or NADH-GOGAT and plastidic NAD-GAPDHs (GapCps), respectively. Based on our results, we conclude that the lack of malate valve capacities is balanced by an increase of the activity of plastid-localized glycolysis in order to cover the high demand for plastidial ATP, stressing the importance of the plastids for energy metabolism in plant cells.
