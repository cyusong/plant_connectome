General transcription factor IID (TFIID) is a multisubunit protein complex involved in promoter recognition and is fundamental to the nucleation of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional preinitiation complex. TFIID is comprised of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and 12-15 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). While general transcription factors have been extensively studied in metazoans and yeast, little is known about the details of their structure and function in the plant kingdom. This work represents the first attempt to compare the structure of a plant TFIID complex with that determined for other organisms. While no TAF3 homolog has been observed in plants, at least one homolog has been identified for each of the remaining 14 TFIID subunits, including both TAF14 and TAF15 which have previously been shown to be unique to either yeast or humans. The presence of both TAFs 14 and 15 in plants suggests ancient roles for these proteins that were lost in metazoans and fungi, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays resulted in a total of 65 binary interactions between putative subunits of Arabidopsis TFIID, including 26 contacts unique to plants. The interaction matrix of Arabidopsis TAFs is largely consistent with the three-lobed topological map for yeast TFIID, which suggests that the structure and composition of TFIID have been highly conserved among eukaryotes.
