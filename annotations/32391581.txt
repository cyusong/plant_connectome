['32391581', 'HYDROXYPROLINE O-ARABINOSYLTRANSFERASEs (HPATs) initiate a post-translational  protein modification (Hyp-Ara) found abundantly on cell wall structural proteins.  In Arabidopsis thaliana, HPAT1 and HPAT3 are redundantly required for full pollen  fertility. In addition to the lack of Hyp-Ara in hpat1/3 pollen tubes (PTs), we  also found broadly disrupted cell wall polymer distributions, particularly the  conversion of the tip cell wall to a more shaft-like state. Mutant PTs were slow  growing and prone to rupture and morphological irregularities. In a forward  mutagenesis screen for suppressors of the hpat1/3 low seed-set phenotype, we  identified a missense mutation in exo70a2, a predicted member of the  vesicle-tethering exocyst complex. The suppressed pollen had increased fertility,  fewer morphological defects and partially rescued cell wall organization. A  transcriptional null allele of exo70a2 also suppressed the hpat1/3 fertility  phenotype, as did mutants of core exocyst complex member sec15a, indicating that  reduced exocyst function bypassed the PT requirement for Hyp-Ara. In a wild-type  background, exo70a2 reduced male transmission efficiency, lowered pollen  germination frequency and slowed PT elongation. EXO70A2 also localized to the PT  tip plasma membrane, consistent with a role in exocyst-mediated secretion. To  monitor the trafficking of Hyp-Ara modified proteins, we generated an  HPAT-targeted fluorescent secretion reporter. Reporter secretion was partially  dependent on EXO70A2 and was significantly increased in hpat1/3 PTs compared with  the wild type, but was reduced in the suppressed exo70a2 hpat1/3 tubes.', '2020 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14808', 'ORCID:']
