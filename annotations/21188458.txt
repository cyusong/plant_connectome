['21188458', 'The CCCH-type zinc finger proteins are a superfamily containing tandem  zinc-binding motifs involved in many aspects of plant growth and development.  However, the precise role of these proteins involved in plant stress tolerance is  poorly understood. This study was to examine the regulatory and functional role  of the CCCH-type zinc finger protein, AtOZF1 (At2g19810), under oxidative stress.  Interestingly, the AtOZF1 protein was localized in the plasma membrane. The  AtOZF1 transcripts were highly induced by treatment with hydrogen peroxide,  abscisic acid and salinity. The AtOZF1-overexpressing plants were relatively  resistant to oxidative stress than wild-type and T-DNA insertion mutant atozf1.  Malondialdehyde, a decomposition product of lipid peroxidation, accumulated in  atozf1 mutants more than in wild-type and AtOZF1-overexpressing plants.  Furthermore, atozf1 mutants displayed lower activities of catalase and guaiacol  peroxidase, higher chlorosis, and down-regulated expression of antioxidant genes  under oxidative stress. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that  AtOZF1 is required for the tolerance of Arabidopsis to oxidative stress.', '2011 Nov', 'J Plant Res', '10.1007/s10265-010-0397-3', 'Kim']
