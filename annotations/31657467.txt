['31657467', 'Group 1 Remorins (REMs) are extensively involved in virus trafficking through  plasmodesmata (PD). However, their roles in Potyvirus cell-to-cell movement are  not known. The plasma membrane (PM)-associated Ca(2+) binding protein 1 (PCaP1)  interacts with the P3N-PIPO of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and is required for  TuMV cell-to-cell movement, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The  mutant plants with overexpression or knockout of REM1.2 were used to investigate  its role in TuMV cell-to-cell movement. Arabidopsis thaliana complementary  mutants of pcap1 were used to investigate the role of PCaP1 in TuMV cell-to-cell  movement. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation,  co-immunoprecipitation and RT-qPCR assays were employed to investigate the  underlying molecular mechanism. The results show that TuMV-P3N-PIPO recruits  PCaP1 to PD and the actin filament-severing activity of PCaP1 is required for  TuMV intercellular movement. REM1.2 negatively regulates the cell-to-cell  movement of TuMV via competition with PCaP1 for binding actin filaments. As a  counteractive response, TuMV mediates REM1.2 degradation via both 26S  ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways through the interaction of VPg with  REM1.2 to establish systemic infection in Arabidopsis. This work unveils the  actin cytoskeleton and PM nanodomain-associated molecular events underlying the  cell-to-cell movement of potyviruses.', '2020 Mar', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.16285', 'ORCID:']
