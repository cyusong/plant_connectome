Crenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata) is a root parasitic weed that represents a major constraint for grain legume production in Mediterranean and West Asian countries. Medicago truncatula has emerged as an important model plant species for structural and functional genomics. The close phylogenic relationship of M. truncatula with crop legumes increases its value as a resource for understanding resistance against Orobanche spp. Different cytological methods were used to study the mechanisms of resistance against crenate broomrape of two accessions of M. truncatula, showing early and late acting resistance. In the early resistance accession (SA27774) we found that the parasite died before a tubercle had formed. In the late resistance accession (SA4327) the parasite became attached without apparent problems to the host roots but most of the established tubercles turned dark and died before emergence. The results suggest that there are defensive mechanisms acting in both accessions but with a time gap that is crucial for a higher success avoiding parasite infection.
