BMAA is a cycad-derived glutamate receptor agonist that causes a two- to three-fold increase in hypocotyl elongation on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the light. To probe the role of plant glutamate receptors and their downstream mediators, we utilized a previously described genetic screen to identify a novel, BMAA insensitive morphology (bim) mutant, bim409. The normal BMAA-induced hypocotyl elongation response observed on wild-type seedlings grown in the light is impaired in the bim409 mutant. This BMAA-induced phenotype is light-specific, as the bim409 mutant exhibits normal hypocotyl elongation in etiolated (dark grown) plants (+ or - BMAA). The mutation in bim409 was identified to be in a gene encoding the Proteosomal Regulatory Particle AAA-ATPase-3 (RPT3). Possible roles of the proteosome in Glu-mediated signaling in plants is discussed.
