['31118221', 'Mitochondrial and plastid biogenesis requires the biosynthesis and assembly of  proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the  mitochondrial outer membrane protein DGD1 SUPPRESSOR1 (DGS1) is part of a large  multi-subunit protein complex that contains the mitochondrial contact site and  cristae organizing system 60-kD subunit, the translocase of outer mitochondrial  membrane 40-kD subunit (TOM40), the TOM20s, and the Rieske FeS protein. A point  mutation in DGS1, dgs1-1, altered the stability and protease accessibility of  this complex. This altered mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial size, lipid  content and composition, protein import, and respiratory capacity. Whole plant  physiology was affected in the dgs1-1 mutant as evidenced by tolerance to imposed  drought stress and altered transcriptional responses of markers of mitochondrial  retrograde signaling. Putative orthologs of Arabidopsis DGS1 are conserved in  eukaryotes, including the Nuclear Control of ATP Synthase2 (NCA2) protein in  yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but lost in Metazoa. The genes encoding DGS1  and NCA2 are part of a similar coexpression network including genes encoding  proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, morphology, and lipid homeostasis.  Thus, DGS1 links mitochondrial protein and lipid import with cellular lipid  homeostasis and whole plant stress responses.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00885', 'ORCID:']
