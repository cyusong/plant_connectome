['19297586', 'Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) siliques synthesize high levels of benzoic  acid (BA), which is incorporated into several glucosinolate compounds. The origin  of BA in the siliques has not yet been determined. Here, we show that siliques  have higher levels of benzaldehyde (BD)-oxidizing activity relative to leaves.  The BD-oxidizing activity was purified from siliques in several chromatographic  steps, and a 145-kD protein was identified as the enzyme most likely to possess  this activity. The protein was trypsinized, and the sequence of the resulting  peptides was determined by mass spectrometry, identifying it as the product of  gene At1g04580, also designated as AAO4 (for ARABIDOPSIS ALDEHYDE OXIDASE4). AAO4  had previously been shown to be highly and specifically expressed in developing  seeds, and its protein was shown to belong to a family of aldehyde oxidases.  Here, we show that the AAO4 protein is an aldehyde oxidase that can use several  substrates but that, among the substrates tested, has the lowest K(m) value (23  microm) with BD. AAO4 is able to oxidize BD without NAD(+), but its activity  increases by 50% when this cofactor is added. The pH optimum of AAO4 is 7.0.  Plants homozygous for a null allele in AAO4 showed a reduction of 30% to 45% in  the total levels of BA in seeds as well as 7% to 9% and 32% to 38% decreases in  the levels of 3-benzoyloxypropylglucosinolate and 4-benzoyloxybutylglucosinolate,  respectively. Expressing AAO4 in Escherichia coli resulted in a 3-fold increase  of BD-oxidizing activity in crude bacterial extracts over endogenous levels.  These findings indicate that in Arabidopsis seeds, oxidation of BD contributes in  part to the synthesis of BA.', '2009 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.135848', 'Pichersky']
