VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) induction by vernalization is one of the earliest events in the vernalization response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, the mechanism responsible for vernalization-mediated VIN3 induction is poorly understood. Here, we show that the constitutive repression of VIN3 in the absence of the cold is due to multiple repressive components, including a transposable element-derived sequence, LIKE-HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 and POLYCOMB REPRESSION COMPLEX2. Furthermore, the full extent of VIN3 induction by vernalization requires activating complex components, including EARLY FLOWERING7 and EARLY FLOWERING IN SHORT DAYS. In addition, we observed dynamic changes in the histone modifications present at VIN3 chromatin during the course of vernalization. Our results show that the induction of VIN3 includes dynamic changes at the level of chromatin triggered by long-term cold exposure.
