In chloroplasts, thiol-dependent redox regulation is linked to light since the disulfide reductase activity of thioredoxins (Trxs) relies on photo-reduced ferredoxin (Fdx). Furthermore, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase (NTR) with a joint Trx domain, termed NTRC. The activity of these two redox systems is integrated by the redox balance of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx), which is controlled by NTRC. However, NTRC was proposed to participate in redox regulation of additional targets, prompting inquiry into whether the function of NTRC depends on its capacity to maintain the redox balance of 2-Cys Prxs or by direct redox interaction with chloroplast enzymes. To answer this, we studied the functional relationship of NTRC and 2-Cys Prxs by a comparative analysis of the triple Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant, ntrc-2cpab, which lacks NTRC and 2-Cys Prxs, and the double mutant 2cpab, which lacks 2-Cys Prxs. These mutants exhibit almost indistinguishable phenotypes: in growth rate, photosynthesis performance, and redox regulation of chloroplast enzymes in response to light and darkness. These results suggest that the most relevant function of NTRC is in controlling the redox balance of 2-Cys Prxs. A comparative transcriptomics analysis confirmed the phenotypic similarity of the two mutants and suggested that the NTRC-2-Cys Prxs system participates in cytosolic protein quality control. We propose that NTRC and 2-Cys Prxs constitute a redox relay, exclusive to photosynthetic organisms that fine-tunes the redox state of chloroplast enzymes in response to light and affects transduction pathways towards the cytosol.
