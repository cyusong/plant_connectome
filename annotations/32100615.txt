The diel patterns of stem carbon dioxide efflux (<i>E</i><sub>s</sub>) were determined for cycads, monocots, and woody eudicot and gymnosperm tree species. Stem <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> at a height of 30-40 cm was measured every 2 h throughout 31-h campaigns. Our range of <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> was 1.5-4.0 µmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup> for cycads, 1.0-3.5 µmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup> for arborescent monocots, and 1.5-4.5 µmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup> for woody eudicot and gymnosperm trees species. Time of day did not influence <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> of cycads or monocots. In contrast, the woody stems of eudicots and gymnosperms exhibited diurnal <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> that was 36% to 40% greater than nocturnal <i>E</i><sub>s</sub>. The established literature based on <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> of woody tree species cannot be used to estimate habitat carbon cycles in habitats which contain cycad or monocot trees. Time of day must be included for accuracy of research on <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> of woody tree species. Failures to account for the spatiotemporal differences of <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> may explain some of the disparity in outcomes of published stem respiration studies.
