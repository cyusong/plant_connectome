The agriculture sector is vulnerable to various environmental stresses, which significantly affect plant growth, performance, and development. Abiotic stresses, such as salinity and drought, cause severe losses in crop productivity worldwide. Soil salinity is a major stress suppressing plant development through osmotic stress accompanied by ion toxicity, nutritional imbalance, and oxidative stress. Various defense mechanisms like osmolytes accumulations, activation of stress-induced genes, and transcription factors, production of plant growth hormones, accumulation of antioxidants, and redox defense system in plants are responsible for combating salt stress. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub> S) have emerged as novel bioactive gaseous signaling molecules that positively impact seed germination, homeostasis, plant metabolism, growth, and development, and are involved in several plant acclimation responses to impart stress tolerance in plants. NO and H<sub>2</sub> S trigger cell signaling by activating a cascade of biochemical events that result in plant tolerance to environmental stresses. NO- and H<sub>2</sub> S-mediated signaling networks, interactions, and crosstalks facilitate stress tolerance in plants. Research on the roles and mechanisms of NO and H<sub>2</sub> S as challengers of salinity is entering an exponential exploration era. The present review focuses on the current knowledge of the mechanisms of stress tolerance in plants and the role of NO and H<sub>2</sub> S in adaptive plant responses to salt stress and provides an overview of the signaling mechanisms and interplay of NO and H<sub>2</sub> S in the regulation of growth and development as well as modulation of defense responses in plants and their long term priming effects for imparting salinity tolerance in plants.
