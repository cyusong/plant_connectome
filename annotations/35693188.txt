Grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L., <i>Vvi</i>) on their roots are generally sensitive to salt-forming ions, particularly chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) when grown in saline environments. Grafting <i>V. vinifera</i> scions to Cl<sup>-</sup>-excluding hybrid rootstocks reduces the impact of salinity. Molecular components underlying Cl<sup>-</sup>-exclusion in <i>Vitis</i> species remain largely unknown, however, various anion channels and transporters represent good candidates for controlling this trait. Here, two nitrate/peptide transporter family (NPF) members <i>VviNPF2.1</i> and <i>VviNPF2.2</i> were isolated. Both highly homologous proteins localized to the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protoplasts. Both were expressed primarily in grapevine roots and leaves and were more abundant in a Cl<sup>-</sup>-excluding rootstock compared to a Cl<sup>-</sup>-includer. Quantitative PCR of grapevine roots revealed that <i>VviNPF2</i>.<i>1</i> and <i>2.2</i> expression was downregulated by high [NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>] resupply post-starvation, but not affected by 25 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>. VviNPF2.2 was functionally characterized using an Arabidopsis enhancer trap line as a heterologous host which enabled cell-type-specific expression. Constitutive expression of <i>VviNPF2.2</i> exclusively in the root epidermis and cortex reduced shoot [Cl<sup>-</sup>] after a 75 mM NaCl treatment. Higher expression levels of <i>VviNPF2.2</i> correlated with reduced Arabidopsis xylem sap [NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>] when not salt stressed. We propose that when expressed in the root epidermis and cortex, VviNPF2.2 could function in passive anion efflux from root cells, which reduces the symplasmic Cl<sup>-</sup> available for root-to-shoot translocation. VviNPF2.2, through its role in the root epidermis and cortex, could, therefore, be beneficial to plants under salt stress by reducing net shoot Cl<sup>-</sup> accumulation.
