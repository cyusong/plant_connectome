Potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) are mineral nutrients that are required in large quantities by plants. Both elements critically contribute to the process of photosynthesis and the subsequent long-distance transport of photoassimilates. If K or Mg is not present in sufficient quantities in photosynthetic tissues, complex interactions of anatomical, physiological and biochemical responses result in a reduction of photosynthetic carbon assimilation. As a consequence, excessive production of reactive oxygen species causes photo-oxidation of the photosynthetic apparatus and causes an up-regulation of photoprotective mechanisms. In this article, we review the functioning of K and Mg in processes directly or indirectly associated with photosynthesis. Focus is given to chloroplast ultrastructure, light-dependent and -independent reactions of photosynthesis and the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub>  - a major substrate for photosynthesis - into chloroplasts. We further emphasize their contribution to phloem-loading and long-distance transport of photoassimilates and to the photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus.
