In this study, a gene with a full-length cDNA of 1422 bp encoding 473 amino acids, designated <i>RrGT2</i>, was isolated from R. rugosa 'Zizhi' and then functionally characterized. RrGT2 transcripts were detected in various tissues and were proved that their expression patterns corresponded with anthocyanins accumulation. Functional verification of <i>RrGT2</i> in R. rugosa was performed via VIGS. When <i>RrGT2</i> was silenced, the Rosa plants displayed a pale petal color phenotype. The detection results showed that the expression of <i>RrGT2</i> was significantly downregulated, which was consistent with the decrease of all anthocyanins; while the expression of six key upstream structural genes was normal. Additionally, the in vivo function of RrGT2 was investigated via its overexpression in tobacco. In transgenic tobacco plants expressing RrGT2, anthocyanin accumulation was induced in the flowers, indicating that RrGT2 could encode a functional GT protein for anthocyanin biosynthesis and could function in other species. The application of VIGS in transgenic tobacco resulted in the treated tobacco plants presenting flowers whose phenotypes were lighter in color than those of normal plants. These results also validated and affirmed previous conclusions. Therefore, we speculated that glycosylation of <i>RrGT2</i> plays a crucial role in anthocyanin biosynthesis in R. rugosa.
