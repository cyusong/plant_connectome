Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient, and its deficiency can cause plants to undergo metabolic changes at several levels of organization. It has been shown that leaf age can play a role in nutrient partitioning along the shoot axis of poplar. In this study, we investigated the effect of Cu deficiency on the altered partitioning of essential macro and micronutrients in leaves and stems of different age. Cu deficiency was associated with higher concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, zinc, manganese, and molybdenum in leaves and relatively higher concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc in stems. Leaf and stem age had significant effects on nutrient partitioning. Principal component analyses revealed patterns that point to inverse influences in leaves and stems on nutrient partitioning. Specifically, these analyses revealed that nutrient partitioning in leaves was influenced by Cu feeding status more than developmental stage, whereas nutrient partitioning in stems was influenced by developmental stage more than Cu feeding status. These results suggest that Cu deficiency and developmental stage can significantly influence the partitioning and homeostasis of macro and micronutrients in poplar organs.
