['23370715', '9-Lipoxygenases (9-LOXs) initiate fatty acid oxygenation, resulting in the  formation of oxylipins activating plant defense against hemibiotrophic pathogenic  bacteria. Previous studies using nonresponding to oxylipins (noxy), a series of  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants insensitive to the 9-LOX product  9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid (9-HOT), have demonstrated the  importance of cell wall modifications as a component of 9-LOX-induced defense.  Here, we show that a majority (71%) of 41 studied noxy mutants have an added  insensitivity to isoxaben, an herbicide inhibiting cellulose synthesis and  altering the cell wall. The specific mutants noxy2, noxy15, and noxy38,  insensitive to both 9-HOT and isoxaben, displayed enhanced susceptibility to  Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 as well as reduced activation of salicylic  acid-responding genes. Map-based cloning identified the mutation in noxy2 as  At5g11630 encoding an uncharacterized mitochondrial protein, designated NOXY2.  Moreover, noxy15 and noxy38 were mapped at the DYNAMIN RELATED PROTEIN3A and  FRIENDLY MITOCHONDRIA loci, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy and molecular  analyses revealed that the three noxy mutants characterized exhibit mitochondrial  dysfunction and that 9-HOT added to wild-type Arabidopsis causes mitochondrial  aggregation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The results suggest  that the defensive responses and cell wall modifications caused by 9-HOT are  under mitochondrial retrograde control and that mitochondria play a fundamental  role in innate immunity signaling.', '2013 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.207514', 'Castresana']
