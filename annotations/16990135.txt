['16990135', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone critical for plant growth, development, and  adaptation to various stress conditions. Plants have to adjust ABA levels  constantly to respond to changing physiological and environmental conditions. To  date, the mechanisms for fine-tuning ABA levels remain elusive. Here we report  that AtBG1, a beta-glucosidase, hydrolyzes glucose-conjugated, biologically  inactive ABA to produce active ABA. Loss of AtBG1 causes defective stomatal  movement, early germination, abiotic stress-sensitive phenotypes, and lower ABA  levels, whereas plants with ectopic AtBG1 accumulate higher ABA levels and  display enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress. Dehydration rapidly induces  polymerization of AtBG1, resulting in a 4-fold increase in enzymatic activity.  Furthermore, diurnal increases in ABA levels are attributable to  polymerization-mediated AtBG1 activation. We propose that the activation of  inactive ABA pools by polymerized AtBG1 is a mechanism by which plants rapidly  adjust ABA levels and respond to changing environmental cues.', '2006 Sep 22', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.034', 'Hwang']
