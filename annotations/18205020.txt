We describe here the isolation and characterization of OsiSAP8, a member of stress Associated protein (SAP) gene family from rice characterized by the presence of A20 and AN1 type Zinc finger domains. OsiSAP8 is a multiple stress inducible gene, induced by various stresses, namely heat, cold, salt, desiccation, submergence, wounding, heavy metals as well as stress hormone Abscisic acid. OsiSAP8 protein fused to GFP was localized towards the periphery of the cells in the epidermal cells of infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Yeast two hybrid analysis revealed that A20 and AN1 type zinc-finger domains of OsiSAP8 interact with each other. Overexpression of the gene in both transgenic tobacco and rice conferred tolerance to salt, drought and cold stress at seed germination/seedling stage as reflected by percentage of germination and gain in fresh weight after stress recovery. Transgenic rice plants were tolerant to salt and drought during anthesis stage without any yield penalty as compared to unstressed transgenic plants.
