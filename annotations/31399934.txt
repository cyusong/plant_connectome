Combining genetic engineering of MPK4 activity and quantitative proteomics, we established an in planta system that enables rapid study of MPK4 signaling networks and potential substrate proteins. Mitogen activated protein kinase 4 (MPK4) is a multifunctional kinase that regulates various signaling events in plant defense, growth, light response and cytokinesis. The question of how a single protein modulates many distinct processes has spurred extensive research into the physiological outcomes resulting from genetic perturbation of MPK4. However, the mechanism by which MPK4 functions is still poorly understood due to limited data on the MPK4 networks including substrate proteins and downstream pathways. Here we introduce an experimental system that combines genetic engineering of kinase activity and quantitative proteomics to rapidly study the signaling networks of MPK4. First, we transiently expressed a constitutively active (MPK4<sup>CA</sup>) and an inactive (MPK4<sup>IN</sup>) version of a Brassica napus MPK4 (BnMPK4) in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Proteomics analysis revealed that BnMPK4 activation affects multiple pathways (e.g., metabolism, redox regulation, jasmonic acid biosynthesis and stress responses). Furthermore, BnMPK4 activation also increased protein phosphorylation in the phosphoproteome, from which putative MPK4 substrates were identified. Using protein kinase assay, we validated that a transcription factor TCP8-like (TCP8) and a PP2A regulatory subunit TAP46-like (TAP46) were indeed phosphorylated by BnMPK4. Taken together, we demonstrated the utility of proteomics and phosphoproteomics in elucidating kinase signaling networks and in identification of downstream substrates.
