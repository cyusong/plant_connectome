Kinetochore, a protein super-complex on the centromere of chromosomes, mediates chromosome segregation during cell division by providing attachment sites for spindle microtubules. The NDC80 complex, composed of four proteins, NDC80, NUF2, SPC24 and SPC25, is localized at the outer kinetochore and connects spindle fibers to the kinetochore. Although it is conserved across species, functional studies of this complex are rare in Arabidopsis. Here, we characterize a recessive mutant, meristem unstructured-1 (mun-1), exhibiting an abnormal phenotype with unstructured shoot apical meristem caused by ectopic expression of the WUSCHEL gene in unexpected tissues. mun-1 is a weak allele because of the insertion of T-DNA in the promoter region of the SPC24 homolog. The mutant exhibits stunted growth, embryo arrest, DNA aneuploidy, and defects in chromosome segregation with a low cell division rate. Null mutants of MUN from TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis showed zygotic embryonic lethality similar to nuf2-1; however, the null mutations were fully transmissible via pollen and ovules. Interactions among the components of the NDC80 complex were confirmed in a yeast two-hybrid assay and in planta co-immunoprecipitation. MUN is co-localized at the centromere with HTR12/CENH3, which is a centromere-specific histone variant, but MUN is not required to recruit HTR12/CENH3 to the kinetochore. Our results support that MUN is a functional homolog of SPC24 in Arabidopsis, which is required for proper cell division. In addition, we report the ectopic generations of stem cell niches by the malfunction of kinetochore components.
