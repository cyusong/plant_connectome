Evidence suggests that anthropogenically-mediated global warming results in accelerated flowering for many plant populations. However, the fact that some plants are late flowering or unaffected by warming, underscores the complex relationship between phase change, temperature, and phylogeny. In this review, we present an emerging picture of how plants sense temperature changes, and then discuss the independent recruitment of ancient flowering pathway genes for the evolution of ambient, low, and high temperature-regulated reproductive development. As well as revealing areas of research required for a better understanding of how past thermal climates have shaped global patterns of plasticity in plant phase change, we consider the implications for these phenological thermal responses in light of climate change.
