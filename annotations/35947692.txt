Efficient solar energy conversion is ensured by the organization, physical association, and physiological coordination of various protein complexes in photosynthetic membranes. Here, we visualize the native architecture and interactions of photosynthetic complexes within the thylakoid membranes from a fast-growing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 (Syn2973) using high-resolution atomic force microscopy. In the Syn2973 thylakoid membranes, both photosystem I (PSI)-enriched domains and crystalline photosystem II (PSII) dimer arrays were observed, providing favorable membrane environments for photosynthetic electron transport. The high light (HL)-adapted thylakoid membranes accommodated a large amount of PSI complexes, without the incorporation of iron-stress-induced protein A (IsiA) assemblies and formation of IsiA-PSI supercomplexes. In the iron deficiency (Fe-)-treated thylakoid membranes, in contrast, IsiA proteins densely associated with PSI, forming the IsiA-PSI supercomplexes with varying assembly structures. Moreover, type-I NADH dehydrogenase-like complexes (NDH-1) were upregulated under the HL and Fe- conditions and established close association with PSI complexes to facilitate cyclic electron transport. Our study provides insight into the structural heterogeneity and plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus in the context of their native membranes in Syn2973 under environmental stress. Advanced understanding of the photosynthetic membrane organization and adaptation will provide a framework for uncovering the molecular mechanisms of efficient light harvesting and energy conversion.
