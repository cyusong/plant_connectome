A pathogenesis related protein (AhPR10) is identified from a clone of 6-day old Arachis hypogaea L. (peanut) cDNA library. The clone expressed as a approximately 20 kDa protein in E. coli. Nucleotide sequence derived amino acid sequence of the coding region shows its homology with PR10 proteins having Betv1 domain and P loop motif. Recombinant AhPR10 has ribonuclease activity, and antifungal activity against the peanut pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani. Mutant protein AhPR10-K54N where lys54 is mutated to asn54 loses its ribonuclease and antifungal activities. FITC labeled AhPR10 and AhPR10-K54N are internalized by hyphae of F. oxysporum and R. solani but the later protein does not inhibit the fungal growth. This suggests that the ribonuclease function of AhPR10 is essential for its antifungal activity. Energy and temperature dependent internalization of AhPR10 into sensitive fungal hyphae indicate that internalization of the protein occurs through active uptake.
