SNF1-related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s) regulate the plant responses to abiotic stresses, especially water deficits. They are activated in plants subjected to osmotic stress, and some of them are additionally activated in response to enhanced concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA) in plant cells. The SnRK2s that are activated in response to ABA are key elements of ABA signalling that regulate plant acclimation to environmental stresses and ABA-dependent development. Much less is known about the SnRK2s that are not activated by ABA, albeit several studies have shown that these kinases are also involved in response to osmotic stress. Here, we show that one of the Arabidopsis thaliana ABA-non-activated SnRK2s, SnRK2.10, regulates not only the response to salinity but also the plant sensitivity to dehydration. Several potential SnRK2.10 targets phosphorylated in response to stress were identified by a phosphoproteomic approach, including the dehydrins ERD10 and ERD14. Their phosphorylation by SnRK2.10 was confirmed in vitro. Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of ERD14 within the S-segment is involved in the regulation of dehydrin subcellular localization in response to stress.
