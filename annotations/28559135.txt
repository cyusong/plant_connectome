['28559135', 'As the major resource of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the NADPH oxidases  (Rbohs) have been shown to play important roles in plant cells under normal  growth and stress conditions. Although many family members of Rbohs were studied,  little is known about the function of RbohI in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we  report that exogenous ABA application decreases RbohI expression and mannitol  significantly increases RbohI expression at transcript level. The RbohI  transcripts were strongly detected in dry seeds and roots. The loss-of-function  mutant rbohI exhibited sensitivity to ABA and mannitol stress during germination.  Furthermore, the lateral root growth of rbohI was severely inhibited after  treatment with mannitol stress. Overexpression of RbohI in Arabidopsis  significantly improves the drought tolerance. Moreover, more H(2)O(2) accumulated  in RbohI overexpressors than in wild type plants in response to mannitol stress.  Our conclusion is that AtRbohI functions in drought-stress response in  Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2017 Sep 23', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.05.131', 'Zhang']
