Fruit set is an important yield-related parameter, which varies drastically due to genetic and environmental factors. Here, two commercial cultivars of Capsicum chinense (Biquinho and Habanero) were evaluated in response to light intensity (unshaded and shaded) and N supply (deficiency and sufficiency) to understand the role of source strength on fruit set at the metabolic level. We assessed the metabolic balance of primary metabolites in source leaves during the flowering period. Furthermore, we investigated the metabolic balance of the same metabolites in flowers to gain more insights into their influence on fruit set. Genotype and N supply had a strong effect on fruit set and the levels of primary metabolites, whereas light intensity had a moderate effect. Higher fruit set was mainly related to the export of both sucrose and amino acids from source leaves to flowers. Additionally, starch turnover in source leaves, but not in flowers, had a central role on the sucrose supply to sink organs at night. In flowers, our results not only confirmed the role of the daily supply of carbohydrates on fruit set but also indicated a potential role of the balance of amino acids and malate.
