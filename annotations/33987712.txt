A chitin-binding domain could contribute to the antifungal ability of chitinase through its affinity to the fungal lateral wall by hydrophobic interactions. Complementary DNA encoding the antifungal chitinase of gazyumaru (Ficus microcarpa), designated GlxChiB, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The results of cDNA cloning showed that the precursor of GlxChiB has an N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal and C-terminal vacuolar targeting signal, whereas mature GlxChiB is composed of an N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module family-18 domain (CBM18) and a C-terminal glycoside hydrolase family-19 domain (GH19) with a short linker. To clarify the role of the CBM18 domain in the antifungal activity of chitinase, the recombinant GlxChiB (wild type) and its catalytic domain (CatD) were used in quantitative antifungal assays under different ionic strengths and microscopic observations against the fungus Trichoderma viride. The antifungal activity of the wild type was stronger than that of CatD under all ionic strength conditions used in this assay; however, the antifungal activity of CatD became weaker with increasing ionic strength, whereas that of the wild type was maintained. The results at high ionic strength further verified the contribution of the CBM18 domain to the antifungal ability of GlxChiB. The microscopic observations clearly showed that the wild type acted on both the tips and the lateral wall of fungal hyphae, while CatD acted only on the tips. These results suggest that the CBM18 domain could contribute to the antifungal ability of chitinase through its affinity to the fungal lateral wall by hydrophobic interactions.
