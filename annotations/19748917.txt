['19748917', 'Relatively little is known about the small subset of peroxisomal proteins with  predicted protease activity. Here, we report that the peroxisomal LON2  (At5g47040) protease facilitates matrix protein import into Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) peroxisomes. We identified T-DNA insertion alleles  disrupted in five of the nine confirmed or predicted peroxisomal proteases and  found only two-lon2 and deg15, a mutant defective in the previously described  PTS2-processing protease (DEG15/At1g28320)-with phenotypes suggestive of  peroxisome metabolism defects. Both lon2 and deg15 mutants were mildly resistant  to the inhibitory effects of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on root elongation, but  only lon2 mutants were resistant to the stimulatory effects of IBA on lateral  root production or displayed Suc dependence during seedling growth. lon2 mutants  displayed defects in removing the type 2 peroxisome targeting signal (PTS2) from  peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase and reduced accumulation of 3-ketoacyl-CoA  thiolase, another PTS2-containing protein; both defects were not apparent upon  germination but appeared in 5- to 8-d-old seedlings. In lon2 cotyledon cells,  matrix proteins were localized to peroxisomes in 4-d-old seedlings but  mislocalized to the cytosol in 8-d-old seedlings. Moreover, a PTS2-GFP reporter  sorted to peroxisomes in lon2 root tip cells but was largely cytosolic in more  mature root cells. Our results indicate that LON2 is needed for sustained matrix  protein import into peroxisomes. The delayed onset of matrix protein sorting  defects may account for the relatively weak Suc dependence following germination,  moderate IBA-resistant primary root elongation, and severe defects in IBA-induced  lateral root formation observed in lon2 mutants.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.142505', 'Bartel']
