Pathogenic fungi from the genus Colletotrichum form invasive hyphae; the hyphae are surrounded by an extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM), which is continuous with the plant plasma membrane. Although the EIHM plays a crucial role as the interface between plant and fungal cells, its precise function during Colletotrichum infection remains elusive. Here, we show that enrichment of phosphoinositides (PIs) has a crucial role in Colletotrichum infection. We observed the localization of PIs in Arabidopsis thaliana cells infected by A. thaliana-adapted Colletotrichum higginsianum (Ch), and found that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] was extremely enriched in the EIHM during Ch infection. We also found that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-5 kinase (PIP5K), which catalyzes production of PI(4,5)P2, also accumulated at the EIHM. The overexpression of PIP5K3 in A. thaliana increased hyphal invasion by Ch. An exocytic factor, EXO84b, was targeted to the EIHM during Ch infection, although endocytic factors such as CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 2 and FLOTILLIN 1 did not. Intriguingly, the interfacial membranes between A. thaliana and powdery mildew- or downy mildew-causing pathogens did not accumulate PI(4,5)P2. These results suggest that Ch could modify the PI(4,5)P2 levels in the EIHM to increase the exocytic membrane/protein supply of the EIHM for successful infection. Our results also suggest that PI(4,5)P2 biosynthesis is a promising target for improved defense against Colletotrichum infection.
