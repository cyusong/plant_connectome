['20718953', 'BACKGROUND: The continuous polarized vesicle secretion in pollen tubes is  essential for tip growth but the location of endo- and exocytic sub-domains  remains however controversial. In this report we aimed to show that Arabidopsis  thaliana syntaxins are involved in this process and contribute to spatially  define exocytosis and membrane recycling. RESULTS: Using GFP-fusion constructs,  we imaged the distribution of pollen-specific (AtSYP124) and non-pollen syntaxins  (AtSYP121 and AtSYP122) in transiently transformed Nicotiana tabacum pollen  tubes. All three proteins associate with the plasma membrane and with apical  vesicles indicating a conserved action mechanism for all SYPs. However, the GFP  tagged SYP124 showed a specific distribution with a higher labelling at the  plasma membrane flanks, 10-25 mum behind the apex. This distribution is affected  by Ca2+ fluxes as revealed by treatment with Gd3+ (an inhibitor of extracellular  Ca2+ influx) and TMB-8 (an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release). Both  inhibitors decreased growth rate but the distribution of SYP124 at the plasma  membrane was more strongly affected by Gd3+. Competition with a related dominant  negative mutant affected the specific distribution of SYP124 but not tip growth.  In contrast, co-expression of the phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate 5-kinase 4  (PIP5K4) or of the small GTPase Rab11 perturbed polarity and the normal  distribution of GFP-SYP but did not inhibit the accumulation in vesicles or at  the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented suggest that in normal  growing pollen tubes, a net exocytic flow occurs in the flanks of the tube apex  mediated by SYP124. The specific distribution of SYP124 at the plasma membrane is  affected by changes in Ca2+ levels in agreement with the importance of this ion  for exocytosis. Apical growth and the specific localization of SYP124 were  affected by regulators of membrane secretion (Ca2+, PIP5K4 and Rab11) but  competition with a dominant negative mutant affected only SYP distribution. These  data thus suggest that syntaxins alone do not provide the level of specificity  that is required for apical growth and that additional signalling and functional  mechanisms are required.', '2010 Aug 18', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-10-179', 'Malho']
