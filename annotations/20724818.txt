Plants exposed to stress pass the memory of exposure to stress to the progeny. Previously, we showed that the phenomenon of transgenerational memory of stress is of epigenetic nature and depends on the function of Dicer-like (DCL) 2 and DCL3 proteins. Here, we discuss a possible role of DNA methylation and function of small RNAs in establishing and maintaining transgenerational responses to stress. Our new data report that memory of stress is passed to the progeny predominantly through the female rather than male gamete. Possible evolutionary advantages of this mechanism are also discussed.

DCL2: !affects! Transgenerational memory of stress
DCL3: !affects! Transgenerational memory of stress
DNA methylation: !maintains! Transgenerational responses to stress
small RNAs: !maintain! Transgenerational responses to stress
Female gamete: !passes! Memory of stress
