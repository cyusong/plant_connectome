Drought stress limits wheat production and threatens food security world-wide. While ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs) are known to regulate plant response to drought stress, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for a tolerant phenotype remain unclear. Here, we describe the positive regulatory role of TaERF87 in mediating wheat tolerance to drought stress. TaERF87 overexpression (OE) enhances drought tolerance, while silencing leads to drought sensitivity in wheat. RNA sequencing with biochemical assays revealed that TaERF87 activates the expression of the proline biosynthesis genes TaP5CS1 and TaP5CR1 via direct binding to GCC-box elements. Furthermore, proline accumulates to higher levels in TaERF87- and TaP5CS1-OE lines than that in wild-type plants under well-watered and drought stress conditions concomitantly with enhanced drought tolerance in these transgenic lines. Moreover, the interaction between TaERF87 and the bHLH transcription factor TaAKS1 synergistically enhances TaP5CS1 and TaP5CR1 transcriptional activation. TaAKS1 OE also increases wheat drought tolerance by promoting proline accumulation. Additionally, our findings verified that TaERF87 and TaAKS1 are targets of abscisic acid-responsive element binding factor 2 (TaABF2). Together, our study elucidates the mechanisms underlying a positive response to drought stress mediated by the TaABF2-TaERF87/TaAKS1-TaP5CS1/TaP5CR1 module, and identifies candidate genes for the development of elite drought-tolerant wheat varieties.
