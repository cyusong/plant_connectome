The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of allelochemical stress on Lycopersicon esculentum growth. Our results showed that allelochemical stress caused by Sicyos deppei aqueous leachate inhibited root growth but not germination, and produced an imbalance in the oxidative status of cells in both ungerminated seeds and in primary roots. We observed changes in activity of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase, as well as in the levels of H(2)O(2) and O(2) (*-) in seeds at 12 and 24 h, and in primary roots at 48 and 72 h of treatment, which could account for the oxidative imbalance. There were changes in levels of expression of the mentioned enzymes, but without a correlation with their respective activities. Higher levels of membrane lipid peroxidation were observed in primary roots at 48 and 72 h of treatment. No effect on the expression of metacaspase and the PR1 was observed as indicators of cell death or induction of plant defence. This paper contributes to the understanding of plant-plant interactions through the phytotoxic allelochemicals released in an aqueous leachate of the weed S. deppei, which cause a negative effect on other plants.
