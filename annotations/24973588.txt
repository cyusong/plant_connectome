The origin of the carbon atoms in CO2 respired by leaves in the dark of several plant species has been studied using 13C/12C stable isotopes. This study was conducted using an open gas exchange system for isotope labeling that was coupled to an elemental analyzer and further linked to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) or coupled to a gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-C-IRMS). We demonstrate here that the carbon, which is recently assimilated during photosynthesis, accounts for nearly ca. 50% of the carbon in the CO2 lost through dark respiration (Rd) after illumination in fast-growing and cultivated plants and trees and, accounts for only ca. 10% in slow-growing plants. Moreover, our study shows that fast-growing plants, which had the largest percentages of newly fixed carbon of leaf-respired CO2, were also those with the largest shoot/root ratios, whereas slow-growing plants showed the lowest shoot/root values.

Photosynthesis: !produces! Carbon

Fast-growing plants: !have! Largest shoot/root ratios
Slow-growing plants: !have! Lowest percentages of newly fixed carbon of leaf-respired CO2
Slow-growing plants: !have! Lowest shoot/root ratios
