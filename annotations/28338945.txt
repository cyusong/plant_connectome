Crop nutrient and especially nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is both an economically and an environmentally highly desirable trait. It has been estimated that only a third of nitrogen inputs to cereal crop worldwide are recovered in grain for consumption, resulting in a huge waste of resource with major negative impacts on the environment. Most measures of NUE in wheat and other cereals are based on field assessments of crop yields at given N inputs, performance responses to added N fertilizer, or by quantifying N fertilizer recovery rates. However, NUE is a complex trait comprising two key major components, N uptake and N utilization efficiency, both also complex traits in themselves, each involving many physiological processes and biochemical pathways. A deeper understanding of the processes involved in NUE has been a target of the UK Wheat Genetic Improvement Network project (http://www.wgin.org.uk/). This has enabled the breakdown of characteristics contributing to NUE and an assessment of the variation present in those characteristics, predominantly in modern cultivars; a total of 13 years of data have been obtained to date. Significant but limited variation suggests a requirement for broader germplasm screening such as older varieties, landraces, and wild relatives.
