Arabidopsis thaliana BOR1 is the first boron (B) transporter identified in the living systems. In the rice genome, there are four AtBOR1-like genes, OsBOR1, 2, 3 and 4. We have previously demonstrated that OsBOR4 is a B efflux transporter gene specifically expressed in rice pollen. OsBOR4 heterozygous lines showed abnormal segregation ratio, suggesting the significance of OsBOR4 in rice pollen tube germination/elongation process. To obtain further insights into the mechanisms underlying fertilization defects by osbor4 mutations, we examined if the mutant pollen exhibits morphological changes. The cross section of the pollen of the mutant was similar to those of the wild type. We also determined B concentrations in brown rice of three osbor4 mutants and found that B levels were comparable. These results suggest that osbor4 mutation does not affect B transport to pollen and seeds. We then examined if exogenous B supplementation can rescue segregation defect of osbor4. As reported previously, a OsBOR4 heterozygous lines showed abnormal segregation rate under the normal growth condition in this present study, too. Importantly, this abnormality in segregation was partially rescued by application of six-times higher B concentration to roots, providing further evidence that the fertilization defect of osbor4 is due to the defect in B transport process. Taken together we propose that osbor4 causes defect in B transport process during pollen germination to fertilization.
