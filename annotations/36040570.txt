Compatible interaction between rhizobial Nod factors and host receptors enables initial recognition and signaling events during legume-rhizobia symbiosis. Molecular communication is a new paradigm of information relay, which uses chemical signals or molecules as dialogues for communication and has been witnessed in prokaryotes, plants as well as in animal kingdom. Understanding this fascinating relay of signals between plants and rhizobia during the establishment of a synergistic relationship for biological nitrogen fixation represents one of the hotspots in plant biology research. Predominantly, their interaction is initiated by flavonoids exuding from plant roots, which provokes changes in the expression profile of rhizobial genes. Compatible interactions promote the secretion of Nod factors (NFs) from rhizobia, which are recognised by cognate host receptors. Perception of NFs by host receptors initiates the symbiosis and ultimately leads to the accommodation of rhizobia within root nodules via a series of mutual exchange of signals. This review elucidates the bacterial and plant perspectives during the early stages of symbiosis, explicitly emphasizing the significance of NFs and their cognate NF receptors.
