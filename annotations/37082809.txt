Plants exposed to mildly elevated temperatures display morphological and developmental changes collectively termed thermomorphogenesis. This adaptative process has several undesirable consequences to food production, including yield reduction and increased vulnerability to pathogens. Understanding thermomorphogenesis is, thus, critical for understanding how plants will respond to increasingly warmer temperature conditions, such as those caused by climate change. Recently, we have made major advances in that direction, and it has become apparent that plants resource to a broad range of molecules and molecular mechanisms to perceive and respond to increases in environmental temperature. However, most of our efforts have been focused on regulation of transcription and protein abundance and activity, with an important gap encompassing nearly all processes involving RNA (i.e., posttranscriptional regulation). Here, I summarized our current knowledge of thermomorphogenesis involving transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational regulation, focused on opportunities and challenges in understanding posttranscriptional regulation-a fertile field for exciting new discoveries.
