['26704385', 'Structure-specific endonucleases act to repair potentially toxic structures  produced by recombination and DNA replication, ensuring proper segregation of the  genetic material to daughter cells during mitosis and meiosis. Arabidopsis  thaliana has two putative homologs of the resolvase (structure-specific  endonuclease): GEN1/Yen1. Knockout of resolvase genes GEN1 and SEND1,  individually or together, has no detectable effect on growth, fertility, or  sensitivity to DNA damage. However, combined absence of the endonucleases MUS81  and SEND1 results in severe developmental defects, spontaneous cell death, and  genome instability. A similar effect is not seen in mus81 gen1 plants, which  develop normally and are fertile. Absence of RAD51 does not rescue mus81 send1,  pointing to roles of these proteins in DNA replication rather than DNA break  repair. The enrichment of S-phase histone gamma-H2AX foci and a striking loss of  telomeric DNA in mus81 send1 further support this interpretation. SEND1 has at  most a minor role in resolution of the Holliday junction but acts as an essential  backup to MUS81 for resolution of toxic replication structures to ensure genome  stability and to maintain telomere integrity.', '2016 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00898', 'ORCID:']
