Low concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> cause stomatal opening, whereas [CO<sub>2</sub> ] elevation leads to stomatal closure. Classical studies have suggested a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and protein phosphorylation in CO<sub>2</sub> -induced stomatal closing. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) and calcineurin-B-like proteins (CBLs) can sense and translate cytosolic elevation of the second messenger Ca<sup>2+</sup> into specific phosphorylation events. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> -binding proteins that function in the stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> response remain unknown. Time-resolved stomatal conductance measurements using intact plants, and guard cell patch-clamp experiments were performed. We isolated cpk quintuple mutants and analyzed stomatal movements in response to CO<sub>2</sub> , light and abscisic acid (ABA). Interestingly, we found that cpk3/5/6/11/23 quintuple mutant plants, but not other analyzed cpk quadruple/quintuple mutants, were defective in high CO<sub>2</sub> -induced stomatal closure and, unexpectedly, also in low CO<sub>2</sub> -induced stomatal opening. Furthermore, K<sup>+</sup> -uptake-channel activities were reduced in cpk3/5/6/11/23 quintuple mutants, in correlation with the stomatal opening phenotype. However, light-mediated stomatal opening remained unaffected, and ABA responses showed slowing in some experiments. By contrast, CO<sub>2</sub> -regulated stomatal movement kinetics were not clearly affected in plasma membrane-targeted cbl1/4/5/8/9 quintuple mutant plants. Our findings describe combinatorial cpk mutants that function in CO<sub>2</sub> control of stomatal movements and support the results of classical studies showing a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in this response.
