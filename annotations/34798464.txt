The biosynthesis of putrescine is mainly driven by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Hence, in this study, we generated independent ADC and ODC transgenic silenced tomato lines (SilADC and SilODC, respectively) to test the effect of defective ADC and ODC gene expression on root development under nitrate (NN) or ammonium (NA) conditions. The results showed that SilODC seedlings displayed an increase in ADC expression that led to polyamine accumulation, suggesting a compensatory effect of ADC. However, this effect was not observed in SilADC seedlings. These pathways are involved in different growth processes. The SilADC seedlings showed an increase in fresh weight, shoot length, lateral root number and shoot:root ratio under the NN source and an enhancement in fresh weight, and shoot and root length under NA conditions. However, SilODC seedlings displayed greater weight and shoot length under the NN source, whereas a decrease in lateral root density was found under NA conditions. Moreover, two overexpressed ODC lines were generated to check the relevance of the compensatory effect of the ADC pathway when ODC was silenced. These overexpressed lines showed not only an enhancement of almost all the studied growth parameters under both N sources but also an amelioration of ammonium syndrome under NA conditions. Together, these results reflect the importance of both pathways in plant growth, particularly ODC silencing, which requires compensation by ADC induction.
