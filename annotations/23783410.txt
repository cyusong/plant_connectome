['23783410', 'Previous study showed that the magnesium-protoporphyrin IX chelatase H subunit  (CHLH/ABAR) positively regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we  investigated the functions of a CHLH/ABAR interaction protein, the chloroplast  co-chaperonin 20 (CPN20) in ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that  down-expression of the CPN20 gene increases, but overexpression of the CPN20 gene  reduces, ABA sensitivity in the major ABA responses including ABA-induced seed  germination inhibition, postgermination growth arrest, promotion of stomatal  closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. Genetic evidence supports that CPN20  functions downstream or at the same node of CHLH/ABAR, but upstream of the WRKY40  transcription factor. The other CPN20 interaction partners CPN10 and CPN60 are  not involved in ABA signaling. Our findings show that CPN20 functions negatively  in the ABAR-WRKY40 coupled ABA signaling independently of its co-chaperonin role,  and provide a new insight into the role of co-chaperones in the regulation of  plant responses to environmental cues.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-013-0082-8', 'Zhang']
