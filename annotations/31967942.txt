The filamentous fungus <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> is a soilborne pathogen of many cultivated species and an opportunistic pathogen of humans. <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>matthiolae</i> is one of three formae speciales that are pathogenic to crucifers, including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, a premier model for plant molecular biology and genetics. Here, we report a genome assembly of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>matthiolae</i> strain PHW726, generated using a combination of PacBio and Illumina sequencing technologies. The genome assembly presented here should facilitate in-depth investigation of <i>F. oxysporum</i>-<i>Arabidopsis</i> interactions and shed light on the genetics of fungal pathogenesis and plant immunity.
