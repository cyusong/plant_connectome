Chickpea is one of the most widely consumed grain legume world-wide. Advances in next-generation sequencing and genomics tools have led to genetic dissection and identification of potential candidate genes regulating agronomic traits in chickpea. However, the developmental particularities and its potential in reforming the yield and nutritional value remain largely unexplored. Studies in crops such as rice, maize, tomato and pea have highlighted the contribution of key regulator of developmental events in yield related traits. A comprehensive knowledge on the development aspects of a crop can pave way for new vistas to explore. Pea and Medicago are the close relatives of genus Cicer and the basic developmental events in these legumes are similar. However, there are some distinct developmental features in chickpea which hold potential for future crop improvement endeavours. The global chickpea germplasm encompasses wide range of diversities in terms of morphology at both vegetative and reproductive stages. There is an immediate need for understanding the genetic and molecular basis of this diversity and utilizing them for the yield contributing trait improvement. The review discusses some of the key developmental events which have potential in yield enhancement and the lessons which can be learnt from model legumes in this regard.
