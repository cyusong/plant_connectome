Abiotic and biotic environments influence a myriad of plant-related processes, including growth, development, and the establishment and maintenance of interaction(s) with microbes. In the case of the latter, elevated temperature has been shown to be a key factor that underpins host resistance and pathogen virulence. In this study, we elucidate a role for Arabidopsis NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (NDR1) by exploiting effector-triggered immunity to define the regulation of plant host immunity in response to both pathogen infection and elevated temperature. We generated time-series RNA sequencing data of WT Col-0, an NDR1 overexpression line, and ndr1 and ics1-2 mutant plants under elevated temperature. Not surprisingly, the NDR1-overexpression line showed genotype-specific gene expression changes related to defense response and immune system function. The results described herein support a role for NDR1 in maintaining cell signaling during simultaneous exposure to elevated temperature and avirulent pathogen stressors.
