China has the largest sweet potato planting area worldwide, as well as the highest yield per unit area and total yield. Drought is the most frequently encountered environmental stress during the sweet potato growing season. In this study, we investigated salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense mechanisms under drought conditions in two sweet potato varieties, Zheshu 77 and Zheshu 13. Drought stress decreased growth traits, photosynthetic pigments and relative water contents, as well as the photosynthetic capability parameters net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, whereas it increased reactive oxygen species production, as well as malondialdehyde and abscisic acid contents. The application of SA to drought-stressed plants reduced oxidative damage by triggering the modulation of antioxidant enzyme activities and the maintenance of optimized osmotic environments in vivo in the two sweet potato varieties. After SA solution applications, <i>NCED-like3</i> expression was downregulated and the abscisic acid contents of drought-stressed plants decreased, promoting photosynthesis and plant growth. Thus, foliar spraying an appropriate dose of SA, 2.00-4.00 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>, on drought-stressed sweet potato varieties may induce resistance in field conditions, thereby increasing growth and crop yield in the face of increasingly frequent drought conditions.
