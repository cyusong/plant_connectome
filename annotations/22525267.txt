Brassinosteroids (BRs), a group of plant steroidal hormones, play critical roles in many aspects of plant growth and development. Previous studies showed that BRI1-mediated BR signaling regulates cell division and differentiation during Arabidopsis root development via interplaying with auxin and other phytohormones. Arabidopsis somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases (SERKs), as co-receptors of BRI1, were found to play a fundamental role in an early activation step of BR signaling pathway. Here we report a novel function of SERKs in regulating Arabidopsis root development. Genetic analyses indicated that SERKs control root growth mainly via a BR-independent pathway. Although BR signaling pathway is completely disrupted in the serk1 bak1 bkk1 triple mutant, the root growth of the triple mutant is much severely damaged than the BR deficiency or signaling null mutants. More detailed analyses indicated that the triple mutant exhibited drastically reduced expression of a number of genes critical to polar auxin transport, cell cycle, endodermis development and root meristem differentiation, which were not observed in null BR biosynthesis mutant cpd and null BR signaling mutant bri1-701.
