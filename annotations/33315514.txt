Brassicaceae plants, including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, develop endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived structures called ER bodies, which are involved in chemical defense against herbivores. NAI1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) type transcription factor that regulates two downstream genes, <i>NAI2</i> and <i>BGLU23</i>, that are responsible for the ER body formation and function. Here, we examined the transcription factor function of NAI1, and found that NAI1 binds to the promoter region of <i>NAI2</i> and activates the <i>NAI2</i> promoter. The recombinant NAI1 protein recognizes the canonical and non-canonical G-box motifs in the <i>NAI2</i> promoter. Furthermore, we examined the DNA binding activity of NAI1 toward several E-box motifs in the <i>NAI2</i> and <i>BGLU23</i> promoters and found that NAI1 binds to a DNA fragment that includes an E-box motif from the <i>BGLU23</i> promoter. Subcellular localization of NAI1 was evident in the nucleus, which is consistent with its transcription factor function. Transient expression experiments in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves showed that GFP-NAI1 protein activated the <i>NAI2</i> promoter by binding to the two G-boxes of the promoter. Disruption of the G-boxes abolished the NAI1-dependent activation of the <i>NAI2</i> promoter. These results indicate that NAI1 has a DNA binding activity in a motif-dependent manner and suggest that NAI1 regulates <i>NAI2</i> and <i>BGLU23</i> gene expressions through binding to these DNA motifs in their promoters.
