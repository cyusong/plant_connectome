In ripening grape (Vitis sp.) berries, the combination of rapid sugar import, apoplastic phloem unloading, and water discharge via the xylem creates a potential risk for apoplastic sugar to be lost from the berries. We investigated the likelihood of such sugar loss and a possible sugar retrieval mechanism in the pedicels of different Vitis genotypes. Infusion of D-glucose-1-13C or L-glucose-1-13C to the stylar end of attached berries demonstrated that both sugars can be leached from the berries, but only the nontransport sugar L-glucose moved beyond the pedicels. No 13C enrichment was found in peduncles and leaves. Genes encoding 10 sugar transporters were expressed in the pedicels throughout grape ripening. Using an immunofluorescence technique, we localized the sucrose transporter SUC27 to pedicel xylem parenchyma cells. These results indicate that pedicels possess the molecular machinery for sugar retrieval from the apoplast. Plasmodesmata were observed between vascular parenchyma cells in pedicels, and movement of the symplastically mobile dye carboxyfluorescein demonstrated that the symplastic connection is physiologically functional. Taken together, the chemical, molecular, and anatomical evidence gathered here supports the idea that some apoplastic sugar can be leached from grape berries and is effectively retrieved in a two-step process in the pedicels. First, sugar transporters may actively retrieve leached sugar from the xylem. Second, retrieved sugar may move symplastically to the pedicel parenchyma for local use or storage, or to the phloem for recycling back to the berry.
