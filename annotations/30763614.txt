Plant immunity is controlled by both positive regulators such as PBS3 and EDS1 and negative regulators such as NPR3 and NPR4. However, the relationships among these important immune regulators remain elusive. In this study, we found that PBS3 interacts with EDS1 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and is required for EDS1 protein accumulation. NPR3 and NPR4, which function as salicylic acid receptors and adaptors of Cullin3-based E3 ligase, interact with and mediate the degradation of EDS1 via the 26S proteasome. We further discovered that PBS3 inhibits the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of EDS1 by reducing the association of EDS1 with the Cullin3 adaptors NPR3 and NPR4. Furthermore, we showed that PBS3 and EDS1 also contribute to PAMP-triggered immunity in addition to effector-triggered immunity. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which plants fine-tune defense responses by inhibiting the degradation of a positive player in plant immunity.
