Deubiquitination, a type of post-translational modification, cleaves ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability or activity. Deubiquitination enzymes, ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP/USP), have been reported to be involved in numerous cellular processes in plants, including meristem development, circadian clock regulation, and immunity. In contrast to model plants, however, the functions of UBP in other higher plants remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated a deubiquitination enzyme, ubiquitin-specific protease 12 (NbUBP12), from <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, which shows high sequence homology with the core enzyme regions of UBP12 from other plants. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis revealed that <i>NbUBP12</i> gene expression was significantly induced after drought treatment, and its level was higher in seed than in other tissues. Using a virus-induced gene silencing technique, we generated <i>NbUBP12</i>-silenced tobacco plants to analyze <i>NbUBP12</i> gene function in response to drought stress and found that compared with control plants, <i>NbUBP12</i>-silenced plants exhibited a lower survival rate after exposure to drought stress. In addition, they were characterized by lower leaf surface temperatures and larger stomatal pore size following abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that NbUBP12 is involved in modulating drought resistance in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, which is associated with ABA-mediated stomatal closure.
