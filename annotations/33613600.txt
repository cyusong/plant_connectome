<i>CONSTANS-LIKE</i> (<i>COL</i>) genes play important roles in the regulation of plant growth and development, and they have been analyzed in many plant species. However, few studies have examined <i>COL</i> genes in mungbean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>). In this study, we identified and characterized 31 mungbean genes whose proteins contained B-Box domains. Fourteen were designated as <i>VrCOL</i> genes and were distributed on 7 of the 11 mungbean chromosomes. Based on their phylogenetic relationships, <i>VrCOLs</i> were clustered into three groups (I, II, and III), which contained 4, 6, and 4 members, respectively. The gene structures and conserved motifs of the <i>VrCOL</i> genes were analyzed, and two duplicated gene pairs, <i>VrCOL1/VrCOL2</i> and <i>VrCOL8/VrCOL9</i>, were identified. A total of 82 <i>cis</i>-acting elements were found in the <i>VrCOL</i> promoter regions, and the numbers and types of <i>cis</i>-acting elements in each <i>VrCOL</i> promoter region differed. As a result, the expression patterns of <i>VrCOLs</i> varied in different tissues and throughout the day under long-day and short-day conditions. Among these <i>VrCOL</i> genes, <i>VrCOL2</i> showed a close phylogenetic relationship with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana CO</i> and displayed daily oscillations in expression under short-day conditions but not long-day conditions. In addition, overexpression of <i>VrCOL2</i> accelerated flowering in <i>Arabidopsis</i> under short-day conditions by affecting the expression of the flowering time genes <i>AtFT</i> and <i>AtTSF</i>. Our study lays the foundation for further investigation of <i>VrCOL</i> gene functions.
