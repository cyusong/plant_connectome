['16129836', 'Arabidopsis thaliana contains four DICER-LIKE (DCL) genes with specialized  functions in small RNA biogenesis for RNA interference-related processes. A  mutant with defects in DCL4 was identified and analyzed for microRNA- and  endogenous, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-related functions. The dcl4-2 mutant  contained normal or near-normal levels of microRNAs (21 nt) and  heterochromatin-associated siRNAs (24 nt). In contrast, this mutant lacked each  of three families of 21-nt trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) and possessed elevated  levels of ta-siRNA target transcripts. The dcl4-2 mutant resembled an  rna-dependent RNA polymerase 6 mutant in that both mutants lacked ta-siRNAs and  displayed heterochronic defects in which vegetative phase change was accelerated.  Double mutant analyses with dcl2-1, dcl3-1, and dcl4-2 alleles revealed  hierarchical redundancy among DCL activities, leading to alternative processing  of ta-siRNA precursors in the absence of DCL4. These data support the concept  that plants have specialized and compartmentalized DCL functions for biogenesis  of distinct small RNA classes.', '2005 Sep 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0506426102', 'Carrington']
