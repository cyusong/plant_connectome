Splicing of plant organellar group II introns from precursor-RNA transcripts requires the assistance of nuclear-encoded splicing factors. Maturase (nMAT) is one such factor, as its three homologs (nMAT1, 2 and 4) have been identified as being required for the splicing of various mitochondrial introns in Arabidopsis. However, the function of nMAT in maize (Zea mays L.) is unknown. In this study, we identified a seed development mutant, empty pericarp 2441 (emp2441) from maize, which showed severely arrested embryogenesis and endosperm development. Positional cloning and transgenic complementation assays revealed that Emp2441 encodes a maturase-related protein, ZmnMAT3. ZmnMAT3 is highly expressed during seed development and its protein locates to the mitochondria. The loss of function of ZmnMAT3 resulted in the reduced splicing efficiency of various mitochondrial group II introns, particularly of the trans-splicing of nad1 introns 1, 3 and 4, which consequently abolished the transcript of nad1 and severely impaired the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I. Moreover, the Zmnmat3 mutant showed defective mitochondrial structure and exhibited expression and activity of alternative oxidases. These results indicate that ZmnMAT3 is essential for mitochondrial complex I assembly during kernel development in maize.
