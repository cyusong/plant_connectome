Oil bodies have multiple functions: oleosin-mediated freezing tolerance of seeds, direct interaction with glyoxysomes for lipid degradation in seedlings, and antifungal compound production in leaves.

oleosin: !mediates! freezing tolerance
oleosin: !interacts with! glyoxysomes
oleosin: !produces! antifungal compounds
glyoxysomes: !degrade! lipids
