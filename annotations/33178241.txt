C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is characterized by the compartmentalization of the processes of atmospheric uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> and its conversion into carbohydrate between mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells. As a result, most of the enzymes participating in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, including RubisCO, are highly expressed in bundle-sheath cells. There is evidence that changes in the regulatory sequences of <i>RubisCO</i> contribute to its bundle-sheath-specific expression, however, little is known about how the spatial-expression pattern of other CBB cycle enzymes is regulated. In this study, we use a computational approach to scan for transcription factor binding sites in the regulatory regions of the genes encoding CBB cycle enzymes, SBPase, FBPase, PRK, and GAPDH-B, of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grasses. We identified potential <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements present in each of the genes studied here, regardless of the photosynthetic path used by the plant. The trans-acting factors that bind these elements have been validated in <i>A. thaliana</i> and might regulate the expression of the genes encoding CBB cycle enzymes. In addition, we also found C<sub>4</sub>-specific transcription factor binding sites in the genes encoding CBB cycle enzymes that could potentially contribute to the pathway-specific regulation of gene expression. These results provide a foundation for the functional analysis of the differences in regulation of genes encoding CBB cycle enzymes between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grasses.
