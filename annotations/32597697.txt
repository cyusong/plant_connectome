Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of plant growth promotion of rhizobacteria is very important. This study explored the mechanism by which <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> LZP02 promotes growth in rice roots through proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic techniques. The results showed that <i>B. pumilus</i> LZP02 promoted the absorption of phosphorous, calcium, and magnesium ions by colonization of rice roots and enhanced peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>Mg<sup>2+</sup> adenosine triphosphatase activities and chlorophyll contents in rice. The proteomic results showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and that the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites was also increased. According to RNA-seq and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses, expression of some genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was upregulated in rice roots. Regarding metabolomics, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were increased. The results indicated that <i>B. pumilus</i> LZP02 promoted the growth of rice roots by enhancing carbohydrate metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
