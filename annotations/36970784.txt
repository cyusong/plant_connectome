Apple (Malus domestica) trees often experience various abiotic and biotic stresses. However, due to the long juvenile period of apple and its high degree of genetic heterozygosity, only limited progress has been made in developing cold-hardy and disease-resistant cultivars through traditional approaches. Numerous studies reveal that biotechnology is a feasible approach to improve stress tolerance in woody perennial plants. HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), a double-stranded RNA binding protein, is a key regulator involved in apple drought stress response. However, whether HYL1 participates in apple cold response and pathogen resistance remains unknown. In this study, we revealed that MdHYL1 plays a positive role in cold tolerance and pathogen resistance in apple. MdHYL1 acted upstream to positively regulate freezing tolerance and Alternaria alternata resistance by positively modulating transcripts of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 in response to cold stress or A. alternata infection. In addition, MdHYL1 regulated the biogenesis of several miRNAs responsive to cold and A. alternata infection in apple. Furthermore, we identified Mdm-miRNA156 (Mdm-miR156) as a negative regulator of cold tolerance, Mdm-miRNA172 (Mdm-miR172) as a positive regulator of cold tolerance, and that Mdm-miRNA160 (Mdm-miR160) decreased plant resistance to infection by A. alternata. In summary, we highlight the molecular role of MdHYL1 regarding cold tolerance and A. alternata infection resistance, thereby providing candidate genes for breeding apple with freezing tolerance and A. alternata resistance using biotechnology.
