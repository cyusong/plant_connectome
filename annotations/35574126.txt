Exposure of plants to low temperatures adversely affects plant growth, development, and productivity. Plant response to cold stress is an intricate process that involves the orchestration of various physiological, signaling, biochemical, and molecular pathways. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling plays a crucial role in the acquisition of several stress responses, including cold. Upon perception of cold stress, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps are activated, which induces the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures in plant cells. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures spatially and temporally act inside a plant cell and are eventually decoded by specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors. This series of events results in the molecular regulation of several transcription factors (TFs), leading to downstream gene expression and withdrawal of an appropriate response by the plant. In this context, calmodulin binding transcription activators (CAMTAs) constitute a group of TFs that regulate plant cold stress responses in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner. The present review provides a catalog of the recent progress made in comprehending the Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated cold acclimation in plants.
