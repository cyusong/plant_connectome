APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factors play important roles in plant development and stress response. Although <i>AP2/ERF</i> genes have been extensively investigated in model plants such as <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, little is known about their role in biotic stress response in perennial fruit tree crops such as apple (<i>Malus × domestica</i>). Here, we investigated the role of <i>MdERF100</i> in powdery mildew resistance in apple. MdERF100 localized to the nucleus but showed no transcriptional activation activity. The heterologous expression of <i>MdERF100</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> not only enhanced powdery mildew resistance but also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and cell death. Furthermore, <i>MdERF100</i>-overexpressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants exhibited differential expressions of genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling when infected with the powdery mildew pathogen. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed that MdERF100 physically interacts with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MdbHLH92. These results suggest that <i>MdERF100</i> mediates powdery mildew resistance by regulating the JA and SA signaling pathways, and <i>MdbHLH92</i> is involved in plant defense against powdery mildew. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the role of <i>MdERF</i> genes in disease resistance, and provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of powdery mildew resistance in apple.
