['34034865', 'Chloroplast biogenesis and development regulation have long been a focus of  research; however, the underlying mechanisms of these processes have not yet been  fully elucidated. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins have been shown to play  key roles in chloroplast development. Here, we identified a novel P-type PPR  protein, Early Chloroplast Development 2 (ECD2), and the ecd2 mutant resulted in  embryo lethality. The RNAi lines of ECD2 showed varying degrees of albino  cotyledons and abnormal chloroplast development, but true leaves were similar to  the wild-type. Further analysis revealed that ECD2 was responsible for  chloroplast gene expression and group II intron splicing of several genes.  Transcriptome analysis combined with quantitative real-time PCR showed that ECD2  was associated with the expression of ribosomal genes and accumulation of  chloroplast ribosomes. Overall, our results indicate that ECD2 is critically  important for early chloroplast development in cotyledon.', '2021 Jul', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.110908', 'Xiao']
