Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is a cool-season turf and forage grass. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) play an important role in regulating plant abiotic stress. However, HSFs in perennial ryegrass have rarely been characterized. Here, 25 LpHSFs were identified from the perennial ryegrass genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the LpHSFs could be classified into 12 subclasses. Gene structure analysis showed that 22 LpHSFs have only one intron. Cis-acting elements analysis revealed that the promoter of 15 LpHSFs contained hormone-responsive and abiotic stress-responsive elements. Expression profile analysis indicated that 24 LpHSFs were differentially expressed under submerge, drought, heat, and cold stresses. In addition, a subclass C2 gene, LpHSFC2b, was significantly induced by abiotic stresses. The LpHSFC2b protein is localized to the nucleus, and heterologous expression of LpHSFC2b in Arabidopsis improves plant thermotolerance. This study provides insights useful for the breeding of stress tolerance in perennial ryegrass.
