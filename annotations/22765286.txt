Leaf senescence is induced or accelerated when leaves are detached. However, the senescence process and expression pattern of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) when leaves are detached are not clearly understood. To detect senescence-associated physiological changes and SAG expression, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves were detached and treated with light, darkness, low temperature (4 °C), jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA). The leaf phenotypes, chlorophyll content, delayed fluorescence (DF), and expression levels of two SAGs, namely, TaSAG3 and TaSAG5, were analyzed. Under these different treatments, the detached leaves turned yellow with different patterns and varying chlorophyll content. DF significantly decreased after the dark, ABA, JA and SA treatments. TaSAG3 and TaSAG5, which are expressed in natural senescent leaves, showed different expression patterns under various treatments. However, both TaSAG3 and TaSAG5 were upregulated after leaf detachment. Our results revealed senescence-associated physiological changes and molecular differences in leaves, which induced leaf senescence during different stress treatments.
