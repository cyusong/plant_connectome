Legumes establish an endosymbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria. Following the mutual recognition of the symbiotic partner, the infection process is controlled by the induction of the signaling pathway and subsequent activation of symbiosis-related host genes. One of the protein complexes regulating nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis is formed by GRAS domain regulatory proteins Nodulation Signaling Pathways 1 and 2 (NSP1 and NSP2) that control the expression of several early nodulation genes. Here, we report on a novel point mutant allele (<i>nsp2-6</i>) affecting the function of the <i>NSP2</i> gene and compared the mutant with the formerly identified <i>nsp2-3</i> mutant. Both mutants carry a single amino acid substitution in the VHIID motif of the NSP2 protein. We found that the two mutant alleles show dissimilar root hair response to bacterial infection. Although the <i>nsp2-3</i> mutant developed aberrant infection threads, rhizobia were able to colonize nodule cells in this mutant. The encoded NSP2 proteins of the <i>nsp2-3</i> and the novel <i>nsp2</i> mutants interact with NSP1 diversely and, as a consequence, the activation of early nodulin genes and nodule organogenesis are arrested in the new <i>nsp2</i> allele. The novel mutant with amino acid substitution D244H in NSP2 shows similar defects in symbiotic responses as a formerly identified <i>nsp2-2</i> mutant carrying a deletion in the <i>NSP2</i> gene. Additionally, we found that rhizobial strains induce delayed nodule formation on the roots of the <i>ns2-3</i> weak allele. Our study highlights the importance of a conserved Asp residue in the VHIID motif of NSP2 that is required for the formation of a functional NSP1-NSP2 signaling module. Furthermore, our results imply the involvement of NSP2 during differentiation of symbiotic nodule cells.
