Global warming has become an issue in recent years in viticulture, as increasing temperatures have a negative impact on grapevine (Vitis vinifera) production and on wine quality. Phenotyping for grapevine response to heat stress is, therefore, important to understand thermotolerance mechanisms, with the aim of improving field management strategies or developing more resilient varieties. Nonetheless, the choice of the phenotypic traits to be investigated is not trivial and depends mainly on the objectives of the study, but also on the number of samples and on the availability of instrumentation. Moreover, the grapevine literature reports few studies related to thermotolerance, generally assessing physiological responses, which highlights the need for more holistic approaches. In this context, the present review offers an overview of target traits that are commonly investigated in plant thermotolerance studies, with a special focus on grapevine, and of methods that can be employed to evaluate those traits. With the final goal of providing useful tools and references for future studies on grapevine heat stress resilience, advantages and limitations of each method are highlighted, and the available or possible implementations are described. In this way, the reader is guided in the choice of the best approaches in terms of speed, complexity, range of application, sensitivity, and specificity.
