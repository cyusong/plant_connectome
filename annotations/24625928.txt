['24625928', "Innate immunity relies on the perception of pathogen-associated molecular  patterns (PAMPs) by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) located on the host  cell's surface. Many plant PRRs are kinases. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis  receptor kinase EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR), which perceives the elf18 peptide derived  from bacterial elongation factor Tu, is activated upon ligand binding by  phosphorylation on its tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of a single tyrosine  residue, Y836, is required for activation of EFR and downstream immunity to the  phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. A tyrosine phosphatase, HopAO1,  secreted by P. syringae, reduces EFR phosphorylation and prevents subsequent  immune responses. Thus, host and pathogen compete to take control of PRR tyrosine  phosphorylation used to initiate antibacterial immunity.", '2014 Mar 28', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1248849', 'Zipfel']
