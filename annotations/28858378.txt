Conclusions 29 Acknowledgements 29 References 29 SUMMARY: Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are fundamental components of the eukaryotic cell. They perforate the nuclear envelope and serve as highly selective transport gates that enable bi-directional macromolecule exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Recent studies illustrate that the NPC is not a static structural channel but a flexible environment and strategic player during nuclear signaling. The constitutional and conformational dynamics of the NPC allow it to tailor nucleocytoplasmic transport activities and define specific signaling output in response to various cellular and environmental cues. In this Insight, we review the roles of NPC constituents in immune activation and hormone signaling in plants, and discuss the possible role of the NPC as a legitimate platform for regulating cell signaling.
