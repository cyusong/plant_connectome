Cultured Coptis japonica cells show tolerance to various toxic compounds. By yeast functional screening of cadmium (Cd) plates with its cDNA library, we isolated a gene encoding Bowman-Birk proteinase inhibitor (CjBBI). The yeast transformant of CjBBI showed multiple tolerance to various drugs adding to Cd, and revealed reduced Cd accumulation in cells. Preferential organs for Cjbbi expression were aerial parts of intact plants, and the subcellular localization of CjBBI was shown, using its green fluorescent protein fusion, to be the apoplast. Induction of Cjbbi expression by Cd treatment suggested that CjBBI was responsible for the tolerance to Cd observed in C. japonica cells.
