Plants will interact with beneficial endophytic fungi to increase resistance under environmental stress. Among these stresses, salt stress poses one of the major threats to plant growth worldwide. We have studied the response mechanism of Chaetomium globosum D5, a salt-tolerant fungus isolated from the roots of Paeonia lactiflora under salt stress, and its mechanism of action in helping P. lactiflora alleviate salt stress. In our study, high levels of salt inhibit growth, whereas low levels promote the growth of C. globosum D5, which resists salt stress by forming dense hyphae and producing more pigments, soluble proteins, and antioxidants. Under salt stress, growth and photosynthesis of P. lactiflora are inhibited, and they are subjected to osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and ionic stress. C. globosum D5 could help P. lactiflora promote growth and photosynthesis by increasing the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus and increasing the accumulation of the carbon and photosynthetic pigments, help P. lactiflora alleviate osmotic stress by increasing the accumulation of proline, help P. lactiflora alleviate ion stress by reducing Na<sup>+</sup> and increasing K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca2<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Na <sup>+</sup> ratios in P. lactiflora roots and leaves. In summary, joint action between P. lactiflora and C. globosum D5 is responsible for mitigating damage caused by P. lactiflora under salt stress. We first investigate the interaction between the fungus and P. lactiflora under salt stress, providing a theoretical basis for further investigations into the mechanisms of P. lactiflora's response to salt stress and its promotion in coastal areas.
