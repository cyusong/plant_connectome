Anthocyanins are natural colorants are synthesized in a branch of the flavonoid pathway. Dihydroflavonol-4reductase (DFR) catalyzes dihydroflavonoids into anthocyanins biosynthesis, which is a key regulatory enzyme of anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. <i>Hosta ventricosa</i> is an ornamental plant with elegant flowers and rich colorful leaves. How the function of HvDFR contributes to the anthocyanins biosynthesis is still unknown. In this study, the DFR homolog was identified from <i>H. ventricosa</i> and sequence analysis showed that HvDFR possessed the conserved NADPH binding and catalytic domains. A phylogenetic analysis showed that HvDFR was close to the clade formed with MaDFR and HoDFR in Asparagaceae. Gene expression analysis revealed that HvDFR was constitutive expressed in all tissues and expressed highly in flower as well as was positively correlated with anthocyanin content. In addition, the subcellular location of HvDFR showed that is in the nucleus and cell membrane. Overexpression of HvDFR in transgenic tobacco lines enhanced the anthocyanins accumulation along with the key genes upregulated, such as F3H, F3'H, ANS, and UFGT. Our results indicated a functional activity of the HvDFR, which provide an insight into the regulation of anthocyanins content in <i>H. ventricosa.</i>
