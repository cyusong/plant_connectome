The leaf margin is a fascinating feature of leaf morphology, contributing to the incredible diversity of leaf shapes and forms. As a central regulator of plant organ separation and margin development, CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2), a NAM, ATAF1, 2, CUC2 (NAC)-family transcription factor, governs the extent of serrations along the leaf margin. CUC2 activity is tightly regulated at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. However, the molecular mechanism that controls <i>CUC2</i> transcription during leaf development has not been fully elucidated. Here we report that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NGATHA-LIKE1 (NGAL1) to NGAL3, which are three related B3 family transcription factors, act as negative regulators of leaf margin serration formation. Over-expression of <i>NGALs</i> led to "cup-shaped" cotyledons and smooth leaf margins, whereas the triple loss-of-function mutant <i>ngaltri</i> exhibited more serrated leaves than the wild type. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that the expression levels of a number of transcription factor genes involved in leaf development are regulated by NGALs, including <i>CUC2</i> Comparative transcriptome analyses further uncovered a significant overlap between NGAL- and CUC2-regulated genes. Moreover, genetic analyses using various combinations of gain- and loss-of-function mutants of <i>NGALs</i> and <i>CUC2</i> confirmed that CUC2 acts downstream of NGALs in promoting the formation of leaf-margin serrations. Finally, we demonstrate that NGAL1 directly binds to the <i>CUC2</i> promoter causing repressed <i>CUC2</i> expression. In summary, direct <i>CUC2</i> transcriptional repression by NGAL1 characterizes a further regulatory module controlling leaf margin development.
