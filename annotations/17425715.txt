Brassica napus is an amphidiploid species with the A genome from Brassica rapa and the C genome from Brassica oleracea. Although B. rapa, B. oleracea and artificially synthesized amphidiploids with the AC genome are self-incompatible, B. napus is self-compatible. Six S genotypes were identified in B. napus, five of which had class I S haplotypes from one species and a class II S haplotype from the other species, and mutations causing self-compatibility were identified in three of these S genotypes. The most predominant S genotype (BnS-1;BnS-6), which is that of cv. 'Westar', had a class I S haplotype similar to B. rapa S-47 (BrS-47) and a class II S haplotype similar to B. oleracea S-15 (BoS-15). The stigmas of 'Westar' rejected the pollen grains of both BrS-47 and BoS-15, while reciprocal crossings were compatible. Insertion of a DNA fragment of about 3.6 kb was found in the promoter region of the SP11/SCR allele of BnS-1, and transcripts of SP11/SCR were not detected in 'Westar'. The nucleotide sequence of the SP11 genomic DNA of BnS-6 was 100% identical to that of SP11 of BoS-15. Class I SP11 alleles from one species showed dominance over class II SP11 alleles from the other species in artificially synthesized B. napus lines, suggesting that the non-functional dominant SP11 allele suppressed the expression of the recessive SP11 allele in 'Westar'. Two other S genotypes in B. napus also had non-functional class I S haplotypes together with recessive BnS-6. These observations suggest independent origins of self-compatibility in B. napus.
