Al(3+), the predominant form of solubilized aluminum at pH values below 5.0, has been shown to exert a profound inhibitory effect on root elongation. Al is known to accumulate at the root apex. The plasma membrane represents the first potential target for Al toxicity, due to its pronounced binding to phospholipids. Al appears to alter both the structure and functions of the plasma membrane, and a great deal of research has been conducted concerning the interactions between Al and the plasma membrane. In this review, recent findings regarding the interactions between Al and the plasma membrane are described, specifically findings involving Al-induced alterations in the structure and function of the plasma membrane.
