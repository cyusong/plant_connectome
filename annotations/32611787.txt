['32611787', 'Plants form calluses and regenerate new organs when incubated on  phytohormone-containing media. While accumulating evidence suggests that these  regenerative processes are governed by transcriptional networks orchestrating  wound response and developmental transitions, it remains unknown if  posttranslational regulatory mechanisms are involved in this process. In this  study, we demonstrate that SAP AND MIZ1 DOMAIN- CONTAINING LIGASE1 (SIZ1), an E3  ligase-catalyzing attachment of the SMALL UBIQUITIN-LIKE MODIFIER (SUMO) to  proteins, regulates wound-induced signal transduction and organ regeneration in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that loss-of-function mutants for  SIZ1 exhibit overproduction of shoot meristems under in vitro tissue culture  conditions, while this defect is rescued in a complementation line expressing  pSIZ1::SIZ1 RNA sequencing analysis revealed that siz1-2 mutants exhibit enhanced  transcriptional responses to wound stress, resulting in the hyper-induction of  over 400 genes immediately after wounding. Among them, we show that elevated  levels of WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 (WIND1) and WIND2 contribute to the  enhanced shoot regeneration observed in siz1 mutants, as expression of the  dominant-negative chimeric protein WIND1-SRDX (SUPERMAN repression domain) in  siz1-3 mutants partly rescues this phenotype. Although compromised SIZ1 function  does not modify the transcription of genes implicated in auxin-induced callus  formation and/or pluripotency acquisition, it does lead to enhanced induction of  cytokinin-induced shoot meristem regulators such as WUSCHEL, promoting the  formation of WUSCHEL-expressing foci in explants. This study thus suggests that  SIZ1 negatively regulates shoot regeneration in part by repressing wound-induced  developmental reprogramming.', '2020 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.20.00626', 'ORCID:']
