The efficient uptake of nutrients depends on the ability of roots to respond to gradients of these resources. Although pot experiments have shown that species differ in their ability to proliferate their roots in nutrient-rich patches, the role of such differences in determining root shapes in the field is unclear. We used fine-scale quantitative (q)PCR-based species-specific mapping of roots in a grassland community to reconstruct species-specific root system shapes. We linked them with data from pot experiments on the ability of these species to proliferate in nutrient-rich patches and their rooting depth. We found remarkable diversity in root system shapes, from cylindrical to conical. Interspecific differences in rooting depths in pots were the main determinant of rooting depths in the field, whereas differences in foraging ability played only a minor role. Although some species with strong foraging ability did place their roots into nutrient-rich soil layers, it was not a universal pattern. The results imply that although the vertical differentiation of grassland species is pronounced, it is primarily not driven by the differential plastic response of species to soil nutrient gradients. This may constrain the coexistence of species with similar rooting depths and may instead favour coexistence of species differing in their architectural blueprints.
