Plum is one of the most important stone fruits in the world and anthocyanin-rich plums are increasingly popular due to their health-promoting potential. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation in the flesh of the red-fleshed mutant of the yellow-fleshed plum 'Sanyueli'. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR showed that anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and the transcription factor <i>PsMYB10.2</i> were upregulated in the flesh of the mutant. Functional testing in tobacco leaves indicated that <i>PsMYB10.2</i> was an anthocyanin pathway activator and can activate the promoter of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes <i>PsUFGT</i> and <i>PsGST</i>. The role of <i>PsMYB10.2</i> in anthocyanin accumulation in the flesh of plum was further confirmed by virus-induced gene silencing. These results provide information for further elucidating the underlying mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation in the flesh of plum and for the breeding of new red-fleshed plum cultivars.
