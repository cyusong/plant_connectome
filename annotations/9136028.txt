['9136028', 'A simple screening method was developed for the isolation of Arabidopsis thaliana  mutants hypersensitive to X-ray irradiation. The root meristem was used as the  target for irradiation with sublethal doses of X rays, while protection of the  shoot meristem by a lead cover allowed the rescue of hypersensitive individuals.  We isolated nine independent X-ray-hypersensitive mutants from 7000 M2 seedlings.  Analysis of three chosen mutants (xrs4, xrs9 and xrs11) showed that alterations  in single recessive alleles are responsible for their phenotypes. The mutations  are not allelic but linked and map to chromosome 4, suggesting mutations in novel  genes as compared to previously mapped mutant alleles. Importantly,  hypersensitivity to X rays was found to correlate with hypersensitivity to the  DNA-alkylating agent mitomycin C, which provokes interstrand crosslinks, and/or  to methyl methanesulfonate, which is known as a radiomimetic chemical. These  novel phenotypes suggest that the mutants described here are altered in the  repair of DNA damage, most probably by recombinational repair.', '1997 May', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/146.1.401', 'Paszkowski']
