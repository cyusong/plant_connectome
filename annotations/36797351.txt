How transcription factors attain their target gene specificity and how this specificity may be modulated, acquiring different regulatory functions through the development of plant tissues, is an open question. Here we characterized different regulatory roles of the MADS-domain transcription factor FRUITFULL (FUL) in flower development and mechanisms modulating its activity. We found that the dual role of FUL in regulating floral transition and pistil development is associated with its different in vivo patterns of DNA binding in both tissues. Characterization of FUL protein complexes by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and SELEX-seq experiments shows that aspects of tissue-specific target site selection can be predicted by tissue-specific variation in the composition of FUL protein complexes with different DNA binding specificities, without considering the chromatin status of the target region. This suggests a role for dynamic changes in FUL TF complex composition in reshaping the regulatory functions of FUL during flower development.

FUL: !regulates! floral transition 
FUL: !regulates! pistil development 
FUL: !binds to DNA! differently in different tissues 
FUL: !comprises! protein complexes with different DNA binding specificities 
FUL: !reshapes! regulatory functions during flower development
