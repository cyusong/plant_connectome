Most terrestrial plants use C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis to fix carbon. In multiple plant lineages a modified system known as C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis has evolved. To better understand the molecular patterns associated with induction of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, the genus Flaveria that contains C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species was used. A base to tip maturation gradient of leaf anatomy was defined, and RNA sequencing was undertaken along this gradient for two C<sub>3</sub> and two C<sub>4</sub> Flaveria species. Key C<sub>4</sub> traits including vein density, mesophyll and bundle sheath cross-sectional area, chloroplast ultrastructure, and abundance of transcripts encoding proteins of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis were quantified. Candidate genes underlying each of these C<sub>4</sub> characteristics were identified. Principal components analysis indicated that leaf maturation and the photosynthetic pathway were responsible for the greatest amount of variation in transcript abundance. Photosynthesis genes were over-represented for a prolonged period in the C<sub>4</sub> species. Through comparison with publicly available data sets, we identify a small number of transcriptional regulators that have been up-regulated in diverse C<sub>4</sub> species. The analysis identifies similar patterns of expression in independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages and so indicates that the complex C<sub>4</sub> pathway is associated with parallel as well as convergent evolution.
