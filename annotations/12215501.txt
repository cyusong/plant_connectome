['12215501', 'The cell wall is the major limiting factor for plant growth. Wall extension is  thought to result from the loosening of its structure. However, it is not known  how this is coordinated with wall synthesis. We have identified two novel allelic  cellulose-deficient dwarf mutants, kobito1-1 and kobito1-2 (kob1-1 and kob1-2).  The cellulose deficiency was confirmed by the direct observation of microfibrils  in most recent wall layers of elongating root cells. In contrast to the wild  type, which showed transversely oriented parallel microfibrils, kob1 microfibrils  were randomized and occluded by a layer of pectic material. No such changes were  observed in another dwarf mutant, pom1, suggesting that the cellulose defect in  kob1 is not an indirect result of the reduced cell elongation. Interestingly, in  the meristematic zone of kob1 roots, microfibrils appeared unaltered compared  with the wild type, suggesting a role for KOB1 preferentially in rapidly  elongating cells. KOB1 was cloned and encodes a novel, highly conserved,  plant-specific protein that is plasma membrane bound, as shown with a green  fluorescent protein-KOB1 fusion protein. KOB1 mRNA was present in all organs  investigated, and its overexpression did not cause visible phenotypic changes.  KOB1 may be part of the cellulose synthesis machinery in elongating cells, or it  may play a role in the coordination between cell elongation and cellulose  synthesis.', '2002 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.002873', 'Hofte']
