Extracellular ATP (eATP) and nitric oxide (NO) have emerged as crucial players in plant development, stress responses and cell viability. Glutathione (GSH) is an abundant reducing agent with proposed roles in plant growth, development and stress physiology. In a recent publication, we demonstrated that eATP and NO restore hypocotyl elongation of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings treated with GSH. Here it is reported that exogenous ATP also restore root hair growth suggesting a role for ATP and NO in the regulation of redox balance associated to specific processes of plant morphogenesis. A tentative model integrating redox-, eATP- and NO- signaling pathways during root hair growth in Arabidopsis seedlings is presented.

eATP: !restores! hypocotyl elongation 
NO: !restores! hypocotyl elongation 
GSH: !treats! Arabidopsis seedlings 
eATP: !restores! root hair growth 
ATP: !regulates! redox balance 
NO: !regulates! redox balance
