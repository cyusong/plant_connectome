D-type cyclins play key roles in the G1-to-S phase transition that occurs in response to nutrient and hormonal signals. In higher plants, sucrose is the major transported carbon source, and is likely to be a major determinant of cell division. To elucidate how sugar affects on the regulation of cell cycle machinery and plant development, we examined the role of carbon sources on the expression of cell-cycle-related genes in transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing Nicta;CycD3;4. The Nicta;CycD3;4 overexpressed transgenic plants showed accelerated growth and remarkable increase in the number of cells in the S and G2 phases in response to sucrose concentrations. Increased expressions level of Nicta;CycD3;4 gene was observed in transgenic tobacco plants grown on 1/2 strength MS medium supplemented with a high concentration of sugar. Moreover, the expression of sugar-sensing-related gene, invertase, was also maintained at a high level in transgenic tobacco plants with elevated sugar availability. These findings indicate that sugar availability plays a role during the G1 phase and the transition of the G1-to-S phase of cell cycle by controlling the expression of Nicta;CycD3;4.
