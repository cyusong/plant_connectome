['19666499', 'Inadequate availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the rhizosphere is a  common challenge to plants, which activate metabolic and developmental responses  to maximize Pi acquisition. The sensory mechanisms that monitor environmental Pi  status and regulate root growth via altered meristem activity are unknown. Here,  we show that PHOSPHATE DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (PDR2) encodes the single P(5)-type  ATPase of Arabidopsis thaliana. PDR2 functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  and is required for proper expression of SCARECROW (SCR), a key regulator of root  patterning, and for stem-cell maintenance in Pi-deprived roots. We further show  that the multicopper oxidase encoded by LOW PHOSPHATE ROOT 1 (LPR1) is targeted  to the ER and that LPR1 and PDR2 interact genetically. Because the expression  domains of both genes overlap in the stem-cell niche and distal root meristem, we  propose that PDR2 and LPR1 function together in an ER-resident pathway that  adjusts root meristem activity to external Pi. Our data indicate that the  Pi-conditional root phenotype of pdr2 is not caused by increased Fe availability  in low Pi; however, Fe homeostasis modifies the developmental response of root  meristems to Pi availability.', '2009 Aug 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0901778106', 'Abel']
