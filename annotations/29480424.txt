The comprehensive genetic variation of two citrus species were analyzed at genome and transcriptome level. A total of 1090 differentially expressed genes were found during fruit development by RNA-sequencing. Fruit size (fruit equatorial diameter) and weight (fresh weight) are the two most important components determining yield and consumer acceptability for many horticultural crops. However, little is known about the genetic control of these traits. Here, we performed whole-genome resequencing to reveal the comprehensive genetic variation of the fruit development between kumquat (Citrus japonica) and Clementine mandarin (Citrus clementina). In total, 5,865,235 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 414,447 insertions/deletions (InDels) were identified in the two citrus species. Based on integrative analysis of genome and transcriptome of fruit, 640,801 SNPs and 20,733 InDels were identified. The features, genomic distribution, functional effect, and other characteristics of these genetic variations were explored. RNA-sequencing identified 1090 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during fruit development of kumquat and Clementine mandarin. Gene Ontology revealed that these genes were involved in various molecular functional and biological processes. In addition, the genetic variation of 939 DEGs and 74 multiple fruit development pathway genes from previous reports were also identified. A global survey identified 24,237 specific alternative splicing events in the two citrus species and showed that intron retention is the most prevalent pattern of alternative splicing. These genome variation data provide a foundation for further exploration of citrus diversity and gene-phenotype relationships and for future research on molecular breeding to improve kumquat, Clementine mandarin and related species.
