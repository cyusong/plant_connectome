['36769138', 'LSUs (RESPONSE TO LOW SULFUR) are plant-specific proteins of unknown function  that were initially identified during transcriptomic studies of the sulfur  deficiency response in Arabidopsis. Recent functional studies have shown that  LSUs are important hubs of protein interaction networks with potential roles in  plant stress responses. In particular, LSU proteins have been reported to  interact with members of the brassinosteroid, jasmonate signaling, and ethylene  biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that LSUs may be involved in response to plant  stress through modulation of phytohormones. Furthermore, in silico analysis of  the promoter regions of LSU genes in Arabidopsis has revealed the presence of  cis-regulatory elements that are potentially responsive to phytohormones such as  ABA, auxin, and jasmonic acid, suggesting crosstalk between LSU proteins and  phytohormones. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the LSU gene  family in plants and its potential role in phytohormone responses.', '2023 Feb 1', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms24032819', 'ORCID:']
