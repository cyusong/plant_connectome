Salinity is one of the major abiotic constraints affecting the growth and yield of plants including soybean. In this context, the previous studies have documented the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in the regulation of salt signaling in model plants. However, there is not a systematic analysis of salt-related MAPKs in soybean. Hence, in this study, we identified a total of 32 GmMAPKs via., genome-wide reanalysis of the MAPK family using the soybean genome v4.0. Based on the transcriptome datasets in the public database, we observed that GmMAPKs are induced by different abiotic stresses, especially salt stress. Furthermore, based on the candidate gene association mapping and haplotype analysis of the GmMAPKs, we identified a salt-related MAPK member, GmMMK1. GmMMK1 possesses significant sequence variations, which affect salt tolerance in soybean at the germination stage. Besides, the overexpression of the GmMMK1 in soybean hairy roots has a significant negative effect on the root growth, leading to increased sensitivity of the GmMMK1-OE plants to salt stress. Moreover, the heterologous expression of the GmMMK1 in Arabidopsis has been also observed to have a negative effect on the germination and root growth under salt stress. The transcriptome analysis and yeast two-hybrid screening showed that hormone signaling and the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species are involved in the GmMMK1 regulation network. In conclusion, the results of this work demonstrated that GmMMK1 is an important negative regulator of the salt stress response, and provides better insights for understanding the role of the MAPKs in soybean salt signaling.
