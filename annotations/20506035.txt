Subcellular localization of mRNA is a widespread and efficient way for targeting proteins to specific regions of a cell. Messenger RNA sorting appears as a key mechanism for posttranscriptional gene regulation, and its involvement in organelle biogenesis has been described in different organisms. Here we demonstrate that mRNA targeting to the surface of mitochondria occurs in higher plants. Cytosolic mRNAs corresponding to mitochondrial proteins, but also to some particular cytosolic proteins, were found associated to mitochondria, offering new perspectives for mitochondria biogenesis in plant cells.
