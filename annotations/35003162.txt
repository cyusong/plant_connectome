Although <i>Catalpa bungei</i> is a forest plant with considerable economic and ornamental value in China, its wood and decorative qualities are constrained by insect pests such as the shoot borer <i>Omphisa plagialis</i> (Lepidoptera). Overexpressing insect resistance genes such as <i>crystal</i> genes to develop an insect-resistant variety of <i>C. bungei</i> is an environmental and ecological approach. However, genotype limitations and low regeneration rates of embryogenic calli (EC) inhibit the development of transformation and the insect-resistant gene expression system in <i>C. bungei</i>. Here, we first established embryogenic callus induction and regeneration systems of five genotypes using mature seed and stem segment explants; the highest induction and regeneration rates of EC were 39.89 and 100%, respectively. Next, an efficient and stable <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated genetic transformation system was developed from EC and its positive frequency was up to 92.31%. Finally, using the transformation system, 15 and 22 transgenic <i>C. bungei</i> lines that expressed <i>Cry2A</i> and <i>Cry9Aa-like</i> were generated, respectively. These transgenic lines that exhibited significantly higher resistance to <i>O. plagialis</i> in the laboratory and field have great promise for meeting the challenge of future pest management under changing climatic conditions. Additionally, this efficient, fast, and stable transformation system could be a potential tool for gene function analysis and forest tree genetic improvement.
