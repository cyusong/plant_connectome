['18390806', 'Transcription corepressors play important roles in animal and plant development.  In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), LEUNIG (LUG) and LEUNIG_HOMOLOG (LUH)  encode two highly homologous proteins that are similar to the animal and fungal  Gro/Tup1-type corepressors. LUG was previously shown to form a putative  corepressor complex with another protein, SEUSS (SEU), and to repress the  transcription of AGAMOUS in floral organ identity specification. However, the  function of LUH is completely unknown. Here, we show that single luh  loss-of-function mutants develop normal flowers, but lug; luh double mutants are  embryo lethal, uncovering a previously unknown function of LUG and LUH in  embryonic development. In addition, luh/+ enhances the floral phenotype of lug,  revealing a minor role of LUH in flower development. Functional diversification  between LUH and LUG is evidenced by the inability of 35S::LUH overexpression to  rescue lug mutants and by the opposite expression trends of LUG and LUH in  response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The luh-1 mutation does not enhance the  defect of seu in flower development, but LUH could directly interact with SEU in  yeast. We propose a model that explains the complex relationships among LUH, LUG,  and SEU. As most eukaryotes have undergone at least one round of whole-genome  duplication during evolution, gene duplication and functional diversification are  important issues to consider in uncovering gene function. Our study provides  important insights into the complexity in the relationship between two highly  homologous paralogous genes.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.115923', 'Liu']
