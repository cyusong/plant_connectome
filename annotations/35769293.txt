Ear architecture is determined by two stable heritable traits, kernel row number (KRN) and kernel number per row (KNPR), but its relationship with drought resistance is still vague. To this end, we obtained 16 and 11 hybrids with slender (less KRN but more KNPR) and stubby (more KRN but less KNPR) ears by intentionally crossbreeding, respectively. These hybrids were exposed to a seven-day water deficit (WD) since silk emergence coupled with synchronous (SP) and continuous pollination (CP) to alter the pollination time gaps on ears. The results showed that the emerged silks in CP were 9.1 and 9.0% less than in the SP treatment in the stubby and slender ears, respectively, suggesting the suppression of asynchronous pollination on silk emergence. The stubby ears performed higher silking rate and yield compared with the slender ears with or without drought stress. To eliminate the inherent difference in sink capacities, we selected four hybrids for each ear type with similar silk and kernel numbers for further analyses. Interestingly, the stubby ears were less affected in silking rate and thus performed higher yield under drought compared with the slender ears. The finding suggests that ear architecture matters in the determination of drought resistance that deserves more attention in breeding.
