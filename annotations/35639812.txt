Small secreted peptides have been described as key contributors to complex signalling networks that control plant development and stress responses. The Brassicaceae-specific PROSCOOP family encodes precursors of Serine riCh endOgenOus Peptides (SCOOPs). In Arabidopsis SCOOP12 has been shown to promote the defence response against pathogens and to be involved in root development. Here, we explore its role as a moderator of Arabidopsis primary root development. We show that the PROSCOOP12 null mutation leads to longer primary roots through the development of longer differentiated cells while PROSCOOP12 overexpression induces dramatic plant growth impairments. In comparison, the exogenous application of synthetic SCOOP12 peptide shortens roots through meristem size and cell length reductions. Moreover, superoxide anion (O2·-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in root tips vary according to SCOOP12 abundance. By using reactive oxygen species scavengers that suppress the proscoop12 phenotype, we showed that root growth regulation by SCOOP12 is associated with reactive oxygen species metabolism. Furthermore, our results suggest that peroxidases act as potential SCOOP12 downstream targets to regulate H2O2 production, which in turn triggers cell wall modifications in root. Finally, a massive transcriptional reprogramming, including the induction of genes from numerous other pathways, including ethylene, salicylic acid, and glucosinolates biosynthesis, was observed, emphasizing its dual role in defence and development.
