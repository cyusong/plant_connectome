The skin is an important organ that acts as a physical barrier to the outer environment. It is rich in immune cells such as keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, mast cells, and T cells, which provide the first line of defense mechanisms against numerous pathogens by activating both the innate and adaptive response. Cutaneous immunological processes may be stimulated or suppressed by numerous plant extracts via their immunomodulatory properties. Several plants are rich in bioactive molecules; many of these exert antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. The present study describes the impact of plant extracts on the modulation of skin immunity, and their antimicrobial effects against selected skin invaders. Plant products remain valuable counterparts to modern pharmaceuticals and may be used to alleviate numerous skin disorders, including infected wounds, herpes, and tineas.
