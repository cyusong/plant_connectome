The human UV-damaged DNA binding protein (UV-DDB), a heterodimeric protein composed of 127 kDa (UV-DDB1) and 48 kDa (UV-DDB2) subunits, has been shown to be involved in DNA repair. To elucidate the in vivo function of plant UV-DDB2, we have analyzed T-DNA insertion mutants of the Arabidopsis thaliana UV-DDB2 subunit (atuv-ddb2 mutants) and AtUV-DDB2 RNAi silenced plants (atuv-ddb2 silenced plants). atuv-ddb2 mutants and atuv-ddb2 silenced plants were both viable, suggesting that AtUV-DDB2 is not essential for survival. Interestingly, both plant types showed a dwarf phenotype, implying impaired growth of the meristem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first occasion that a dwarf phenotype has been found to be associated with a UV-DDB2 mutation in either plants or animals. The mutants also demonstrated increased sensitivity to UV irradiation, methyl methanesulfonate and hydrogen peroxide treatment, indicating that AtUV-DDB2 is also involved in DNA repair. Our results lead us to suggest that not only does AtUV-DDB2 function in DNA repair, it also has a direct or indirect influence on cell proliferation in the plant meristem.
