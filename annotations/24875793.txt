To study the molecular mechanism that underpins crosstalk between plant growth and disease resistance, we performed a mutant screening on tobacco and created a recessive mutation that caused the phenotype of growth enhancement and resistance impairment (geri1). In the geri1 mutant, growth enhancement accompanies promoted expression of growth-promoting genes, whereas repressed expression of defense response genes is consistent with impaired resistance to diseases caused by viral, bacterial, and oomycete pathogens. The geri1 allele identifies a single genetic locus hypothetically containing the tagged GERI1 gene. The isolated GERI1 gene was predicted to encode auxin-repressed protein ARP1, which was determined to be 13.5 kDa in size. The ARP1/GERI1 gene was further characterized as a repressor of plant growth and an activator of disease resistance based on genetic complementation, gene silencing, and overexpression analyses. ARP1/GERI1 resembles pathogen-associated molecular patterns and is required for them to repress plant growth and activate plant immunity responses. ARP1/GERI1 represses growth by inhibiting the expression of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR gene ARF8, and ARP1/GERI1 recruits the NPR1 gene, which is essential for the salicylic-acid-mediated defense, to coregulate disease resistance. In conclusion, ARP1/GERI1 is an integral regulator for crosstalk between growth and disease resistance in the plant.
