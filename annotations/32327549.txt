['32327549', 'The development of pollen is a prerequisite for double fertilization in  angiosperms. Coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates anterograde transport of  vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. Components of the COPII  complex have been reported to regulate either sporophytic or gametophytic control  of pollen development. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome encodes five  Sar1 isoforms, the small GTPases essential for COPII formation. By using a  dominant negative approach, Sar1 isoforms were proposed to have distinct cargo  specificity despite their sequence similarity. Here, we examined the functions of  three Sar1 isoforms through analysis of transfer DNA insertion mutants and  CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutants. We report that functional loss of Sar1b caused  malfunction of tapetum, leading to male sterility. Ectopic expression of Sar1c  could compensate for Sar1b loss of function in sporophytic control of pollen  development, suggesting that they are interchangeable. Functional distinction  between Sar1b and Sar1c may have resulted from their different gene transcription  levels based on expression analyses. On the other hand, Sar1b and Sar1c  redundantly mediate male gametophytic development such that the sar1b;sar1c  microspores aborted at anther developmental stage 10. This study uncovers the  role of Sar1 isoforms in both sporophytic and gametophytic control of pollen  development. It also suggests that distinct functions of Sar1 isoforms may be  caused by their distinct transcription programs.', '2020 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.20.00159', 'ORCID:']
