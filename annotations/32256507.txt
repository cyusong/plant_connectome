Soybean [<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr.] is an important crop for oil and protein resources worldwide, and its farming is impacted by increasing soil salinity levels. In <i>Arabidopsis</i> the gene <i>EARLY FLOWERING 3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>), increased salt tolerance by suppressing salt stress response pathways. <i>J</i> is the ortholog of <i>AtELF3</i> in soybean, and loss-of-function <i>J</i>-alleles greatly prolong soybean maturity and enhance grain yield. The exact role of <i>J</i> in abiotic stress response in soybean, however, remains unclear. In this study, we showed that <i>J</i> expression was induced by NaCl treatment and that the J protein was located in the nucleus. Compared to NIL-<i>J</i>, tolerance to NaCl was significantly lower in the NIL-<i>j</i> mutant. We also demonstrated that overexpression of <i>J</i> increased NaCl tolerance in transgenic soybean hairy roots. J positively regulated expression of downstream salt stress response genes, including <i>GmWRKY12</i>, <i>GmWRKY27</i>, <i>GmWRKY54, GmNAC</i>, and <i>GmSIN1</i>. Our study disclosed a mechanism in soybean for regulation of the salt stress response. Manipulation of these genes should facilitate improvements in salt tolerance in soybean.
