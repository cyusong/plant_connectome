Climate change has escalated abiotic stresses, leading to adverse effects on plant growth and development, eventually having deleterious consequences on crop productivity. Environmental stresses induce epigenetic changes, namely cytosine DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications, thus altering chromatin structure and gene expression. Stable epigenetic changes are inheritable across generations and this enables plants to adapt to environmental changes (epipriming). Hence, epigenomes serve as a good source of additional tier of variability for development of climate-smart crops. Epigenetic resources such as epialleles, epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs), epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTLs), and epigenetic hybrids (epihybrids) can be utilized in epibreeding for improving stress tolerance of crops. Epigenome engineering is also gaining momentum for developing sustainable epimarks associated with important agronomic traits. Different epigenome editing tools are available for creating, erasing, and reading such epigenetic codes in plant genomes. However, epigenome editing is still understudied in plants due to its complex nature. Epigenetic interventions such as epi-fingerprinting can be exploited in the near future for health and quality assessment of crops under stress conditions. Keeping in view the challenges and opportunities associated with this important technology, the present review intends to enhance understanding of stress-induced epigenetic changes in plants and its prospects for development of climate-ready crops.
