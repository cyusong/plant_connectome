A trade-off between growth and defence functions is commonly observed in plants. We propose that the association of plants with Epichloë fungal endophytes may eliminate this trade-off. This would be a consequence of the double role of these endophytes in host plants: the stimulation of plant growth hormones (e.g. gibberellins) and the fungal production of antiherbivore alkaloids. We put forward a model that integrates this dual effect of endophytes on plant growth and defence and test its predictions by means of meta-analysis of published literature. Our results support the notion that the enhanced plant resistance promoted by endophytes does not compromise plant growth. The limits and ecological benefits of this endophyte-mediated lack of plant growth-defence trade-off are discussed.

Epichloë fungal endophytes: !stimulate! plant growth hormones 
Epichloë fungal endophytes: !produce! antiherbivore alkaloids 
plant growth hormones: !enhance! plant resistance 
antiherbivore alkaloids: !promote! plant resistance 
plant resistance: !does not compromise! plant growth
