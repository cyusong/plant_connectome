Many years have passed since micronuclei were first observed then accepted as an indicator of the effect of mutagens. However, the possible mechanisms of their formation and elimination from the cell are still not fully understood. Various stresses, including mutagens, can alter gene expression through changes in DNA methylation in plants. In this study we demonstrate for the first time DNA methylation in the foci of 5S and 35S rDNA sequences in individual <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> micronuclei that are induced by mutagenic treatment with maleic acid hydrazide (MH). The impact of MH on global epigenetic modifications in nuclei and micronuclei has been studied in plants before; however, no in situ analyses of DNA methylation in specific DNA sequence sites are known. To address this problem, we used sequential immunodetection of 5-methylcytosine and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 5S and 25S rDNA probes on the non-dividing cells of <i>B. distachyon</i>. Such investigations into the presence or absence of DNA methylation within specific DNA sequences are extremely important in plant mutagenesis in the light of altering gene expression.
