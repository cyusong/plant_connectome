Plant defense responses against insect herbivores are induced through wound-induced signaling and the specific perception of herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs). In addition, herbivores can deliver effectors that suppress plant immunity. Here we review plant immune recognition of HAMPs and effectors, and argue that these initial molecular interactions upon a plant-herbivore encounter mediate and structure effective resistance. While the number of distinct HAMPs and effectors from both chewing and piercing-sucking herbivores has expanded rapidly with omics-enabled approaches, paired receptors and targets in the host are still not well characterized. Herbivore-derived effectors may also be recognized as HAMPs depending on the host plant species, potentially through the evolution of novel immune receptor functions. We compile examples of HAMPs and effectors where natural variation between species may inform evolutionary patterns and mechanisms of plant-herbivore interactions. Finally, we discuss the combined effects of wounding and HAMP recognition, and review potential signaling hubs, which may integrate both sensing functions. Understanding the precise mechanisms for plant sensing of herbivores will be critical for engineering resistance in agriculture.
