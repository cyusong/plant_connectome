Callose plays an important role in pollen development in flowering plants. In rice, 10 genes encoding putative callose synthases have been identified; however, none of them has been functionally characterized. In this study, a rice Glucan Synthase-Like 5 (GSL5) knock-out mutant was isolated that exhibited a severe reduction in fertility. Pollen viability tests indicated that the pollen of the mutant was abnormal while the embryo sac was normal. Further, GSL5-RNA interference transgenic plants phenocopied the gsl5 mutant. The RNA expression of GSL5 was found to be knocked out in the gsl5 mutant and knocked down in GSL5-RNA interference transgenic plants by real-time reverse transcripion-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. The male sterility of the mutant was due to abnormal microspore development; an analysis of paraffin sections of the mutant anthers at various developmental stages revealed that abnormal microspore development began in late meiosis. Both the knock-out and knock-down of GSL5 caused a lack of callose in the primary cell wall of meiocytes and in the cell plate of tetrads. As a result, the callose wall of the microspores was defective. This was demonstrated by aniline blue staining and an immunogold labeling assay; the microspores could not maintain their shape, leading to premature swelling and even collapsed microspores. These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice.
