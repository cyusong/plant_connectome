Blue carbon (C) ecosystems are among the most effective C sinks of the biosphere, but methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions can offset their climate cooling effect. Drivers of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from blue C ecosystems and effects of global change are poorly understood. Here we test for the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and its interactions with elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, eutrophication, and plant community composition on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from an estuarine tidal wetland. Changes in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions with SLR are primarily mediated by shifts in plant community composition and associated plant traits that determine both the direction and magnitude of SLR effects on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. We furthermore show strong stimulation of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, whereas effects of eutrophication are not significant. Overall, our findings demonstrate a high sensitivity of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions to global change with important implications for modeling greenhouse-gas dynamics of blue C ecosystems.
