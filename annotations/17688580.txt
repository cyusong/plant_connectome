Pharmacological agents were used to investigate the possible involvement of actin in signalling chains associated with abscisic acid (ABA)-induced ion release from the guard cell vacuole, a process which is absolutely essential for stomatal closure. Effects on the ABA-induced transient stimulation of tonoplast efflux were measured, using (86)Rb in isolated guard cells of Commelina communis, together with effects on stomatal apertures. In the response to 10 microm ABA (triggered by Ca(2+) influx rather than internal Ca(2+) release), jasplakinolide (stabilizing actin filaments) and latrunculin B (depolymerizing actin filaments) had opposite effects. Both closure and the vacuolar efflux transient were inhibited by jasplakinolide but enhanced by latrunculin B. At 10 microm ABA prevention of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by PD98059 partially inhibited closure and reduced the efflux transient. By contrast, latrunculin B inhibited the efflux transient at 0.1 microm ABA (involving internal Ca(2+) release rather than Ca(2+) influx). The results suggest that 10 microm ABA activates Ca(2+)-dependent vacuolar ion efflux via a Ca(2+)-permeable influx channel which is maintained closed by interaction with F-actin. A MAP kinase is also involved, in a chain similar to that postulated for Ca(2+)-dependent gene expression in cold acclimation.
