Reassimilation of internal CO<sub>2</sub> via corticular photosynthesis (PS<sub>cort</sub> ) has an important effect on the carbon economy of trees. However, little is known about its role as a source of O<sub>2</sub> supply to the stem parenchyma and its implications in consumption and movement of O<sub>2</sub> within trees. PS<sub>cort</sub> of young Populus nigra (black poplar) trees was investigated by combining optical micro-optode measurements with monitoring of stem chlorophyll fluorescence. During times of zero sap flow in spring, stem oxygen concentrations (cO<sub>2</sub> ) exhibited large temporal changes. In the sapwood, over 80% of diurnal changes in cO<sub>2</sub> could be explained by respiration rates (R<sub>d(mod)</sub> ). In the cortex, photosynthetic oxygen release during the day altered this relationship. With daytime illumination, oxygen levels in the cortex steadily increased from subambient and even exhibited a diel period of superoxia of up to 110% (% air sat.). By contrast, in the sapwood, cO<sub>2</sub> never reached ambient levels; the diurnal oxygen deficit was up to 25% of air saturation. Our results confirm that PS<sub>cort</sub> is not only a CO<sub>2</sub> -recycling mechanism, it is also a mechanism to actively raise the cortical O<sub>2</sub> concentration and counteract temporal/spatial hypoxia inside plant stems.
