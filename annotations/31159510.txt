<i>Acidovorax citrulli</i> (<i>A. citrulli</i>) strains cause bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) in cucurbit crops and affect melon significantly. Numerous strains of the bacterium have been isolated from melon hosts globally. Strains that are aggressively virulent towards melon and diagnostic markers for detecting such strains are yet to be identified. Using a cross-inoculation assay, we demonstrated that two Korean strains of <i>A. citrulli</i>, NIHHS15-280 and KACC18782, are highly virulent towards melon but avirulent/mildly virulent to the other cucurbit crops. The whole genomes of three <i>A. citrulli</i> strains isolated from melon and three from watermelon were aligned, allowing the design of three primer sets (<i>AcM13, AcM380,</i> and <i>AcM797</i>) that are specific to melon host strains, from three pathogenesis-related genes. These primers successfully detected the target strain NIHHS15-280 in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays from a very low concentration of bacterial gDNA. They were also effective in detecting the target strains from artificially infected leaf, fruit, and seed washing suspensions, without requiring the extraction of bacterial DNA. This is the first report of PCR-based markers that offer reliable, sensitive, and rapid detection of strains of A. citrulli causing BFB in melon. These markers may also be useful in early disease detection in the field samples, in seed health tests, and for international quarantine purposes.
