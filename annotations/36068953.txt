Rice false smut caused by Ustilaginoidea virens is becoming one of the most recalcitrant rice diseases worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying rice immunity against U. virens remain unknown. Using genetic, biochemical and disease resistance assays, we demonstrated that the xb24 knockout lines generated in non-Xa21 rice background exhibit an enhanced susceptibility to the fungal pathogens U. virens and Magnaporthe oryzae. Consistently, flg22- and chitin-induced oxidative burst and expression of pathogenesis-related genes in the xb24 knockout lines were greatly attenuated. As a central mediator of energy signaling, SnRK1A interacts with and phosphorylates XB24 at Thr83 residue to promote ATPase activity. SnRK1A is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and positively regulates plant immune responses and disease resistance. Furthermore, the virulence effector SCRE1 in U. virens targets host ATPase XB24. The interaction inhibits ATPase activity of XB24 by blocking ATP binding to XB24. Meanwhile, SCRE1 outcompetes SnRK1A for XB24 binding, and thereby suppresses SnRK1A-mediated phosphorylation and ATPase activity of XB24. Our results indicate that the conserved SnRK1A-XB24 module in multiple crop plants positively contributes to plant immunity and uncover an unidentified molecular strategy to promote infection in U. virens and a novel host target in fungal pathogenesis.
