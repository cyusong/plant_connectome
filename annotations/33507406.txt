The dormancy release in Avena fatua caryopses was associated with a reduction in the ABA content in embryos, coleorhiza and radicle. The coleorhiza proved more sensitive to KAR<sub>1</sub> and less sensitive to ABA than the radicle. The inability of dormant caryopses and ABA-treated non-dormant caryopses to complete germination is related to inhibition and delayed of cell-cycle activation, respectively. As freshly harvested Avena fatua caryopses are dormant at 20 °C, they cannot complete germination; the radicle is not able to emerge. Both karrikin 1 (KAR<sub>1</sub>) and dry after-ripening release dormancy, enabling the emergence of, first, the coleorhiza and later the radicle. The after-ripening removes caryopse sensitivity to KAR<sub>1</sub> and decreases the sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA). The coleorhiza was found to be more sensitive to KAR<sub>1</sub>, and less sensitive to ABA, than radicles. Effects of KAR<sub>1</sub> and after-ripening were associated with a reduction of the embryo's ABA content during caryopsis germination. KAR<sub>1</sub> was found to decrease the ABA content in the coleorhiza and radicles. Germination of after-ripened caryopses was associated with the progress of cell-cycle activation before coleorhiza emergence. Inhibition of the germination completion due to dormancy or treating the non-dormant caryopses with ABA was associated with a total and partial inhibition of cell-cycle activation, respectively.

after-ripening: !removes! caryopse sensitivity to KAR<sub>1</sub>
after-ripening: !decreases! sensitivity to ABA
coleorhiza: !more sensitive to! KAR<sub>1</sub>
radicle: !less sensitive to! ABA
