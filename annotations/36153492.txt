Fruit tree yield and fruit quality are affected by the tree's growth type, and branching angle is an important agronomic trait of fruit trees, which largely determines the crown structure. The weeping type of peach tree shows good ventilation and light transmission; therefore, it is commonly cultivated. However, there is no molecular marker closely linked with peach weeping traits for target gene screening and assisted breeding. First, we confirmed that the peach weeping trait is a recessive trait controlled by a single gene by constructing segregating populations. Based on BSA-seq, we mapped the gene controlling this trait within 159 kb of physical distance on chromosome 3. We found a 35 bp deletion in the candidate area in standard type, which was not lacking in weeping type. For histological assessments, different types of branches were sliced and examined, showing fiber bundles in the secondary xylem of ordinary branches but not in weeping branches. This study established a molecular marker that is firmly linked to weeping trait. This marker can be used for the selection of parents in the breeding process and the early screening of hybrid offspring to shorten the breeding cycle. Moreover, we preliminary explored histological differences between growth types. These results lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the weeping growth habit of peach trees.
