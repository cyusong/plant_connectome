Electrochemical fingerprinting can collect the electrochemical behavior of electrochemically active molecules in plant tissues, so it is regarded as a new plant analysis technology. Because the signal of electrochemical fingerprinting is positively correlated with the amount and type of electrochemically active molecules in plant tissues, it can also be used to reflect genetic differences between different species. Previous electrochemical fingerprinting techniques have been frequently used in phylogenetic studies of herbaceous plants. In this work, 19 <i>Quercus</i> species (17 evergreen or semi evergreen species and 2 deciduous species) were selected for investigation. The results indicated the electrochemical fingerprint of some species share similar features but can be distinguished after changing the recording condition (extraction solvent and electrolyte). The two sets of electrochemical fingerprint data can be used to construct different pattern recognition technology, which further speeds up the recognition efficiency. These electrochemical fingerprints were further used in phylogenetic investigations. The phylogenetic results deduced from electrochemical fingerprinting were divided mainly into three clusters. These can provide evidence for some of these arguments as well as new results.
