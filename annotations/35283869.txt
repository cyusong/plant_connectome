The effects of twelve different pre-drying and drying methods on the chemical composition in the pericarp and kernel of <i>Amomum tsao-ko</i> were studied. The volatile components were isolated from the samples by simultaneous distillation and extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sixty and thirty-eight compounds were identified from pericarp and kernel, respectively, and the main constituents were oxygenated monoterpenes. These compounds were not only significantly affected by pre-drying and drying methods but also varied in content due to different tissue locations. The total volatile content of pericarp varied from 0.70 to 1.55%, with the highest obtained by microwave-dried samples (150 W) and the lowest in freeze-dried samples. The total volatile content of the kernel varied from 6.11 to 10.69%, with the highest content obtained during sun drying (SD) and the lowest content in samples treated with boiling water for 2 min. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the highest compounds in pericarp and kernel, which were also the most affected by drying methods. The highest content of oxygenated monoterpenes in the pericarp (0.77%) could be obtained by boiling water treatment for 5 min, and the highest content of oxygenated monoterpenes in the kernel (7.48%) could be obtained by SD. Additionally, the main components such as 1,8-cineole, 2-carene, (<i>Z</i>)-citral, nerolidol, (<i>Z</i>)-2-decenal, (<i>E</i>)-2-dodecenal, citral, (<i>E</i>)-2-octenal, 4-propylbenzaldehyde, and phthalan showed remarkable variations in pre-drying and drying methods.
