['25270985', 'Plant purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) belong to a relatively large gene family  whose individual functions are poorly understood. Three PAP isozymes that are  up-regulated in the cell walls of phosphate (Pi)-starved (-Pi) Arabidopsis  thaliana suspension cells were purified and identified by MS as AtPAP12  (At2g27190), AtPAP25 (At4g36350) and AtPAP26 (At5g34850). AtPAP12 and AtPAP26  were previously isolated from the culture medium of -Pi cell cultures, and shown  to be secreted by roots of Arabidopsis seedlings to facilitate Pi scavenging from  soil-localized organophosphates. AtPAP25 exists as a 55 kDa monomer containing  complex NX(S/T) glycosylation motifs at Asn172, Asn367 and Asn424. Transcript  profiling and immunoblotting with anti-AtPAP25 immune serum indicated that  AtPAP25 is exclusively synthesized under -Pi conditions. Coupled with potent  mixed-type inhibition of AtPAP25 by Pi (I50 = 50 mum), this indicates a tight  feedback control by Pi that prevents AtPAP25 from being synthesized or  functioning as a phosphatase except when Pi levels are quite low. Promoter-GUS  reporter assays revealed AtPAP25 expression in shoot vascular tissue of -Pi  plants. Development of an atpap25 T-DNA insertion mutant was arrested during  cultivation on soil lacking soluble Pi, but rescued upon Pi fertilization or  complementation with AtPAP25. Transcript profiling by quantitative RT-PCR  indicated that Pi starvation signaling was attenuated in the atpap25 mutant.  AtPAP25 exhibited near-optimal phosphatase activity with several phosphoproteins  and phosphoamino acids as substrates. We hypothesize that AtPAP25 plays a key  signaling role during Pi deprivation by functioning as a phosphoprotein  phosphatase rather than as a non-specific scavenger of Pi from extracellular  P-monoesters.', '2014 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12663', 'Plaxton']
