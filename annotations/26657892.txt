One of the classical research plants in plant biology, Marchantia polymorpha, is drawing attention as a new model system. Its ease of genetic transformation and a genome sequencing project have attracted attention to the species. Here I present a thorough assessment of the taxonomic status, anatomy and developmental morphology of each organ and tissue of the gametophyte and sporophyte on the basis of a thorough review of the literature and my own observations. Marchantia polymorpha has been a subject of intensive study for nearly 200 years, and the information summarized here offers an invaluable resource for future studies on this model plant.
