Tandem repeats can occupy a large portion of plant genomes and can either cause or result from chromosomal rearrangements, which are important drivers of dysploidy-mediated karyotype evolution and speciation. To understand the contribution of tandem repeats in shaping the extant <i>Senna tora</i> dysploid karyotype, we analyzed the composition and abundance of tandem repeats in the <i>S. tora</i> genome and compared the chromosomal distribution of these repeats between <i>S. tora</i> and a closely related euploid, <i>Senna occidentalis</i>. Using a read clustering algorithm, we identified the major <i>S. tora</i> tandem repeats and visualized their chromosomal distribution by fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization. We identified eight independent repeats covering ~85 Mb or ~12% of the <i>S. tora</i> genome. The unit lengths and copy numbers had ranges of 7-5,833 bp and 325-2.89 × 10<sup>6</sup>, respectively. Three short duplicated sequences were found in the 45S rDNA intergenic spacer, one of which was also detected at an extra-NOR locus. The canonical plant telomeric repeat (TTTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> was also detected as very intense signals in numerous pericentromeric and interstitial loci. StoTR05_180, which showed subtelomeric distribution in <i>Senna occidentalis</i>, was predominantly pericentromeric in <i>S. tora</i>. The unusual chromosomal distribution of tandem repeats in <i>S. tora</i> not only enabled easy identification of individual chromosomes but also revealed the massive chromosomal rearrangements that have likely played important roles in shaping its dysploid karyotype.
