['23057675', 'Activation tagging is a powerful tool for discovering novel genes that are not  easily identified by loss-of-function (lof) screening due to genetic redundancy  or lethality. Although the current activation tagging system, which involves a  viral enhancer sequence, has been used for a decade, alternative methods that  allow organ- or tissue-specific activation are required to identify genes whose  strong activation leads to loss of fertility or viability. Here, we established a  GAL4/UAS activation-tagging system in Arabidopsis thaliana. Host plants that  express a synthetic transcription activator GAL4:VP16 (GV) in an organ- or  tissue-specific manner were transformed with a T-DNA harboring tandem copies of  UAS, a GAL4-binding sequence. Using a post-embryonic and root-specific  GV-expressing line as the host plant, we isolated several dominant mutants with  abnormal root tissue patterns, designated as uas-tagged root patterning (urp)  mutants, and identified their causal genes. Notably, most URP genes encoded  putative transcription factors, indicating that the GAL4/UAS activation tagging  system effectively identifies genes with regulatory functions. lof phenotypes of  most URP genes were either local patterning defects or visible only if homologous  genes were disrupted simultaneously or independently. Systemic overexpression of  some URP genes resulted in seedling lethality. These results indicate that  GAL4/UAS activation tagging is a powerful method for identifying genes with  biological functions that are not readily identified by conventional screening  methods.', '2013 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12049', 'Nakajima']
