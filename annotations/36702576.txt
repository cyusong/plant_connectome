PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) repress photosynthetic genes partly by upregulating REPRESSOR OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC GENES 1 (RPGE1) and RPGE2. However, it is unknown how RPGEs inhibit gene expression at the molecular level. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RPGE overexpression lines display extensive similarities to the golden2-like 1 (glk1)/glk2 double mutant at the phenotypic and transcriptomic levels, prompting us to hypothesize that there is a close molecular relationship between RPGEs and chloroplast development-regulating GLK transcription factors. Indeed, we found that RPGE1 disrupts the homodimerization of GLK1 by interacting with its dimerization domain and debilitates the DNA-binding activity of GLK1. The interaction was not restricted to the Arabidopsis RPGE1-GLK1 pair, but rather extended to RPGE-GLK homolog pairs across species, providing a molecular basis for the pale green leaves of Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing a rice (Oryza sativa) RPGE homolog. Our discovery of RPGE-GLK regulatory pairs suggests that any condition leading to an increase in RPGE levels would decrease the expression levels of GLK target genes. Consistently, we found that shade, which upregulates the RPGE mRNA by stabilizing PIFs, represses the expression of photosynthetic genes partly by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of GLK1. Taken together, these results indicate that RPGE-GLK regulatory pairs regulate photosynthetic gene expression downstream of PIFs.
