Agronomic treatments such as the application of nitrogen fertilizer and topping (removal of the inflorescence and top leaves) cause substantial changes in plant metabolism. To explore these changes, we conducted comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of leaves collected from four positions along the stem on plants exposed to two nitrogen doses and with different numbers of leaves retained after topping in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). We identified 13,330 unique differentially expressed genes and 32 differentially abundant metabolites. Through RNA-seq and WGCNA analyze, we constructed 2 co-expression networks (green and blue) highly correlation to N application and leaf number retained, predicted a hub gene NtGER3 may play an important role in N metabolism related to amino acid (cysteine) through CK pathway in tobacco leaves, NtARFs may participated in modulating the auxin signal and N in bottom leaves and NtRAP2.12 as key gene involved in N regulation by ethylene pathway. What's more, our data prove C/N transformation and balance affect the "source - flow - sink" redistribution and remobilization in tobacco during growth and development process. Overall, this comparative transcriptomics study provides novel insight into the complex molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to different levels of nitrogen application and the number of leaves remaining after topping in plants.
