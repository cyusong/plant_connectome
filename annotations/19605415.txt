Rice glutelin RNAs are localized to the cisternal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a regulated RNA transport process requiring specific cis-localization elements. We set out to identify these glutelin sequences by their dominant character of being able to re-direct the normal protein body ER localization of a maize 10 kDa delta-zein RNA to the cisternal ER. In situ RNA localization analysis showed that the glutelin RNA contains multiple cis-localization elements; two located at the 5' and 3' ends of the coding sequences and a third located within the 3'-untranslated region. These three regions contain two conserved sequences, suggesting that these RNA recognition signals may be sequence based.
