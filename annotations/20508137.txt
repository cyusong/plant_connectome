MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of plant growth and development. Previously, we identified a group of conserved and novel miRNA families from soybean (Glycine max) roots. Many of these miRNAs are specifically induced during soybean-Bradyrhizobium japonicum interactions. Here, we examined the gene expression levels of six families of novel miRNAs and investigated their functions in nodule development. We used northern-blot analyses to study the tissue specificity and time course of miRNA expression. Transgenic expression of miR482, miR1512, and miR1515 led to significant increases of nodule numbers, while root length, lateral root density, and the number of nodule primordia were not altered in all tested miRNA lines. We also found differential expression of these miRNAs in nonnodulating and supernodulating soybean mutants. The expression levels of 22 predicted target genes regulated by six novel miRNAs were studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. These results suggested that miRNAs play important roles in soybean nodule development.
