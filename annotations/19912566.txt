NHX-type antiporters in the tonoplast have been reported to increase the salt tolerance of various plants species, and are thought to mediate the compartmentation of Na(+) in vacuoles. However, all isoforms characterized so far catalyze both Na(+)/H(+) and K(+)/H(+) exchange. Here, we show that AtNHX1 has a critical involvement in the subcellular partitioning of K(+), which in turn affects plant K(+) nutrition and Na(+) tolerance. Transgenic tomato plants overexpressing AtNHX1 had larger K(+) vacuolar pools in all growth conditions tested, but no consistent enhancement of Na(+) accumulation was observed under salt stress. Plants overexpressing AtNHX1 have a greater capacity to retain intracellular K(+) and to withstand salt-shock. Under K(+)-limiting conditions, greater K(+) compartmentation in the vacuole occurred at the expense of the cytosolic K(+) pool, which was lower in transgenic plants. This caused the early activation of the high-affinity K(+) uptake system, enhanced K(+) uptake by roots, and increased the K(+) content in plant tissues and the xylem sap of transformed plants. Our results strongly suggest that NHX proteins are likely candidates for the H(+)-linked K(+) transport that is thought to facilitate active K(+) uptake at the tonoplast, and the partitioning of K(+) between vacuole and cytosol.
