Constitutive genomes of allopolyploid species evolve throughout their life span. However, the consequences of long-term alterations on the interdependency between each original genome have not been established. Here, we attempted an approach corresponding to subgenome extraction from a previously sequenced natural allotetraploid, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate plant viability and structural evolution of one of its diploid components. We employed two different strategies to extract the diploid AA component of the Brassica napus variety 'Darmor' (AACC, 2n = 4x = 38) and we assessed the genomic structure of the latest AA plants obtained (after four to five rounds of selection), using a 60K single nucleotide polymorphism Illumina array. Only one strategy was successful and the diploid AA plants that were structurally characterized presented a lower proportion of the B. napus A subgenome extracted than expected. In addition, our analyses revealed that some genes lost in a polyploid context appeared to be compensated for plant survival, either by conservation of genomic regions from B. rapa, used in the initial cross, or by some introgressions from the B. napus C subgenome. We conclude that as little as c. 7500 yr of coevolution could lead to subgenome interdependency in the allotetraploid B. napus as a result of structural modifications.
