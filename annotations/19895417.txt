The stereospecific 5 beta-reduction of progesterone is a required step for cardiac glycoside biosynthesis in foxglove plants. Recently, we have isolated the gene P5 beta R, and here we investigate the function and regulation of P5 beta R2, a new progesterone 5 beta-reductase gene from Digitalis purpurea. P5 beta R2 cDNA was isolated from a D. purpurea cDNA library and further characterized at the biochemical, structural and physiological levels. Like P5 beta R, P5 beta R2 catalyzes the 5 beta-reduction of the Delta(4) double bond of several steroids and is present in all plant organs. Under stress conditions or on treatment with chemical elicitors, P5 beta R expression does not vary, whereas P5 beta R2 is highly responsive. P5 beta R2 expression is regulated by ethylene and hydrogen peroxide. The correlation between P5 beta R2 expression and cardenolide formation demonstrates the key role of this gene in cardenolide biosynthesis, and therefore in the chemical defense of foxglove plants.
