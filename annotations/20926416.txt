Plasma membrane fluxes of the large unicellular model algal cell Eremosphaera viridis (De Bary) were measured under various light regimes to explore the role of plasma membrane fluxes during photosynthesis and high light-induced chloroplast translocation. Plasma membrane fluxes were measured directly and non-invasively with self-referencing ion-selective (H(+), Ca(2+), K(+) and Cl(-)) potentiometric microelectrodes and oxygen amperometric microelectrodes. At light irradiances high enough to induce chloroplast migration from the cell periphery to its center, oxygen evolution declined to respiratory net O(2) uptake prior to any significant chloroplast translocation, while net K(+) and Cl(-) influx increased during the decline in photosynthetic activity (and the membrane potential depolarized). The results suggest that chloroplast translocation is not the cause of the cessation of O(2) evolution at high irradiance. Rather, the chloroplast translocation may play a protective role: shielding the centrally located nucleus from damaging light intensities. At both high and low light intensities (similar to ambient growth conditions), there was a strong inverse correlation between H(+) net fluxes and respiratory and photosynthetic net O(2) fluxes. A similar inverse relationship was also observed for Ca(2+) net fluxes, but only at higher light intensities. The net H(+) fluxes are small relative to the buffering capacity of the cell, but are clearly related to both photosynthetic and respiratory activity.
