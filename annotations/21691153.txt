Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit stable diurnal growth profiles that are controlled by the circadian clock. Here we describe the effects of mutations in leaf starch metabolism on the diurnal root growth characteristics of Arabidopsis thaliana. High temporal and spatial resolution video imaging was performed to quantify the growth kinetics of Arabidopsis wild-type as well as pgm, sex1, mex1, dpe1 and dpe2 starch metabolism mutants grown in three different photoperiods. As a result, root growth patterns of all genotypes displayed characteristic modifications in their diurnal kinetics that were also affected by the photoperiod. To further investigate the role of starch derived substrate deficiency on root growth, the effect of 0.05% extracellular sucrose was studied in 12 h-12 h light-dark cycles.
