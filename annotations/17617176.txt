['17617176', 'The key regulatory role of abscisic acid (ABA) in many physiological processes in  plants is well established. However, compared with other plant hormones, the  molecular mechanisms underlying ABA signalling are poorly characterized. In this  work, a specific catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac-2) has been  identified as a component of the signalling pathway that represses responses to  ABA. A loss-of-function pp2ac-2 mutant is hypersensitive to ABA. Moreover,  pp2ac-2 plants have altered responses in developmental and environmental  processes that are mediated by ABA, such as primary and lateral root development,  seed germination and responses to drought and high salt and sugar stresses.  Conversely, transgenic plants overexpressing PP2Ac-2 are less sensitive to ABA  than wild type, a phenotype that is manifested in all the above-mentioned  physiological processes. DNA microarray hybridization experiments reveal that  PP2Ac-2 is negatively involved in ABA responses through regulation of  ABA-dependent gene expression. Moreover, the results obtained indicate that ABA  antagonistically regulates PP2Ac-2 expression and PP2Ac-2 activity thus allowing  plant sensitivity to the hormone to be reset after induction. Phenotypic, genetic  and gene expression data strongly suggest that PP2Ac-2 is a negative regulator of  the ABA pathway. Activity of protein phosphatase 2A thus emerges as a key element  in the control of ABA signalling.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03179.x', 'Sanchez-Serrano']
