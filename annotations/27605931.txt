['27605931', 'Plant zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) comprise a large protein family and they are  mainly involved in abiotic stress tolerance. Although Arabidopsis RING/FYVE/PHD  ZFP At5g62460 (AtRZFP) is found to bind to zinc, whether it is involved in  abiotic stress tolerance is still unknown. In the present study, we characterized  the roles of AtRZFP in response to abiotic stresses. The expression of AtRZFP was  induced significantly by salt and osmotic stress. AtRZFP positively mediates  tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. Additionally, compared with wild-type  Arabidopsis plants, plants overexpressing AtRZFP showed reduced reactive oxygen  species (ROSs) accumulation, enhanced superoxide dismutase and peroxidase  activity, increased soluble sugars and proline contents, reduced K(+) loss,  decreased Na(+) accumulation, stomatal aperture and the water loss rate.  Conversely, AtRZFP knockout plants displayed the opposite physiological changes  when exposed to salt or osmotic stress conditions. These data suggested that  AtRZFP enhances salt and osmotic tolerance through a series of physiological  processes, including enhanced ROSs scavenging, maintaining Na(+) and K(+)  homeostasis, controlling the stomatal aperture to reduce the water loss rate, and  accumulating soluble sugars and proline to adjust the osmotic potential.', '2016', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2016.01272', 'Wang']
