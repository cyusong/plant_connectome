Wood formation was present in early angiosperms, but has been highly modified through evolution to generate the anatomical diversity seen in extant angiosperm lineages. In this project, we modeled changes in gene coexpression relationships associated with the evolution of wood formation in a phylogenetic survey of 13 angiosperm tree species. Gravitropic stimulation was used as an experimental treatment to alter wood formation and also perturb gene expression. Gene transcript abundances were determined using RNA sequencing of developing wood tissues from upright trees, and from the top (tension wood) and bottom (opposite wood) tissues of gravistimulated trees. A network-based approach was employed to align gene coexpression networks across species based on orthologous relationships. A large-scale, multilayer network was modeled that identified both lineage-specific gene coexpression modules and modules conserved across multiple species. Functional annotation and analysis of modules identified specific regulatory processes associated with conserved modules, including regulation of hormones, protein phosphorylation, meristem development and epigenetic processes. Our results provide novel insights into the evolution and development of wood formation, and demonstrate the ability to identify biological processes and genes important for the evolution of a foundational trait in nonmodel, undomesticated forest trees.
