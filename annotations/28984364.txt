['28984364', 'Stromules, or stroma-filled tubules, are thin extensions of the plastid envelope  membrane that are most frequently observed in undifferentiated or non-mesophyll  cells. The formation of stromules is developmentally regulated and responsive to  biotic and abiotic stress; however, the physiological roles and molecular  mechanisms of the stromule formation remain enigmatic. Accordingly, we attempted  to obtain Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with aberrant stromule biogenesis in the  leaf epidermis. Here, we characterize one of the obtained mutants. Plastids in  the leaf epidermis of this mutant were giant and pleomorphic, typically having  one or more constrictions that indicated arrested plastid division, and usually  possessed one or more extremely long stromules, which indicated the deregulation  of stromule formation. Genetic mapping, whole-genome resequencing-aided exome  analysis, and gene complementation identified PARC6/CDP1/ARC6H, which encodes a  vascular plant-specific, chloroplast division site-positioning factor, as the  causal gene for the stromule phenotype. Yeast two-hybrid assay and double mutant  analysis also identified a possible interaction between PARC6 and MinD1, another  known chloroplast division site-positioning factor, during the morphogenesis of  leaf epidermal plastids. To the best of our knowledge, PARC6 is the only known A.  thaliana chloroplast division factor whose mutations more extensively affect the  morphology of plastids in non-mesophyll tissue than in mesophyll tissue.  Therefore, the present study demonstrates that PARC6 plays a pivotal role in the  morphology maintenance and stromule regulation of non-mesophyll plastids.', '2018 Apr', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/ppl.12648', 'Fujiwara']
