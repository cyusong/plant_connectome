The energy status of plant cells strongly depends on the energy metabolism in chloroplasts and mitochondria, which are capable of generating ATP either by photosynthetic or oxidative phosphorylation, respectively. Another energy-rich metabolite inside plastids is the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). However, chloroplasts and most non-green plastids lack the ability to generate PEP via a complete glycolytic pathway. Hence, PEP import mediated by the plastidic PEP/phosphate translocator or PEP provided by the plastidic enolase are vital for plant growth and development. In contrast to chloroplasts, metabolism in non-green plastids (amyloplasts) of starch-storing tissues strongly depends on both the import of ATP mediated by the plastidic nucleotide transporter NTT and of carbon (glucose 6-phosphate, Glc6P) mediated by the plastidic Glc6P/phosphate translocator (GPT). Both transporters have been shown to co-limit starch biosynthesis in potato plants. In addition, non-photosynthetic plastids as well as chloroplasts during the night rely on the import of energy in the form of ATP via the NTT. During energy starvation such as prolonged darkness, chloroplasts strongly depend on the supply of ATP which can be provided by lipid respiration, a process involving chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria and the transport of intermediates, i.e. fatty acids, ATP, citrate, and oxaloacetate across their membranes. The role of transporters involved in the provision of energy-rich metabolites and in pathways supplying plastids with metabolic energy is summarized here.
