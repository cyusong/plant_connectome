Neuroactive metabolites from the bark of <i>Galbulimima belgraveana</i> occur in variable distributions among trees and are not easily accessible through chemical synthesis because of elaborate bond networks and dense stereochemistry. Previous syntheses of complex congeners such as himgaline have relied on iterative, stepwise installation of multiple methine stereocenters. We decreased the synthetic burden of himgaline chemical space to nearly one-third of the prior best (7 to 9 versus 19 to 31 steps) by cross-coupling high fraction aromatic building blocks (high F<sub>sp</sub>2) followed by complete, stereoselective reduction to high fraction sp<sup>3</sup> products (high F<sub>sp</sub>3). This short entry into <i>Galbulimima</i> alkaloid space should facilitate extensive chemical exploration and biological interrogation.
