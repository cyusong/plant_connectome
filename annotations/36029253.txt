The plant economics spectrum describes the trade-off between plant resource acquisition and storage, and sheds light on plant responses to environmental changes. However, the data used to construct the plant economics spectrum comes mainly from seed plants, thereby neglecting vascular non-seed plant lineages such as the ferns. To address this omission, we evaluated whether a fern economics spectrum exists using leaf and root traits of 23 fern species living under three subtropical forest conditions differing in light intensity and nutrient gradients. The fern leaf and root traits were found to be highly correlated and formed a plant economics spectrum. Specific leaf mass and root tissue density were found to be on one side of the spectrum (conservative strategy), whereas photosynthesis rate, specific root area, and specific root length were on the other side of the spectrum (acquisitive strategy). Ferns had higher photosynthesis and respiration rates, and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency under high light conditions and higher specific root area and lower root tissue density in high nutrient environments. However, environmental changes did not significantly affect their resource acquisition strategies. Thus, the plant economics spectrum can be broadened to include ferns, which expands its phylogenetic and ecological implications and utility.
