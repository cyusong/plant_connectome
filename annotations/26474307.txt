Potassium (K(+) ) is the most important cationic nutrient for all living organisms. Vacuolar two-pore K(+) (TPK) channels are important players in the regulation of cellular levels of K(+) but have not been characterised in rice. In order to assess the role of OsTPKb, a K(+) selective ion channel predominantly expressed in the tonoplast of small vacuoles, we generated overexpressing (OX) lines using a constitutive promoter and compared their phenotypes with control plants. Relative to control plants, OX lines showed better growth when exposed to low-K(+) or water stress conditions. K(+) uptake was greater in OX lines which may be driven by increased AKT1 and HAK1 activity. The enhanced K(+) uptake led to tissue K(+) levels that were raised in roots and shoots. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses showed a higher cytoplasm: vacuole K(+) ratio which is likely to contribute to the increased stress tolerance. In all, the data suggest that TPKb can alter the K(+) status of small vacuoles, which is important for general cellular K(+) homeostasis which, in turn, affects stress tolerance.
