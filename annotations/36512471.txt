Tight control of lateral root (LR) initiation is vital for root system architecture and function. Regulation of cortical microtubule reorganization is involved in the asymmetric radial expansion of founder cells during LR initiation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, critical genetic evidence on the role of microtubules in LR initiation is lacking and the mechanisms underlying this regulation are poorly understood. Here, we found that the previously uncharacterized microtubule-stabilizing protein TPX2-LIKE5 (TPXL5) participates in LR initiation, which is finely regulated by the transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). In tpxl5 mutants, LR density was decreased and more LR primordia (LRPs) remained in stage I, indicating delayed LR initiation. In particular, the cell width in the peripheral domain of LR founder cells after the first asymmetric cell division was larger in tpxl5 mutants than in the wild-type. Consistently, ordered transverse cortical microtubule arrays were not well generated in tpxl5 mutants. In addition, HY5 directly targeted the promoter of TPXL5 and downregulated TPXL5 expression. The hy5 mutant exhibited higher LR density and fewer stage I LRPs, indicating accelerated LR initiation. Such phenotypes were partially suppressed by TPXL5 knockout. Taken together, our data provide genetic evidence supporting the notion that cortical microtubules are essential for LR initiation and unravel a molecular mechanism underlying HY5 regulation of TPXL5-mediated microtubule reorganization and cell remodeling during LR initiation.
