Circadian clocks are biochemical timers regulating many physiological and molecular processes according to the day/night cycle. The small GTPase LIGHT INSENSITIVE PERIOD1 (LIP1) is a circadian clock-associated protein that regulates light input to the clock. In the absence of LIP1, the effect of light on free-running period length is much reduced. Here, we show that in addition to suppressing red and blue light-mediated photomorphogenesis, LIP1 is also required for light-controlled inhibition of endoreplication and tolerance to salt stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We demonstrate that in the processes of endoreplication and photomorphogenesis, LIP1 acts downstream of the red and blue light photoreceptors phytochrome B and cryptochromes. Manipulation of the subcellular distribution of LIP1 revealed that the circadian function of LIP1 requires nuclear localization of the protein. Our data collectively suggest that LIP1 influences several signaling cascades and that its role in the entrainment of the circadian clock is independent from the other pleiotropic effects. Since these functions of LIP1 are important for the early stages of development or under conditions normally experienced by germinating seedlings, we suggest that LIP1 is a regulator of seedling establishment.
