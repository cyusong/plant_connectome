In Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells, ABA was previously shown to promote the activation of anion channels and the reduction of proton pumping that both contribute to the plasma membrane depolarization. These two ABA responses were shown to induce two successive [Ca(2+)](cyt) spikes. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as components of ABA signaling pathways especially by promoting [Ca(2+)](cyt) variations, we studied whether ROS were involved in the regulation of anion channels and proton pumps activities. Here we demonstrated that ABA induced ROS production which triggered the second of the two [Ca(2+)](cyt) increases observed in response to ABA. Blocking ROS generation using diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) impaired the proton pumping reduction, the anion channel activation and the RD29A gene expression in response to ABA. Furthermore, H(2)O(2) was shown to activate anion channels and to inhibit plasma membrane proton pumping, as did ABA. However, ROS partially mimicked ABA's effects since H(2)O(2) treatment elicited anion channel activation but not the subsequent expression of the RD29A gene as did ABA. This suggests that expression of the RD29A gene in response to ABA results from the activation of multiple concomitant signaling pathways: blocking of one of them would impair gene expression whereas stimulating only one would not. We conclude that ROS are a central messenger of ABA in the signaling pathways leading to the plasma membrane depolarization induced by ABA.
