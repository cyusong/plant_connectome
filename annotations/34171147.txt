Non-host resistance (NHR), which protects all members of a plant species from non-adapted or non-host plant pathogens, is the most common form of plant immunity. NHR provides the most durable and robust form of broad-spectrum immunity against non-adaptive pathogens pathogenic to other crop species. In a mutant screen for loss of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) NHR against the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) pathogen Phytophthora sojae, the Phytophthora sojae-susceptible 30 (pss30) mutant was identified. The pss30 mutant is also susceptible to the soybean pathogen Fusarium virguliforme. PSS30 encodes a folate transporter, AtFOLT1, which was previously localized to chloroplasts and implicated in the transport of folate from the cytosol to plastids. We show that two Arabidopsis folate biosynthesis mutants with reduced folate levels exhibit a loss of non-host immunity against P. sojae. As compared to the wild-type Col-0 ecotype, the steady-state folate levels are reduced in the pss1, atfolt1 and two folate biosynthesis mutants, suggesting that folate is required for non-host immunity. Overexpression of AtFOLT1 enhances immunity of transgenic soybean lines against two serious soybean pathogens, the fungal pathogen F. virguliforme and the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines. Transgenic lines showing enhanced SCN resistance also showed increased levels of folate accumulation. This study thus suggests that folate contributes to non-host plant immunity and that overexpression of a non-host resistance gene could be a suitable strategy for generating broad-spectrum disease resistance in crop plants.
