Plants exhibit respiratory bypasses (e.g., the alternative oxidase [AOX]) and increase the synthesis of carboxylates in their organs (leaves and roots) in response to phosphorus (P) deficiency, which increases P uptake capacity. They also show differential expression of high-affinity inorganic phosphorus (Pi) transporters, thus avoiding P toxicity at a high P availability. The association between AOX and carboxylate synthesis was tested in Solanum lycopersicum plants grown at different soil P availability, by using plants grown under P-sufficient and P-limiting conditions and by applying a short-term (24 hr) P-sufficient pulse to plants grown under P limitation. Tests were also performed with plants colonized with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which increased plant P concentration under reduced P availability. The in vivo activities of AOX and cytochrome oxidase were measured together with the concentration of carboxylates and the P concentration in plant organs. Gene transcription of Pi transporters (LePT1 and LePT2) was also studied. A coordinated response between plant P concentration with these traits was observed, indicating that a sufficient P availability in soil led to a suppression of both AOX activity and synthesis of citrate and a downregulation of the transcription of genes encoding high-affinity Pi transporters, presumably to avoid P toxicity.
