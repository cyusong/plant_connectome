['9208946', 'Two methyl transfers are involved in the course of plant sterol biosynthesis and  responsible for the formation of 24-alkyl sterols (mainly 24-ethyl sterols) which  play major roles in plant growth and development. The first methyl transfer  applies to cycloartenol, the second one to 24-methylene lophenol. Five cDNA  clones encoding two Arabidopsis thaliana, two Nicotiana tabacum and one Ricinus  communis S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) sterol methyltransferases (SMT) were  isolated. The deduced amino acid sequences of A. thaliana and N. tabacum SMT are  about 80% identical in all possible combinations. In contrast they are about 40%  identical with the deduced amino acid sequence of R. communis SMT and the  published Glycine max sequence. Both A. thaliana and one N. tabacum SMT cDNAs  were expressed in a yeast null mutant erg6, deficient in AdoMet zymosterol  C24-methyltransferase and containing C24-non-alkylated sterols. In all cases,  several 24-ethylidene sterols were synthesized. A thorough study of the sterolic  composition of erg6 expressing the A. thaliana cDNA 411 (erg6-4118-pYeDP60)  showed 24-methylene and 24-ethylidene derivatives of 4-desmethyl, 4alpha-methyl  and 4,4-dimethyl sterols as well as 24-methyl and 24-ethyl derivatives of  4-desmethyl sterols. The structure of 5alpha-stigmasta-8,  Z-24(24(1))-dien-3beta-ol, the major sterol of transformed yeasts, was  demonstrated by 400 MHz 1H NMR. Microsomes from erg6-4118-pYeDP60 were shown to  possess AdoMet-dependent sterol-C-methyltransferase activity. Delipidated  preparations of these microsomes converted cycloartenol into 24-methylene  cycloartanol and 24-methylene lophenol into 24-ethylidene lophenol, thus allowing  the first identification of a plant sterol-C-methyltransferase cDNA. The  catalytic efficiency of the expressed SMT was 17-times higher with 24-methylene  lophenol than with cycloartenol. This result provides evidence that the A.  thaliana cDNA 411 (and most probably the 3 plant SMT cDNAs presenting 80%  identity with it) encodes a 24-methylene lophenol-C-24(1) methyltransferase  catalyzing the second methylation step of plant sterol biosynthesis.', '1997 Jun 1', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.t01-1-00518.x', 'Benveniste']
