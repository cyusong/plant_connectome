A major limiting factor for plant growth is the aluminum (Al) toxicity in acidic soils, especially in tropical regions. The exclusion of Al from the root apex through root exudation of organic acids such as malate and citrate is one of the most ubiquitous tolerance mechanisms in the plant kingdom. Two families of anion channels that confer Al tolerance are well described in the literature, ALMT and MATE family. In this study, sugarcane plants constitutively overexpressing the Sorghum bicolor MATE gene (SbMATE) showed improved tolerance to Al when compared to non-transgenic (NT) plants, characterized by sustained root growth and exclusion of aluminum from the root apex based on the result obtained with hematoxylin staining. In addition, genome-wide analysis of the recently released sugarcane genome identified 11 ALMT genes and molecular studies showed potential new targets for aluminum tolerance. Our results indicate that the transgenic plants overexpressing the Sorghum bicolor MATE has an improved tolerance to Al. The expression profile of ALMT genes revels potential candidate genes to be used has an alternative for agricultural expansion in Brazil and other areas with aluminum toxicity in poor and acid soils.

SbMATE: !overexpresses! improved Al tolerance
ALMT genes: !identifies! potential targets for Al tolerance
