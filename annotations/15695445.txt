The preprophase band (PPB) of microtubules is thought to be involved in deciding the future division site. In this study, we investigated the effects of double PPBs on spindle formation and the directional decision of cytokinesis by using transgenic BY-2 cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tubulin. At prophase, most of the cells with double PPBs formed multipolar spindles, whereas all cells with single PPBs formed normal bipolar spindles, clearly implicating the PPB in deciding the spindle poles. At metaphase, however, both cell types possessed the bipolar spindles, indicating the existence of correctional mechanism(s) at prometaphase. From prometaphase to metaphase, the spindles in double PPB cells altered their directions to become oblique to the cell-elongating axis, and these orientations were maintained in the phragmoplast and resulted in the oblique division planes. These oblique cell plates decreased when actin microfilaments were disrupted, and double actin-depleted zones (ADZs) appeared where the double PPBs had existed. These results suggest that the information necessary for proper cytokinesis may be transferred from the PPBs to the ADZs, even in the case of the double PPBs.
