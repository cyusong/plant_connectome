This paper investigates the opening and closing mechanism for the Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). A mathematical model has been proposed to explain how the flytrap transitions between open, semi-closed, and closed states. The model accounts for the charge accumulation of action potentials, which generated by mechanical stimulation of the sensitive trigger hairs on the lobes of the flytrap. Though many studies have been reported for the Venus flytrap opening and closing mechanism, this paper attempts to explain the mechanism from nonlinear dynamics and control perspective.

Mechanical stimulation: !generates! Action potentials 
Action potentials: !accumulate! Charge 
Charge: !controls! Flytrap opening/closing mechanism 
Flytrap: !transitions between! Open, semi-closed, and closed states
