Transgenic or genetically modified crops have great potential in modern agriculture but still suffer from heavy regulations worldwide due to biosafety concerns. As a promising alternative route, cisgenic crops have received higher public acceptance and better reviews by governing authorities. To serve the purpose of cisgenic plant breeding, we have developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based vector system, which is capable of delivering target gene-of-interest (GOI) into recipient plants while removing undesired genetic traces in the plants. The new system features a controllable auto-excision feature, which is realized by a core design of embedded multi-clonal sequence and the use of inducible promoters controlling the expression of Cas9 nuclease. In the current proof-of-concept study in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (L.) Heynh., we have successfully incorporated a GOI into the plant and removed the selection marker and CRISPR/Cas9 components from the final product. Following the designed workflow, we have demonstrated that novel cisgenic plant germplasms with desired traits could be developed within one to two generations. Further characterizations of the vector system have shown that heat treatment at 37 °C could significantly improve the editing efficiency (up to 100%), and no off-target mutations were identified in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> background. This novel vector system is the first CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing tool for cisgenic plant breeding and should prove powerful for other similar applications in the bright future of precision molecular breeding.
