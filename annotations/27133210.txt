The maturation of tRNA precursors involves the 5' cleavage of leader sequences by an essential endonuclease called RNase P. Beyond the ancestral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) RNase P, a second type of RNase P called PRORP (protein-only RNase P) evolved in eukaryotes. The current view on the distribution of RNase P in cells is that multiple RNPs, multiple PRORPs or a combination of both, perform specialised RNase P activities in the different compartments where gene expression occurs. Here, we identify a single gene encoding PRORP in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii while no RNP is found. We show that its product, CrPRORP, is triple-localised to mitochondria, the chloroplast and the nucleus. Its downregulation results in impaired tRNA biogenesis in both organelles and the nucleus. CrPRORP, as a single-subunit RNase P for an entire organism, makes up the most compact and versatile RNase P machinery described in either prokaryotes or eukaryotes.
