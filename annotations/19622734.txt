Helitrons are recently discovered eukaryotic transposons that are predicted to amplify by a rolling-circle mechanism. They are present in most plant and animal species investigated, but were previously overlooked partly because they lack terminal repeats and do not create target site duplications. Helitrons are particularly abundant in flowering plants, where they frequently acquire, and sometimes express, 1 or more gene fragments. A structure-based search protocol was developed to find Helitrons and was used to analyze several plant and animal genomes, leading to the discovery of hundreds of new Helitrons. Analysis of these Helitrons has uncovered mechanisms of element evolution, including end creation and sequence acquisition. Preferential accumulation in gene-poor regions and target site specificities were also identified. Overall, these studies provide insights into the transposition and evolution of Helitrons and their contributions to evolved gene content and genome structure.
