Seed deterioration is detrimental to plant germplasm conservation, and predicting seed germination and vigor with reliability and sensitivity means is urgently needed for practical problems. We investigated the link between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) flux, oxygen influx and seed vigor of Caragana korshinskii by the non-invasive micro-test technique (NMT). Some related physiological and biochemical changes in seeds were also determined to further explain the changes in the molecular fluxes. The results showed that there was a good linear relationship between germination and H2O2 flux, and that O2 influx was more suitable for assessing seed vigor. H2O2 flux changed relatively little initially, mainly affected by antioxidants (APX, CAT and GSH) and H2O2 content; afterward, the efflux increased more and more rapidly due to high membrane permeability. With the damage of mitochondrial respiration and membrane integrity, O2 influx was gradually reduced. We propose that monitoring H2O2 and O2 fluxes by NMT may be a reliable and sensitive method to evaluate seed germination and vigor.
