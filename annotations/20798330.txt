We previously identified Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective in sense transgene posttranscriptional gene silencing (S-PTGS) that defined six loci; here, we describe mutants that define nine additional loci, including HYPER RECOMBINATION1 (HPR1), SILENCING DEFECTIVE3 (SDE3), and SDE5. Our analyses extend previous findings by showing that the requirement for the putative RNA helicase SDE3 is inversely proportional to the strength of the PTGS inducer and that the putative RNA trafficking protein SDE5 is an essential component of the trans-acting small interfering RNA (tasiRNA) pathway and is required for S-PTGS but not inverted repeat transgene-mediated PTGS (IR-PTGS). Our screen also identified HPR1 as a PTGS actor. We show that hpr1 mutations negatively impact S-PTGS, IR-PTGS, and tasiRNA pathways, resulting in increased accumulation of siRNA precursors and decreased accumulation of mature siRNA. In animals, HPR1/THO1 is a member of the conserved RNA trafficking THO/TREX complex, which also includes TEX1/THO3. We show that tex1 mutants, like hpr1 mutants, impact TAS precursor and mature tasiRNA levels, suggesting that a THO/TREX complex exists in plants and that this complex is important for the integrity of the tasiRNA pathway. We propose that both HPR1 and TEX1 participate in the trafficking of siRNA precursors to the ARGONAUTE catalytic center.
