['26119694', 'Transposable elements (TEs) and repetitive sequences are ubiquitously present in  eukaryotic genomes which are in general epigenetically silenced by DNA  methylation and/or histone 3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me). RNA-directed DNA  methylation (RdDM) is the major pathway that initiates de novo DNA methylation in  Arabidopsis and sets up a self-reinforcing silencing loop between DNA methylation  and H3K9me. However, a key issue is the requirement of a basal level transcript  from the target loci to initiate the RNA-based silencing. How the heterochromatic  silenced loci are transcribed remains largely unknown. Here, we show that JMJ24,  a JmjC domain-containing protein counteracts H3K9me to promote basal level  transcription of endogenous silenced loci in Arabidopsis. JMJ24 functionally  resembles the fission yeast JmjC protein Epe1. The transcript promoted by JMJ24  is, at least in part, processed to small RNA to initiate the RdDM. Genome-wide  transcriptome profiling indicates that transcript levels of TEs are more likely  regulated by JMJ24, compared with protein-coding genes. Our data suggest that  JMJ24 plays a conserved role in promoting basal level transcription of endogenous  silenced loci to reinforce the silencing. We also provide evidence of a physical  association between JMJ24 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), which  represents an evolved property of the RNA silencing pathway.', '2015 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12924', 'Chua']
