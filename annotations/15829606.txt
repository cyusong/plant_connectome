['15829606', 'In the absence of cell migration, plant architecture is largely determined by the  direction and extent of cell expansion during development. In this report, we  show that very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) synthesis plays an essential role in  cell expansion. The Arabidopsis thaliana eceriferum10 (cer10) mutants exhibit  severe morphological abnormalities and reduced size of aerial organs. These  mutants are disrupted in the At3g55360 gene, previously identified as a gene  coding for enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR), an enzyme required for VLCFA synthesis. The  absence of ECR activity results in a reduction of cuticular wax load and affects  VLCFA composition of seed triacylglycerols and sphingolipids, demonstrating in  planta that ECR is involved in all VLCFA elongation reactions in Arabidopsis.  Epidermal and seed-specific silencing of ECR activity resulted in a reduction of  cuticular wax load and the VLCFA content of seed triacylglycerols, respectively,  with no effects on plant morphogenesis, suggesting that the developmental  phenotypes arise from abnormal sphingolipid composition. Cellular analysis  revealed aberrant endocytic membrane traffic and defective cell expansion  underlying the morphological defects of cer10 mutants.', '2005 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.030155', 'Kunst']
