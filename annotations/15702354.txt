Two full-length cDNA sequences homologous to caleosin, a seed-storage oil-body protein from sesame, were identified from a series of barley grain development cDNA libraries and further characterised. The cDNAs, subsequently termed HvClo1 and HvClo2, encode proteins of 34 kDa and 28 kDa, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR indicated that HvClo1 is expressed abundantly during the later stages of embryogenesis and is seed-specific, accumulating in the scutellum of mature embryos. HvClo2 is expressed mainly in the endosperm tissues of the developing grain. We show that HvClo1 and HvClo2 are paralogs that co-segregate on barley chromosome 2HL. Transient expression of HvClo1 in lipid storage and non-storage cells of barley using biolistic particle bombardment indicates that caleosins have different subcellular locations from the structural oil-body protein oleosin, and by inference participate in different sorting pathways. We observe that caleosin sorts via small vesicles, suggesting a likely association with lipid trafficking, membrane expansion and oil-body biogenesis.
