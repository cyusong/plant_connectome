Owing to a weak availability in soil, plants have developed numerous morphological, physiological and biochemical adaptations to acquire phosphate (Pi). Identification and characterisation of key genes involved in the initial steps of Pi-signalling might provide clues about the regulation of the complex Pi deficiency adaptation mechanism. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach was performed to investigate proteome responses to Pi starvation in Arabidopsis. Two ecotypes were selected according to contrasting responses of their root system architecture to low availability of Pi. Thirty protein spots were shown to be affected by Pi deficiency. Fourteen proteins appeared to be up-regulated and ten down-regulated with ecotype Be-0, wheras only thirteen proteins were observed as down-regulated for ecotype Ll-0. Furthermore, systematic and opposite responses to Pi deficiency were observed between the two ecotypes. The sequences of these 30 differentially expressed protein spots were identified using mass spectrometry, and most of the proteins were involved in oxidative stress, carbohydrate and proteins metabolism. The results suggested that the modulation of alcohol dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and aconitate hydratase may contribute to the contrasted adaptation strategy to Pi deficiency of Be-0 and Ll-0 ecotypes. A focus on aconitate hydratase highlighted a complex reverse response of the pattern of corresponding spots between the two ecotypes. This protein, also potentially involved in iron homeostasis, was speculated to contribute, at least indirectly, to the root architecture response of these ecotypes.
