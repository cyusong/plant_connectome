Grain weight is a key trait that determines rice quality and yield, and it is primarily controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL). Recently, attention has been paid to minor QTLs. A minor effect QTL <i>qTGW7</i> that controls grain weight was previously identified in a set of chromosomal fragment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from Nipponbare (NPB)/93-11. Compared to NPB, the single segment substitution line (SSSL) N83 carrying the <i>qTGW7</i> introgression exhibited an increase in grain length and width and a 4.5% increase in grain weight. Meanwhile, N83 was backcrossed to NPB to create a separating population, <i>qTGW7b</i>, a QTL distinct from <i>qTGW7</i>, which was detected between markers G31 and G32. Twelve near-isogenic lines (NILs) from the BC<sub>9</sub>F<sub>3</sub> population and progeny of five NILs from the BC<sub>9</sub>F<sub>3:4</sub> population were genotyped and phenotyped, resulting in the fine mapping of the minor effect QTL <i>qTGW7b</i> to the approximately 86.2-kb region between markers G72 and G32. Further sequence comparisons and expression analysis confirmed that five genes, including <i>Os07g39370</i>, <i>Os07g39430</i>, <i>Os07g39440</i>, <i>Os07g39450</i>, and <i>Os07g39480</i>, were considered as the candidate genes underlying <i>qTGW7b</i>. These results provide a crucial foundation for further cloning of <i>qTGW7b</i> and molecular breeding design in rice.
