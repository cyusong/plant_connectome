Although considerable progress has been made in identifying the genes regulating accumulation of hormones that are involved in leaf senescence, only a few studies have focused on natural variations in jasmonates content and much less on the underlying genetic basis. Moreover, the epigenetic regulation of jasmonate-mediated leaf senescence remains largely unknown. In this study, we carried out metabolic profiling of a worldwide collection of rice accessions and demonstrated that there are substantial variations in jasmonate levels among these accessions. A subsequent metabolite-based genome-wide association study identified candidates for two major quantitative genes (QTGs), OsPME1 and OsTSD2, affecting the content of jasmonates. Further investigations using a series of relevant mutants and transgenic lines revealed the MeOH-jasmonate cascade plays an important role in regulating leaf senescence. Moreover, we showed that OsSRT1, one of the two Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) homologs in rice, negatively regulates leaf senescence by repressing expression of the biosynthetic genes of this metabolic cascade and at least particially through histone H3K9 deacetylation of OsPME1. Taken together, our results indicate that the MeOH-jasmonates cascade and its epigenetic regulation are crucial for controlling leaf senescence process in rice.
