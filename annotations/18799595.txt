['18799595', 'Chloroplast genomes in angiosperms encode approximately 20 group II introns,  approximately half of which are classified as subgroup IIB. The splicing of all  but one of the subgroup IIB introns requires a heterodimer containing the  peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase homolog CRS2 and one of two closely related proteins,  CAF1 or CAF2, that harbor a recently recognized RNA binding domain called the CRM  domain. Two CRS2/CAF-dependent introns require, in addition, a CRM domain protein  called CFM2 that is only distantly related to CAF1 and CAF2. Here, we show that  CFM3, a close relative of CFM2, associates in vivo with those CRS2/CAF-dependent  introns that are not CFM2 ligands. Mutant phenotypes in rice and Arabidopsis  support a role for CFM3 in the splicing of most of the introns with which it  associates. These results show that either CAF1 or CAF2 and either CFM2 or CFM3  simultaneously bind most chloroplast subgroup IIB introns in vivo, and that the  CAF and CFM subunits play nonredundant roles in splicing. These results suggest  that the expansion of the CRM protein family in plants resulted in two  subfamilies that play different roles in group II intron splicing, with further  diversification within a subfamily to accommodate multiple intron ligands.', '2008 Nov', 'RNA', '10.1261/rna.1223708', 'Barkan']
