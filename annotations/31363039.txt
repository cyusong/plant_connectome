Evolution of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway involved in some cases recruitment of housekeeping proteins through gene duplication and their further neofunctionalization. NADP-malic enzyme (ME), the most widespread C<sub>4</sub> decarboxylase, has increased its catalytic efficiency and acquired regulatory properties that allowed it to participate in the C<sub>4</sub> pathway. Here, we show that regulation of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) C<sub>4</sub>-NADP-ME activity is much more elaborate than previously thought. Using mass spectrometry, we identified phosphorylation of the Ser419 residue of C<sub>4</sub>-NADP-ME in protein extracts of maize leaves. The phosphorylation event increases in the light, with a peak at Zeitgeber time 2. Phosphorylation of ZmC<sub>4</sub>-NADP-ME drastically decreases its activity as shown by the low residual activity of the recombinant phosphomimetic mutant. Analysis of the crystal structure of C<sub>4</sub>-NADP-ME indicated that Ser419 is involved in the binding of NADP at the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations and effective binding energy computations indicate a less favorable binding of the cofactor NADP in the phosphomimetic and the phosphorylated variants. We propose that phosphorylation of ZmC<sub>4</sub>-NADP-ME at Ser419 during the first hours in the light is a cellular mechanism that fine tunes the enzymatic activity to coordinate the carbon concentration mechanism with the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate, probably to avoid CO<sub>2</sub> leakiness from bundle sheath cells.
