Two North American fungal pathogens caused a coepizootic leading to localized collapse of an outbreak population of the newly invasive planthopper pest, the spotted lanternfly (<i>Lycorma delicatula</i>), in the eastern United States. The pathogens partitioned the habitat, with the majority of <i>L. delicatula</i> on tree trunks killed by <i>Batkoa major</i>, while cadavers of <i>L. delicatula</i> killed by <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> were usually on the ground. The future will show whether these pathogens will be drivers in boom-bust cycles or will result in recurrent low population densities of this new invasive species.
