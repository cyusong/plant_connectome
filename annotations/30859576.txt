This work aims at developing an adequate theoretical basis for comparing assimilation of the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> pathway with CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanisms (CCM) that have evolved to reduce photorespiratory yield losses. We present a novel model for C<sub>3</sub> , C<sub>2</sub> , C<sub>2</sub>  + C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis simulating assimilatory metabolism, energetics and metabolite traffic at the leaf level. It integrates a mechanistic description of light reactions to simulate ATP and NADPH production, and a variable engagement of cyclic electron flow. The analytical solutions are compact and thus suitable for larger scale simulations. Inputs were derived with a comprehensive gas-exchange experiment. We show trade-offs in the operation of C<sub>4</sub> that are in line with ecophysiological data. C<sub>4</sub> has the potential to increase assimilation over C<sub>3</sub> at high temperatures and light intensities, but this benefit is reversed under low temperatures and light. We apply the model to simulate the introduction of progressively complex levels of CCM into C<sub>3</sub> rice, which feeds > 3.5 billion people. Increasing assimilation will require considerable modifications such as expressing the NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase-like complex and upregulating cyclic electron flow, enlarging the bundle sheath, and expressing suitable transporters to allow adequate metabolite traffic. The simpler C<sub>2</sub> rice may be a desirable alternative.
