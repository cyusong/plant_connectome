Distinct photosynthetic physiologies are found within the <i>Moricandia</i> genus, both C3-type and C2-type representatives being known. As C2-physiology is an adaptation to drier environments, a study of physiology, biochemistry and transcriptomics was conducted to investigate whether plants with C2-physiology are more tolerant of low water availability and recover better from drought. Our data on <i>Moricandia moricandioides</i> (Mmo, C3), <i>M. arvensis</i> (Mav, C2) and <i>M. suffruticosa</i> (Msu, C2) show that C3 and C2-type <i>Moricandias</i> are metabolically distinct under all conditions tested (well-watered, severe drought, early drought recovery). Photosynthetic activity was found to be largely dependent upon the stomatal opening. The C2-type <i>M. arvensis</i> was able to secure 25-50% of photosynthesis under severe drought as compared to the C3-type <i>M. moricandioides</i>. Nevertheless, the C2-physiology does not seem to play a central role in <i>M. arvensis</i> drought responses and drought recovery. Instead, our biochemical data indicated metabolic differences in carbon and redox-related metabolism under the examined conditions. The cell wall dynamics and glucosinolate metabolism regulations were found to be major discriminators between <i>M. arvensis</i> and <i>M. moricandioides</i> at the transcription level.
