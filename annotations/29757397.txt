Gametocidal (Gc) chromosomes can kill gametes that lack them by causing chromosomal breakage to ensure their preferential transmission, and they have been exploited in genetic breeding. The present study investigated the possible roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in Gc action. By sequencing two small RNA libraries from the anthers of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and the Chinese Spring-Gc 3C chromosome monosomic addition line (CS-3C), we identified 239 conserved and 72 putative novel miRNAs, including 135 differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs were predicted to target multiple genes with various molecular functions relevant to the features of Gc action, including sterility and genome instability. The transgenic overexpression of miRNA, which was up-regulated in CS-3C, reduced rice fertility. The CS-3C line exhibited a genome-wide reduction in 24 nt siRNAs compared with that of the CS line, particularly in transposable element (TE) and repetitive DNA sequences. Corresponding to this reduction, the bisulfite sequencing analysis of four retro-TE sequences showed a decrease in CHH methylation, typical of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). These results demonstrate that both miRNA-directed regulation of gene expression and siRNA-directed DNA methylation of target TE loci could play a role in Gc action.
