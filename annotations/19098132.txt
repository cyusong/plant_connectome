Sequences required for the expression of Cytc-2 (At4g10040), one of two cytochrome c genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, were characterized using plants transformed with deleted and mutagenized promoter fragments fused to gus. These studies indicated that a region containing a G-box and an ACGT motif is essential for expression. Mutation of the ACGT motif causes a complete loss of expression, while mutation of the G-box causes decreased expression in aerial parts and abolishes expression in roots and induction by environmental factors. Upstream located site II elements are required for maximal expression, mainly in reproductive tissues, and maximal induction by different factors. One-hybrid screenings allowed the identification of transcription factors from the bZIP and bHLH families that interact mainly with the G-box. Four of these factors were able to bind to the Cytc-2 promoter in vitro and in transactivation assays in Arabidopsis. Analysis of available microarray data indicated that the bZIP transcription factors share expression characteristics with the Cytc-2 gene, suggesting that they act as mediators of its response to tissue-specific, environmental, and metabolic conditions. Site II elements interact with a TCP family protein and may co-ordinate the expression of the Cytc-2 gene with that of other respiratory chain components. A model is proposed for the evolution of the Cytc-2 gene through the incorporation of a segment containing a G-box and an ACGT motif into an ancestral gene that contained site II elements. This may have reduced the importance of site II elements for basal expression and conferred new responses to environmental factors.
