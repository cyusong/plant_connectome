Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is one of the most ideal phenomena known in higher plants to describe the incompatibilities between mitochondrial-nuclear genomic interactions. To elucidate the dependency of pollen development on mitochondrial genotypes and cytoplasmic-nuclear genomic barriers, we employed five CMS isogenic lines of rice, CW-, W11-, LD-, BT- and WA-type CMS lines, that exhibit distinct pollen-defective phenotypes, and we characterized the CMS phenotypes and the nuclear gene expression patterns in conjunction with their mitochondrial genomic structures. These five CMS lines carried independent mitotypes, and W11, LD and BT mitochondrial genomes were relatively close with respect to their phylogeny. In anthers at the uninucleate microspore and bicellular pollen stages, 8,199 genes significantly changed their expression in at least one of the CMS lines. Common expression patterns were observed in BT, LD and W11 after k-means clustering. Among the genes encoding putative mitochondrial proteins, ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1A, a gene for the well-known mitochondrial stress marker, was included in the group ectopically up-regulated in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage of BT, LD and W11. Several other clusters were also regulated in a cytoplasm-specific manner during pollen development. These clear similarities in gene regulatory networks of BT-, LD- and W11-CMS lines indicate that the phylogenetic relationships of the mitochondrial genotypes are strongly correlated with nuclear gene expression patterns and pollen abortion phenotypes, providing evidence of the mitochondrial epistacy over the nuclear genome during pollen development.
