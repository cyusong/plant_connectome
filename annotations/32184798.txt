Amongst various environmental constraints, abiotic stresses are increasing the risk of food insecurity worldwide by limiting crop production and disturbing the geographical distribution of food crops. Millets are known to possess unique features of resilience to adverse environments, especially infertile soil conditions, although the underlying mechanisms are yet to be determined. The small diploid genome, short stature, excellent seed production, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, and short life cycle of foxtail millet make it a very promising model crop for studying nutrient stress responses. Known to be a drought-tolerant crop, it responds to low nitrogen and low phosphate by respective reduction and enhancement of its root system. This special response is quite different from that shown by maize and some other cereals. In contrast to having a smaller root system under low nitrogen, foxtail millet enhances biomass accumulation, facilitating root thickening, presumably for nutrient translocation. The low phosphate response of foxtail millet links to the internal nitrogen status, which tends to act as a signal regulating the expression of nitrogen transporters and hence indicates its inherent connection with nitrogen nutrition. Altogether, the low nitrogen and low phosphate responses of foxtail millet can act as a basis to further determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we will highlight the abiotic stress responses of foxtail millet with a key note on its low nitrogen and low phosphate adaptive responses in comparison to other crops.
