Rhizobia fix nitrogen within root nodules of host plants where nitrogenase expression is strictly controlled by its key regulator NifA. We recently discovered that in nodules infected by the beta-rhizobial strain <i>Paraburkholderia phymatum</i> STM815, NifA controls expression of two bacterial auxin synthesis genes. Both the <i>iaaM</i> and <i>iaaH</i> transcripts, as well as the metabolites indole-acetamide (IAM) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) showed increased abundance in nodules occupied by a <i>nifA</i> mutant compared to wild-type nodules. Here, we document the structural changes that a <i>P. phymatum nifA</i> mutant induces in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules, eventually leading to hypernodulation. To investigate the role of the <i>P. phymatum iaaMH</i> genes during symbiosis, we monitored their expression in presence and absence of NifA over different stages of the symbiosis. The <i>iaaMH</i> genes were found to be under negative control of NifA in all symbiotic stages. While a <i>P. phymatum iaaMH</i> mutant produced the same number of nodules and nitrogenase activity as the wild-type strain, the <i>nifA</i> mutant produced more nodules than the wild-type that clustered into regularly-patterned root zones. Mutation of the <i>iaaMH</i> genes in a <i>nifA</i> mutant background reduced the presence of these nodule clusters on the root. We further show that the <i>P. phymatum iaaMH</i> genes are located in a region of the symbiotic plasmid with a significantly lower GC content and exhibit high similarity to two genes of the IAM pathway often used by bacterial phytopathogens to deploy IAA as a virulence factor. Overall, our data suggest that the increased abundance of rhizobial auxin in the non-fixing <i>nifA</i> mutant strain enables greater root infection rates and a role for bacterial auxin production in the control of early stage symbiotic interactions.
