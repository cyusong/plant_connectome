In animals, the Sep15 protein participates in disease resistance, growth, and development, but the function of its plant homologues remains unclear. Here, the function of maize Sep15 was analysed by characterization of two independent Sep15-like loss-of-function mutants. In the absence of ZmSep15-like, seedling tolerance to both water and salinity stress was compromised. The mutants experienced a heightened level of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and over-accumulated reactive oxygen species, resulting in leaf necrosis. Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana atsep15 mutant as well as like with ectopic expression of ZmSep15-like indicated that ZmSep15-like contributed to tolerance of both osmotic and salinity stress. ZmSep15-like interacted physically with UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase1 (UGGT1). When the interaction was disrupted, the response to both osmotic and salinity stresses was impaired in maize or Arabidopsis. Co-expressing ZmUGGT1 and ZmUGGT2 enhanced the tolerance of A. thaliana to both stressors, indicating a functional interaction between them. Together, the data indicated that plants Sep15-like proteins promote osmotic and salinity stress resistance by influencing endoplasmic reticulum stress response and reactive oxygen species level.
