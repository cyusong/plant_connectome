DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of the genome involved in the regulation of gene expression and modulation of chromatin structure. Plant genomes are widely methylated, and the methylation generally occurs on the cytosine bases through the activity of specific enzymes called DNA methyltransferases. On the other hand, methylated DNA can also undergo demethylation through the action of demethylases. The methylation landscape is finely tuned and assumes a pivotal role in plant development and evolution. This review illustrates different molecular aspects of DNA methylation and some plant physiological processes influenced by this epigenetic modification in model species, crops, and ornamental plants such as orchids. In addition, this review aims to describe the relationship between the changes in plant DNA methylation levels and the response to biotic and abiotic stress. Finally, we discuss the possible evolutionary implications and biotechnological applications of DNA methylation.
