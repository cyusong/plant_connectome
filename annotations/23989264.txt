Boron (B) plays a well-known structural role in the cell wall, however the way of perceiving B deficiency by roots and transmitting this environmental signal to the nucleus to elicit a response is not well established. It is known that the direct interaction between Ca2+ sensors and transcription factors (TFs) is a necessary step to regulate the expression of downstream target genes in some signaling pathways. Interestingly, B deprivation affected gene expressions of several TFs belonging to MYB, WRKY, and bZIP families, as well as expressions of Ca2+ -related genes such as several CML (calmodulin-like protein) and CPK (Ca2+ -dependent protein kinase) genes. Taken together, these results suggest that B deficiency could affect the expression of downstream target genes by alteration of a calcium signaling pathway in which the interaction between CMLs and/or CPKs with TFs (activator or repressor) would be a crucial step, which would explain why some genes are upregulated whereas others are repressed upon B deprivation.

B: !affects! expression of TFs 
TFs: !interact with! Ca2+ sensors 
Ca2+ sensors: !regulate! downstream target genes 
B deprivation: !alters! calcium signaling pathway 
CMLs/CPKs: !interact with! TFs (activator/repressor) 
TFs: !control! upregulation/repression of genes
