RNA interference (RNAi) has been developed as an efficient technology. RNAi insect-resistant transgenic plants expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is ingested into insects to silence target genes can affect the viability of these pests or even lead to their death. <i>HaHR3</i>, a molt-regulating transcription factor gene, was previously selected as a target expressed in bacteria and tobacco plants to control <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> by RNAi technology. In this work, we selected the dsRNA-<i>HaHR3</i> fragment to silence <i>HaHR3</i> in cotton bollworm for plant mediated-RNAi research. A total of 19 transgenic cotton lines expressing <i>HaHR3</i> were successfully cultivated, and seven generated lines were used to perform feeding bioassays. Transgenic cotton plants expressing ds<i>HaHR3</i> were shown to induce high larval mortality and deformities of pupation and adult eclosion when used to feed the newly hatched larvae, and 3rd and 5th instar larvae of <i>H. armigera</i>. Moreover, <i>HaHR3</i> transgenic cotton also demonstrated an improved cotton yield when compared with controls.

RNAi: !affects! viability of pests 
dsRNA-<i>HaHR3</i>: !silences! <i>HaHR3</i> 
transgenic cotton: !expresses! ds<i>HaHR3</i> 
ds<i>HaHR3</i>: !induces! larval mortality 
ds<i>HaHR3</i>: !deforms! pupation and adult eclosion 
ds<i>HaHR3</i>: !improves! cotton yield
