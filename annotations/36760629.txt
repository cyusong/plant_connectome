Plant's perception of heat stress involves several pathways and signaling molecules, such as phosphoinositide, which is derived from structural membrane lipids phosphatidylinositol. Phospholipase C (PLC) is a well-known signaling enzyme containing many isoforms in different organisms. In the present study, Phospholipase C Isoform 5 (<i>PLC5</i>) was investigated for its role in thermotolerance in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Two over-expressing lines and one knock-down mutant of <i>PLC5</i> were first treated at a moderate temperature (37 °C) and left for recovery. Then again exposed to a high temperature (45 °C) to check the seedling viability and chlorophyll contents. Root behavior and changes in <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> labeled phospholipids were investigated after their exposure to high temperatures. Over-expression of <i>PLC5</i> (<i>PLC5 OE</i>) exhibited quick and better phenotypic recovery with bigger and greener leaves followed by chlorophyll contents as compared to wild-type (<i>Col-0</i>) and <i>PLC5</i> knock-down mutant in which seedling recovery was compromised. <i>PLC5</i> knock-down mutant illustrated well-developed root architecture under controlled conditions but stunted secondary roots under heat stress as compared to over-expressing <i>PLC5</i> lines. Around 2.3-fold increase in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate level was observed in <i>PLC5 OE</i> lines upon heat stress compared to wild-type and <i>PLC5</i> knock-down mutant lines. A significant increase in phosphatidylglycerol was also observed in <i>PLC5 OE</i> lines as compared to <i>Col-0</i> and <i>PLC5</i> knock-down mutant lines. The results of the present study demonstrated that <i>PLC5</i> over-expression contributes to heat stress tolerance while maintaining its photosynthetic activity and is also observed to be associated with primary and secondary root growth in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
