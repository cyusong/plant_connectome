The year 2004 was an exciting one for the Phytophthora research community. The United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) completed the draft genome sequence of two Phytophthora species, Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum. In August of that year over 50 people gathered at JGI in Walnut Creek, California, for an annotation jamboree and searched for the secrets and surprises that the two genomes have in petto. This culminated in a paper in Science in September of this year describing the highlights of the sequencing project and emphasizing the power of having the genome sequences of two closely related organisms. This MPMI Focus issue on Phytophthora genomics contains a number of more specialized manuscripts centered on gene annotation and genome organization, and complemented with manuscripts that rely on genomics resources.
