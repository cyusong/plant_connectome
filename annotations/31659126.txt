Gibberellin (GA) is known to play an important role in low red/far-red (R:FR) light ratio-mediated hypocotyl and petiole elongation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the regulatory relationship between low R:FR and GAs remains unclear, especially in gymnosperms. To increase our understanding of the molecular basis of low R:FR-mediated shoot elongation in pines and to determine whether there is an association between low R:FR and GAs action, we explored the morphological and transcriptomic changes triggered by low R:FR, GAs, and paclobutrazol (PAC), a GAs biosynthesis inhibitor, in <i>Pinus tabuliformis</i> seedlings. Transcriptome profiles revealed that low R:FR conditions and GAs have a common set of transcriptional targets in <i>P. tabuliformis</i> We provide evidence that the effect of low R:FR on shoot elongation in <i>P. tabuliformis</i> is at least partially modulated by GAs accumulation, which can be largely attenuated by PAC. GAs are also involved in the cross talk between different phytohormones in the low R:FR response. A GA biosynthesis gene, encoding ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), was strongly stimulated by low R:FR without being affected by GAs feedback regulation or the photoperiod. We show that GA signaling is required for low R:FR-induced shoot elongation in <i>P</i> <i>tabuliformis</i> seedlings, and that there are different regulatory targets for low R:FR-mediated GA biosynthesis between conifers and angiosperms.
