Cuticular wax protects plants from various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the genetic network of wax biosynthesis and the environmental factors influencing leaf wax production in rapeseed (Brassica napus) remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated the role of leaf wax in the resistance to Sclerotinia infection in rapeseed. We found that leaves grown under high light intensity had higher expression of genes involved in wax biosynthesis, and produced more wax on the leaf surface, compared with those grown under low light conditions. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 89 single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with leaf wax coverage. A cross-analysis between GWAS and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the leaf epidermis of the accessions with contrasting differences in wax content revealed 17 candidate genes that control this variation in rapeseed. Selective sweep analysis combined with DEG analysis unveiled 510 candidate genes with significant selective signatures. From the candidate genes, we selected BnaA02.LOX4, a putative lipoxygenase, and BnaCnn.CER1, BnaA02.CER3, BnaC02.CER3, and BnaA01.CER4 (ECERIFERUM1-4) that were putatively responsible for wax biosynthesis, to analyse the allelic forms and haplotypes corresponding to high or low leaf wax coverage. These data enrich our knowledge about wax formation, and provide a gene pool for breeding an ideal leaf wax content in rapeseed.
