Rhomboids are ubiquitous intramembrane serine proteases the sequences of which are found in nearly all sequenced genomes, including those of plants. They were molecularly characterized in a number of organisms, and were found to play a role in a variety of biological functions including signaling, development, apoptosis, mitochondrial integrity, parasite invasion and more. Although rhomboid sequences are found in plants, very little is known about their function. Here, we present the current knowledge in the rhomboids field in general, and in plant rhomboids in particular. In addition, we discuss possible physiological roles of different plant rhomboids.
