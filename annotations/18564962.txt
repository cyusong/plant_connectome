['18564962', 'Light signal transduction in plants involves an intricate series of pathways  which is finely regulated by interactions between specific signalling proteins,  as well as by protein modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination.  The identification of novel phytochrome-interacting proteins and the precise  signalling mechanisms that they mediate is still ongoing. In our present study,  we show that the newly identified putative phytochrome-associated protein, PAPP2C  (phytochrome-associated protein phosphatase type 2C), interacts in the nucleus  with phyA (phytochrome A) and phyB, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the  phosphatase activity of PAPP2C and its association with phytochromes were found  to be enhanced by red light, indicating that it plays a role in mediating  phytochrome signalling. In particular, PAPP2C specifically binds to the  N-terminal PHY domain of the phytochromes. We thus speculate that this  interaction reflects a unique regulatory function of this phosphatase toward  established phytochrome-associated proteins. We also show that PAPP2C effectively  dephosphorylates phytochromes in vitro. Interestingly, PAPP2C indirectly mediates  the dephosphorylation of PIF3 (phytochrome-interacting factor 3) in vitro. Taken  together, we suggest that PAPP2C functions as a regulator of PIF3 by  dephosphorylating phytochromes in the nucleus.', '2008 Oct 15', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20071555', 'Hahn']
