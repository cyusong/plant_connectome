The partitioning of assimilated carbon is a complex process that involves the loading, long-distance transport, and subsequent unloading of carbohydrates from source to sink tissues. The network of plumbing that facilitates this coordinated process is the phloem tissue. Our understanding of the physiology of phloem transport has grown tremendously since the modern theory of mass flow was first put forward, aided by the concomitant progress of technology and experimental methodologies. Recent findings have put a renewed emphasis on the underlying anatomy of the phloem, and in particular the important role that cell walls play in enabling the high-pressure flow of photoassimilates through the sieve element. This review will briefly summarize the foundational work in phloem anatomy and highlight recent work exploring the physiology of phloem cell wall structure and mechanics.
