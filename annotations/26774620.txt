['26774620', 'Successful double fertilization and subsequent seed development in flowering  plants requires the delivery of two sperm cells, transported by a pollen tube,  into the embryo sac of an ovule. The embryo sac cells tightly control synergid  cell death, and as a result the polyspermy block. Arabinogalactan proteins are  highly glycosylated proteins thought to be involved in several steps of the  reproductive process. We show that JAGGER, Arabinogalactan Protein 4, is an  important molecule necessary to prevent the growth of multiple pollen tubes into  one embryo sac in Arabidopsis thaliana. In jagger, an AGP4 knockout mutant, the  pistils show impaired pollen tube blockage as a consequence of the survival of  the persistent synergid. JAGGER seems to be involved in the signaling pathway  that leads to a blockage of pollen tube attraction. Our results shed light on the  mechanism responsible for preventing polyspermy in Arabidopsis and for  safeguarding successful fertilization of all ovules in one pistil, ensuring seed  set and the next generation.', '2016 Apr 4', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2016.01.002', 'Coimbra']
