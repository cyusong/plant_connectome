Stomata regulate gas exchange and their closure in response to pathogens may, in some cases, contribute to resistance. However, in the cereal mildew and rust systems, stomatal closure follows establishment of compatible infections. In incompatible systems, expression of major (R) gene controlled hypersensitive responses (HR), causes drastic, permanent stomatal dysfunction: stomata become locked open following powdery mildew attack and locked shut following rust attack. Thus, stomatal locking can be a hitherto unsuspected negative consequence of R gene resistance that carries a physiological cost affecting plant performance.
