During plant development, morphogenetic processes rely on the activity of meristems. Meristem homeostasis depends on a complex regulatory network constituted by different factors and hormone signaling that regulate gene expression to coordinate the correct balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. ULTRAPETALA1, a transcriptional regulatory protein described as an Arabidopsis Trithorax group factor, has been characterized as a regulator of the shoot and floral meristems activity. Here, we highlight the role of ULTRAPETALA1 in root stem cell niche maintenance. We found that ULTRAPETALA1 is required to regulate both the quiescent center cell division rate and auxin signaling at the root tip. Furthermore, ULTRAPETALA1 regulates columella stem cell differentiation. These roles are independent of the ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX1, suggesting a different mechanism by which ULTRAPETALA1 can act in the root apical meristem of Arabidopsis. This work introduces a new component of the regulatory network needed for the root stem cell niche maintenance.
