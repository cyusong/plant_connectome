A greater rate of phloem unloading and storage in the stem, not a higher rate of sugar production by photosynthesis or sugar export from leaves, is the main factor that results in sugar accumulation in sweet dwarf sorghum compared to grain sorghum. At maturity, the stem internodes of sweet sorghum varieties accumulate high concentrations of fermentable sugars and represent an efficient feedstock for bioethanol production. Although stem sugar accumulation is a heritable trait, additional factors that drive sugar accumulation in sorghum have not been identified. To identify the constraints on stem sugar accumulation in sweet sorghum, we used a combination of carbon-11 (<sup>11</sup>C) radiotracer, physiological and biochemical approaches, and compared a grain sorghum and sweet dwarf sorghum line that have similar growth characteristics including height. Photosynthesis did not increase during development or differ between the sorghum lines. During the developmental transition to the reproductive stage, export of <sup>11</sup>C from leaves approximately doubled in both sorghum lines, but <sup>11</sup>C export in the sweet dwarf line did not exceed that of the grain sorghum. Defoliation to manipulate relative sink demand did not result in increased photosynthetic rates, indicating that the combined accumulation of C by all sink tissues was limited by the maximum photosynthetic capacity of source leaves. Nearly 3/4 of the <sup>11</sup>C exported from leaves was transported to the lower stem in sweet sorghum within 2 h, whereas in grain sorghum nearly 3/4 of the <sup>11</sup>C was in the panicle. Accordingly, the transcripts of several sucrose transporter (SUT) genes were more abundant in the stem internodes of the sweet dwarf line compared to the grain sorghum. Overall, these results indicate that sugar accumulation in sweet sorghum stems is influenced by the interplay of different sink tissues for the same sugars, but is likely driven by elevated sugar phloem unloading and uptake capacity in mature stem internodes.
