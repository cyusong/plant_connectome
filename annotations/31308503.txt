The application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) for genetic manipulation has revolutionized life science over the past few years. CRISPR was first discovered as an adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea, and then engineered to generate targeted DNA breaks in living cells and organisms. During the cellular DNA repair process, various DNA changes can be introduced. The diverse and expanding CRISPR toolbox allows programmable genome editing, epigenome editing and transcriptome regulation in plants. However, challenges in plant genome editing need to be fully appreciated and solutions explored. This Review intends to provide an informative summary of the latest developments and breakthroughs of CRISPR technology, with a focus on achievements and potential utility in plant biology. Ultimately, CRISPR will not only facilitate basic research, but also accelerate plant breeding and germplasm development. The application of CRISPR to improve germplasm is particularly important in the context of global climate change as well as in the face of current agricultural, environmental and ecological challenges.
