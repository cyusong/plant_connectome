Many mangrove forests have undergone major changes as a result of human activity and global climate change. <i>Sonneratia caseolaris</i> is a common tree located in inner mangroves, and its range extends inland along tidal creeks, as far as the influence of salinity extends. This study investigated the physiological and molecular response mechanisms of <i>S. caseolaris</i> by analyzing its antioxidant defense capacity, including its differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under similar salt stress conditions. Salt treatment significantly affected the osmoprotectants and lipid peroxidation in <i>S. caseolaris</i> seedlings, which increased proline (Pro) content by 31.01-54.90% during all sample periods and decreased malonaldehyde (MDA) content by 12.81 and 18.17% at 25 and 40 days under 3.0% NaCl treatment. Antioxidant enzyme activities increased significantly following 3.0% NaCl treatment. Transcriptome analysis following <i>De novo</i> assembly showed 26,498 matched unigenes. The results showed that 1,263 DEGs responded to transcription factors (TFs) and plant phytohormones and mediated oxidoreductase activity to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the control vs. 3.0% NaCl comparison. In addition, the transcription levels of genes associated with auxin and ethylene signal transduction also changed. Under salt stress, ROS scavenging genes (<i>POD</i>, <i>CAT</i>, and <i>APX</i>) and part of AP2, MYB, NAC, C2C2, bHLH, and WRKY TFs were upregulated. This study identified important pathways and candidate genes involved in <i>S. caseolaris</i> salinity tolerance and provided suggestions for further research into the mechanisms of salt tolerance in <i>S. caseolaris</i>.
