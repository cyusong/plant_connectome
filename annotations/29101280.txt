['29101280', 'Nonhost resistance is defined as the immunity of a plant species to all  nonadapted pathogen species. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype  Columbia-0 is nonhost to the oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae and the  fungal plant pathogen Fusarium virguliforme that are pathogenic to soybean  (Glycine max). Previously, we reported generating the pss1 mutation in the pen1-1  genetic background as well as genetic mapping and characterization of the  Arabidopsis nonhost resistance Phytophthora sojae-susceptible gene locus, PSS1 In  this study, we identified six candidate PSS1 genes by comparing single-nucleotide  polymorphisms of (1) the bulked DNA sample of seven F(2:3) families homozygous  for the pss1 allele and (2) the pen1-1 mutant with Columbia-0. Analyses of T-DNA  insertion mutants for each of these candidate PSS1 genes identified the At3g59640  gene encoding a glycine-rich protein as the putative PSS1 gene. Later,  complementation analysis confirmed the identity of At3g59640 as the PSS1 gene.  PSS1 is induced following P. sojae infection as well as expressed in an  organ-specific manner. Coexpression analysis of the available transcriptomic data  followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that PSS1  is coregulated with ATG8a (At4g21980), a core gene in autophagy. PSS1 contains a  predicted single membrane-spanning domain. Subcellular localization study  indicated that it is an integral plasma membrane protein. Sequence analysis  suggested that soybean is unlikely to contain a PSS1-like defense function.  Following the introduction of PSS1 into the soybean cultivar Williams 82, the  transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to F. virguliforme, the pathogen  that causes sudden death syndrome.', '2018 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.01982', 'ORCID:']
