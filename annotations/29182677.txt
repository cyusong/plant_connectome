['29182677', 'In Arabidopsis, fungal chitin is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular  pattern (PAMP) by the chitin receptor complex containing the lysin-motif (LysM)  receptor-like kinases CERK1 and LYK5. Upon the perception of chitin, CERK1  phosphorylates the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, PBL27, which activates the  intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. However, the  mechanisms by which the CERK1-PBL27 complex is regulated remain largely unknown.  We identified ubiquitin ligase PUB12 as a component of the PBL27 complex using  co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. However, PUB12 did not interact  directly with PBL27. Instead, the ARM domains of PUB12 and its paralog PUB13  interacted with the intracellular domain of CERK1 in a manner that was dependent  on its autophosphorylation, suggesting that the phosphorylation-based  auto-activation of CERK1 may be required for its interaction with PUB12. The  co-expression of PUB12 in Nicotiana benthamiana reduced the accumulation of  CERK1. The pub12 pub13 mutant exhibited enhanced chitin-induced immune responses  such as ROS production, MAPK activation, and callose deposition. These results  suggest that PUB12 and PUB13 are involved in the negative regulation of the  chitin receptor complex, which may contribute to the transient desensitization of  chitin-induced responses.', '2017', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0188886', 'ORCID:']
