Japonica/geng and indica/xian are two major rice (Oryza sativa) subspecies with multiple divergent traits, but how these traits are related and interact within each subspecies remains elusive. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid phytohormones that modulate many important agronomic traits in rice. Here, using different physiological assays, we revealed that japonica rice exhibits an overall lower BR sensitivity than indica. Extensive screening of BR signaling genes led to the identification of a set of genes distributed throughout the primary BR signaling pathway with divergent polymorphisms. Among these, we demonstrate that the C38/T variant in BR Signaling Kinase2 (OsBSK2), causing the amino acid change P13L, plays a central role in mediating differential BR signaling in japonica and indica rice. OsBSK2<sup>L13</sup> in indica plays a greater role in BR signaling than OsBSK2<sup>P13</sup> in japonica by affecting the auto-binding and protein accumulation of OsBSK2. Finally, we determined that OsBSK2 is involved in a number of divergent traits in japonica relative to indica rice, including grain shape, tiller number, cold adaptation, and nitrogen-use efficiency. Our study suggests that the natural variation in OsBSK2 plays a key role in the divergence of BR signaling, which underlies multiple divergent traits between japonica and indica.
