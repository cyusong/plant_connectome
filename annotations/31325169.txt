Salinity is a deleterious abiotic stress factor that affects growth, productivity, and physiology of crop plants. Strategies for improving salinity tolerance in plants are critical for crop breeding programmes. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) really interesting new gene (RING) H2-type E3 ligase, OsSIRH2-14 (previously named OsRFPH2-14), which plays a positive role in salinity tolerance by regulating salt-related proteins including an HKT-type Na<sup>+</sup> transporter (OsHKT2;1). OsSIRH2-14 expression was induced in root and shoot tissues treated with NaCl. The OsSIRH2-14-EYFP fusion protein was predominately expressed in the cytoplasm, Golgi, and plasma membrane of rice protoplasts. In vitro pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed that OsSIRH2-14 interacts with salt-related proteins, including OsHKT2;1. OsSIRH2-14 E3 ligase regulates OsHKT2;1 via the 26S proteasome system under high NaCl concentrations but not under normal conditions. Compared with wild type plants, OsSIRH2-14-overexpressing rice plants showed significantly enhanced salinity tolerance and reduced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in the aerial shoot and root tissues. These results suggest that the OsSIRH2-14 RING E3 ligase positively regulates the salinity stress response by modulating the stability of salt-related proteins.
