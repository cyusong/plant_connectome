Norway spruce is a conifer storing large amounts of terpenoids in resin ducts of various tissues. Parts of the terpenoids stored in needles can be emitted together with de novo synthesized terpenoids. Since previous studies provided hints on xylem transported terpenoids as a third emission source, we tested if terpenoids are transported in xylem sap of Norway spruce. We further aimed at understanding if they might contribute to terpenoid emission from needles. We determined terpenoid content and composition in xylem sap, needles, bark, wood and roots of field grown trees, as well as terpenoid emissions from needles. We found considerable amounts of terpenoids-mainly oxygenated compounds-in xylem sap. The terpenoid concentration in xylem sap was relatively low compared with the content in other tissues, where terpenoids are stored in resin ducts. Importantly, the terpenoid composition in the xylem sap greatly differed from the composition in wood, bark or roots, suggesting that an internal transport of terpenoids takes place at the sites of xylem loading. Four terpenoids were identified in xylem sap and emissions, but not within needle tissue, suggesting that these compounds are likely derived from xylem sap. Our work gives hints that plant internal transport of terpenoids exists within conifers; studies on their functions should be a focus of future research.
