Suspensor development is essential for early embryogenesis. The filamentous suspensor plays vital roles in supporting the embryo proper and in exchanging nutrients and information between the embryo proper and embryo sac. In addition, at the globular stage, the uppermost suspensor cell differentiates into the hypophysis, which generates the progenitors of the quiescent center and columella stem cells. In naa10 and naa15 mutant plants, suspensor cell identity was found to be abnormal and embryo development was disturbed, leading to embryonic lethality. Therefore, the NatA complex is required for proper suspensor development in Arabidopsis.
