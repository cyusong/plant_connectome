The floral transition stage is pivotal for sustaining plant populations and is affected by several environmental factors, including photoperiod. However, the mechanisms underlying photoperiodic flowering responses are not fully understood. Herein, we have shown that exposure to an extended photoperiod effectively induced early flowering in <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants, at a range of different nitrate concentrations. However, these photoperiodic flowering responses were attenuated when the nitrate levels were suboptimal for flowering. An extended photoperiod also improved the root nitrate uptake of by NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1.1 (NRT1.1) and NITRATE TRANSPORTER 2.1 (NRT2.1), whereas the loss of function of NRT1.1/NRT2.1 in the <i>nrt1.1-1/2.1-2</i> mutants suppressed the expression of the key flowering genes <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>), and reduced the sensitivity of the photoperiodic flowering responses to elevated levels of nitrate. These results suggest that the upregulation of root nitrate uptake during extended photoperiods, contributed to the observed early flowering. The results also showed that the sensitivity of photoperiodic flowering responses to elevated levels of nitrate, were also reduced by either the replacement of nitrate with its assimilation intermediate product, ammonium, or by the dysfunction of the nitrate assimilation pathway. This indicates that nitrate serves as both a nutrient source for plant growth and as a signaling molecule for floral induction during extended photoperiods.
