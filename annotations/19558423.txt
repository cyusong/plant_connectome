['19558423', 'Environmental challenges such as low light intensity induce differential  growth-driven upward leaf movement (hyponastic growth) in Arabidopsis thaliana.  However, little is known about the physiological regulation of this response.  Here, we studied how low light intensity is perceived and translated into a  differential growth response in Arabidopsis. We used mutants defective in light,  ethylene and auxin signaling, and in polar auxin transport, as well as chemical  inhibitors, to analyze the mechanisms of low light intensity-induced differential  growth. Our data indicate that photosynthesis-derived signals and blue light  wavelengths affect petiole movements and that rapid induction of hyponasty by low  light intensity involves functional cryptochromes 1 and 2, phytochrome-A and  phytochrome-B photoreceptor proteins. The response is independent of ethylene  signaling. Auxin and polar auxin transport, by contrast, play a role in low light  intensity-induced differential petiole growth. We conclude that low light  intensity-induced differential petiole growth requires blue light, auxin  signaling and polar auxin transport and is, at least in part, genetically  separate from well-characterized ethylene-induced differential growth.', '2009', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02921.x', 'Peeters']
