Concerns over widespread use of insecticides and heightened insect pest virulence under climate change continue to fuel the need for environmentally safe and sustainable control strategies. However, to develop such strategies, a better understanding of the molecular basis of plant-pest interactions is still needed. Despite decades of research investigating plant-insect interactions, few examples exist where underlying molecular mechanisms are well characterized, and even rarer are cases where this knowledge has been successfully applied to manage harmful agricultural pests. Consequently, the field appears to be static, urgently needing shifts in approaches to identify novel mechanisms by which insects colonize plants and plants avoid insect pressure. In this perspective, we outline necessary steps for advancing holistic methodologies that capture complex plant-insect molecular interactions. We highlight novel and underexploited approaches in plant-insect interaction research as essential routes to translate knowledge of underlying molecular mechanisms into durable pest control strategies, including embracing microbial partnerships, identifying what makes a plant an unsuitable host, capitalizing on tolerance of insect damage, and learning from cases where crop domestication and agronomic practices enhance pest virulence.
