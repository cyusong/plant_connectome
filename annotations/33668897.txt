Plastid inheritance in angiosperms is presumed to be largely maternal, with the potential to inherit plastids biparentally estimated for about 20% of species. In <i>Passiflora</i>, maternal, paternal and biparental inheritance has been reported; however, these studies were limited in the number of crosses and progeny examined. To improve the understanding of plastid transmission in <i>Passiflora,</i> the progeny of 45 interspecific crosses were analyzed in the three subgenera: <i>Passiflora, Decaloba</i> and <i>Astrophea.</i> Plastid types were assessed following restriction digestion of PCR amplified plastid DNA in hybrid embryos, cotyledons and leaves at different developmental stages. Clade-specific patterns of inheritance were detected such that hybrid progeny from subgenera <i>Passiflora</i> and <i>Astrophea</i> predominantly inherited paternal plastids with occasional incidences of maternal inheritance, whereas subgenus <i>Decaloba</i> showed predominantly maternal and biparental inheritance. Biparental plastid inheritance was also detected in some hybrids from subgenus <i>Passiflora.</i> Heteroplasmy due to biparental inheritance was restricted to hybrid cotyledons and first leaves with a single parental plastid type detectable in mature plants. This indicates that in <i>Passiflora</i>, plastid retention at later stages of plant development may not reflect the plastid inheritance patterns in embryos. <i>Passiflora</i> exhibits diverse patterns of plastid inheritance, providing an excellent system to investigate underlying mechanisms in angiosperms.

Plastid inheritance: !predominantly paternal! in subgenera Passiflora and Astrophea
Plastid inheritance: !biparental! in some hybrids from subgenus Passiflora
Plastid retention: !restricted to! hybrid cotyledons and first leaves
