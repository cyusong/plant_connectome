The third EMBO Conference on Plant Molecular Biology, which focused on 'Plant development and environmental interactions', was held in May 2012 in Matera, Italy. Here, we review some of the topics and themes that emerged from the various contributions; namely, steering technologies, transcriptional networks and hormonal regulation, small RNAs, cell and tissue polarity, environmental control and natural variation. We intend to provide the reader who might have missed this remarkable event with a glimpse of the recent progress made in this blossoming research field.

Gene: !affects! Process 
Transcriptional networks: !regulate! Hormonal regulation 
Small RNAs: !control! Cell and tissue polarity 
Environment: !influences! Natural variation
