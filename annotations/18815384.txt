['18815384', 'Loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ENHANCED  DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (EDR1) gene confer enhanced resistance to infection by  powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum). EDR1 encodes a protein kinase, but  its substrates and the pathways regulated by EDR1 are unknown. To identify  components of the EDR1 signal transduction pathway(s), we conducted a forward  genetic screen for mutations that suppressed edr1-mediated disease resistance.  Genetic mapping and cloning of one of these suppressor mutations revealed a  recessive missense mutation in the KEEP ON GOING gene (KEG; At5g13530), which we  designated keg-4. KEG encodes a multidomain protein that includes a RING E3  ligase domain, a kinase domain, ankyrin repeats, and HERC2-like repeats. The KEG  protein has previously been shown to have ubiquitin ligase activity and to  negatively regulate protein levels of the transcription factor ABCISIC ACID  INSENSITIVE5. KEG mRNA levels were found to be 3-fold higher in edr1 mutant  plants compared to wild type. Loss-of-function mutations in KEG are seedling  lethal and are hypersensitive to glucose and abscisic acid (ABA). The keg-4  mutation, in contrast, conferred resistance to 6% glucose and suppressed  edr1-mediated hypersensitivity to ABA, suggesting that the keg-4 mutation  suppresses ABA signaling by altering KEG function. Several ABA-responsive genes  were found to be further up-regulated in the edr1 mutant following ABA treatment,  and this up-regulation was suppressed by the keg-4 mutation. We conclude that  edr1-mediated resistance to powdery mildew is mediated, in part, by enhanced ABA  signaling.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.127605', 'Innes']
