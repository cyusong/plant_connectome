The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major site for protein folding in eukaryotic cells. ER homeostasis is essential for the development of an organism, whereby the unfolded protein response (UPR) within the ER is precisely regulated. ER-phagy is a newly identified selective autophagic pathway for removal of misfolded or unfolded proteins within the ER in mammalian cells. Sec62, a component of the translocon complex, was recently characterized as an ER-phagy receptor during the ER stress recovery phase in mammals. In this study, we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis Sec62 (AtSec62) is required for plant development and might function as an ER-phagy receptor in plants. We showed that AtSec62 is an ER-localized membrane protein with three transmembrane domains (TMDs) with its C-terminus facing to the ER lumen. AtSec62 is required for plant development because atsec62 mutants display impaired vegetative growth, abnormal pollen and decreased fertility. atsec62 mutants are sensitive towards tunicamycin (TM)-induced ER stress, whereas overexpression of AtSec62 subsequently enhances stress tolerance during the ER stress recovery phase. Moreover, YFP-AtSec62 colocalizes with the autophagosome marker mCh-Atg8e in ring-like structures upon ER stress induction. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the pivotal roles of AtSec62 in plant development and ER-phagy.
