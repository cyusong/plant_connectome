As a climbing organ, the tendril undergoes rapid elongation to increase its length to locate a support within a short growth time. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this observation is poorly understood. Here, tendril development was divided into four stages in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) along with its growth. Phenotypic observations and section analyses showed that the rapid elongation of tendril primarily happened during stage 3 and mainly due to cell expansion. RNA-seq analysis showed that PACLOBUTRAZOL-RESISTANCE4 (CsPRE4) was highly expressed in the tendril. Our RNAi studies in cucumber and transgenic overexpression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suggested that CsPRE4 functions as a conserved activator of cell expansion to promote cell expansion and tendril elongation. Through a triantagonistic HLH (helix-loop-helix)-HLH-bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) cascade, CsPRE4-CsPAR1 (PHYTOCHROME RAPIDLY REGULATED1)-CsBEE1 (BR-ENHANCED EXPRESSION 1), CsPRE4 released the transcription factor CsBEE1, which activated expansin A12 (CsEXPA12) to loosen the cell wall structure in tendrils. Gibberellin (GA) promoted tendril elongation by modulating cell expansion, and CsPRE4 expression was induced by exogenous GA treatment, suggesting that CsPRE4 acts downstream of GA in regulating tendril elongation. In summary, our work suggested a CsPRE4-CsPAR1-CsBEE1-CsEXPA12 pathway in regulating cell expansion in cucumber tendrils, which might enable rapid tendril elongation to quickly locate a support.
