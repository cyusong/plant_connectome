Free magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) represents a powerful signal arising from interconversions of adenylates (ATP, ADP and AMP). This is a consequence of the involvement of adenylate kinase (AK) which equilibrates adenylates and uses defined species of Mg-complexed and Mg-free adenylates in both directions of its reaction. However, cells contain also other reversible Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes that equilibrate non-adenylate nucleotides (uridylates, cytidylates and guanylates), i.e. nucleoside monophosphate kinases (NMPKs) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK). Here, we propose that AK activity is tightly coupled to activities of NMPK and NDPK, linking adenylate equilibrium to equilibria of other nucleotides, and with [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] controlling the ratios of Mg-chelated and Mg-free nucleotides. This coupling establishes main hubs for adenylate-driven equilibration of non-adenylate nucleotides, with [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] acting as signal arising from all nucleotides rather than adenylates only. Further consequences involve an overall adenylate control of UTP-, GTP- and CTP-dependent pathways and the availability of substrates for RNA and DNA synthesis.
