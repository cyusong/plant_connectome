['27192441', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical to plant development and stress  responses. Abiotic stress triggers an ABA signal transduction cascade, which is  comprised of the core components PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, PP2C-type protein  phosphatases, and protein kinases. Small GTPases of the ROP/RAC family act as  negative regulators of ABA signal transduction. However, the mechanisms by which  ABA controls the behavior of ROP/RACs have remained unclear. Here, we show that  an Arabidopsis guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein RopGEF1 is rapidly  sequestered to intracellular particles in response to ABA. GFP-RopGEF1 is  sequestered via the endosome-prevacuolar compartment pathway and is degraded.  RopGEF1 directly interacts with several clade A PP2C protein phosphatases,  including ABI1. Interestingly, RopGEF1 undergoes constitutive degradation in pp2c  quadruple abi1/abi2/hab1/pp2ca mutant plants, revealing that active PP2C protein  phosphatases protect and stabilize RopGEF1 from ABA-mediated degradation.  Interestingly, ABA-mediated degradation of RopGEF1 also plays an important role  in ABA-mediated inhibition of lateral root growth. The presented findings point  to a PP2C-RopGEF-ROP/RAC control loop model that is proposed to aid in shutting  off ABA signal transduction, to counteract leaky ABA signal transduction caused  by "monomeric" PYL/RCAR ABA receptors in the absence of stress, and facilitate  signaling in response to ABA.', '2016 May', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.1002461', 'Schroeder']
