Light and microRNAs (miRNAs) are key external and internal signals for plant development, respectively. However, the relationship between the light signaling and miRNA biogenesis pathways remains unknown. Here we found that miRNA processer proteins DCL1 and HYL1 interact with a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4), which mediates the destabilization of DCL1 during dark-to-red-light transition. PIF4 acts as a transcription factor for some miRNA genes and is necessary for the proper accumulation of miRNAs. DCL1, HYL1, and mature miRNAs play roles in the regulation of plant hypocotyl growth. These results uncovered a previously unknown crosstalk between miRNA biogenesis and red light signaling through the PIF4-dependent regulation of miRNA transcription and processing to affect red-light-directed plant photomorphogenesis.
