A new study provides insight into microtubule turnover during plant cell division. Using clever molecular-genetic and imaging strategies, the authors demonstrate that the recently discovered CORD4 and 5 proteins associate with phragmoplast microtubules and control recruitment and activity of the microtubule-severing protein katanin.

CORD4: !associates with! phragmoplast microtubules
CORD5: !associates with! phragmoplast microtubules
CORD4/5: !controls! recruitment and activity of katanin
