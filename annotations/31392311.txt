In plants, chlorophyll (Chl) a and b are interconvertible by the action of three enzymes-chlorophyllide a oxygenase, Chl b reductase (CBR) and 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a reductase (HCAR). These reactions are collectively referred to as the Chl cycle. In plants, this cyclic pathway ubiquitously exists and plays essential roles in acclimation to different light conditions at various developmental stages. By contrast, only a limited number of cyanobacteria species produce Chl b, and these include Prochlorococcus, Prochloron, Prochlorothrix and Acaryochloris. In this study, we investigated a possible existence of the Chl cycle in Chl b synthesizing cyanobacteria by testing in vitro enzymatic activities of CBR and HCAR homologs from Prochlorothrix hollandica and Acaryochloris RCC1774. All of these proteins show respective CBR and HCAR activity in vitro, indicating that both cyanobacteria possess the potential to complete the Chl cycle. It is also found that CBR and HCAR orthologs are distributed only in the Chl b-containing cyanobacteria that habitat shallow seas or freshwater, where light conditions change dynamically, whereas they are not found in Prochlorococcus species that usually habitat environments with fixed lighting. Taken together, our results implicate a possibility that the Chl cycle functions for light acclimation in Chl b-containing cyanobacteria.
