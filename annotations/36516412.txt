Abscisic acid (ABA) represses seed germination and postgerminative growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. Auxin and jasmonic acid (JA) stimulate ABA function; however, the possible synergistic effects of auxin and JA on ABA signaling and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that exogenous auxin works synergistically with JA to enhance the ABA-induced delay of seed germination. Auxin biosynthesis, perception, and signaling are crucial for JA-promoted ABA responses. The auxin-dependent transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR10 (ARF10) and ARF16 interact with JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) repressors of JA signaling. ARF10 and ARF16 positively mediate JA-increased ABA responses, and overaccumulation of ARF16 partially restores the hyposensitive phenotype of JAZ-accumulating plants defective in JA signaling in response to combined ABA and JA treatment. Furthermore, ARF10 and ARF16 physically associate with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a critical regulator of ABA signaling, and the ability of ARF16 to stimulate JA-mediated ABA responses is mainly dependent on ABI5. ARF10 and ARF16 activate the transcriptional function of ABI5, whereas JAZ repressors antagonize their effects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that auxin contributes to the synergetic modulation of JA on ABA signaling, and explain the mechanism by which ARF10/16 coordinate with JAZ and ABI5 to integrate the auxin, JA, and ABA signaling pathways.
