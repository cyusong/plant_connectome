The oxidative (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) burst is a seminal feature of the basal plant defense response to attempted pathogen invasions. In 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' UF506, expression of the SC2 prophage-encoded secreted peroxidase (F489_gp15) increases bacterial fitness and delays symptom progression in citrus. Two chromosomal 1-Cys peroxiredoxin genes, CLIBASIA_RS00940 (Lasprx5) and CLIBASIA_RS00445 (Lasbcp), are conserved among all sequenced 'Ca. L. asiaticus' strains, including those lacking prophages. Both LasBCP and LasdPrx5 have only a single conserved peroxidatic Cys (C<sub>P</sub>/SH) and lack the resolving Cys (C<sub>R</sub>/SH). Lasprx5 appeared to be a housekeeping gene with similar moderate transcript abundance in both 'Ca. L. asiaticus'-infected psyllids and citrus. By contrast, Lasbcp was expressed only in planta, similar to the expression of the SC2 peroxidase. Since 'Ca. L. asiaticus' is uncultured, Lasbcp and Lasprx5 were functionally validated in a cultured surrogate species, Liberibacter crescens, and both genes significantly increased oxidative stress tolerance and cell viability in culture. LasBCP was nonclassically secreted and, in L. crescens, conferred 214-fold more resistance to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) than wild type. Transient overexpression of Lasbcp in tobacco suppressed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated transcriptional activation of RbohB, the key gatekeeper of the systemic plant defense signaling cascade. Lasbcp expression did not interfere with the perception of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' flagellin (flg22<sub>Las</sub>) but interrupted the downstream activation of RbohB and stereotypical deposition of callose in tobacco. Critically, LasBCP also protected against tBOOH-induced peroxidative degradation of lipid membranes in planta, preventing subsequent accumulation of antimicrobial oxylipins that can also trigger the localized hypersensitive cell death response.
