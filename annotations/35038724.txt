Raindrop impact on leaves is a common event which is of relevance for numerous processes, including the dispersal of pathogens and propagules, leaf wax erosion, gas exchange, leaf water absorption, and interception and storage of rainwater by canopies. The process of drop impact is complex, and its outcome depends on many influential factors. The wettability of plants has been recognized as an important parameter which is itself complex and difficult to determine for leaf surfaces. Other important parameters include leaf inclination angle and the ability of leaves to respond elastically to drop impact. Different elastic motions are initiated by drop impact, including local deformation, flapping, torsion, and bending, as well as 'swinging' of the petiole. These elastic responses, which occur on different time scales, can affect drop impact directly or indirectly, by changing the leaf inclination. An important feature of drop impact is splashing, meaning the fragmentation of the drop with ejection of satellite droplets. This process is promoted by the kinetic energy of the drop and leaf traits. For instance, a dense trichome cover can suppress splashing. Basic drop impact patterns are presented and discussed for a number of different leaf types, as well as some exemplary mosses.
