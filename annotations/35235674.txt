Recent research on the regulation of cellular phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in eukaryotes has collectively made substantial advances in elucidating inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsP) as Pi signaling molecules that are perceived by the SPX (Syg1, Pho81, and Xpr1) domains residing in multiple proteins involved in Pi transport and signaling. The PP-InsP-SPX signaling module is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and has been elaborately adopted in plant Pi transport and signaling systems. In this review, we have integrated these advances with prior established knowledge of Pi and PP-InsP metabolism, intracellular Pi sensing, and transcriptional responses according to the dynamics of cellular Pi status in plants. Anticipated challenges and pending questions as well as prospects are also discussed.
