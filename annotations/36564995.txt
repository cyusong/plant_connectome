Carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) is one of the most famous and ethylene-sensitive cut flowers worldwide, but how ethylene interacts with other plant hormones and factors to regulate petal senescence in carnation is largely unknown. Here we found that a gene encoding WRKY family transcription factor, DcWRKY33, was significantly upregulated upon ethylene treatment. Silencing and overexpression of DcWRKY33 could delay and accelerate the senescence of carnation petals, respectively. Abscisic acid (ABA) and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> treatments could also accelerate the senescence of carnation petals by inducing the expression of DcWRKY33. Further, DcWRKY33 can bind directly to the promoters of ethylene biosynthesis genes (DcACS1 and DcACO1), ABA biosynthesis genes (DcNCED2 and DcNCED5), and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation gene DcRBOHB to activate their expression. Lastly, relationships are existed between ethylene, ABA and ROS. This study elucidated that DcWRKY33 promotes petal senescence by activating genes involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene and ABA and accumulation of ROS in carnation, supporting the development of new strategies to prolong the vase life of cut carnation.
