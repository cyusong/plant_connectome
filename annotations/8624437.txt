['8624437', 'The membranes of plant and animal cells contain aquaporins, proteins that  facilitate the transport of water. In plants, aquaporins are found in the  vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) and the plasma membrane. Many aquaporins are  mercury sensitive, and in AQP1, a mercury-sensitive cysteine residue (Cys-189) is  present adjacent to a conserved Asn-Pro-Ala motif. Here, we report the molecular  analysis of a new Arabidopsis aquaporin, delta-TIP (for tonoplast intrinsic  protein), and show that it is located in the tonoplast. The water channel  activity of delta-TIP is sensitive to mercury. However, the mercury-sensitive  cysteine residue found in mammalian aquaporins is not present in delta-TIP, or in  gamma-TIP, a previously characterized mercury-sensitive tonoplast aquaporin.  Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the mercury-sensitive site in  these two aquaporins as Cys-116 and Cys-118 for delta-TIP and gamma-TIP,  respectively. These mutations are at a conserved position in a presumed  membrane-spanning domain not previously known to have a role in aquaporin mercury  sensitivity. Comparing the tissue expression patterns of delta-TIP with gamma-TIP  and alpha-TIP showed that the TIPs are differentially expressed.', '1996 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.8.4.587', 'Chrispeels']
