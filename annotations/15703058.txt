['15703058', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones that are essential for a wide range of  developmental processes in plants. Many of the genes responsible for the early  reactions in the biosynthesis of BRs have recently been identified. However,  several genes for enzymes that catalyze late steps in the biosynthesis pathways  of BRs remain to be identified, and only a few genes responsible for the  reactions that produce bioactive BRs have been identified. We found that the  ROTUNDIFOLIA3 (ROT3) gene, encoding the enzyme CYP90C1, which was specifically  involved in the regulation of leaf length in Arabidopsis thaliana, was required  for the late steps in the BR biosynthesis pathway. ROT3 appears to be required  for the conversion of typhasterol to castasterone, an activation step in the BR  pathway. We also analyzed the gene most closely related to ROT3, CYP90D1, and  found that double mutants for ROT3 and CYP90D1 had a severe dwarf phenotype,  whereas cyp90d1 single knockout mutants did not. BR profiling in these mutants  revealed that CYP90D1 was also involved in BR biosynthesis pathways. ROT3 and  CYP90D1 were expressed differentially in leaves of A. thaliana, and the mutants  for these two genes differed in their defects in elongation of hypocotyls under  light conditions. The expression of CYP90D1 was strongly induced in leaf petioles  in the dark. The results of the present study provide evidence that the two  cytochrome P450s, CYP90C1 and CYP90D1, play distinct roles in organ-specific  environmental regulation of the biosynthesis of BRs.', '2005 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02330.x', 'Tsukaya']
