['24004165', 'The Arabidopsis protein AtTTM3 belongs to the CYTH superfamily named after its  two founding members, the CyaB adenylate cyclase from Aeromonas hydrophila and  the mammalian thiamine triphosphatase. In this study we report the  three-dimensional structure of a plant CYTH domain protein, AtTTM3, determined at  1.9 A resolution. The crystal structure revealed the characteristic tunnel  architecture of CYTH proteins, which specialize in the binding of nucleotides and  other organic phosphates and in phosphoryl transfer reactions. The beta barrel is  composed of eight antiparallel beta strands with a cluster of conserved inwardly  facing acidic and basic amino acid residues. Mutagenesis of these residues in the  catalytic core led to an almost complete loss of enzymatic activity. We  established that AtTTM3 is not an adenylate cyclase. Instead, the enzyme  displayed weak NTP phosphatase as well as strong tripolyphosphatase activities  similar to the triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme proteins from Clostridium  thermocellum (CthTTM) and Nitrosomonas europaea (NeuTTM). AtTTM3 is most highly  expressed in the proximal meristematic zone of the plant root. Furthermore, an  AtTTM3 T-DNA insertion knockout line displayed a delay in root growth as well as  reduced length and number of lateral roots, suggesting a role for AtTTM3 in root  development.', '2013 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12325', 'Yoshioka']
