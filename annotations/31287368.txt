<i>Azorhizobium caulinodans</i> can form root and stem nodules with the host plant <i>Sesbania rostrata</i>. The role of the CheZ phosphatase in the <i>A. caulinodans</i> chemotaxis pathway was previously explored using the nonchemotactic <i>cheZ</i> mutant strain (AC601). This mutant displayed stronger attachment to the root surface, enhancing early colonization; however, this did not result in increased nodulation efficiency. In this study, we further investigated the role of CheZ in the interaction between strain ORS571 and the roots of its host plant. By tracking long-term colonization dynamic of <i>cheZ</i> mutant marked with LacZ, we found a decrease of colonization of the <i>cheZ</i> mutant during this process. Furthermore, the <i>cheZ</i> mutant could not spread on the root surface freely and was gradually outcompeted by the wild type in original colonization sites. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analyses showed that <i>exp</i> genes encoding exopolysaccharides synthesis, including <i>oac3,</i> were highly expressed in the <i>cheZ</i> mutant. Construction of a strain carrying a deletion of both <i>cheZ</i> and <i>oac3</i> resulted in a mutant strain defective in the colonization process to the same extent as found with the <i>oac3</i> single-mutant strain. This result suggested that the enhanced colonization of the <i>cheZ</i> mutant may be achieved through regulating the formation of exopolysaccharides. This shows the importance of the chemotactic proteins in the interaction between rhizobia and host plants, and expands our understanding of the symbiosis interaction between rhizobium and host plant.
