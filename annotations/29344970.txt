In gas-exchange experiments, manipulating CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> is commonly used to change the balance between carboxylation and oxygenation. Downstream metabolism (utilization of photosynthetic and photorespiratory products) may also be affected by gaseous conditions but this is not well documented. Here, we took advantage of sunflower as a model species, which accumulates chlorogenate in addition to sugars and amino acids (glutamate, alanine, glycine and serine). We performed isotopic labelling with <sup>13</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> under different CO<sub>2</sub> /O<sub>2</sub> conditions, and determined <sup>13</sup> C contents to compute <sup>13</sup> C-allocation patterns and build-up rates. The <sup>13</sup> C content in major metabolites was not found to be a constant proportion of net fixed carbon but, rather, changed dramatically with CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> . Alanine typically accumulated at low O<sub>2</sub> (hypoxic response) while photorespiratory intermediates accumulated under ambient conditions and at high photorespiration, glycerate accumulation exceeding serine and glycine build-up. Chlorogenate synthesis was relatively more important under normal conditions and at high CO<sub>2</sub> and its synthesis was driven by phosphoenolpyruvate de novo synthesis. These findings demonstrate that carbon allocation to metabolites other than photosynthetic end products is affected by gaseous conditions and therefore the photosynthetic yield of net nitrogen assimilation varies, being minimal at high CO<sub>2</sub> and maximal at high O<sub>2</sub> .
