Domestication of plant species has affected the evolutionary dynamics of plant pathogens in agriculture and forestry. A model system for studying the consequences of plant domestication on the evolution of an emergent plant disease is the fungal pathogen <i>Sphaerulina musiva</i>. This ascomycete causes leaf spot and stem canker disease of <i>Populus</i> spp. and their hybrids. A population genomics approach was used to determine the degree of population structure and evidence for selection on the North American population of <i>S. musiva</i>. In total, 122 samples of the fungus were genotyped identifying 120,016 single-nucleotide polymorphisms after quality filtering. In North America, <i>S. musiva</i> has low to moderate degrees of differentiation among locations. Three main genetic clusters were detected: southeastern United States, midwestern United States and Canada, and a new British Columbia cluster (BC2). Population genomics suggest that BC2 is a novel genetic cluster from central British Columbia, clearly differentiated from previously reported <i>S. musiva</i> from coastal British Columbia, and the product of a single migration event. Phenotypic measurements from greenhouse experiments indicate lower aggressiveness of BC2 on <i>Populus trichocarpa.</i> In summary, <i>S. musiva</i> has geographic structure across broad regions indicative of gene flow among clusters. The interconnectedness of the North American <i>S. musiva</i> populations across large geographic distances further supports the hypothesis of anthropogenic-facilitated transport of the pathogen.
