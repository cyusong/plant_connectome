['22672737', 'BACKGROUND: The positioning and dynamics of vesicles and organelles, and thus the  growth of plant cells, is mediated by the acto-myosin system. In Arabidopsis  there are 13 class XI myosins which mediate vesicle and organelle transport in  different cell types. So far the involvement of five class XI myosins in cell  expansion during the shoot and root development has been shown, three of which,  XI-1, XI-2, and XI-K, are essential for organelle transport. RESULTS:  Simultaneous depletion of Arabidopsis class XI myosins XI-K, XI-1, and XI-2 in  double and triple mutant plants affected the growth of several types of epidermal  cells. The size and shape of trichomes, leaf pavement cells and the elongation of  the stigmatic papillae of double and triple mutant plants were affected to  different extent. Reduced cell size led to significant size reduction of shoot  organs in the case of triple mutant, affecting bolt formation, flowering time and  fertility. Phenotype analysis revealed that the reduced fertility of triple  mutant plants was caused by delayed or insufficient development of pistils.  CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the class XI myosins XI-K, XI-1 and XI-2 have  partially redundant roles in the growth of shoot epidermis. Myosin XI-K plays  more important role whereas myosins XI-1 and XI-2 have minor roles in the  determination of size and shape of epidermal cells, because the absence of these  two myosins is compensated by XI-K. Co-operation between myosins XI-K and XI-2  appears to play an important role in these processes.', '2012 Jun 6', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-12-81', 'Paves']
