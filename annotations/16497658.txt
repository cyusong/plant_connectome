['16497658', 'AtCyp59 and its orthologs from different organisms belong to a family of modular  proteins consisting of a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain,  followed by an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and a C-terminal domain enriched in  charged amino acids. AtCyp59 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an  interacting partner of the Arabidopsis SR protein SCL33/SR33. The interaction  with SCL33/SR33 and with a majority of Arabidopsis SR proteins was confirmed by  in vitro pull-down assays. Consistent with these interactions, AtCyp59 localizes  to the cell nucleus, but it does not significantly colocalize with SR proteins in  nuclear speckles. Rather, it shows a punctuate localization pattern resembling  transcription sites. Indeed, by using yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pull-down, and  immunoprecipitation assays, we found that AtCyp59 interacts with the C-terminal  domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Ectopic expression of  the tagged protein in Arabidopsis cell suspension resulted in highly reduced  growth that is most probably due to reduced phosphorylation of the CTD. Together  our data suggest a possible function of AtCyp59 in activities connecting  transcription and pre-mRNA processing. We discuss our data in the context of a  dynamic interplay between transcription and pre-mRNA processing.', '2006 Apr', 'RNA', '10.1261/rna.2226106', 'Lorkovic']
