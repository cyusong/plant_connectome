Compared with sole nitrogen (N), the nutrition mixture of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>) is known to better improve crop yield and quality. However, the mechanism underlying this improvement remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the changes in nutrient solution composition, content of different N forms in plant tissues and exudates, and expression of plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase genes (<i>HAs</i>) under different NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ratios (0/100, 10/90, 25/75, 50/50 as control, T1, T2, and T3) in flowering Chinese cabbage. We observed that compared with the control, T1 and T2 increased the economical yield of flowering Chinese cabbage by 1.26- and 1.54-fold, respectively, whereas T3 significantly reduced plant yield. Compared with the control, T1-T3 significantly reduced the NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> content and increased the NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>, amino acid, and soluble protein contents of flowering Chinese cabbage to varying extents. T2 significantly increased the N use efficiency (NUE), whereas T3 significantly decreased it to only being 70.25% of that of the control. Owing to the difference in N absorption and utilization among seedlings, the pH value of the nutrient solution differed under different NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ratios. At harvest, the pH value of T2 was 5.8; in the control and T1, it was approximately 8.0, and in T3 it was only 3.6. We speculated that appropriate NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ratios may improve N absorption and assimilation and thus promote the growth of flowering Chinese cabbage, owing to the suitable pH value. On the contrary, addition of excessive NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> may induce rhizosphere acidification and ammonia toxicity, causing plant growth inhibition. We further analyzed the transcription of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase genes (<i>HAs</i>). <i>HA1</i> and <i>HA7</i> transcription in roots was significantly down-regulated by the addition of the mixture of NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>, whereas the transcription of <i>HA2</i>, <i>HA9</i> in roots and <i>HA7</i>, <i>HA8</i>, and <i>HA10</i> in leaves was sharply up-regulated by the addition of the mixture; the transcription of <i>HA3</i> was mainly enhanced by the highest ratio of NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>. Our results provide valuable information about the effects of treatments with different NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ratios on plant growth and N uptake and utilization.
