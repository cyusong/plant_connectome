['8798465', 'Two plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) K+ transport systems, KAT1 and AKT1, have been  expressed in insect cells (Sf9 cell line) using recombinant baculoviruses.  Microscopic observation after immunogold staining revealed that the expressed  AKT1 and KAT1 polypeptides were mainly associated with internal membranes, but  that a minute fraction was targeted to the cell membrane. KAT1 was known, from  earlier electrophysiological characterization in Xenopus oocytes, to be an  inwardly rectifying voltage-gated channel highly selective for K+, while similar  experiments had failed to characterize AKT1. Insect cells expressing KAT1  displayed an exogenous inwardly rectifying K+ conductance reminiscent of that  described previously in Xenopus oocytes expressing KAT1. Under similar  conditions, cells expressing AKT1 showed a disturbed cell membrane electrical  stability that precluded electrophysiological analysis. Use of a baculovirus  transfer vector designed so as to decrease the expression level allowed the first  electrophysiological characterization of AKT1. The baculovirus system can thus be  used as an alternative method when expression in Xenopus oocytes is unsuccessful  for electrophysiological characterization of the ion channel of interest. The  plant AKT1 protein has been shown in this way to be an inwardly rectifying  voltage-gated channel highly selective for K+ ions and sensitive to cGMP.', '1996 Sep 13', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.271.37.22863', 'Thibaud']
