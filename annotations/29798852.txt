LaManna <i>et al</i> (Reports, 30 June 2017, p. 1389) claim that subadult trees are proportionally less common at high conspecific adult density (CNDD) and that this effect increases toward the tropics and for rare species. We show that the CNDD-abundance correlation may have arisen from a methodological artifact and that a range of processes can explain the reported latitudinal pattern.
