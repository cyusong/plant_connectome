['16617110', 'Low phosphate (Pi) availability is one of the major constraints for plant  productivity in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Plants have evolved a myriad  of developmental and biochemical mechanisms to increase internal Pi uptake and  utilization efficiency. One important biochemical pathway leading to an increase  in internal Pi availability is the hydrolysis of phospholipids. Hydrolyzed  phospholipids are replaced by nonphosphorus lipids such as galactolipids and  sulfolipids, which help to maintain the functionality and structure of membrane  systems. Here we report that a member of the Arabidopsis phospholipase D gene  family (PLDZ2) is gradually induced upon Pi starvation in both shoots and roots.  From lipid content analysis we show that an Arabidopsis pldz2 mutant is defective  in the hydrolysis of phospholipids and has a reduced capacity to accumulate  galactolipids under limiting Pi conditions. Morphological analysis of the pldz2  root system shows a premature change in root architecture in response to Pi  starvation. These results show that PLDZ2 is involved in the eukaryotic  galactolipid biosynthesis pathway, specifically in hydrolyzing  phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine to produce diacylglycerol for  digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthesis and free Pi to sustain other Pi-requiring  processes.', '2006 Apr 25', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0600863103', 'Herrera-Estrella']
