Grain size is an important agronomic trait, but our knowledge about grain size determination in crops is still limited. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is a special ubiquitin proteasome system that is involved in degrading misfolded or incompletely folded proteins in the ER. Here, we report that SMALL GRAIN 3 (SMG3) and DECREASED GRAIN SIZE 1 (DGS1), an ERAD-related E2-E3 enzyme pair, regulate grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway in rice (Oryza sativa). SMG3 encodes a homolog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UBIQUITIN CONJUGATING ENZYME 32, which is a conserved ERAD-associated E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. SMG3 interacts with another grain size regulator, DGS1. Loss of function of SMG3 or DGS1 results in small grains, while overexpression of SMG3 or DGS1 leads to long grains. Further analyses showed that DGS1 is an active E3 ubiquitin ligase and colocates with SMG3 in the ER. SMG3 and DGS1 are involved in BR signaling. DGS1 ubiquitinates the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and affects its accumulation. Genetic analysis suggests that SMG3, DGS1, and BRI1 act together to regulate grain size and weight. In summary, our findings identify an ERAD-related E2-E3 pair that regulates grain size and weight, which gives insight into the function of ERAD in grain size control and BR signaling.
