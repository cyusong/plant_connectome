Plant growth and morphogenesis depend on the levels and distribution of the plant hormone auxin. Plants tightly regulate cellular levels of the active auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) through synthesis, inactivation, and transport. Although the transporters that move IAA into and out of cells are well characterized and play important roles in development, little is known about the transport of IAA precursors. In this review, we discuss the accumulating evidence suggesting that the IAA precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is transported independently of the characterized IAA transport machinery along with the recent identification of specific IBA efflux carriers and enzymes suggested to metabolize IBA. These studies have revealed important roles for IBA in maintaining IAA levels and distribution within the plant to support normal development.
