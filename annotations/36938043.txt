The subgenus <i>Cerasus</i>, one of the most important groups in the genus <i>Prunus sensu lato</i>, comprises over 100 species; however, the taxonomic classification and phylogenetic relationships of <i>Cerasus</i> remain controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree for known <i>Cerasus</i> species. Here, we report the chloroplast (cp) genome sequences of 11 <i>Cerasus</i> species to provide insight into evolution of the plastome. The cp genomes of the 11 <i>Cerasus</i> species (157,571-158,830 bp) displayed a typical quadripartite circular structure. The plastomes contain 115 unique genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, four ribosomal RNAs, and 31 transfer RNAs. Twenty genes were found to be duplicated in inverted repeats as well as at the boundary. The conserved non-coding sequences showed significant divergence compared with the coding regions. We found 12 genes and 14 intergenic regions with higher nucleotide diversity and more polymorphic sites, including <i>matK</i>, <i>rps16</i>, <i>rbcL</i>, <i>rps16</i>-<i>trnQ</i>, <i>petN</i>-<i>psbM</i>, and <i>trnL</i>-<i>trnF</i>. During cp plastome evolution, the codon profile has been strongly biased toward the use of A/T at the third base, and leucine and isoleucine codons appear the most frequently. We identified strong purifying selection on the <i>rpoA</i>, <i>cemA</i>, <i>atpA</i>, and <i>petB</i> genes; whereas <i>ccsA</i>, <i>rps19</i>, <i>matK</i>, <i>rpoC2</i>, <i>ycf2</i> and <i>ndhI</i> showed a signature of possible positive selection during the course of <i>Cerasus</i> evolution. In addition, we further analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of these species with 57 other congenic related species.Through reconstructing the <i>Cerasus</i> phylogeny tree, we found that true cherry is similar to the flora of China forming a distinct group, from which <i>P. mahaleb</i> was separated as an independent subclade. <i>Microcerasus</i> was genetically closer to <i>Amygdalus</i>, <i>Armeniaca</i>, and <i>Prunus</i> (<i>sensu stricto</i>) than to members of true cherry, whereas <i>P. japonica</i> and <i>P. tomentosa</i> were most closely related to <i>P. triloba</i> and <i>P. pedunculata</i>. However, <i>P. tianshanica</i> formed a clade with <i>P. cerasus</i>, <i>P. fruticosa</i>, <i>P. cerasus</i> × <i>P. canescens</i> 'Gisela 6', and <i>P. avium</i> as a true cherry group. These results provide new insights into the plastome evolution of <i>Cerasus</i>, along with potential molecular markers and candidate DNA barcodes for further phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of <i>Cerasus</i> species.
