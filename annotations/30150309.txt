['30150309', 'Plant seedlings undergo distinct developmental processes in the dark and in the  light. Several genes, including ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), B-BOX PROTEIN21  (BBX21), and BBX22, have been identified as photomorphogenesis-promoting factors  in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, the overexpression of these genes does not  induce photomorphogenesis in the dark. Using an activation-tagging approach, we  identified SRS5ox, which overexpresses SHI-RELATED SEQUENCE5 (SRS5) following  induction with estradiol. SRS5 overexpression in SRS5ox and Pro35S:SRS5-GFP  seedlings results in a constitutive photomorphogenesis phenotype in the dark,  whereas SRS5 loss of function in the srs5-2 mutant results in long hypocotyls in  the light. This indicates that SRS5 is a positive regulator of  photomorphogenesis. Furthermore, SRS5 promotes photomorphogenesis by directly  binding to the promoters of photomorphogenesis-promoting genes, such as HY5,  BBX21, and BBX22, and activating their expression, thus affecting the expression  of downstream light-signaling genes. These data indicate that SRS5 acts in the  upregulation of photomorphogenesis-promoting genes. In addition, CONSTITUTIVELY  PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), which plays a central repressive role in seedling  photomorphogenesis, directly ubiquitinates SRS5, promoting its degradation in the  dark. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SRS5 directly activates the  expression of downstream genes HY5, BBX21, and BBX22 and is a target of  COP1-mediated degradation in Arabidopsis.', '2018 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00455', 'ORCID:']
