Transmission of electrical charge between a lobe and the midrib causes closure of the trap and induces an electrical signal propagating between a lobe and a midrib. The Venus flytrap can accumulate small subthreshold charges, and when the threshold value is reached, the trap closes. The cumulative character of electrical stimuli points to the existence of short-term electrical memory in the Venus flytrap. We investigated the electrical properties of the upper leaf of the Venus flytrap and proposed the equivalent electrical circuit in agreement with the experimental data.
