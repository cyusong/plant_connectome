['26628744', 'Dolichol is a required cofactor for protein glycosylation, the most common  posttranslational modification modulating the stability and biological activity  of proteins in all eukaryotic cells. We have identified and characterized two  genes, PPRD1 and -2, which are orthologous to human SRD5A3 (steroid 5alpha reductase  type 3) and encode polyprenol reductases responsible for conversion of polyprenol  to dolichol in Arabidopsis thaliana. PPRD1 and -2 play dedicated roles in plant  metabolism. PPRD2 is essential for plant viability; its deficiency results in  aberrant development of the male gametophyte and sporophyte. Impaired protein  glycosylation seems to be the major factor underlying these defects although  disturbances in other cellular dolichol-dependent processes could also  contribute. Shortage of dolichol in PPRD2-deficient cells is partially rescued by  PPRD1 overexpression or by supplementation with dolichol. The latter has been  discussed as a method to compensate for deficiency in protein glycosylation.  Supplementation of the human diet with dolichol-enriched plant tissues could  allow new therapeutic interventions in glycosylation disorders. This  identification of PPRD1 and -2 elucidates the factors mediating the key step of  the dolichol cycle in plant cells which makes manipulation of dolichol content in  plant tissues feasible.', '2015 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00463', 'ORCID:']
