['35731874', 'RNA binding proteins mediate posttranscriptional RNA metabolism and play  regulatory roles in many developmental processes in eukaryotes. Despite their  known effects on the floral transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in  plants, the underlying mechanisms remain largely obscure. Here, we show that a  hitherto unknown RNA binding protein, hnRNP R-LIKE PROTEIN (HRLP), inhibits  cotranscriptional splicing of a key floral repressor gene FLOWERING LOCUS C  (FLC). This, in turn, facilitates R-loop formation near FLC intron I to repress  its transcription, thereby promoting the floral transition in Arabidopsis  thaliana. HRLP, together with the splicing factor ARGININE/SERINE-RICH 45, forms  phase-separated nuclear condensates with liquid-like properties, which is  essential for HRLP function in regulating FLC splicing, R-loop formation, and RNA  Polymerase II recruitment. Our findings reveal that inhibition of  cotranscriptional splicing of FLC by nuclear HRLP condensates constitutes the  molecular basis for down-regulation of FLC transcript levels to ensure the  reproductive success of Arabidopsis.', '2022 Jun 24', 'Sci Adv', '10.1126/sciadv.abn5488', 'ORCID:']
