This commentary highlights the recent two studies which uncovered dynamic maize kernel RNA-seq transcriptomes from early seed development, storage filling to maturation, day by day, hour by hour. These two studies provide a 'maize kernel gene expression dictionary' that will be powerful for the future studies in seed biology.
