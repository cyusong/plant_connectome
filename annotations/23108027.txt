['23108027', 'Arsenic is a toxic metalloid and recognized carcinogen. Arsenate and arsenite are  the most common arsenic species available for uptake by plants. As an inorganic  phosphate (Pi) analog, arsenate is acquired by plant roots through endogenous Pi  transport systems. Inside the cell, arsenate is reduced to the thiol-reactive  form arsenite. Glutathione (GSH)-conjugates of arsenite may be extruded from the  cell or sequestered in vacuoles by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)  family of transporters. In the present study we sought to enhance both plant  arsenic uptake through Pi transporter overexpression, and plant arsenic tolerance  through ABC transporter overexpression. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana  plants overexpressing the high-affinity Pi transporter family members, AtPht1;1  or AtPht1;7, are hypersensitive to arsenate due to increased arsenate uptake.  These plants do not exhibit increased sensitivity to arsenite. Co-overexpression  of the yeast ABC transporter YCF1 in combination with AtPht1;1 or AtPht1;7  suppresses the arsenate-sensitive phenotype while further enhancing arsenic  uptake. Taken together, our results support an arsenic transport mechanism in  which arsenate uptake is increased through Pi transporter overexpression, and  arsenic tolerance is enhanced through YCF1-mediated vacuolar sequestration. This  work substantiates the viability of coupling enhanced uptake and vacuolar  sequestration as a means for developing a prototypical engineered arsenic  hyperaccumulator.', '2013 Jan 10', 'J Biotechnol', '10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.10.013', 'Smith']
