<i>Festuca rubra</i> subsp. <i>pruinosa</i> is a perennial grass that inhabits sea cliffs, a habitat where salinity and low nutrient availability occur. These plants have a rich fungal microbiome, and particularly common are their associations with <i>Epichloë festucae</i> in aboveground tissues and with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> and <i>Periconia macrospinosa</i> in roots. In this study, we hypothesized that these fungi could affect the performance of <i>F. rubra</i> plants under salinity, being important complements for plant habitat adaptation. Two lines of <i>F. rubra</i>, each one consisting of <i>Epichloë</i>-infected and <i>Epichloë</i>-free clones, were inoculated with the root endophytes (<i>F. oxysporum</i> and <i>P. macrospinosa</i>) and subjected to a salinity treatment. Under salinity, plants symbiotic with <i>Epichloë</i> had lower Na<sup>+</sup> content than non-symbiotic plants, but this effect was not translated into plant growth. <i>P. macrospinosa</i> promoted leaf and root growth in the presence and absence of salinity, and <i>F. oxysporum</i> promoted leaf and root growth in the presence and absence of salinity, plus a decrease in leaf Na<sup>+</sup> content under salinity. The growth responses could be due to functions related to improved nutrient acquisition, while the reduction of Na<sup>+</sup> content might be associated with salinity tolerance and plant survival in the long term. Each of these three components of the <i>F. rubra</i> core mycobiome contributed with different functions, which are beneficial and complementary for plant adaptation to its habitat in sea cliffs. Although our results do not support an obvious role of <i>Epichloë</i> itself in FRP salt tolerance, there is evidence that <i>Epichloë</i> can interact with root endophytes, affecting host plant performance.
