PP2C protein phosphatase family is one of the largest gene families in the plant genome. Many PP2C family members are involved in the regulation of abiotic stress. We found that <i>BpPP2C1</i> gene has highly up-regulated in root under salt stress in <i>Betula platyphylla</i>. Thus, transgenic plants of <i>Betula platyphylla</i> with overexpression and knockout of <i>BpPP2C1</i> gene were generated using a zygote transformation system. Under NaCl stress treatment, we measured the phenotypic traits of transgenic plants, chlorophyll-fluorescence parameters, peroxidase (POD) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. We found that <i>BpPP2C1</i> overexpressed lines showed obvious salt tolerance, while <i>BpPP2C1</i> knocked out plants were sensitive to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis identified significantly amount of differentially expressed genes associated with salt stress in <i>BpPP2C1</i> transgenic lines, especially genes in abscisic acid signaling pathway, flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, oxidative stress and anion transport. Functional study of <i>BpPP2C1</i> in <i>Betula platyphylla</i> revealed its role in salt stress.
