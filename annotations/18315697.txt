Atmospheric CO(2) concentration ([CO(2)]) is rising on a global scale and is known to affect flowering time. Elevated [CO(2)] may be as influential as temperature in determining future changes in plant developmental timing, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control altered flowering times at elevated [CO(2)]. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression patterns were compared of floral-initiation genes between a genotype that was selected for high fitness at elevated [CO(2)] and a nonselected control genotype. The selected genotype exhibits pronounced delays in flowering time when grown at elevated [CO(2)], whereas the control genotype is unaffected by elevated [CO(2)]. Thus, this comparison provides an evolutionarily relevant system for gaining insight into the responses of plants to future increases in [CO(2)]. Evidence is provided that elevated [CO(2)] influences the expression of floral-initiation genes. In addition, it is shown that delayed flowering at elevated [CO(2)] is associated with sustained expression of the floral repressor gene, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), in an elevated CO(2)-adapted genotype. Understanding the mechanisms that account for changes in plant developmental timing at elevated [CO(2)] is critical for predicting the responses of plants to a high-CO(2) world of the near future.
