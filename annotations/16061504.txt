The F-actin cytoskeleton is hypothesized to play a role in signal transduction mechanisms of gravitropism by interacting with sedimenting amyloplasts as they traverse statocytes of gravistimulated plants. Previous studies have determined that pharmacological disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin B (Lat-B) causes increased gravitropism in stem-like organs and roots, and results in a more rapid settling of amyloplasts in the columella cells of Arabidopsis roots. These results suggest that the actin cytoskeleton modulates amyloplast movement and also gravitropic signal transduction. To determine the effect of F-actin disruption on amyloplast sedimentation in stem-like organs, Arabidopsis hypocotyls were treated with Lat-B and a detailed analysis of amyloplast sedimentation kinetics was performed by determining amyloplast positions in endodermal cells at various time intervals following reorientation. Confocal microscopy was used to confirm that Lat-B effectively disrupts the actin cytoskeleton in these cells. The results indicate that amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells settle more quickly compared with amyloplasts in root columella cells. F-actin disruption with Lat-B severely reduces amyloplast mobility within Arabidopsis endodermal statocytes, and these results suggest that amyloplast sedimentation within the hypocotyl endodermal cell is F-actin-dependent. Thus, a model for gravitropism in stem-like organs is proposed in which F-actin modulates the gravity response by actively participating in statolith repositioning within the endodermal statocytes.
