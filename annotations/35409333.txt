<i>Class III peroxidases</i> constitute a plant-specific multigene family, where 73 genes have been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. These genes are members of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulatory network in the whole plant, but more importantly, at the root level. In response to abiotic stresses such as cold, heat, and salinity, their expression is significantly modified. To learn more about their transcriptional regulation, an integrative phenotypic, genomic, and transcriptomic study was executed on the roots of <i>A. thaliana</i> Pyrenean populations. Initially, the root phenotyping highlighted 3 Pyrenean populations to be tolerant to cold (Eaux), heat (Herr), and salt (Grip) stresses. Then, the RNA-seq analyses on these three populations, in addition to Col-0, displayed variations in <i>CIII Prxs</i> expression under stressful treatments and between different genotypes. Consequently, several <i>CIII Prxs</i> were particularly upregulated in the tolerant populations, suggesting novel and specific roles of these genes in plant tolerance against abiotic stresses.
