Initial exposure of plants to osmotic stress caused by drought, cold, or salinity leads to acclimation, termed acquired tolerance, to subsequent severe stresses. Acquired osmotolerance induced by salt stress is widespread across Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions and is conferred by disruption of a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat gene, designated ACQUIRED OSMOTOLERANCE. De-repression of this gene under osmotic stress causes detrimental autoimmunity via ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4). However, the mechanism underlying acquired osmotolerance remains poorly understood. Here, we isolated an acquired osmotolerance-defective mutant (aod13) by screening 30,000 seedlings of an ion beam-mutagenized M2 population of Bu-5, an accession with acquired osmotolerance. We found that AOD13 encodes the dual-specificity phosphatase MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE1 (MKP1), which negatively regulates MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE3/6 (MPK3/6). Consistently, MPK3/6 activation was greater in aod13 than in the Bu-5 wild-type (WT). The aod13 mutant was sensitive to osmotic stress but tolerant to salt stress. Under osmotic stress, pathogenesis-related genes were strongly induced in aod13 but not in the Bu-5 WT. Loss of PAD4 in pad4 aod13 plants did not restore acquired osmotolerance, implying that activation of immunity independent of PAD4 renders aod13 sensitive to osmotic stress. These findings suggest that AOD13 (i.e. MKP1) promotes osmotolerance by suppressing the PAD4-independent immune response activated by MPK3/6.
