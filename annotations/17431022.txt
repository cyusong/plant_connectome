With the recent proliferation of computer models of auxin transport, it is important that plant biologists understand something about these techniques and how to evaluate them. The paper begins with a brief introduction to the parts of a computer model, followed by a discussion of the limitations of the most common auxin modelling technique. Lastly, several recent models of organ initiation in the shoot apical meristem (i.e. phyllotaxis) are reviewed. The cell and molecular biology of phyllotaxis is now understood well enough that computer models can go beyond a simple 'proof of principle' and start to provide insights into gene function.
