['33439244', "PGR3 is a P-class pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein required for the  stabilization of petL operon RNA and the translation of the petL gene in  plastids. Irrespective of its important roles in plastids, key questions have  remained unanswered, including how PGR3 protein promotes translation and which  plastid mRNA PGR3 activates the translation. Here, we show that PGR3 facilitates  the translation from ndhG, in addition to petL, through binding to their 5'  untranslated regions (UTRs). Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing in pgr3  mutants revealed that translation from petL and ndhG was specifically suppressed.  Harnessing small RNA fragments protected by PPR proteins in vivo, we probed the  PGR3 recruitment to the 5' UTRs of petL and ndhG. The putative PGR3-bound RNA  segments per se repress the translation possibly with a strong secondary  structure and thereby block ribosomes' access. However, the PGR3 binding  antagonizes the effects and facilitates the protein synthesis from petL and ndhG  in vitro. The prediction of the 3-dimensional structure of PGR3 suggests that the  26th PPR motif plays important roles in target RNA binding. Our data show the  specificity of a plastidic RNA-binding protein and provide a mechanistic insight  into translational control.", '2021 Oct 29', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcaa180', 'ORCID:']
