In this study we examined the role of the nitrogen-fixing tree, Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust), in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) formation and ECM community of Pinus thunbergii (Japanese black pine) seedlings. Two 200 m(2) experimental plots were established at the border between a Japanese black pine- and a black locust-dominated area in a coastal forest. The ECM fungal community of pine seedlings was examined by PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis. We analyzed the relationship between ECM formation, ECM community, growth, and nutrient status of pine seedlings and environmental conditions using the Mantel test and structural equation model. Percentages of ECM root tips, the number of ECM fungal species and ECM diversity on pine seedlings decreased in the black locust-dominated area. Cenococcum geophilum and Russula spp. were dominant in the Japanese black pine-dominated area, whereas Tomentella spp. were dominant in the black locust-dominated area. Nitrogen (N) concentration in soils or pine seedlings strongly influenced the percentage of ECM root tips, the number of ECM fungal species and ECM fungal similarity. These results imply the long-term eutrophication caused by N-fixing trees can change ECM formation and ECM community structure.
