We examined whether the reduced mycorrhization of abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient tomato mutants correlates with their incapacity in ABA biosynthesis and whether this effect is dependent on ethylene production. The mycorrhization of notabilis and sitiens mutants, which have different ABA deficiencies and an excess of ethylene production, was analyzed. Comparative analysis of the ABA-deficient tomato mutants showed both quantitative and qualitative differences in the pattern of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) colonization between the two tomato mutant phenotypes. The sitiens mutant showed a great limitation in fungal colonization (mycorrhizal intensity and arbuscule formation) well correlated with their incapacity in ABA biosynthesis. The notabilis plants, which maintained normal ABA levels in roots under our experimental conditions, appeared to be less affected in their capacity for AM formation, and only a decrease in mycorrhizal intensity was noted at the end of the mycorrhization process. Blockage of ABA formation after tungstate application resulted in a reduction in mycorrhization of wild-type tomato plants. The transcript accumulation of the mycorrhiza-responsive LePT4 gene (tomato phosphate transporter) was clearly associated with the ABA content and mycorrhiza development in roots, as the tungstate treatment in wild-type plants and the inherent ABA deficiency in sitiens mutants led to a complete abolishment of their expression. Our results suggest that the decrease in arbuscular abundance in mycorrhizal sitiens roots is directly associated with their ABA biosynthesis deficiency, and the accumulation of ethylene, as a consequence of ABA deficiency in the mutants, primarily affects mycorrhizal intensity.
