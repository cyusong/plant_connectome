['19897605', "Processing bodies (PBs) are specialized cytoplasmic foci where mRNA turnover and  translational repression can take place. Stress granules are related cytoplasmic  foci. The CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins (TZFs) play pivotal roles in gene  expression, cell fate specification, and various developmental processes. Human  TZF binds AU-rich elements at the 3' untranslated region and recruits decapping,  deadenylation, and exonucleolytic enzymes to PBs for RNA turnover. Recent genetic  studies indicate that plant TZFs are involved in gene regulation and  hormone-mediated environmental responses. It is unknown if plant TZFs can bind  RNA and be localized to PBs or stress granules. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) AtTZF1/AtCTH/AtC3H23 was identified as a sugar-sensitive gene in a  previous microarray study. It is characterized by a TZF motif that is distinct  from the human TZF. Higher plants such as Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa)  each have a gene family containing this unique TZF motif. Here, we show that  AtTZF1 can traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasmic foci. AtTZF1 colocalizes  with markers of PBs, and the morphology of these cytoplasmic foci resembles that  of mammalian PBs and stress granules. AtTZF1-associated cytoplasmic foci are  dynamic and tissue specific. They can be induced by dark and wound stresses and  are preferentially present in actively growing tissues and stomatal precursor  cells. Since AtTZF1 can bind both DNA and RNA in vitro, it raises the possibility  that AtTZF1 might be involved in DNA and/or RNA regulation.", '2010 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.145656', 'Jang']
