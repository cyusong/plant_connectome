Global research agendas on plant nutrient relations attempt to illuminate biotic and abiotic factors that mediate nutrient relations. We contend that cycad species are not adequately represented in these global agendas. Little is known about how various cycad traits such as phylogenetics, growth form, latitudinal range, or ecological niche influence concentration, stoichiometry, and resorption dynamics of leaf nutrients. The addition of cycad species data to the global research dataset will address a critical knowledge gap and benefit global research needs to improve our systemic understanding of biotic and abiotic influences on plant nutrition.
