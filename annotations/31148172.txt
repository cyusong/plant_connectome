The causative link between phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation is an important but poorly understood part of ecological speciation. We studied the effects of floral-tube length variation on pollen placement/receipt positions and reproductive isolation. In a population of Lapeirousia anceps (Iridaceae) with bimodal floral-tube lengths, we labelled pollen of short- and long-tubed flowers with different colour fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots). This enabled us to map pollen placement by long- and short-tubed flowers on the only floral visitor, a long-proboscid fly. Furthermore, it allowed us to quantify pollen movement within and between short- and long-tubed flowers. Short- and long-tubed flowers placed pollen on different parts of the pollinator, and long-tubed flowers placed more pollen per visit than short-tubed flowers. This resulted in assortative pollen receipt (most pollen received comes from the same phenotype) and strong but asymmetric reproductive isolation, where short-tubed plants are more reproductively isolated than long-tubed plants. These results suggest that floral-tube length divergence can promote mechanical isolation in plants through divergence in pollen placement sites on pollinators. Consequently, in concert with other reproductive isolation mechanisms, selection for differences in floral-tube length can play an important role in ecological speciation of plants.

floral-tube length: !affects! pollen placement
floral-tube length: !promotes! mechanical isolation
long-tubed flowers: !place more! pollen per visit
short-tubed flowers: !receive more! pollen from same phenotype
short-tubed flowers: !more reproductively isolated! than long-tubed flowers
