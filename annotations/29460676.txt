Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) can confer broad defense against diverse microbes and pathogens with disparate lifestyles through the detection of microbial extracellular signatures by surface-exposed pattern recognition receptors. However, unlike recognition of pathogen effectors by cytosolic resistance proteins, PTI is typically not associated with a host-cell programmed cell death response. Although host PTI signaling has been extensively studied, the mechanisms by which it restricts microbial colonization are poorly understood. We sought to gain insight into the mechanisms of PTI action by using bacterial transcriptomics analysis during exposure to PTI. Here, we describe a method for bacterial cell extraction from inoculated leaves that was used to analyze a time course of genome-wide transcriptional responses in the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 during early naïve host infection and exposure to pre-induced PTI in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis revealed early transcriptional regulation of important bacterial metabolic processes and host interaction pathways. We observed peak induction of P. syringae virulence genes at 3 h postinoculation and that exposure to PTI was associated with significant reductions in the expression of virulence genes. We also observed the induction of P. syringae sulfur starvation response genes such as sulfate and sulfonate importers only during exposure to PTI.
