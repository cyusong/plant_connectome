The effects of light quality on the expression of a sunflower dehydrin-encoding gene, HaDhn1, were studied during seedling de-etiolation. Seeds were germinated in the dark and, after 5 days, seedlings were maintained well watered and de-etiolated under different lights for 3, 6, 12, and 24h. Exposure to white light stimulated HaDhn1 transcript accumulation in the cotyledons of these seedlings, contrary to seedlings grown in the dark. HaDhn1 transcripts increased also treating plantlets with monochromatic lights, especially red light. The increase of HaDhn1 transcripts is provoked by the formation of the active form of phytochrome. Further experiments, performed saturating active phytochrome by yellow light, in combination or not with blue light, showed that also cryptochrome can increase HaDhn1 transcripts accumulation after exposure to light. In situ analysis of HaDhn1 expression domains in cotyledons of light-treated seedlings showed a hybridisation signal spread in all mesophyll cells, especially in the basal portion and in the vascular tissue. In the distal portion of the cotyledons, less intense signal was observed. Western blot analysis indicated that HaDhn1 transcription is not followed by dehydrin-protein accumulation. The isolated putative promoter sequence of the HaDhn1 gene showed that different putative cis-elements recognisable by transcription factors occur in the isolated sequence, including a putative light-responsive G-box. On the whole, our results indicate that HaDhn1 gene expression is induced by light during de-etiolation, in absence of water stress.
