['11726703', 'Phytochrome A plays a major role in early seedling development by triggering the  transition from etiolated growth to greening. Seedlings germinated under constant  far-red (FR) light show a partially de-etiolated phenotype that is not seen in  phyA mutants. This phytochrome A specific response was used to screen a  population of T-DNA mutagenized Arabidopsis seedlings. One mutant line, pat3  (phytochrome A signal transduction3), which showed no inhibition of hypocotyl  elongation under FR light conditions and no FR-induced killing response,  contained a T-DNA insertion in a 609-bp ORF. The recessive mutation co-segregated  with the T-DNA resistance marker and could be allelic to fhy1. A 2,248-bp genomic  fragment of the PAT3 locus can complement the pat3 mutant phenotype. PAT3  transcript peaked 3 d after germination and was downregulated by light. PAT3 has  no significant homology to any known protein and shows no preferential cellular  localization. The protein can activate transcription in yeast when fused to the  GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Our results show that PAT3 is a positive regulator of  phytochrome A signal transduction.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pce177', 'Chua']
