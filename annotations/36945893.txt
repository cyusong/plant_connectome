Legumes establish symbioses with rhizobia by forming nitrogen-fixing nodules. Nitrate is a major environmental factor that affects symbiotic functioning. However, the molecular mechanism of nitrate-induced nodule senescence is poorly understood. Comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals an NAC-type transcription factor in Lotus japonicus, LjNAC094, that acts as a positive regulator in nitrate-induced nodule senescence. Stable overexpression and mutant lines of NAC094 were constructed and used for phenotypic characterization. DNA-affinity purification sequencing was performed to identify NAC094 targeting genes and results were confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift and transactivation assays. Overexpression of NAC094 induces premature nodule senescence. Knocking out NAC094 partially relieves nitrate-induced degradation of leghemoglobins and abolishes nodule expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) that contain a conserved binding motif for NAC094. Nitrate-triggered metabolic changes in wild-type nodules are largely affected in nac094 mutant nodules. Induction of NAC094 and its targeting SAGs was almost blocked in the nitrate-insensitive nlp1, nlp4, and nlp1 nlp4 mutants. We conclude that NAC094 functions downstream of NLP1 and NLP4 by regulating nitrate-induced expression of SAGs. Our study fills in a key gap between nitrate and the execution of nodule senescence, and provides a potential strategy to improve nitrogen fixation and stress tolerance of legumes.
