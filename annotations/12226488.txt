['12226488', 'We have examined the effect of regulated overexpression of AGL15, a member of the  MADS domain family of regulatory factors, on reproductive tissues. Using  molecular and physiological markers, we show that constitutive overexpression of  AGL15 in Arabidopsis leads to delay and down-regulation of senescence programs in  perianth organs and developing fruits and alters the process of seed desiccation.  Through genetic crosses, we show that the rate of water loss in the maturing  seeds is dictated by the genetic composition and physiological state of the  maternal tissue, rather than the embryo. To define the developmental time and/or  place when senescence programs are most affected by elevated AGL15 levels, we  expressed AGL15 under the control of various promoters. Expression during  senescence or in abscission zone cells did not produce delays in floral organ  senescence or abscission. Using a glucocorticoid-inducible expression system, we  show that an increase in AGL15 levels around the time of flower opening is  necessary to delay senescence and increase floral organ longevity.', '2002 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.004721', 'Fernandez']
