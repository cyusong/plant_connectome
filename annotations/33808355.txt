The NF-Y gene family is a highly conserved set of transcription factors. The functional transcription factor complex is made up of a trimer between NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC proteins. While mammals typically have one gene for each subunit, plants often have multigene families for each subunit which contributes to a wide variety of combinations and functions. Soybean plants with an overexpression of a particular NF-YC isoform <i>GmNF-YC4-2</i> (Glyma.04g196200) in soybean cultivar Williams 82, had a lower amount of starch in its leaves, a higher amount of protein in its seeds, and increased broad disease resistance for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in the field, similar to the effects of overexpression of its isoform <i>GmNF-YC4-1</i> (Glyma.06g169600). Interestingly, <i>GmNF-YC4-2-OE</i> (overexpression) plants also filled pods and senesced earlier, a novel trait not found in <i>GmNF-YC4-1-OE</i> plants. No yield difference was observed in <i>GmNF-YC4-2-OE</i> compared with the wild-type control. Sequence alignment of GmNF-YC4-2, GmNF-YC4-1 and AtNF-YC1 indicated that faster maturation may be a result of minor sequence differences in the terminal ends of the protein compared to the closely related isoforms.
