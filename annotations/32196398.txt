Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection can causes serious damage to tobacco crops. To explore the approach of preventing TMV infection of plants, two tobacco cultivars with different resistances to TMV were used to analyze transcription profiling before and after TMV infection. The involvement of biological pathways differed between the tolerant variety (Yuyan8) and the susceptible variety (NC89). In particular, the plant-virus interaction pathway was rapidly activated in Yuyan8, and specific resistance genes were enriched. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis detected large quantities of antiviral substances in the tolerant Yuyan8. A novel <i>Nicotiana tabacum leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase</i> (<i>NtLRR-RLK</i>) gene was identified as being methylated and this was verified using bisulfite sequencing. Transient expression of <i>TMV-green fluorescent protein</i> in <i>pRNAi-NtLRR-RLK</i> transgenic plants confirmed that <i>NtLRR-RLK</i> was important for susceptibility to TMV. The specific protein interaction map generated from our study revealed that levels of BIP1, E3 ubiquitin ligase, and LRR-RLK were significantly elevated, and all were represented at node positions in the protein interaction map. The same expression tendency of these proteins was also found in <i>pRNAi-NtLRR-RLK</i> transgenic plants at 24 h after TMV inoculation. These data suggested that specific genes in the infection process can activate the immune signal cascade through different resistance genes, and the integration of signal pathways could produce resistance to the virus. These results contribute to the overall understanding of the molecular basis of plant resistance to TMV and in the long term could identify new strategies for prevention and control virus infection.
