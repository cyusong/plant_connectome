Cell expansion is a key determinant for the final size and shape of plant organ, and is regulated by various phytohormones. Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) consist of a superfamily involved in multiple aspects of organ morphogenesis. However, little is known about WIP-type ZFP function in phytohormone-mediated organ growth. Using reverse genetics, RNA-seq and phytohormone quantification, we elucidated the role of a new WIP-type ZFP from Gerbera hybrida, GhWIP2, in controlling organ growth via regulation of cell expansion. GhWIP2 localizes to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional repressor. Constitutive overexpression of GhWIP2 (GhWIP2OE) in both Gerbera and Arabidopsis thaliana caused major developmental defects associated with cell expansion, including dwarfism, short petals, scapes, and petioles. Furthermore, GhWIP2OE plants were hypersensitive to GA, but not to ABA, and showed a reduction in endogenous GA and auxin, but not ABA concentrations. Consistent with these observations, RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes involved in GA and auxin signaling were down-regulated, while those involved in ABA signaling were up-regulated in GhWIP2OE plants. Our findings suggest that GhWIP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, suppressing cell expansion during organ growth by modulating crosstalk between GA, ABA, and auxin.
