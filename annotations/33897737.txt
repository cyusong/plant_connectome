Transcription is the first step of central dogma, in which the genetic information stored in DNA is copied into RNA. In addition to mature RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), high-throughput nascent RNA assays have been established and applied to provide detailed transcriptional information. Here, we present the profiling of nascent RNA from trifoliate leaves and shoot apices of soybean. In combination with nascent RNA (chromatin-bound RNA, CB RNA) and RNA-seq, we found that introns were largely spliced cotranscriptionally. Although alternative splicing (AS) was mainly determined at nascent RNA biogenesis, differential AS between the leaf and shoot apex at the mature RNA level did not correlate well with cotranscriptional differential AS. Overall, RNA abundance was moderately correlated between nascent RNA and mature RNA within each tissue, but the fold changes between the leaf and shoot apex were highly correlated. Thousands of novel transcripts (mainly non-coding RNA) were detected by CB RNA-seq, including the overlap of natural antisense RNA with two important genes controlling soybean reproductive development, <i>FT2a</i> and <i>Dt1</i>. Taken together, we demonstrated the adoption of CB RNA-seq in soybean, which may shed light on gene expression regulation of important agronomic traits in leguminous crops.
