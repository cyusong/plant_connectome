ABA is a crucial phytohormone for development and stress responses in plants. Snf1-related protein kinase 1.1 (SnRK1.1) is involved in the ABA response. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the SnRK1.1 response to ABA is largely unknown. Here, it was found that overexpression of the apple MdSnRK1.1 gene enhanced ABA sensitivity in both transgenic apple calli and Arabidopsis seedlings. Subsequently, a yeast two-hybrid screen demonstrated that MdCAIP1 (C2-domain ABA Insensitive Protein1) interacted with MdSnRK1.1. Their interaction was further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Expression of the MdCAIP1 gene was positively induced by ABA. Its overexpression enhanced ABA sensitivity in transgenic apple calli. Furthermore, it was found that MdSnRK1.1 phosphorylated the MdCAIP1 protein in vivo and promoted its degradation in vitro and in vivo. As a result, MdSnRK1.1 inhibited MdCAIP1-mediated ABA sensitivity, and MdCAIP1 partially reduced MdSnRK1.1-mediated ABA sensitivity. Our findings indicate that MdSnRK1.1 plays an important role in the ABA response, partially by controlling the stability of the MdCAIP1 protein.
