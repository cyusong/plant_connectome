Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is one of the earliest domesticated crops, and is a valuable resource to secure food diversity and combat drought stresses under the global warming scenario. However, due to the absence of extant diploid progenitors, the polyploidy genome of broomcorn millet remains poorly understood. Here, we report the chromosome-scale genome assembly of broomcorn millet. We divided the broomcorn millet genome into two subgenomes using the genome sequence of Panicum hallii, a diploid relative of broomcorn millet. Our analyses revealed that the two subgenomes diverged at ~4.8 million years ago (Mya), while the allotetraploidization of broomcorn millet may have occurred about ~0.48 Mya, suggesting that broomcorn millet is a relatively recent allotetraploid. Comparative analyses showed that subgenome B was larger than subgenome A in size, which was caused by the biased accumulation of long terminal repeat retrotransposons in the progenitor of subgenome B before polyploidization. Notably, the accumulation of biased mutations in the transposable element-rich subgenome B led to more gene losses. Although no significant dominance of either subgenome was observed in the expression profiles of broomcorn millet, we found the minimally expressed genes in P. hallii tended to be lost during diploidization of broomcorn millet. These results suggest that broomcorn millet is at the early stage of diploidization and that mutations likely occurred more on genes that were marked with lower expression levels.
