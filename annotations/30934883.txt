Recent investigations show that exogenously applied small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors can be taken up and translocated in plants to induce RNA interference (RNAi) in the plant or in its fungal pathogen. The question of whether genes in the plant genome can undergo suppression as a result of exogenous RNA application on plant surface is almost unexplored. This study analyzed whether it is possible to influence transcript levels of transgenes, as more prone sequences to silencing, in <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome by direct exogenous application of target long dsRNAs. The data revealed that <i>in vitro</i> synthesized dsRNAs designed to target the gene coding regions of enhanced green fluorescent protein (<i>EGFP</i>) or neomycin phosphotransferase II (<i>NPTII</i>) suppressed their transcript levels in Arabidopsis. The fact that, simple exogenous application of polynucleotides can affect mRNA levels of plant transgenes, opens new opportunities for the development of new scientific techniques and crop improvement strategies.
