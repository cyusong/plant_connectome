Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an indole molecule widely found in animals and plants. It is well known that melatonin improves plant resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses due to its potent free radical scavenging ability while being able to modulate plant signaling and response pathways through mostly unknown mechanisms. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that melatonin plays a crucial role in improving crop quality and yield by participating in the regulation of various aspects of plant growth and development. Here, we review the effects of melatonin on plant vegetative growth and reproductive development, and systematically summarize its molecular regulatory network. Moreover, the effective concentrations of exogenously applied melatonin in different crops or at different growth stages of the same crop are analysed. In addition, we compare endogenous phytomelatonin concentrations in various crops and different organs, and evaluate a potential function of phytomelatonin in plant circadian rhythms. The prospects of different approaches in regulating crop yield and quality through exogenous application of appropriate concentrations of melatonin, endogenous modification of phytomelatonin metabolism-related genes, and the use of nanomaterials and other technologies to improve melatonin utilization efficiency are also discussed.
