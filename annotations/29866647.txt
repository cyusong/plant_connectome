['29866647', 'The mechanism of starch granule initiation in chloroplasts is not fully  understood. Here, we aimed to build on our recent discovery that PROTEIN  TARGETING TO STARCH (PTST) family members, PTST2 and PTST3, are key players in  starch granule initiation, by identifying and characterizing additional proteins  involved in the process in Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts. Using  immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that PTST2 interacts  with two plastidial coiled-coil proteins. Surprisingly, one of the proteins is  the thylakoid-associated MAR BINDING FILAMENT-LIKE PROTEIN1 (MFP1), which was  proposed to bind plastid nucleoids. The other protein, MYOSIN-RESEMBLING  CHLOROPLAST PROTEIN (MRC), contains long coiled coils and no known domains.  Whereas wild-type chloroplasts contained multiple starch granules, only one large  granule was observed in most chloroplasts of the mfp1 and mrc mutants. The mfp1  mrc double mutant had a higher proportion of chloroplasts containing no visible  granule than either single mutant and accumulated ADP-glucose, the substrate for  starch synthesis. PTST2 was partially associated with the thylakoid membranes in  wild-type plants, and fluorescently tagged PTST2 was located in numerous discrete  patches within the chloroplast in which MFP1 was also located. In the mfp1  mutant, PTST2 was not associated with the thylakoids and formed discrete puncta,  suggesting that MFP1 is necessary for normal PTST2 localization. Overall, we  reveal that proper granule initiation requires the presence of MFP1 and MRC, and  the correct location of PTST2.', '2018 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00219', 'ORCID:']
