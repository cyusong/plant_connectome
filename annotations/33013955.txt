An affinity tag system requires both high affinity and specificity. The RAP tag epitope DMVNPGLEDRIE, derived from rat podoplanin (PDPN), is specifically recognized by PMab-2 monoclonal antibodies in rats. Here, we demonstrated that high levels of PMab-2 can be produced in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and plant-derived PMab-2 possesses similar activity to CHO-derived PMab-2, and the RAP tag presents a useful tagging system for detecting and purifying proteins from plant cells. The heavy chain of PMab-2 fused with KDEL, an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence, and the light chain of the antibody were introduced into <i>N. benthamiana</i> by agroinfiltration. The expression of PMab-2 peaked 4 days after agroinfiltration, and approximately 0.3 mg/g fresh weight of the antibody was accumulated. After purification, the plant-derived PMab-2 successfully recognized rat PDPN expressed in CHO-K1 cells and exhibited almost the same binding activity as CHO-derived PMab-2. The RAP-tagged proteins expressed in plant cells were specifically recognized by PMab-2. These results indicate that PMab-2 can accumulate at high levels in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and is easily purified and that the RAP tagging system presents a useful tool for detecting and purifying proteins of interest in plant cells.
