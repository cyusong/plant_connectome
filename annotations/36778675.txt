Short term experiments have identified heat shock and cold response elements in many biological systems. However, the effect of long-term low or high temperatures is not well documented. To address this gap, we grew <i>Antirrhinum majus</i> plants from two-weeks old until maturity under control (normal) (22/16°C), cold (15/5°C), and hot (30/23°C) conditions for a period of two years. Flower size, petal anthocyanin content and pollen viability obtained higher values in cold conditions, decreasing in middle and high temperatures. Leaf chlorophyll content was higher in cold conditions and stable in control and hot temperatures, while pedicel length increased under hot conditions. The control conditions were optimal for scent emission and seed production. Scent complexity was low in cold temperatures. The transcriptomic analysis of mature flowers, followed by gene enrichment analysis and CNET plot visualization, showed two groups of genes. One group comprised genes controlling the affected traits, and a second group appeared as long-term adaptation to non-optimal temperatures. These included hypoxia, unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, ribosomal proteins, carboxylic acid, sugar and organic ion transport, or protein folding. We found a differential expression of floral organ identity functions, supporting the flower size data. Pollinator-related traits such as scent and color followed opposite trends, indicating an equilibrium for rendering the organs for pollination attractive under changing climate conditions. Prolonged heat or cold cause structural adaptations in protein synthesis and folding, membrane composition, and transport. Thus, adaptations to cope with non-optimal temperatures occur in basic cellular processes.
