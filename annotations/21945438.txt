['21945438', 'The Euonymus lectin (EUL) domain was recognized as the structural motif for a  novel class of putative carbohydrate binding proteins. Confocal microscopy  demonstrated that the lectin from Euonymus europaeus (EEA) as well as the EUL  protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (ArathEULS3) are located in the  nucleocytoplasmic compartment of the plant cell. ArathEULS3 as well as its EUL  domain were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified. The EUL  domain from Arabidopsis interacts with glycan structures containing Lewis Y,  Lewis X and lactosamine, indicating that it can be considered a true lectin  domain. Despite the high sequence identity between the EUL domains in EEA and  ArathEULS3, both domains recognize different carbohydrate structures.', '2011 Oct 14', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.031', 'Van']
