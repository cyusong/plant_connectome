Fragrant flowers emit a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that we perceive as pleasant. While we know the chemical nature of these volatiles, the molecular traits that regulate their biosynthesis are poorly understood. In this issue, Tian et al. (2019) compare the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of a scented genotype of wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox) with a non-scented one. By correlating the differential gene expression profile with the observed differences in VOC profiles, they attempt to identify the genes that regulate the fragrance of wintersweet.

Gene: !affects! VOC biosynthesis 
Gene: !regulates! Fragrance of wintersweet
