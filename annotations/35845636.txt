Nitrogen (N) is one of the important macronutrients in plants, and N deficiency induces leaf senescence. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how N deficiency affects leaf senescence is unclear. Here, we report an apple NAC TF, MdNAC4, that participates in N deficiency-induced leaf senescence. The senescence phenotype of apple leaves overexpressing <i>MdNAC4</i> was enhanced after N deficiency. Consistently, the chlorophyll content of transgenic leaves was significantly lower than that in the WT control leaves, the expression of chlorophyll catabolism-related genes (<i>MdNYC1</i>, <i>MdPAO</i>, and <i>MdSGR1</i>) was significantly higher than that in the WT controls, and the expression of chlorophyll synthesis-related genes (<i>MdHEMA</i>, <i>MdCHLI</i>, and <i>MdCHLM</i>) was significantly lower than that in the WT control leaves. Furthermore, MdNAC4 was found to directly activate the transcription of the chlorophyll catabolism-related genes <i>MdNYC1</i> and <i>MdPAO</i>. Additionally, MdNAC4 was proven to interact with MdAPRR2 proteins both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and overexpression of <i>MdAPRR2</i> seemed to delay N deficiency-induced leaf senescence. Correspondingly, the chlorophyll loss of MdAPRR2-overexpressing (MdAPRR2-OE) lines was significantly lower than in WT control plants. Although downregulated, the expression of the chlorophyll synthesis-related genes <i>MdHEMA</i>, <i>MdCHLI</i>, and <i>MdCHLM</i> in the transgenic plants was more than twice that in the WT control plants. Taken together, our results enrich the regulatory network of leaf senescence induced by N deficiency through the interaction between MdNAC4 and MdAPRR2.
