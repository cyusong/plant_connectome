Organogenesis in plants is primarily postembryonic and relies on a strict balance between cell division and cell expansion. The root is a particularly well-suited model to study cell proliferation in detail since the two processes are spatially and temporally separated for all the different tissues. In addition, the root is amenable to detailed microscopic analysis to identify cells progressing through the cell cycle. While it is clear that cell proliferation activity is restricted to the root apical meristem (RAM), understanding cell proliferation kinetics and identifying its parameters have required much effort over many years. Here, we review the main concepts, experimental settings, and findings aimed at obtaining a detailed knowledge of how cells proliferate within the RAM. The combination of novel tools, experimental strategies, and mathematical models has contributed to our current view of cell proliferation in the RAM. We also discuss several lines of research that need to be explored in the future.
