Polyamines (PAs) have been considered as important molecules for survival. However, evidence reinforces that PAs are also implicated, directly or indirectly, in pathways regulating programmed cell death (PCD). Direct correlation of PAs with cell death refers to their association with particular biological processes, and their physical contact with molecules or structures involved in cell death. Indirectly, PAs regulate PCD through their metabolic derivatives, such as catabolic and interconversion products. Cytotoxic products of PA metabolism are involved in PCD cascades, whereas it remains largely elusive how PAs directly control pathways leading to PCD. In this review, we present and compare advances in PA-dependent PCD in animals and plants.
