* In the mycorrhizal association, changes in the metabolic activities expressed by the plant and fungal partners could result from modulations in the quantity and nature of nutrients available at the plant-fungus interface. This hypothesis was tested for the nitrite reductase gene in the association Hebeloma cylindrosporumxPinus pinaster. * Transcripts from plant and fungal nitrite reductases and a fungal ammonium transporter were quantified in control uninoculated roots, extraradical mycelia and mycorrhizas formed by either wild-type or nitrate reductase deficient fungal strains. * The fungal genes were downregulated in mycorrhizas compared with extraradical hyphae. The plant nitrite reductase was induced only transiently by NO(3)(-) in the association with a wild-type strain, but permanently expressed at a high level in mycorrhizas formed by the deficient mutant. * These results suggest that reduced nitrogen compounds transferred from the fungus to the root cortical cells repress the plant nitrite reductase, thus highlighting a plant gene regulation by the nutrients available in the Hartig net.
