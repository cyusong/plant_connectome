In the leaf epidermis, stomatal pores allow gas exchange between plants and the environment. The production of stomatal guard cells requires the lineage cells to divide asymmetrically. In this Insight review, we describe an emerging picture of how intrinsic molecules drive stomatal asymmetric cell division in multidimensions, from transcriptional activities in the nucleus to the dynamic assembly of the polarity complex at the cell cortex. Given the significant roles of stomatal activity in plant responses to environmental changes, we incorporate recent advances in external cues feeding into the regulation of core molecular machinery required for stomatal development. The work we discuss here is mainly based on the dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana with summaries of recent progress in the monocots.
