To study the regulatory mechanisms underlying lignin biosynthesis, we isolated and characterized lignescens (lig), a previously undescribed temperature-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that exhibits ectopic lignin deposition and growth defects under high-temperature conditions. The lig mutation was identified as a single base transition in GNA1 encoding glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA), a critical enzyme of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis. lig harbors a glycine-to-serine substitution at residue 68 (G68S) of GNA1. Enzyme activity assays of the mutant protein (GNA1(G68S)) showed its thermolability relative to the wild-type protein. The lig mutant exposed to the restrictive temperature contained a significantly smaller amount of UDP-GlcNAc than did the wild type. The growth defects and ectopic lignification of lig were suppressed by the addition of UDP-GlcNAc. Since UDP-GlcNAc is an initial sugar donor of N-glycan synthesis and impaired N-glycan synthesis is known to induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), we examined possible relationships between N-glycan synthesis, UPR, and the lig phenotype. N-glycans were reduced and LUMINAL BINDING PROTEIN3, a typical UPR gene, was expressed in lig at the restrictive temperature. Furthermore, treatment with UPR-inducing reagents phenocopied the lig mutant. Our data collectively suggest that impairment of N-glycan synthesis due to a shortage of UDP-GlcNAc leads to ectopic lignin accumulation, mostly through the UPR.
