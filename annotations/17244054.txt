Banksia species (Proteaceae) occur on some of the most phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils in the world. We hypothesized that plasticity in the exudation of P-mobilizing carboxylates would be greater in widespread than in rare Banksia species. Glasshouse experiments were conducted to identify and quantify carboxylate exudation in three widespread and six narrowly distributed Banksia species. High concentrations of carboxylates (predominantly malate, citrate, aconitate, oxalate) were measured in the rhizosphere of all nine species of Banksia on six different soils, but widespread species did not have greater plasticity in the composition of exuded carboxylates. Based on the evidence in the present study, rarity in Banksia cannot be explained by limited phenotypic adjustment of carboxylate exudation.

Banksia species: !exude! carboxylates 
widespread Banksia species: !not more plastic! in composition of exuded carboxylates 
rarity in Banksia: !not explained by! limited phenotypic adjustment of carboxylate exudation
