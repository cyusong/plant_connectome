['27029856', 'Plant vacuoles serve as the primary intracellular compartments for inorganic  phosphate (Pi) storage. Passage of Pi across vacuolar membranes plays a critical  role in buffering the cytoplasmic Pi level against fluctuations of external Pi  and metabolic activities. Here we demonstrate that the SPX-MFS proteins,  designated as PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 5 family (PHT5), also named Vacuolar  Phosphate Transporter (VPT), function as vacuolar Pi transporters. Based on  (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis, Arabidopsis pht5;1  loss-of-function mutants accumulate less Pi and exhibit a lower  vacuolar-to-cytoplasmic Pi ratio than controls. Conversely, overexpression of  PHT5 leads to massive Pi sequestration into vacuoles and altered regulation of Pi  starvation-responsive genes. Furthermore, we show that heterologous expression of  the rice homologue OsSPX-MFS1 mediates Pi influx to yeast vacuoles. Our findings  show that a group of Pi transporters in vacuolar membranes regulate cytoplasmic  Pi homeostasis and are required for fitness and plant growth.', '2016 Mar 31', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms11095', 'Chiou']
