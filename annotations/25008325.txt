['25008325', 'Photosystem I (PS I) is a multisubunit membrane protein complex that functions as  a light-driven plastocyanin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The PsbP domain protein 1  (PPD1; At4g15510) is located in the thylakoid lumen of plant chloroplasts and is  essential for photoautotrophy, functioning as a PS I assembly factor. In this  work, RNAi was used to suppress PPD1 expression, yielding mutants displaying a  range of phenotypes with respect to PS I accumulation and function. These PPD1  RNAi mutants showed a loss of assembled PS I that was correlated with loss of the  PPD1 protein. In the most severely affected PPD1 RNAi lines, the accumulated PS I  complexes exhibited defects in electron transfer from plastocyanin to the  oxidized reaction center P700 (+). The defects in PS I assembly in the PPD1 RNAi  mutants also had secondary effects with respect to the association of  light-harvesting antenna complexes to PS I. Because of the imbalance in  photosystem function in the PPD1 RNAi mutants, light-harvesting complex II  associated with and acted as an antenna for the PS I complexes. These results  provide new evidence for the role of PPD1 in PS I biogenesis, particularly as a  factor essential for proper assembly of the lumenal portion of the complex.', '2014 Aug 22', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M114.589085', 'Bricker']
