['15705854', "Methylation on the base or the ribose is prevalent in eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs  (rRNAs) and is thought to be crucial for ribosome biogenesis and function.  Artificially introduced 2'-O-methyl groups in small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can  stabilize siRNAs in serum without affecting their activities in RNA interference  in mammalian cells. Here, we show that plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have a naturally  occurring methyl group on the ribose of the last nucleotide. Whereas methylation  of rRNAs depends on guide RNAs, the methyltransferase protein HEN1 is sufficient  to methylate miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. Our studies uncover a new and crucial step in  plant miRNA biogenesis and have profound implications in the function of miRNAs.", '2005 Feb 11', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1107130', 'Chen']
