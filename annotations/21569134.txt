Gravitropism aligns plant growth with gravity. It involves gravity perception and the asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone auxin. Here we provide insights into the mechanism for hypocotyl gravitropic growth. We show that the Arabidopsis thaliana PIN3 auxin transporter is required for the asymmetric auxin distribution for the gravitropic response. Gravistimulation polarizes PIN3 to the bottom side of hypocotyl endodermal cells, which correlates with an increased auxin response at the lower hypocotyl side. Both PIN3 polarization and hypocotyl bending require the activity of the trafficking regulator GNOM and the protein kinase PINOID. Our data suggest that gravity-induced PIN3 polarization diverts the auxin flow to mediate the asymmetric distribution of auxin for gravitropic shoot bending.
