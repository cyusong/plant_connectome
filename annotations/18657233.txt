['18657233', 'RNA editing changes the sequence of many transcripts in plant organelles, but  little is known about the molecular mechanisms determining the specificity of the  process. In this study, we have characterized CLB19 (also known as PDE247), a  gene that is required for editing of two distinct chloroplast transcripts, rpoA  and clpP. Loss-of-function clb19 mutants present a yellow phenotype with impaired  chloroplast development and early seedling lethality under greenhouse conditions.  Transcript patterns are profoundly affected in the mutant plants, with a pattern  entirely consistent with a defect in activity of the plastid-encoded RNA  polymerase. CLB19 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein similar to the  editing specificity factors CRR4 and CRR21, but, unlike them, is implicated in  editing of two target sites.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03634.x', 'Leon']
