Leaf traits of global plants reveal the fundamental trade-offs in plant resource acquisition to conservation strategies. However, which leaf traits are consistent, converged, or diverged among herbs, shrubs, and subshrubs in an arid environment remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the trade-offs in six leaf functional traits (LFTs): leaf fresh mass (LFM), leaf dry mass (LDM), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf thickness (LTh) of 37 desert plant species. LFTs differed between different plant life forms; LFM, LDM, and LA were slightly higher in herbs, LDMC and LTh in shrubs, and SLA in subshrubs. Conversely, the correlations among LFTs were inconsistent in different life forms, which may indicate their different adaptation strategies in an arid environment. Legumes and C<sub>3</sub> plants exhibited slightly higher LDMC, LA, and SLA than non-legumes and C<sub>4</sub> plants, whereas non-legumes and C<sub>4</sub> plants showed higher (nonsignificant) LFM, LDM, and LTh than legumes and C<sub>3</sub> plants. A significant phylogenetic signal (PS) and maximum K-value were found for SLA (K = 0.32). LFTs exhibited convergent and divergent variations among different life forms. However, these variations in LFTs were not influenced by phylogeny. Together, these findings increase our understanding of the variations in ecological adaptations of desert plants as well as adaption strategies of different life forms in an arid environment.
