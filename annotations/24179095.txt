['24179095', 'In Arabidopsis, more than 1000 putative small signalling peptides have been  predicted, but very few have been functionally characterized. One class of small  post-translationally modified signalling peptides is the C-TERMINALLY ENCODED  PEPTIDE (CEP) family, of which one member has been shown to be involved in  regulating root architecture. This work applied a bioinformatics approach to  identify more members of the CEP family. It identified 10 additional members and  revealed that this family only emerged in flowering plants and was absent from  extant members of more primitive plants. The data suggest that the CEP proteins  form two subgroups according to the CEP domain. This study further provides an  overview of specific CEP expression patterns that offers a comprehensive  framework to study the role of the CEP signalling peptides in plant development.  For example, expression patterns point to a role in aboveground tissues which was  corroborated by the analysis of transgenic lines with perturbed CEP levels. These  results form the basis for further exploration of the mechanisms underlying this  family of peptides and suggest their putative roles in distinct developmental  events of higher plants.', '2013 Dec', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ert331', 'Beeckman']
