<i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>, the causal bacterium of bacterial blight limits rice production globally. Currently, genome sequences for only a few <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> isolates are available from India. Based on the next-generation sequencing and single-molecule sequencing in real-time technologies, we present here the complete genome sequence of <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> race 4, a highly virulent member of the Indian <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> population that has been extensively used in different research studies. The genome data will contribute to our understanding of <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> genomic features and pave the way for research on rice-<i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> interactions.
