The salinization of irrigated land affects agricultural productivity. HIGH-AFFINITY POTASSIUM (K<sup>+</sup> ) TRANSPORTER 1;5 (OsHKT1;5)-dependent sodium (Na<sup>+</sup> ) transport is a key salt tolerance mechanism during rice growth and development. Using a previously generated high-throughput activation tagging-based T-DNA insertion mutant pool, we isolated a mutant exhibiting salt stress-sensitive phenotype, caused by a reduction in OsHKT1;5 transcripts. The salt stress-sensitive phenotype of this mutant results from the loss of function of OsDNAJ15, which encodes plasma membrane-localized heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40). osdnaj15 loss-of-function mutants show decreased plant height, increased leaf angle, and reduced grain number caused by shorter panicle length and fewer branches. On the other h'and, OsDNAJ15-overexpression plants showed salt stress-tolerant phenotypes. Intriguingly, salt stress facilitates the nuclear relocation of OsDNAJ15 so that it can interact with OsBAG4, and OsDNAJ15 and OsBAG4 synergistically facilitate the DNA-binding activity of OsMYB106 to positively regulate the expression of OsHKT1;5. Overall, our results reveal a novel function of plasma membrane-localized Hsp40 protein in modulating, alongside chaperon regulator OsBAG4, transcriptional regulation under salinity stress tolerance.
