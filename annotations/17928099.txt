Mechanical wounding of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum leaves in planta induced a fast decrease in stomatal conductance, which was related to accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Higher levels of H(2)O(2) were accompanied by an increase in total activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a decrease in catalase (CAT) activity. Among SOD forms, manganese SOD (MnSOD) and copper/zinc SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) seem to be especially important sources of H(2)O(2) at early stages of wounding response. Moreover, NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), one of the key enzymes of primary carbon metabolism, which is also involved in stress responses, showed a strong increase in activity in wounded leaves. All these symptoms: high accumulation of H(2)O(2), high activities of Cu/ZnSOD and NADP-ME, together with the decrease of CAT activity, were also observed in the major veins of unwounded leaves. The potential role of veinal tissues as an important source of H(2)O(2) during wounding response is discussed.

Mechanical wounding: !induces! decrease in stomatal conductance
H(2)O(2): !accumulates! with higher levels of SOD activity
MnSOD: !seems to be important source of! H(2)O(2)
NADP-ME: !increases in activity! in wounded leaves
CAT activity: !decreases! in wounded leaves
Veinal tissues: !potential role as source of! H(2)O(2)
