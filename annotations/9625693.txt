['9625693', 'The Sec1p family of proteins is required for vesicle-mediated protein trafficking  between various organelles of the endomembrane system. This family includes  Vps45p, which is required for transport to the vacuole in yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae). We have isolated a cDNA encoding a VPS45 homolog from Arabidopsis  thaliana (AtVPS45). The cDNA is able to complement both the temperature-sensitive  growth defect and the vacuolar-targeting defect of a yeast vps45 mutant,  indicating that the two proteins are functionally related. AtVPS45p is a  peripheral membrane protein that associates with microsomal membranes.  Sucrose-density gradient fractionation demonstrated that AtVPS45p co-fractionates  with AtELP, a potential vacuolar protein sorting receptor, implying that they may  reside on the same membrane populations. These results indicate that AtVPS45p is  likely to function in the transport of proteins to the vacuole in plants.', '1998 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.117.2.407', 'Raikhel']
