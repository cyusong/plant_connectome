Verticillium wilt caused by Verticillium dahliae is a major disease of cotton. Acidic protein-lipopolysaccharide complexes are thought to be the toxins responsible for its symptoms. Here, we determined that the sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor fumonisin B1 (FB1) acts as a toxin and phenocopies the symptoms induced by V. dahliae. Knocking out genes required for FB1 biosynthesis reduced V. dahliae pathogenicity. Moreover, we showed that overexpression of a FB1 and V. dahliae both downregulated gene, GhIQD10, enhanced verticillium wilt resistance by promoting the expression of brassinosteroid and anti-pathogen genes. Our results provide a new strategy for preventing verticillium wilt in cotton.
