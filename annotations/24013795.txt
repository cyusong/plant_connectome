MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that are endogenous regulators of gene expression. miRNAs play a crucial role in cells via degradation of target mRNAs or by inhibition of target protein translation. In the present study, 186 new potentially conserved pear miRNAs belonging to 37 families were identified. The length of mature miRNAs ranged from 19 to 24 nt, and most of the miRNAs (154 out of 186) were 21 nt in length. The length of pre-miRNAs in pear was also found to vary from 62 to 282 nt with an average of 105 ± 43 nt. The potential miRNAs belonged to 29 clusters involving 20 different miRNA families. Using these potential miRNAs, we further scoured of the pear genome and found 326 potential target genes, which included transcription factors, stress responsive genes, and the genes involved in transmembrane transport and signal transduction. Gene ontology analysis of these potential targets suggested that 47 biological processes were potentially regulated by miRNAs, including oxidation-reduction, stress response, transport, etc. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the identified miRNAs were found in 15 metabolism networks which were related to starch and sucrose metabolism, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, among others. Our study will help in the further understanding of the essential role of miRNAs in growth and development and stress response of pear.
