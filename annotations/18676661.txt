['18676661', 'The "light" signal from the environment sets the circadian clock to regulate  multiple physiological processes for optimal rhythmic growth and development. One  such process is the control of flowering time by photoperiod perception in  plants. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the flowering time is determined  by the correct interconnection of light input and signal output by the circadian  clock. The identification of additional clock proteins will help to better  dissect the complex nature of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. Here, we show  LIGHT-REGULATED WD1 (LWD1)/LWD2 as new clock proteins involved in photoperiod  control. The lwd1lwd2 double mutant has an early-flowering phenotype, contributed  by the significant phase shift of CONSTANS (CO), and, therefore, an increased  expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) before dusk. Under entrainment conditions,  the expression phase of oscillator (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 [CCA1], LATE  ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL [LHY], TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 [TOC1], and EARLY FLOWERING4  [ELF4]) and output (GIGANTEA, FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1, CYCLING DOF  FACTOR1, CO, and FT) genes in the photoperiod pathway shifts approximately 3 h  forward in the lwd1lwd2 double mutant. Both the oscillator (CCA1, LHY, TOC1, and  ELF4) and output (COLD, CIRCADIAN RHYTHM, AND RNA BINDING2 and CHLOROPHYLL  A/B-BINDING PROTEIN2) genes have a short period length in the lwd1lwd2 double  mutant. Our data imply that LWD1/LWD2 proteins function in close proximity to or  within the circadian clock for photoperiodic flowering control.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.124917', 'Wu']
