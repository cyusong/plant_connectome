To help develop an understanding of the genes that govern the developmental characteristics of the potato (Solanum tuberosum), as well as the genes associated with responses to specified pathogens and storage conditions, The Canadian Potato Genome Project (CPGP) carried out 5' end sequencing of regular, normalized and full-length cDNA libraries of the Shepody potato cultivar, generating over 66,600 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Libraries sequenced represented tuber developmental stages, pathogen-challenged tubers, as well as leaf, floral developmental stages, suspension cultured cells and roots. All libraries analysed to date have contributed unique sequences, with the normalized libraries high on the list. In addition, a low molecular weight library has enhanced the 3' ends of our sequence assemblies. Using the combined assembly dataset, unique tuber developmental, cold storage and pathogen-challenged sequences have been identified. A comparison of the ESTs specific to the pathogen-challenged tuber and foliar libraries revealed minimal overlap between these libraries. Mixed assemblies using over 189,000 potato EST sequences from CPGP and The Institute for Genomics Research (TIGR) has revealed common sequences, as well as CPGP- and TIGR-unique sequences.
