The Triticeae tribe of the plant Poaceae family contains some of the most important cereal crop plants for nutrition of humans and livestock such as wheat and barley. Despite the agronomical relevance of plant immunity, knowledge on mechanisms of disease or resistance in Triticeae is limited. It is hardly understood what actually stops a microbial invader when restricted by the plant and in how far a susceptible host plant contributes to pathogenesis. Transcriptional reprogramming of the host plant may be involved in both immunity and disease. This paper gives an overview about recent analyses of global pathogenesis-related transcriptional patterns in response of Triticeae to biotrophic or non-biotrophic fungal pathogens and their toxins. It highlights enriched biological functions in association with successful plant defence or disease as well as experiments that successfully translated gene expression data into analysis of gene functions.
