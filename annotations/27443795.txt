['27443795', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion mutant glucose hypersensitive (ghs) 40-1  exhibited hypersensitivity to glucose (Glc) and abscisic acid (ABA). The ghs40-1  mutant displayed severely impaired cotyledon greening and expansion and showed  enhanced reduction in hypocotyl elongation of dark-grown seedlings when grown in  Glc concentrations higher than 3 %. The Glc-hypersensitivity of ghs40-1 was  correlated with the hyposensitive phenotype of 35S::AtGHS40 seedlings. The  phenotypes of ghs40-1 were recovered by complementation with 35S::AtGHS40. The  AtGHS40 (At5g11240) gene encodes a WD40 protein localized primarily in the  nucleus and nucleolus using transient expression of AtGHS40-mRFP in onion cells  and of AtGHS40-EGFP and EGFP-AtGHS40 in Arabidopsis protoplasts. The ABA  biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone extensively rescued Glc-mediated growth arrest.  Quantitative real time-PCR analysis showed that AtGHS40 was involved in the  control of Glc-responsive genes. AtGHS40 acts downstream of HXK1 and is activated  by ABI4 while ABI4 expression is negatively modulated by AtGHS40 in the Glc  signaling network. However, AtGHS40 may not affect ABI1 and SnRK2.6 gene  expression. Given that AtGHS40 inhibited ABA degrading and signaling gene  expression levels under high Glc conditions, a new circuit of fine-tuning  modulation by which ABA and ABA signaling gene expression are modulated in  balance, occurred in plants. Thus, AtGHS40 may play a role in ABA-mediated Glc  signaling during early seedling development. The biochemical function of AtGHS40  is also discussed.', '2016 Nov', 'J Plant Res', '10.1007/s10265-016-0849-5', 'Wang']
