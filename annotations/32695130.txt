C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is a complex trait that evolved from its ancestral C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis by recruiting pre-existing genes. These co-opted genes were changed in many aspects compared to their counterparts in C<sub>3</sub> species. Most of the evolutionary changes of the C<sub>4</sub> shuttle enzymes are well characterized, however, evolutionary changes for the recruited metabolite transporters are less studied. Here we analyzed the evolutionary changes of the shuttle enzyme phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP) transporter (PPT) during its recruitment from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Our analysis showed that among the two PPT paralogs PPT1 and PPT2, PPT1 was the copy recruited for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in multiple C<sub>4</sub> lineages. During C<sub>4</sub> evolution, PPT1 gained increased transcript abundance, shifted its expression from predominantly in root to in leaf and from bundle sheath cell to mesophyll cell, and gained more rapid and long-lasting responsiveness to light. Modifications occurred in both regulatory and coding regions in C<sub>4</sub> PPT1 as compared to C<sub>3</sub> PPT1, however, the PEP transporting function of PPT1 remained. We found that PPT1 of a <i>Flaveria</i> C<sub>4</sub> species recruited a MEM1 B submodule in the promoter region, which might be related to the increased transcript abundance of PPT1 in C<sub>4</sub> mesophyll cells. The case study of PPT further suggested that high transcript abundance in a proper location is of high priority for PPT to support C<sub>4</sub> function.
