Yellow vein mosaic disease of mesta, a compatible plant virus interaction poses a serious threat to mesta cultivation in India. Plants respond to invasion by pathogens with multi component defense responses particularly in incompatible interaction. With the aim of understanding, a biochemical approach was attempted to study the cellular redox status in early stages of yellow vein mosaic virus infection associated with different age's plant of Hibiscus cannabinus. Comparative analysis of GSH and GSSG content in infected and control plant of different ages indicated that infected plants are under oxidative or nitrosative stress condition. A significant change was observed in Glutathione Reductase, Catalase and Ascorbate Peroxidase level in early stage of infection. We also showed microscopic evidence of nitrosylated thiols in infected leaves, stems and roots of H. cannabinus. Furthermore, we identified few defense related proteins in infected plant using MALDI TOF mass spectrometric analysis.
