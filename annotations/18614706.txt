['18614706', 'The sensitive to freezing6 (sfr6) mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is  late flowering in long days due to reduced expression of components in the  photoperiodic flowering pathway in long-day photoperiods. Microarray analysis of  gene expression showed that a circadian clock-associated motif, the evening  element, was overrepresented in promoters of genes down-regulated in sfr6 plants.  Analysis of leaf movement rhythms found sfr6 plants showed a sucrose  (Suc)-dependent long period phenotype; unlike wild-type Arabidopsis, the clock in  sfr6 plants did not have a shorter rhythm in the presence of Suc. Other  developmental responses to Suc were unaltered in sfr6 plants, suggesting  insensitivity to Suc is restricted to the clock. We investigated the effect of  sfr6 and Suc upon clock gene expression over 24 h. The sfr6 mutation resulted in  reduced expression of the clock components CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1, GIGANTEA,  and TIMING OF CAB1. These changes occurred independently of Suc supplementation.  Wild-type plants showed small increases in clock gene expression in the presence  of Suc; this response to Suc was reduced in sfr6 plants. This study shows that  large changes in level and timing of clock gene expression may have little effect  upon clock outputs. Moreover, although Suc influences the period and accuracy of  the Arabidopsis clock, it results in relatively minor changes in clock gene  expression.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.123901', 'McWatters']
