['9826741', 'Constitutive expression of the cold-regulated COR15a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana  results in a significant increase in the survival of isolated protoplasts frozen  over the range of -4.5 to -7 degreesC. The increased freezing tolerance is the  result of a decreased incidence of freeze-induced lamellar-to-hexagonal II phase  transitions that occur in regions where the plasma membrane is brought into close  apposition with the chloroplast envelope as a result of freeze-induced  dehydration. Moreover, the mature polypeptide encoded by this gene, COR15am,  increases the lamellar-to-hexagonal II phase transition temperature of  dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and promotes formation of the lamellar phase in  a lipid mixture composed of the major lipid species that comprise the chloroplast  envelope. We propose that COR15am, which is located in the chloroplast stroma,  defers freeze-induced formation of the hexagonal II phase to lower temperatures  (lower hydrations) by altering the intrinsic curvature of the inner membrane of  the chloroplast envelope.', '1998 Nov 24', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.24.14570', 'Thomashow']
