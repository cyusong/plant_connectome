['10712555', 'We have characterized two isoforms of ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (ATP-PRT)  from Arabidopsis (AtATP-PRT1 [accession no. AB025251] and AtATP-PRT2), catalyzing  the first step of the pathway of hisidine (His) biosynthesis. The primary  structures deduced from AtATP-PRT1 and AtATP-PRT2 cDNAs share an overall amino  acid identity of 74.6% and contain N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide  sequences. DNA-blot analyses indicated that the ATP-PRTs in Arabidopsis are  encoded by two separate genes with a closely similar gene structural  organization. Both gene transcripts were detected throughout development, and  protein-blot analysis revealed predominant accumulation of the AtATP-PRT proteins  in Arabidopsis leaves. The His auxotrophy of a his1 mutant of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae was suppressed by the transformation with AtATP-PRT1 and AtATP-PRT2  cDNAs, indicating that both isoforms are functionally active ATP-PRT enzymes. The  K(m) values for ATP and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate of the recombinant AtATP-PRT  proteins were comparable to those of the native ATP-PRTs from higher plants and  bacteria. It was demonstrated that the recombinant AtATP-PRTs were inhibited by  L-His (50% inhibition of initial activity = 40-320 microM), suggesting that His  biosynthesis was regulated in plants through feedback inhibition by L-His.', '2000 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.122.3.907', 'Kozaki']
