Grain size is a key constituent of grain weight and appearance in rice. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the small-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on the grain size. In the present study, residual heterozygous populations were developed for mapping two genetically linked small-effect QTLs for grain size. After the genotyping and the phenotyping of five successive generations, <i>qGS7.1</i> was dissected into three QTLs and two were selected for further analysis. The <i>qTGW7.2a</i> was finally mapped into a 21.10 kb interval containing four annotated candidate genes. Transcript levels assay showed that the expression of the candidates <i>LOC_Os07g39490</i> and the <i>LOC_Os07g39500</i> were significantly reduced in the NIL-<i>qTGW7.2a<sup>BG1</sup></i> . The cytological observation indicated that <i>qTGW7.2a</i> regulated the grain width through controlling the cell expansion. Using the same strategy, <i>qTGW7.2b</i> was fine-mapped into a 52.71 kb interval containing eight annotated candidate genes, showing a significant effect on the grain length and width with opposite allelic directions, but little on the grain weight. Our study provides new genetic resources for yield improvement and for fine-tuning of grain size in rice.
