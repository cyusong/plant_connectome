Plant microtubules are found to be strongly associated with the cell cortex and to experience polymerization/depolymerization processes that are responsible for the organization of microtubule cortical array. Here we propose a minimal model that incorporates the basic assembly dynamics and intermicrotubule interaction to understand the unexplored phase behavior of such a system. Through kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical calculations, we show that the self-organized patterns of plant cell cortical microtubules can be regulated by controlling single microtubule assembly dynamics. Biologically, this means that the structural reorganization can be regulated by microtubule-associated proteins via changing microtubule dynamic instability parameters, such as the microtubule plus-end growing rate, GTP-tubulin hydrolysis rate, etc. Such regulation is indirectly confirmed by various in vivo experiments. For the physical aspects, we not only construct the phase diagram that determines under what parameters ordered microtubule arrays form, but also predict that the essentially different ordered structures may appear through continuous and discontinuous transitions. The present study will play a central role in our understanding of the basic mechanism of plant cell noncentrosomal microtubule arrays.
