Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PROTEIN ARGININE METHYLTRANSFERASE5 (PRMT5), a highly conserved arginine (Arg) methyltransferase protein, regulates multiple aspects of the growth, development, and environmental stress responses by methylating Arg in histones and some mRNA splicing-related proteins in plants. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a recently characterized gasotransmitter that also regulates various important physiological processes. l-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD) is a key enzyme of endogenous H2S production. However, our understanding of the upstream regulatory mechanisms of endogenous H2S production is limited in plant cells. Here, we confirmed that AtPRMT5 increases the enzymatic activity of AtLCD through methylation modifications during stress responses. Both atprmt5 and atlcd mutants were sensitive to cadmium (Cd2+), whereas the overexpression (OE) of AtPRMT5 or AtLCD enhanced the Cd2+ tolerance of plants. AtPRMT5 methylated AtLCD at Arg-83, leading to a significant increase in AtLCD enzymatic activity. The Cd2+ sensitivity of atprmt5-2 atlcd double mutants was consistent with that of atlcd plants. When AtPRMT5 was overexpressed in the atlcd mutant, the Cd2+ tolerance of plants was significantly lower than that of AtPRMT5-OE plants in the wild-type background. These results were confirmed in pharmacological experiments. Thus, AtPRMT5 methylation of AtLCD increases its enzymatic activity, thereby strengthening the endogenous H2S signal and ultimately improving plant tolerance to Cd2+ stress. These findings provide further insights into the substrates of AtPRMT5 and increase our understanding of the regulatory mechanism upstream of H2S signals.
