['23707506', 'Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) catalyze the interconversion between alcohols and  aldehydes with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) to  NADH. In this study, for the first time we report an over-expression and  purification strategy for the Arabidosis thaliana ADH (AtADH), and characterize  its enzymatic properties. AtADH was expressed in an Escherichia coli system, the  polyhistidine-tag was removed after the recombinant AtADH protein was purified by  metal chelating affinity chromatography. Activity assays demonstrated that AtADH  has distinct enzymatic properties when compared with many well-known ADHs. It  held peak activity at pH 10.5 and showed broad substrate selectivity for primary  and secondary alcohols. The kinetic Km parameters for both ethanol and coenzyme  were in the order of mM. This relative low affinity may reflect the need of the  plant to maintain a supply of NAD(+) in nature. Different from yeast ADH, AtADH  showed almost the same activity for short straight chain alcohols and reduced  activity for secondary alcohols. This broad spectrum in alcohol selection and the  observed higher catalytic activity (high Vmax (EtOH)) may result from the  requirement of the single enzyme to accommodate many substrates.', '2013 Aug', 'Protein Expr Purif', '10.1016/j.pep.2013.05.004', 'Xu']
