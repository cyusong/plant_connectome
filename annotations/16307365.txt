To identify and characterize lineage-specific genes of conifers, two sets of ESTs (with 12791 and 5902 ESTs, representing 5373 and 3018 gene transcripts, respectively) were generated from the Cupressaceae species Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa. These transcripts were compared with non-redundant sets of genes generated from Pinaceae species, other gymnosperms and angiosperms. About 6% of tentative unique genes (Unigenes) of C. japonica and C. obtusa had homologs in other conifers but not angiosperms, and about 70% had apparent homologs in angiosperms. The calculated GC contents of orthologous genes showed that GC contents of coniferous genes are likely to be lower than those of angiosperms. Comparisons of the numbers of homologous genes in each species suggest that copy numbers of genes may be correlated between diverse seed plants. This correlation suggests that the multiplicity of such genes may have arisen before the divergence of gymnosperms and angiosperms.
