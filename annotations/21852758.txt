Almost a decade ago BRI1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1) was identified as a co-receptor of brassinosteroid (BR) insensitive 1 (BRI1), the receptor for BRs, which plays an essential role in transducing BR signaling to regulate plant development. BAK1 is also critical in resistance to various pathogens. BAK1 rapidly binds to certain receptors for pathogen/microbeassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) after the perception of pathogen elicitors and is required for the full elicitation of pathogen-induced defense responses, such as the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6) and production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, BAK1 functions in both BR signaling and PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Recently BAK1 was also found to play an important role in mediating defense responses against an insect herbivore (Manduca sexta) of Nicotiana attenuata. In this interaction, BAK1 positively modulates wound- or herbivore feeding induced accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile). This mini-review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the functions of BAK1 in resistance to pathogens and herbivores.
