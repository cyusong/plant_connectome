This commentary introduces an exciting breakthrough: the first solved structure of a plant NLR immune receptor complex. The significance of this work, including the similarity between the activation of NLRs from plants and animals, and potentially novel mechanism of immune signaling in plants, were discussed and put into perspective.

NLR: !activates! Immune Signaling
Plants: !similar to! Animals
NLR: !structurally similar to! Animal NLRs
NLR: !binds to! Effector Proteins
