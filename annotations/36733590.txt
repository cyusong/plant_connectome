In the <i>Convolvulaceae</i> family, around 1650 species belonging to 60 genera are widely distributed globally, mainly in the tropical and subtropical regions of America and Asia. Although a series of chloroplast genomes in <i>Convolvulaceae</i> were reported and investigated, the evolutionary and genetic relationships among the chloroplast genomes of the <i>Convolvulaceae</i> family have not been extensively elucidated till now. In this study, we first reported the complete chloroplast genome sequence of <i>Ipomoea pes-caprae</i>, a widely distributed coastal plant with medical values. The chloroplast genome of <i>I. pes-caprae</i> is 161667 bp in length, and the GC content is 37.56%. The chloroplastic DNA molecule of <i>I. pes-caprae</i> is a circular structure composed of LSC (large-single-copy), SSC (small-single-copy), and IR (inverted repeat) regions, with the size of the three regions being 88210 bp, 12117 bp, and 30670 bp, respectively. The chloroplast genome of <i>I. pes-caprae</i> contains 141 genes, and 35 SSRs are identified in the chloroplast genome. Our research results provide important genomic information for the molecular phylogeny of <i>I. pes-caprae</i>. The Phylogenetic analysis of 28 <i>Convolvulaceae</i> chloroplast genomes showed that the relationship of <i>I. pes-caprae</i> with <i>I. involucrata</i> or <i>I. obscura</i> was much closer than that with other <i>Convolvulaccae</i> species. Further comparative analyses between the <i>Ipomoea</i> species and <i>Cuscuta</i> species revealed the mechanism underlying the formation of parasitic characteristics of <i>Cuscuta</i> species from the perspective of the chloroplast genome.
