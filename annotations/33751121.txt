['33751121', 'Angiosperms have evolved the phloem for the long-distance transport of  metabolites. The complex process of phloem development involves genes that only  occur in vascular plant lineages. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the  BREVIS RADIX (BRX) gene is required for continuous root protophloem  differentiation, together with PROTEIN KINASE ASSOCIATED WITH BRX (PAX). BRX and  its BRX-LIKE (BRXL) homologs are composed of four highly conserved domains  including the signature tandem BRX domains that are separated by variable  spacers. Nevertheless, BRX family proteins have functionally diverged. For  instance, BRXL2 can only partially replace BRX in the root protophloem. This  divergence is reflected in physiologically relevant differences in protein  behavior, such as auxin-induced plasma membrane dissociation of BRX, which is not  observed for BRXL2. Here we dissected the differential functions of BRX family  proteins using a set of amino acid substitutions and domain swaps. Our data  suggest that the plasma membrane-associated tandem BRX domains are both necessary  and sufficient to convey the biological outputs of BRX function and therefore  constitute an important regulatory entity. Moreover, PAX target phosphosites in  the linker between the two BRX domains mediate the auxin-induced plasma membrane  dissociation. Engineering these sites into BRXL2 renders this modified protein  auxin-responsive and thereby increases its biological activity in the root  protophloem context.', '2021 Jul 19', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab076', 'ORCID:']
