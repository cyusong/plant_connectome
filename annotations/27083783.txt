Studies in yeast and animals have revealed that histone deacetylases (HDACs) often act as components of multiprotein complexes, including chromatin remodelling complexes (CRCs). However, interactions between HDACs and CRCs in plants have yet to be demonstrated. Here, we present evidence for the interaction between Arabidopsis HD2C deacetylase and a BRM-containing SWI/SNF CRC. Moreover, we reveal a novel function of HD2C as a regulator of the heat stress response. HD2C transcript levels were strongly induced in plants subjected to heat treatment, and the expression of selected heat-responsive genes was up-regulated in heat-stressed hd2c mutant, suggesting that HD2C acts to down-regulate heat-activated genes. In keeping with the HDAC activity of HD2C, the altered expression of HD2C-regulated genes coincided in most cases with increased histone acetylation at their loci. Microarray transcriptome analysis of hd2c and brm mutants identified a subset of commonly regulated heat-responsive genes, and the effect of the brm hd2c double mutation on the expression of these genes was non-additive. Moreover, heat-treated 3-week-old hd2c, brm and brm hd2c mutants displayed similar rates of growth retardation. Taken together, our findings suggest that HD2C and BRM act in a common genetic pathway to regulate the Arabidopsis heat stress response.
