In the smut fungus Ustilago maydis, a tightly regulated cAMP signaling cascade is necessary for pathogenic development. Transcriptome analysis using whole genome microarrays set up to identify putative target genes of the protein kinase A catalytic subunit Adr1 revealed nine genes with putative functions in two high-affinity iron uptake systems. These genes locate to three gene clusters on different chromosomes and include the previously identified complementing siderophore auxotroph genes sid1 and sid2 involved in siderophore biosynthesis. Transcription of all nine genes plus three additional genes associated with the gene clusters was also coregulated by iron through the Urbs1 transcription factor. Two components of a high-affinity iron uptake system were characterized in more detail: fer2, encoding a high-affinity iron permease; and fer1, encoding an iron multicopper oxidase. Fer2 localized to the plasma membrane and complemented an ftr1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking a high-affinity iron permease. During pathogenic development, fer2 expression was confined to the phase of hyphal proliferation inside the plant. fer2 as well as fer1 deletion mutants were strongly affected in virulence. These data highlight the importance of the high-affinity iron uptake system via an iron permease and a multicopper oxidase for biotrophic development in the U. maydis/maize (Zea mays) pathosystem.
