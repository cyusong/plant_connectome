We report on a nondestructive clearing technique that enhances transmission of light through specimens from diverse plant species, opening unique opportunities for microscope-enabled plant research. After clearing, plant organs and thick tissue sections are amenable to deep imaging. The clearing method is compatible with immunocytochemistry techniques and can be used in concert with common fluorescent probes, including widely adopted protein tags such as GFP, which has fluorescence that is preserved during the clearing process.
