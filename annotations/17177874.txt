The slow gas diffusion rate in flooded soil not only causes oxygen deficiency, but also favours the accumulation of ethylene in root systems to concentrations that may strongly affect root elongation. Previously published experiments showed that root elongation in rice is much less strongly inhibited by ethylene than in some other species less well adapted to wet conditions. Rice roots have also been reported to produce abnormally little ethylene. We tested if these traits are typical of wetland species and are thus likely to be widespread adaptive traits. Comparisons using 14 species indicated that insensitivity to the inhibiting effects of ethylene on root elongation is unlikely to be a common feature of temperate wetland species. However, resistance to longitudinal gas diffusion within roots of wetland species, which largely depends on diameter and the presence of gas-filled channels, was found to be less than in non-wetland species. We show that this can help maintain low internal ethylene concentrations by venting accumulated gas to the shoot and atmosphere.
