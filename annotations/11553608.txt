['11553608', 'The xanthine oxidase class of molybdenum enzyzmes requires a terminal sulfur  ligand at the active site. It has been proposed that a special sulfurase  catalyzes the insertion of this ligand thereby activating the enzymes. Previous  analyses of mutants in plants indicated that the genetic locus aba3 is involved  in this step leading to activation of the molybdenum enzymes aldehyde oxidase and  xanthine dehydrogenase. Here we report the cloning of the aba3 gene from  Arabidopsis thaliana and the biochemical characterization of the purified  protein. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with a N-terminal NifS-like sulfurase  domain and a C-terminal domain that might be involved in recognizing the target  enzymes. Molecular analysis of three aba3 mutants identified mutations in both  domains. ABA3 contains highly conserved binding motifs for pyridoxal phosphate  and for a persulfide. The purified recombinant protein possesses a cysteine  desulfurase activity, is yellow in color, and shows a NifS-like change in  absorbance in the presence of L-cysteine. Pretreatment of ABA3 with a  thiol-specific alkylating reagent inhibited its desulfurase activity. These data  indicate a transsulfuration reaction similar to bacterial NifS. In a fully  defined in vitro system, the purified protein was able to activate aldehyde  oxidase by using L-cysteine as sulfur donor. Finally, we show that the expression  of the aba3 gene is inducible by drought-stress.', '2001 Nov 2', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.C100472200', 'Mendel']
