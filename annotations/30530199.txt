['30530199', 'Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) catalyze the formation of the second messenger cAMP from  ATP. Here we report the characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana leucine-rich  repeat (LRR) protein (At3g14460; AtLRRAC1) as an adenylyl cyclase. Using an  AC-specific search motif supported by computational assessments of protein models  we identify an AC catalytic center within the N-terminus and demonstrate that  AtLRRAC1 can generate cAMP in vitro. Knock-out mutants of AtLRRAC1 have  compromised immune responses to the biotrophic fungus Golovinomyces orontii and  the hemibiotrophic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae, but not against the  necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. These findings are consistent with a role  of cAMP-dependent pathways in the defense against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic  plant pathogens.', '2019 Jan', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2018.10.025', 'Pasqualini']
