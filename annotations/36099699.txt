Methyl salicylate is a volatile compound, the synthesis of which takes place via the salicylic acid pathway in plants. Both compounds can be involved in the development of systemic acquired resistance and they play their role partly independently. Salicylic acid transport has an important role in long-distance signalling, but methyl salicylate has also been suggested as a phloem-based mobile signal, which can be demethylated to form salicylic acid, inducing the de-novo synthesis of salicylic acid in distal tissue. Despite the fact that salicylic acid has a protective role in abiotic stress responses and tolerance, very few investigations have been reported on the similar effects of methyl salicylate. In addition, as salicylic acid and methyl salicylate are often treated simply as the volatile and non-volatile forms of the same compound, and in several cases they also act in the same way, it is hard to highlight the differences in their mode of action. The main aim of the present review is to reveal the individual role and action mechanism of methyl salicylate in systemic acquired resistance, plant-plant communication and various stress conditions in fruits and plants.
