['29194659', 'Members of Stress-Associated Protein (SAP) family in plants have been shown to  impart tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, however, their mode of action in  providing tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses is largely unknown. There are 14  SAP genes in Arabidopsis thaliana containing A20, AN1, and Cys2-His2 zinc finger  domains. AtSAP13, a member of the SAP family, carries two AN1 zinc finger domains  and an additional Cys2-His2 domain. AtSAP13 transcripts showed upregulation in  response to Cd, ABA, and salt stresses. AtSAP13 overexpression lines showed  strong tolerance to toxic metals (AsIII, Cd, and Zn), drought, and salt stress.  Further, transgenic lines accumulated significantly higher amounts of Zn, but  less As and Cd accumulation in shoots and roots. AtSAP13 promoter-GUS fusion  studies showed GUS expression predominantly in the vascular tissue, hydathodes,  and the apical meristem and region of root maturation and elongation as well as  the root hairs. At the subcellular level, the AtSAP13-eGFP fusion protein was  found to localize in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Through yeast one-hybrid assay,  we identified several AP2/EREBP family transcription factors that interacted with  the AtSAP13 promoter. AtSAP13 and its homologues will be highly useful for  developing climate resilient crops.', '2018 May', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.13103', 'ORCID:']
