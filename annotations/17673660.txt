['17673660', 'In flowering plants, signaling between the male pollen tube and the synergid  cells of the female gametophyte is required for fertilization. In the Arabidopsis  thaliana mutant feronia (fer), fertilization is impaired; the pollen tube fails  to arrest and thus continues to grow inside the female gametophyte. FER encodes a  synergid-expressed, plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase. We found that  the FER protein accumulates asymmetrically in the synergid membrane at the  filiform apparatus. Interspecific crosses using pollen from Arabidopsis lyrata  and Cardamine flexuosa on A. thaliana stigmas resulted in a fer-like phenotype  that correlates with sequence divergence in the extracellular domain of FER. Our  findings show that the female control of pollen tube reception is based on a  FER-dependent signaling pathway, which may play a role in reproductive isolation  barriers.', '2007 Aug 3', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1143562', 'Grossniklaus']
