Wheat is a critically important crop. The application of fungi, such as <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i>, to protect and improve crop yields could become an alternative solution to synthetic chemicals. However, the interaction between the fungus and wheat in the presence of stress factors at the molecular level has not been fully elucidated. In the present work, we exposed germinating seeds of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to the plant pathogen <i>Fusarium culmorum</i> and the popular herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in the presence of <i>T. harzianum</i> or its extracellular metabolites. Then, the harvested roots and shoots were analyzed using spectrometry, 2D-PAGE, and MALDI-TOF/MS techniques. Although <i>F. culmorum</i> and 2,4-D were found to disturb seed germination and the chlorophyll content, <i>T. harzianum</i> partly alleviated these negative effects and reduced the synthesis of zearalenone by <i>F. culmorum</i>. Moreover, <i>T. harzianum</i> decreased the activity of oxidoreduction enzymes (CAT and SOD) and the contents of the oxylipins 9-Hode, 13-Hode, and 13-Hotre induced by stress factors. Under the influence of various growth conditions, changes were observed in over 40 proteins from the wheat roots. Higher volumes of proteins and enzymes performing oxidoreductive functions, such as catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, cytochrome C peroxidase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, were found in the <i>Fusarium</i>-inoculated and 2,4-D-treated wheat roots. Additionally, observation of the level of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase involved in the oxylipin signaling pathway in wheat showed an increase. <i>Trichoderma</i> and its metabolites present in the system leveled out the mentioned proteins to the control volumes. Among the 30 proteins examined in the shoots, the expression of the proteins involved in photosynthesis and oxidative stress response was found to be induced in the presence of the herbicide and the pathogen. In summary, these proteomic and metabolomic studies confirmed that the presence of <i>T. harzianum</i> results in the alleviation of oxidative stress in wheat induced by 2,4-D or <i>F. culmorum</i>.
