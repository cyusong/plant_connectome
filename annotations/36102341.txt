Plant organisms assimilate CO<sub>2</sub> through the photosynthetic pathway, which facilitates in the synthesis of sugar for plant development. As environmental elements including water level, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, temperature and soil characteristics change, the plants may recruit series of genes to help adapt the hostile environments and challenges. C4 photosynthesis plants are an excellent example of plant evolutionary adaptation to diverse condition. Compared with C3 photosynthesis plants, C4 photosynthesis plants have altered leaf anatomy and new metabolism for CO<sub>2</sub> capture, with multiple related enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase), pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), NAD(P)-malic enzyme (NAD(P)-ME), NAD(P) - malate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)-MDH) and carbonic anhydrases (CA), identified to participate in the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) pathway. Recently, great achievements about C4 CCM-related genes have been made in the dissection of C3 plant development processes involving various stresses. In this review, we describe the functions of C4 CCM-related homologous genes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in C3 plants. We further summarize C4 CCM-related homologous genes' functions in response to stresses in C3 plants. The understanding of C4 CCM-related genes' function in response to abiotic stress in plant is important to modify the crop plants for climate diversification.
