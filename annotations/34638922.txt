Forest tree breeding efforts have focused mainly on improving traits of economic importance, selecting trees suited to new environments or generating trees that are more resilient to biotic and abiotic stressors. This review describes various methods of forest tree selection assisted by genomics and the main technological challenges and achievements in research at the genomic level. Due to the long rotation time of a forest plantation and the resulting long generation times necessary to complete a breeding cycle, the use of advanced techniques with traditional breeding have been necessary, allowing the use of more precise methods for determining the genetic architecture of traits of interest, such as genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and genomic selection (GS). In this sense, main factors that determine the accuracy of genomic prediction models are also addressed. In turn, the introduction of genome editing opens the door to new possibilities in forest trees and especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9). It is a highly efficient and effective genome editing technique that has been used to effectively implement targetable changes at specific places in the genome of a forest tree. In this sense, forest trees still lack a transformation method and an inefficient number of genotypes for CRISPR/Cas9. This challenge could be addressed with the use of the newly developing technique GRF-GIF with speed breeding.
