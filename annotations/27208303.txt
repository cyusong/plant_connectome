Peroxisomes are highly dynamic and metabolically active organelles that play an important role in cellular functions, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Peroxisomal dynamics, such as the proliferation, movement, and production of dynamic extensions called peroxules, have been associated with ROS in plant cells. However, the function and regulation of peroxules are largely unknown. Using confocal microscopy, we have shown that treatment of Arabidopsis leaves with the heavy metal cadmium produces time course-dependent changes in peroxisomal dynamics, starting with peroxule formation, followed by peroxisome proliferation, and finally returning to the normal morphology and number. These changes during Cd treatment were regulated by NADPH oxidase (C and F)-related ROS production. Peroxule formation is a general response to stimuli such as arsenic and is regulated by peroxin 11a (PEX11a), as Arabidopsis pex11a RNAi lines are unable to produce peroxules under stress conditions. The pex11a line showed higher levels of lipid peroxidation content and lower expression of genes involved in antioxidative defenses and signaling, suggesting that these extensions are involved in regulating ROS accumulation and ROS-dependent gene expression in response to stress. Our results demonstrate that PEX11a and peroxule formation play a key role in regulating stress perception and fast cell responses to environmental cues.
