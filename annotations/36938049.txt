Soil salinization is one of the main abiotic stresses affecting cotton yield and planting area. Potassium application has been proven to be an important strategy to reduce salt damage in agricultural production. However, the mechanism of potassium regulating the salt adaptability of cotton has not been fully elucidated. In the present research, the appropriate potassium application rate for alleviating salt damage of cotton based on different K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratios we screened, and a gene co-expression network based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) using the transcriptome data sets treated with CK (0 mM NaCl), S (150 mM NaCl), and SK8 (150 mM NaCl + 9.38 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) was constructed. In this study, four key modules that are highly related to potassium regulation of cotton salt tolerance were identified, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glutathione metabolism pathway were identified as the key biological processes and metabolic pathways for potassium to improve cotton root salt adaptability. In addition, 21 hub genes and 120 key candidate genes were identified in this study, suggesting that they may play an important role in the enhancement of salt adaptability of cotton by potassium. The key modules, key biological pathways and hub genes discovered in this study will provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of potassium enhancing salinity adaptability in cotton, and lay a theoretical foundation for the improvement and innovation of high-quality cotton germplasm.
