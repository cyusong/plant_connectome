The 26S proteasome, an essential protease complex of the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS), controls many cellular events by degrading short-lived regulatory proteins marked with polyubiquitin chains. The 20S proteolytic core protease (CP), the catalytic core of the 26S proteasome, is a central enzyme in the UPS. Its biogenesis proceeds in a multistep and orderly fashion assisted by a series of proteasome assembly chaperones. In this study, we identified a novel maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) kernel mutant named <i>defective kernel40</i> (<i>dek40</i>), which produces small, collapsed kernels and exhibits delayed embryo and endosperm development. <i>Dek40</i> was identified by map-based cloning and confirmed by transgenic functional complementation. <i>Dek40</i> encodes a putative cytosol-localized proteasome biogenesis-associated chaperone4 (PBAC4) protein. DEK40 participates in the biogenesis of the 20S CP by interacting with PBAC3. Loss-of-function of DEK40 substantially affected 20S CP biogenesis, resulting in decreased activity of the 26S proteasome. Ubiquitylome analysis indicated that DEK40 influences the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and plays an essential role in the maintenance of cellular protein homoeostasis. These results demonstrate that <i>Dek40</i> encodes a PBAC4 chaperone that affects 20S CP biogenesis and is required for 26S proteasome function and seed development in maize.
