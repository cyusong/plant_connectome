Cyclin proteins, associated to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), play fundamental roles in cell cycle control as they constitute a very important driving force to allow cell cycle progression. D-type cyclins (CycDs) are important both for interpreting external mitogenic signals and in the control of the G1 phase. The maize (Zea mays) genome appears to contain at least 17 different CycD genes, and they fall into the subgroups previously described for other plants. Maize CycDs have been named according to identity percentages of the corresponding orthologs in rice and Arabidopsis. In silico analysis confirmed the presence of characteristic cyclin domains in each maize CycD gene and showed that their genomic organization is similar to their orthologs in rice and Arabidopsis. The expression of maize CycD genes was followed in seeds, during germination in the presence/absence of exogenously added hormones, and also in different plantlet tissues (mesocotyl, root tips and first leaf). Most cyclins were expressed in germinating seeds and at least in one of the plantlet tissues tested; almost all of the detected cyclins show an accumulating pattern of mRNA along germination (0-24 h) and higher levels in root tissue. Interestingly, some cyclins show high levels in non-proliferating tissues as leaf. Addition of auxins or cytokinins does not seem to importantly modify transcript levels; on the other hand, addition of abscisic acid repressed the expression of several cyclins. The role of each CycD during germination and plant growth and its interaction with other cell cycle proteins becomes a topic of the highest interest.
