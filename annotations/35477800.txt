Morphogenic adaptation of young seedlings to light environments is a critical developmental process that ensures plant survival and propagation, as they emerge from the soil. Photomorphogenic responses are facilitated by a network of light and growth hormonal signals, such as auxin and gibberellic acid (GA). Karrikins (KARs), a group of butenolide compounds produced from burning plant materials in wildfires, are known to stimulate seed germination in fire-prone plant species. Notably, recent studies support that they also regulate seedling growth, while underlying molecular mechanisms have been unexplored yet. Here, we demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1), a negative regulator of KAR signaling, integrates light and KAR signals into GA-DELLA pathways that regulate hypocotyl growth during seedling establishment. We found that SMAX1 facilitates degradation of DELLA proteins in the hypocotyls. Interestingly, light induces the accumulation of SMAX1 proteins, and SMAX1-mediated degradation of DELLA is elevated in seedling establishment during the dark-to-light transition. Our observations indicate that SMAX1-mediated integration of light and KAR signals into GA pathways elaborately modulates seedling establishment.
