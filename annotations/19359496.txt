['19359496', 'The Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein is a conserved repressor of cell proliferation.  In animals and plants, deregulation of Rb protein causes hyperproliferation and  perturbs cell differentiation to various degrees. However, the primary  developmental impact of the loss of Rb protein has remained unclear. In this  study we investigated the direct consequences of Rb protein knockout in the  Arabidopsis male germline using cytological and molecular markers. The  Arabidopsis germ line derives from the unequal division of the microspore,  producing a small germ cell and a large terminally differentiated vegetative  cell. A single division of the germ cell produces the 2 sperm cells. We observed  that the loss of Rb protein does not have a major impact on microspore division  but causes limited hyperproliferation of the vegetative cell and, to a lesser  degree, of the sperm cells. In addition, cell fate is perturbed in a fraction of  Rb-defective vegetative cells. These defects are rescued by preventing cell  proliferation arising from down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase A1. Our  results indicate that hyperproliferation caused by the loss of Rb protein  prevents or delays cell determination during plant male gametogenesis, providing  further evidence for a direct link between fate determination and cell  proliferation.', '2009 Apr 28', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0810992106', 'Berger']
