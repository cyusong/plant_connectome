Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in diverse physiological processes in plants, including growth, development, response to pathogens, and interactions with beneficial microorganisms. In this work, a dedicated microarray representing the widest database available of NO-related transcripts in plants has been produced with 999 genes identified by a cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis as modulated in Medicago truncatula roots treated with two NO donors. The microarray then was used to monitor the expression of NO-responsive genes in M. truncatula during the incompatible interaction with the foliar pathogen Colletotrichum trifolii race 1 and during the symbiotic interaction with Sinorhizobium meliloti 1,021. A wide modulation of NO-related genes has been detected during the hypersensitive reaction or during nodule formation and is discussed with special emphasis on the physiological relevance of these genes in the context of the two biotic interactions. This work clearly shows that NO-responsive genes behave differently depending on the plant organ and on the type of interaction, strengthening the need to consider regulatory networks, including different signaling molecules.
