The red color of the foliage and fruit in strawberry comes from anthocyanins stored in the vacuole; however, how this anthocyanin accumulation is regulated remains unclear. A reduced anthocyanin in petioles (rap) mutant was identified in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenized population of YW5AF7, a white-fruited variety of the wild strawberry Fragaria vesca. The causative mutation was identified to be a premature stop codon in a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene. In addition to the foliage coloration, RAP also mediates fruit pigmentation and acts downstream of the fruit-specific transcription factor FvMYB10. Among all eight GST genes in the same subfamily, RAP is most abundantly expressed in the ripening fruit. Expression analysis and transient expression assays demonstrated that RAP is the principal transporter of anthocyanins among the paralogs. Moreover, domain-swap experiments showed that both the N- and C-terminals of RAP are essential for the binding capability of anthocyanins. In addition, transient knock-down of RAP resulted in reduced fruit coloration in cultivated strawberry. Collectively, our results demonstrate that RAP encodes the principal GST transporter of anthocyanins in the strawberry foliage and fruit, and it could be modified to alter the fruit color in strawberry.
