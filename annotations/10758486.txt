['10758486', 'Flowering time mutants represent genetic functions in control of the floral  transition, an important developmental phase switch in the life cycle of higher  plants. Many such mutants have been identified and characterized, particular in  Arabidopsis. Here we describe the identification and initial characterization of  a new early flowering mutant of Arabidopsis. The corresponding gene, SVP (SHORT  VEGETATIVE PHASE), was cloned through transposon tagging and represents a new  member of the MADS-box gene family of transcription factors. Analysis of its  transcriptional activity revealed the presence of differently sized transcripts  that were confined to vegetative tissues and floral primordia and absent from  developed flowers and siliques. The function of SVP as a repressor of the floral  transition is discussed.', '2000 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00682.x', 'Huijser']
