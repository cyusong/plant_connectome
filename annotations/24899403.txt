DUF579 (domain of unknown function 579) family proteins contain a DUF579 domain structure but vary greatly in their overall sequence similarity. Several DUF579 proteins have been found to play a role in cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, while DUF579 family genes have not yet been systematically investigated in Populus. In this study, the Populus DUF579 family proteins were found to be localized in different cell types and subcellular locations. The diverse expression patterns of the proteins indicate that they may perform different functions in Populus. Among the DUF579 family members, PtrDUF579-1 is found to be specifically expressed in vascular cambium zone cells where it is localized in the Golgi apparatus. Suppression of PtrDUF579-1 expression reduced plant height and stem diameter size. Cambium cell division and xylem tissue growth was inhibited while secondary cell wall formation was unchanged in PtrDUF579-1 suppressed plants. Cell walls analysis showed that the composition of the pectin fraction of the cambium cell wall was altered while other polysaccharides were not affected in PtrDUF579-1 suppressed plants. This observation suggest cambium expressed PtrDUF579-1 may affect cell wall biosynthesis and be involved in cambium cell proliferation in Populus. Overall, DUF579 family proteins play a diverse set of roles in Populus.
