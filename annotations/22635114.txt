Verticillium longisporum is a soil-borne vascular pathogen that causes reduced shoot growth and early senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we report that these disease symptoms are less pronounced in plants that lack the receptor of the plant defense hormone jasmonic acid (JA), CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Initial colonization of the roots was comparable in wild-type and coi1 plants, and fungal DNA accumulated to almost similar levels in petioles of wild-type and coi1 plants at 10 d post infection. Completion of the fungal life cycle was impaired in coi1, as indicated by the reduced number of plants with microsclerotia, which are detected on dead plant material at late stages of the disease. Contrary to the expectation that the hormone receptor mutant coi1 should display the same phenotype as the corresponding hormone biosynthesis mutant delayed dehiscence2 (dde2), dde2 plants developed wild-type-like disease symptoms. Marker genes of the JA and the JA/ethylene defense pathway were induced in petioles of wild-type plants but not in petioles of dde2 plants, indicating that fungal compounds that would activate the known COI1-dependent signal transduction chain were absent. Grafting experiments revealed that the susceptibility-enhancing COI1 function acts in the roots. Moreover, we show that the coi1-mediated tolerance is not due to the hyperactivation of the salicylic acid pathway. Together, our results have unraveled a novel COI1 function in the roots that acts independently from JA-isoleucine or any JA-isoleucine mimic. This COI1 activity is required for a yet unknown root-to-shoot signaling process that enables V. longisporum to elicit disease symptoms in Arabidopsis.
