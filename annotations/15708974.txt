['15708974', 'APETALA2 (AP2) is best known for its role in the regulation of flower meristem  and flower organ identity and development in Arabidopsis. We show here that AP2  also plays an important role in determining seed size, seed weight, and the  accumulation of seed oil and protein. We demonstrate genetically that AP2 acts  through the maternal sporophyte and endosperm genomes to control seed weight and  seed yield. Thus, AP2 functions outside the boundaries of flower meristem and  flower organ development to affect agronomically relevant traits in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Feb 22', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0409893102', 'Okamuro']
