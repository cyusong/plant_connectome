Crop domestication and evolution represent key fields of plant and genetics research. Here, we re-sequenced and analyzed whole genome data from 51 wild accessions and 53 representative cultivars of Eriobotrya japonica, an important semi-subtropical fruit crop. Population genomics analysis suggested that modern cultivated E. japonica experienced a two-staged domestication fitting the "marginality model," being initially domesticated in west-northern Hubei province from a mono-phylogenetic wild progenitor, then refined mainly in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces of China. Cultivated E. japonica has experienced little reduction in genome-wide nucleotide polymorphism compared with wild forms. Genes responsible for sugar biosynthesis were enriched in regions harboring putative selective sweeps. An approach based on co-clustering into gene families and evaluating chromosome colinearity of orthologous and paralogous genes was used to identify convergent/parallel selective sweeps among different crops. Specifically, more than one hundred of orthologs and paralogs undergoing selective sweeps were identified between loquat, apple and peach, among which 14 encoded "UDP glycosyltransferase 1." In sum, the study not only provided valuable information for breeding of E. japonica, but also enriched knowledge of crop domestication.
