['11030432', "The phenylpropanoid pathway results in the synthesis of thousands of compounds,  including flavonoids like flavonols, anthocyanidins and tannins. In Arabidopsis  thaliana, the lack of tannins in the seed coat (testa) causes the transparent  testa (tt) phenotype. In the present study, we identified the gene responsible  for the tt7 mutation. We show that TT7 encodes the enzyme flavonoid  3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), and demonstrate that this P450-dependent monooxygenase has  F3'H activity. The availability of the AtF3'H gene and promoter sequence will  allow us to study the coregulation of a complete set of flavonol and  anthocyanidin biosynthesis genes in A. thaliana, and makes in vitro synthesis of  hydroxylated flavonoids more feasible.", '2000 Aug', 'Biol Chem', '10.1515/BC.2000.095', 'Weisshaar']
