Plants have evolved a remarkable capacity to track and respond to fluctuations of light quality and intensity that influence photomorphogenesis facilitated through several photoreceptors, which include a small family of phytochromes. Rice seedlings grown on germination paper in red light for 48 h having their shoot bottom exposed had suppressed photomorphogenesis and were deficient in chlorophyll. Seedlings grown under identical light regime having their shoot bottom covered were green and accumulated chlorophyll. Further, etiolated seedlings with their shoot bottom exposed, when grown in 4 min red/far-red cycles for 48 h, accumulated chlorophyll demonstrating the reversal of suppression of photomorphogenesis by far-red light. It implicates the involvement of phytochrome. Immunoblot analysis showed the persistence of photolabile phytochrome A protein for 48 h in seedlings grown in red light with their shoot bottom exposed, suggesting its involvement in suppression of photomorphogenesis. This was further corroborated in phyA seedlings that turned green when grown in red light having their shoot bottom exposed. Calmodulin (CaM) antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-napthalene sulphonamide or trifluoperazine substantially restored photomorphogenesis both in the wild type (WT) and phyA demonstrating the involvement of CaM-dependent kinases in the down-regulation of the greening process. Results demonstrate that red light-induced suppression of photomorphogenesis, perceived in the shoot bottom, is a red high irradiance response of PhyA.
