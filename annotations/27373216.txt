['27373216', 'Chlorophyll (Chl) degradation is an integral process of leaf senescence, and  NYE1/SGR1 has been demonstrated as a key regulator of Chl catabolism in diverse  plant species. In this study, using yeast one-hybrid screening, we identified  three abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element (ABRE)-binding transcription  factors, ABF2 (AREB1), ABF3, and ABF4 (AREB2), as the putative binding proteins  of the NYE1 promoter. Through the transactivation analysis, electrophoretic  mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that  ABF2, ABF3, and ABF4 directly bound to and activated the NYE1 promoter in vitro  and in vivo. ABA is a positive regulator of leaf senescence, and exogenously  applied ABA can accelerate Chl degradation. The triple mutant of the ABFs,  abf2abf3abf4, as well as two ABA-insensitive mutants, abi1-1 and snrk2.2/2.3/2.6,  exhibited stay-green phenotypes after ABA treatment, along with decreased  induction of NYE1 and NYE2 expression. In contrast, overexpression of ABF4  accelerated Chl degradation upon ABA treatment. Interestingly, ABF2/3/4 could  also activate the expression of two Chl catabolic enzyme genes, PAO and NYC1, by  directly binding to their promoters. In addition, abf2abf3abf4 exhibited a  functional stay-green phenotype, and senescence-associated genes (SAGs), such as  SAG29 (SWEET15), might be directly regulated by the ABFs. Taken together, our  results suggest that ABF2, ABF3, and ABF4 likely act as key regulators in  mediating ABA-triggered Chl degradation and leaf senescence in general in  Arabidopsis.', '2016 Sep 6', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2016.06.006', 'Kuai']
