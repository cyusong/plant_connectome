['32554507', 'Shade-avoiding plants, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), display a  number of growth responses, such as elongation of stem-like structures and  repositioning of leaves, elicited by shade cues, including a reduction in the  blue and red portions of the solar spectrum and a low-red to far-red ratio. Shade  also promotes phototropism of de-etiolated seedlings through repression of  phytochrome B, presumably to enhance capture of unfiltered sunlight. Here we show  that both low blue light and a low-red to far-red light ratio are required to  rapidly enhance phototropism in Arabidopsis seedlings. However, prolonged low  blue light treatments are sufficient to promote phototropism through reduced  cryptochrome1 (cry1) activation. The enhanced phototropic response of cry1  mutants in the lab and in response to natural canopies depends on PHYTOCHROME  INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs). In favorable light conditions, cry1 limits the  expression of PIF4, while in low blue light, PIF4 expression increases, which  contributes to phototropic enhancement. The analysis of quantitative DII-Venus,  an auxin signaling reporter, indicates that low blue light leads to enhanced  auxin signaling in the hypocotyl and, upon phototropic stimulation, a steeper  auxin signaling gradient across the hypocotyl. We conclude that phototropic  enhancement by canopy shade results from the combined activities of phytochrome B  and cry1 that converge on PIF regulation.', '2020 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.20.00243', 'ORCID:']
