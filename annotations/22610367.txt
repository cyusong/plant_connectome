['22610367', 'Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), also termed P23 in human,  belongs to a family of calcium- and tubulin-binding proteins, and it is generally  regarded as a growth-regulating protein. Recently, Arabidopsis TCTP (AtTCTP) has  been reported to function as an important growth regulator in plants. On the  other hand, plant TCTP has been suggested to be involved in abiotic stress  signaling such as aluminum, salt, and water deficit by a number of microarray or  proteomic analyses. In this study, the biological functions of AtTCTP were  investigated by using transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtTCTP.  Interestingly, AtTCTP overexpression enhanced drought tolerance in plants. The  expression analysis showed that AtTCTP was expressed in guard cells as well as in  actively growing tissues. Physiological studies of the overexpression lines  showed increased ABA- and calcium-induced stomatal closure ratios and faster  stomatal closing responses to ABA. Furthermore, in vitro protein-protein  interaction analysis confirmed the interaction between AtTCTP and microtubules,  and microtubule cosedimentation assays revealed that the microtubule binding of  AtTCTP increased after calcium treatment. These results demonstrate that the  overexpression of AtTCTP confers drought tolerance to plants by rapid  ABA-mediated stomatal closure via the interaction with microtubules in which  calcium binding enhances the interaction. Collectively, the present results  suggest that the plant TCTP has molecular properties similar to animal TCTPs,  such as tubulin- and calcium-binding, and that it functions in ABA-mediated  stomatal movement, in addition to regulating the growth of plants.', '2012 Jun', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-012-0080-8', 'Kim']
