['12084057', 'The expression of mitochondrial and hydrogenosomal ADP/ATP carriers (AACs) from  plants, rat and the anaerobic chytridiomycete fungus Neocallimastix spec. L2 in  Escherichia coli allows a functional integration of the recombinant proteins into  the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. For AAC1 and AAC2 from rat, apparent Km  values of about 40 microm for ADP, and 105 microm or 140 microm, respectively,  for ATP have been determined, similar to the data reported for isolated rat  mitochondria. The apparent Km for ATP decreased up to 10-fold in the presence of  the protonophore m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (CCCP). The  hydrogenosomal AAC isolated from the chytrid fungus Neocallimastix spec. L2  exhibited the same characteristics, but the affinities for ADP (165 microm) and  ATP (2.33 mm) were significantly lower. Notably, AAC1-3 from Arabidopsis thaliana  and AAC1 from Solanum tuberosum (potato) showed significantly higher external  affinities for both nucleotides (10-22 microm); they were only slightly  influenced by CCCP. Studies on intact plant mitochondria confirmed these  observations. Back exchange experiments with preloaded E. coli cells expressing  AACs indicate a preferential export of ATP for all AACs tested. This is the first  report of a functional integration of proteins belonging to the mitochondrial  carrier family (MCF) into a bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The technique  described here provides a relatively simple and highly reproducible method for  functional studies of individual mitochondrial-type carrier proteins from  organisms that do not allow the application of sophisticated genetic techniques.', '2002 Jul', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02991.x', 'Tjaden']
