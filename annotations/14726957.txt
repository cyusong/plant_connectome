['14726957', 'The eukaryotic RecA homologue Rad51 is a key factor in homologous recombination  and recombinational repair. Rad51-like proteins have been identified from yeast  (Rad55, Rad57 and Dmc1) to vertebrates (Rad51B, Rad51C, Rad51D, Xrcc2, Xrcc3 and  Dmc1). These Rad51-like proteins are all members of the genetic recombination and  DNA damage repair pathways. The sequenced genome of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes  putative homologues of all six vertebrate Rad51-like proteins. We have identified  and characterized an Arabidopsis mutant defective for one of these, AtXRCC3, the  homologue of XRCC3. atxrcc3 plants are sterile, while they have normal vegetative  development. Cytological observation shows that the atxrcc3 mutation does not  affect homologous chromosome synapsis, but leads to chromosome fragmentation  after pachytene, thus disrupting both male and female gametogenesis. This study  shows an essential role for AtXrcc3 in meiosis in plants and possibly in other  higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, atxrcc3 cells and plants are hypersensitive to  DNA-damaging treatments, supporting the involvement of this Arabidopsis  Rad51-like protein in recombinational repair.', '2004 Jan 28', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600055', 'White']
