A key step in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling is the ligand-dependent assembly of a coreceptor complex comprising the F-box protein COI1 and JAZ transcriptional repressors. The assembly of this receptor complex results in proteasome-mediated degradation of JAZ repressors, which in turn bind and repress MYC transcription factors. Many studies on JAZs have been performed in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but the function of JAZs in rice is largely unknown. To systematically reveal the function of OsJAZs, in this study, we compared the various phenotypes resulting from 13 <i>OsJAZs</i> via ectopic expression in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the phenotypes of 12 <i>AtJAZs</i> overexpression (OE) lines. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 25 proteins could be divided into three major groups. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays revealed that most OsJAZ proteins could form homodimers or heterodimers. The statistical results showed that the phenotypes of the <i>OsJAZ</i> OE plants were quite different from those of <i>AtJAZ</i> OE plants in terms of plant growth, development, and immunity. As an example, compared with other <i>JAZ</i> OE plants, <i>OsJAZ11</i> OE plants exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype and enhanced resistance to <i>Pst</i> DC3000. The protein stability after JA treatment of OsJAZ11 emphasized the specific function of the protein. This study aimed to explore the commonalities and characteristics of different JAZ proteins functions from a genetic perspective, and to screen genes with disease resistance value. Overall, the results of this study provide insights for further functional analysis of rice JAZ family proteins.
