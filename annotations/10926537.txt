['10926537', 'The toc1 mutation causes shortened circadian rhythms in light-grown Arabidopsis  plants. Here, we report the same toc1 effect in the absence of light input to the  clock. We also show that TOC1 controls photoperiodic flowering response through  clock function. The TOC1 gene was isolated and found to encode a nuclear protein  containing an atypical response regulator receiver domain and two motifs that  suggest a role in transcriptional regulation: a basic motif conserved within the  CONSTANS family of transcription factors and an acidic domain. TOC1 is itself  circadianly regulated and participates in a feedback loop to control its own  expression.', '2000 Aug 4', 'Science', '10.1126/science.289.5480.768', 'Kay']
