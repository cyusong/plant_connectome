Biological control is a safe way of combating plant diseases using the living organisms. For the precise use of microbial biological control agents, the genetic information on the hypersensitive response (HR), and defense-related gene induction pathways of plants are necessary. Orchids are the most prominent stakeholders of floriculture industry, and owing to their long-awaited flowering pattern, disease control is imperative to allow healthy vegetative growth that spans more than 2 years in most of the orchids. We observed leaf-less flowering in three orchid species (<i>Cymbidium ensifolium</i>, <i>C. goeringii</i> and <i>C. sinense</i>). Using these materials as reference, we performed transcriptome profiling for healthy leaves from non-infected plants to identify genes specifically involved in plant-pathogen interaction pathway. For this pathway, a total of 253 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in <i>C. ensifolium</i>, 189 DEGs were identified in <i>C. goeringii</i> and 119 DEGs were found in <i>C. sinense</i>. These DEGs were mainly related to bacterial secretion systems, FLS2, CNGCs and EFR, regulating HR, stomatal closure and defense-related gene induction. FLS2 (LRR receptor-like serine/threonine kinase) contained the highest number of DEGs among three orchid species, followed by calmodulin. Highly upregulated gene sets were found in <i>C. sinense</i> as compared to other species. The great deal of DEGs, mainly the FLS2 and EFR families, related to defense and immunity responses can effectively direct the future of biological control of diseases for orchids.
