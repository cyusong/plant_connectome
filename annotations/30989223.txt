Cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is maintained through the balance between de novo synthesis and proteolysis. The unfolded/misfolded protein response (UPR) that is triggered by stressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also plays an important role in proteostasis in both plants and animals. Although ER-triggered UPR has been extensively studied in plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial and chloroplastic UPRs are largely uncharacterized despite the fact that these organelles are sites of production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that chloroplasts of the Arabidopsis yellow leaf variegation 2 (var2) mutant, which lacks the metalloprotease FtsH2, accumulate damaged chloroplast proteins and trigger a UPR-like response, namely the accumulation of a suite of chloroplast proteins involved in protein quality control (PQC). These PQC proteins include heat-shock proteins, chaperones, proteases, and ROS detoxifiers. Given that FtsH2 functions primarily in photosystem II proteostasis, the accumulation of PQC-related proteins may balance the FtsH2 deficiency. Moreover, the apparent up-regulation of the cognate transcripts indicates that the accumulation of PQC-related proteins in var2 is probably mediated by retrograde signaling, indicating the occurrence of a UPR-like response in var2.
