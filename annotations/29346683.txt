After quickly touching upon general aspects of strigolactone biology and functions, including structure, synthesis, and perception, this review focuses on the role and regulation of the strigolactone pathway during osmotic stress, in light of the most recent research developments. We discuss available data on organ-specific dynamics of strigolactone synthesis and interaction with abscisic acid in the acclimatization response, with emphasis on the ecophysiological implications of the effects on the stomatal closure process. We highlight the importance of considering roots and shoots separately as well as combined versus individual stress treatments; and of performing reciprocal grafting experiments to work out organ contributions and long-distance signalling events and components under more realistic conditions. Finally, we elaborate on the question of if and how synthetic or natural strigolactones, alone or in combination with crop management strategies such as grafting, hold potential to maximize crop resilience to abiotic stresses.
