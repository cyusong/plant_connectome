After 30 years of intensive work, nitric oxide (NO) has just started to be characterized as a relevant regulatory molecule on plant development and responses to stress. Its reactivity as a free radical determines its mode of action as an inducer of posttranslational modifications of key target proteins through cysteine S-nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration. Many of the NO-triggered regulatory actions are exerted in tight coordination with phytohormone signaling. This review not only summarizes and updates the information accumulated on how NO is synthesized, sensed, and transduced in plants but also makes emphasis on controversies, deficiencies, and misconceptions that are hampering our present knowledge on the biology of NO in plants. The development of noninvasive accurate tools for the endogenous NO quantitation as well as the implementation of genetic approaches that overcome misleading pharmacological experiments will be critical for getting significant advances in better knowledge of NO homeostasis and regulatory actions in plants.
