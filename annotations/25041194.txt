Spathiphyllum wallisii plants were used to study the effect of chilling stress under high illumination on photosynthesis and chlororespiration. Leaves showed different responses that depended on root temperature. When stem, but not root, was chilled, photosystem II (PSII) was strongly photoinhibited. However, when the whole plant was chilled, the maximal quantum yield of PSII decreased only slightly below the normal values and cyclic electron transport was stimulated. Changes were also observed in the chlororespiration enzymes and PGR5. In whole plants chilled under high illumination, the amounts of NADH dehydrogenase (NDH) complex and plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) remained similar to control and increased when only stem was chilled. In contrast, the amount of PGR5 polypeptide was higher in plants when both root and stem were chilled than in plants in which only stem was chilled. The results indicated that the contribution of chlororespiration to regulating photosynthetic electron flow is not relevant when the whole plant is chilled under high light, and that another pathway, such as cyclic electron flow involving PGR5 polypeptide, may be more important. However, when PSII activity is strongly photoinhibited in plants in which only stem is chilled, chlororespiration, together with other routes of electron input to the electron transfer chain, is probably essential.

PGR5 polypeptide: !increases when! root and stem chilled
Chlororespiration: !regulates photosynthetic electron flow when! only stem chilled
Cyclic electron flow: !involves PGR5 polypeptide when! whole plant chilled
