All cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products of their metabolism. In addition to being cytotoxic, ROS act as regulators of a wide range of developmental and physiological processes. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the perception of ROS and initiation of cellular responses in eukaryotes. Using the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we developed a genetic screen for early components of singlet oxygen signaling. Here, we report the identification of a small zinc finger protein, methylene blue sensitivity (MBS), that is required for induction of singlet oxygen-dependent gene expression and, upon oxidative stress, accumulates in distinct granules in the cytosol. Loss-of-function mbs mutants produce singlet oxygen but are unable to fully respond to it at the level of gene expression. Knockout or knockdown of the homologous genes in the higher plant model Arabidopsis thaliana results in mutants that are hypersensitive to photooxidative stress, whereas overexpression produces plants with elevated stress tolerance. Together, our data indicate an important and evolutionarily conserved role of the MBS protein in ROS signaling and provide a strategy for engineering stress-tolerant plants.
