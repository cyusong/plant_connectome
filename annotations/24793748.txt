Studies have demonstrated that photosynthetic limitations and starch degradation are responses to stress; however, the relationship between the two is seldom described in detail. In this article, the effects of salt stress on photosynthesis, the levels of NADPH and total RNA, the starch content and the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and ribulose-5-phosphate kinase (RPK) were evaluated. In thalli that underwent salt treatments, the cyclic electron flow through PSI showed greater stress tolerance than the flow through PSII. Even though the linear electron flow was suppressed by DCMU, the cyclic electron flow still operated. The electron transport rate I (ETRI) increased as the salinity increased when the thalli recovered in seawater containing DCMU. These results suggested that PSI receives electrons from a source other than PSII. Furthermore, the starch content and RPK activity decreased, while the content of NADPH and total RNA, and the activity of G6PDH increased under salt stress. Soluble sugar from starch degradation may enter the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) to produce NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate. Data analysis suggests that NADPH provides electrons for PSI in Ulva prolifera during salt stress, the OPPP participates in the stress response and total RNA is synthesized in excess to assist recovery.
