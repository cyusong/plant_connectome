['21362134', 'LEUNIG (LUG) and LEUNIG_HOMOLOG (LUH) encode two closely related Arabidopsis  proteins, belonging to the Gro/TLE family of transcriptional co-repressors. These  two genes were previously shown to exhibit partially overlapping functions in  embryo and flower development. In this report, the role of both LUH and LUG on  seed mucilage extrusion was examined. Seed mucilage extrusion occurs after the  seeds are imbibed, serving as functional aid in seed hydration, germination, and  dispersal. While luh-1 mutants exhibited strong defects in seed mucilage  extrusion, lug-3 mutants exhibited a minor phenotype in mucilage extrusion.  Further characterization indicates that luh-1 does not exhibit any obvious defect  in seed epidermal cell differentiation, mucilage synthesis, or mucilage  deposition, suggesting a specific role of LUH in mucilage extrusion. This seed  mucilage phenotype of luh-1 is identical to that of mucilage modified 2 (mum2)  mutants. MUM2 encodes a beta-galactosidase required for the modification of the  mucilage. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of RNA  extracted from siliques detected a slight decrease of MUM2 mRNA in the luh-1  mutant compared to the wild type. Together, LUH and possibly LUG may specifically  regulate mucilage extrusion by promoting the expression of genes required for  mucilage maturation.', '2011 May', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2011.01036.x', 'Liu']
