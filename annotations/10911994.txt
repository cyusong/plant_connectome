['10911994', 'Flagellin, the main protein of the bacterial flagella, elicits defence responses  and alters growth in Arabidopsis seedlings. Previously, we identified the FLS1  locus, which confers flagellin insensitivity in Ws-0. To identify additional  components involved in flagellin perception, we screened for flagellin  insensitivity mutants in the flagellin-sensitive accession La-er. Here, we  describe the identification of a new locus, FLS2, by a map-based strategy. The  FLS2 gene is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a putative receptor kinase. FLS2  shares structural and functional homologies with known plant resistance genes and  with components involved in the innate immune system of mammals and insects.', '2000 Jun', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80265-8', 'Boller']
