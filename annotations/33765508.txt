Thioredoxins (Trxs) are implicated in plant development and stress tolerance through redox regulation of target proteins. Trxs of Type h (Trxhs) constitute the largest and the most complicated cluster in the Trx family because of their unknown individual functions. Here, we identified and characterized the Phaseolus vulgaris Trxh family during development, mutualistic interactions and in response to abiotic stress. P. vulgaris (common bean) Trxh gene family (PvTrxh) encompasses 12 isoforms (PvTrxh1-h12), subdivided into 3 groups according to their amino acid sequence features. In silico RNA-seq -based expression analysis showed a differential expression of PvTrxh genes during development. RT-qPCR analysis of PvTrxh genes during nodule organogenesis revealed their highest expression in the nodule primordium (NP). Interestingly, in response to symbiosis, specific PvTrxh isoforms (PvTrxh3 and h5) were found to be highly upregulated compared to mock-inoculated plants. In addition, their expression patterns in the NP positively correlated with the symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixing efficiency of the Rhizobium strain, as revealed by a number of symbiotic efficiency parameters (ARA, leghemoglobin content, biomass, and total soluble proteins), concomitantly with increased amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). On the other hand, distinctive PvTrxh isoforms were found to be upregulated in plant leaves, where H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> amounts were elevated, in response to both salt and drought constraints. When exogenously applied, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upregulated specific PvTrxh isoforms in plant leaves and roots. These findings point to a specific, rather than redundant, function for Trxh proteins in common bean beside the association of distinctive Trxh isoforms with symbiosis and abiotic stress response.
