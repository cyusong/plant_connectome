Citrus canker disease caused by <i>Xanthomonas citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i> is one of the most destructive diseases in citrus. <i>X. citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i> pathotypes display different host ranges. <i>X. citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i> strain A (<i>Xcc</i><sup>A</sup>) causes canker disease in most commercial citrus varieties, whereas strain AW (<i>Xcc</i><sup>AW</sup>), which is genetically similar to <i>Xcc</i><sup>A</sup>, infects only lime and alemow. Understanding the mechanism that determines the host range of pathogens is critical to investigating and utilizing host resistance. We hypothesized that <i>Xcc</i><sup>AW</sup> would undergo mutations in genes that restrict its host range when artificially inoculated into incompatible citrus varieties. To test this hypothesis, we used an experimental evolution approach to identify phenotypic traits and genetic loci associated with the adaptation of <i>Xcc</i><sup>AW</sup> to incompatible sweet orange. Repeated inoculation and reisolation cycles improved the ability of three independent <i>Xcc</i><sup>AW</sup> strains to colonize sweet orange. Adapted <i>Xcc</i><sup>AW</sup> strains displayed increased expression of type III secretion system and effector genes. Genome sequencing analysis indicated that two of the adapted strains harbored mutations in <i>pthAW1</i>, a transcription activator-like effector (TALE) gene, that corresponded to the removal of one or two repeats from the central DNA-binding repeat region. Introduction of the original but not the adapted <i>pthAW1</i> variants into <i>Xcc</i><sup>A</sup> abolished its ability to cause canker symptoms in sweet orange, Meyer lemon, and clementine but not in other <i>Xcc</i><sup>AW</sup>-resistant citrus varieties. The original <i>pthAW1</i>, when expressed in <i>Xcc</i><sup>A</sup>, induced ion leakage and the expression of pathogenesis-related genes but had no effect on <i>CsLOB1</i> expression in sweet orange. Our study has identified a novel host-specific avirulence TALE and demonstrated active adaptive rearrangements of the TALE repeat array during host adaptation.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
