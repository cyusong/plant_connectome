['27601466', 'Ribose can be used for energy or as a component of several important  biomolecules, but for it to be used in either capacity it must first be  phosphorylated by ribokinase (RBSK). RBSK proteins are part of the  phosphofructokinase-B (pfkB) family of carbohydrate kinases. Sequence comparisons  of pfkB proteins from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with the human and  Escherichia coli RBSK identified a single candidate RBSK, At1g17160 (AtRBSK).  AtRBSK is more similar to predicted RBSKs from other plant species and known  mammalian and prokaryotic RBSK than to all other PfkB proteins in Arabidopsis  AtRBSK contains a predicted chloroplast transit peptide, and we confirmed plastid  localization using AtRBSK fused to YFP. Structure prediction software verified  that the AtRBSK sequence mapped onto a known RBSK structure. Kinetic parameters  of purified recombinant AtRBSK were determined to be K(m)(ribose) = 150 mum +/- 17  mum, K(m)(ATP) = 45 mum +/- 5.6 mum, and k(cat) = 2.0 s(-1) Substrate inhibition was  observed for AtRBSK (K(i)(ATP) = 2.44 mm +/- 0.36 mm), as has been demonstrated for  other RBSK proteins. Ribose accumulated in Arabidopsis plants lacking AtRBSK.  Such plants grew normally unless media was supplemented with ribose, which led to  chlorosis and growth inhibition. Both chlorosis and ribose accumulation were  abolished upon the introduction of a transgene expressing AtRBSK-MYC,  demonstrating that the loss of protein is responsible for ribose  hypersensitivity. Ribose accumulation in plants lacking AtRBSK was reduced in  plants also deficient in the nucleoside ribohydrolase NSH1, linking AtRBSK  activity to nucleoside metabolism.', '2016 Oct 21', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M116.754689', 'ORCID:']
