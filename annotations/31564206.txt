In plants dehydration imposed by salinity can invoke physical changes at the interface of the plasma membrane and cell wall. Changes in hydrostatic pressure activate ion channels and cause depolarization of the plasma membrane due to disturbance in ion transport. During the initial phases of salinity stress, the relatively high osmotic potential of the rhizosphere enforces the plant to use a diverse spectrum of strategies to optimize water and nutrient uptake. Signals of salt stress are recognized by specific root receptors that activate an osmosensing network. Plant response to hyperosmotic tension is closely linked to the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channels and interacting proteins such as calmodulin. A rapid rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels occurs within seconds of exposure to salt stress. Plants employ multiple sensors and signaling components to sense and respond to salinity stress, of which most are closely related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing and signaling. Several tolerance strategies such as osmoprotectant accumulation, antioxidant boosting, polyaminses and nitric oxide (NO) machineries are also coordinated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Substantial research has been done to discover the salt stress pathway and tolerance mechanism in plants, resulting in new insights into the perception of salt stress and the downstream signaling that happens in response. Nevertheless, the role of multifunctional components such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> has not been sufficiently addressed in the context of salt stress. In this review, we elaborate that the salt tolerance signaling pathway converges with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in diverse pathways. We summarize knowledge related to different dimensions of salt stress signaling pathways in the cell by emphasizing the administrative role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling on salt perception, signaling, gene expression, ion homeostasis and adaptive responses.
