The functions of nitric oxide (NO) in processes associated with root hair growth in Arabidopsis were analysed. NO is located at high concentrations in the root hair cell files at any stage of development. NO is detected inside of the vacuole in immature actively growing root hairs and, later, NO is localized in the cytoplasm when they become mature. Experiments performed by depleting NO in Arabidopsis root hairs indicate that NO is required for endocytosis, vesicle formation, and trafficking and it is not involved in nucleus migration, vacuolar development, and transvacuolar strands. The Arabidopsis G'4,3 mutant (double mutant nia1/nia2) is severely impaired in NO production and generates smaller root hairs than the wild type (WT). Root hairs from the Arabidopsis G'4,3 mutant show altered vesicular trafficking and are reminiscent of NO-depleted root hairs from the Arabidopsis WT. Interestingly, normal vesicle formation and trafficking as well as root hair growth is restored by exogenous NO application in the Arabidopsis G'4,3 mutant. All together, these results firmly support the essential role played by NO in the Arabidopsis root-hair-growing process.
