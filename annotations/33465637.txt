DEAD-box (DDX) proteins belong to the largest subfamily of RNA helicase SF2, which contributes to all biological processes of RNA metabolism in the plant kingdom. Till now, no significant data are available regarding studies on DDX in Somatic Embryogenesis (SE) of woody plants. It is important to investigate the biological function of the DlDDX family in longan SE. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of 58 longan DEAD-box (DlDDX) genes characterization was performed by genome-wide identification and transcript abundance validation analysis. Homologous evolution has revealed that some DlDDXs in longan had high sequence similarity with Mus musculus, Citrus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that DlDDXs were highly conservative in the animal, plant, and microorganism. Remarkably, gene duplication, purifying selection, and alternative splicing events, and new auxiliary domains have likely contributed to the functional evolution of DlDDX, indicating that DlDDX appeared neofunctionalization in longan. Besides, DlDDX3, 15, 28, 36 might interact with protein complex (MAC3A, MAC3B, CDC5, CBP20) of miRNA biosynthesis. Notably, DlDDX28 contained a novel auxiliary domain (CAF-1 p150), which might contribute to DNA demethylation in longan early SE. 4 DlDDX genes significantly expressed not only in early SE and zygotic embryogenesis (ZE) but also up-regulated at high levels in 'Honghezi' and 'Quanlongbaihe' with abortive seeds, which are of great significance. Moreover, some DlDDXs presented abiotic stress-response dynamic expression patterns by ABA, SA, JA, and NaCl treatments during early SE. Hence, DEAD-box is essential to SE development and seed abortive in longan.
