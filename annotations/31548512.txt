The <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 2</i> (<i>CUC2</i>) gene, which is negatively regulated by <i>microRNA164</i> (<i>miR164</i>), has been specifically linked to the regulation of leaf margin serration and the maintenance of phyllotaxy in model plants. However, few studies have investigated these effects in woody plants. In this study, we integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and physiology approaches to explore the function of <i>BpCUC2</i> gene in <i>Betula pendula</i> growth and development. Our results showed that <i>Betula pendula</i> plants overexpressing <i>BpCUC2</i>, which is targeted by <i>BpmiR164</i>, exhibit shortened internodes and abnormal leaf shapes. Subsequent analysis indicated that the short internodes of <i>BpCUC2</i> overexpressed transgenic lines and were due to decreased epidermal cell size. Moreover, transcriptome analysis, yeast one-hybrid assays, and ChIP-PCR suggested that BpCUC2 directly binds to the LTRECOREATCOR15 (CCGAC), CAREOSREP1 (CAACTC), and BIHD1OS (TGTCA) motifs of a series of IAA-related and cyclin-related genes to regulate expression. These results may be useful to our understanding of the functional role and genetic regulation of <i>BpCUC2</i>.
