Plant peptides secreted as signal molecular to trigger cell-to-cell signaling are indispensable for plant growth and defense processes. Preciously, it is regraded some plant peptides function in plant growth and development, whereas others regulate defense response in plant-microbe interactions. However, this prejudice is got rid due to more and more evidence showed growth-related plant peptides also exhibit bifunctional roles in plant defense response against different microbial pathogens. Here we provide a mini-review of reported types of plant peptides, including their basic information, reported receptor ligands, and especially direct or indirect roles in plant immune responses.
