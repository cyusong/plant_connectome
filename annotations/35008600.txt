Vacuolar invertase (VI) can irreversibly degrade sucrose into glucose and fructose and involve in plants abiotic-stress-tolerance. Cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i> L.) is susceptible to drought stress, especially during the seedling stage. To date, the involvement of VI in drought tolerance in cucumber seedlings is in urgent need of exploration. In the present study, a cucumber vacuolar invertase gene, <i>CsVI2</i>, was isolated and functionally characterized. The results showed that (1) CsVI2 showed vacuolar invertase activity both in vivo and in vitro; (2) the transcript level of <i>CsVI2</i>, along with VI activity, was significantly induced by drought stress. Moreover, the expression of sucrose synthase 3 (<i>CsSUS3</i>) was increased and that of sucrose phosphate synthase 1 (<i>CsSPS1</i>) was decreased after exposure to drought stress, which was followed by an increase in sucrose synthase activity and a decrease in sucrose phosphate synthase activity; (3) <i>CsVI2</i>-overexpressing transformed cucumber seedlings showed enhanced vacuolar invertase activity and drought tolerance and 4) protein-protein interaction modelling indicated that a cucumber invertase inhibitor, CsINVINH3, can interact with CsVI2. In summary, the results indicate that CsVI2 as an invertase can regulate sucrose metabolism and enhance drought stress in cucumber seedlings.
