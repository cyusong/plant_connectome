Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species have emerged as crucial signalling and regulatory molecules across all organisms. In plants, fungi, and fungi-like oomycetes, NO is involved in the regulation of multiple processes during their growth, development, reproduction, responses to the external environment, and biotic interactions. It has become evident that NO is produced and used as a signalling and defence cue by both partners in multiple forms of plant interactions with their microbial counterparts, ranging from symbiotic to pathogenic modes. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of NO in plant-pathogen interactions, focused on biotrophic, necrotrophic, and hemibiotrophic fungi and oomycetes. Actual advances and gaps in the identification of NO sources and fate in plant and pathogen cells are discussed. We review the decisive role of time- and site-specific NO production in germination, oriented growth, and active penetration by filamentous pathogens of the host tissues, as well in pathogen recognition, and defence activation in plants. Distinct functions of NO in diverse interactions of host plants with fungal and oomycete pathogens of different lifestyles are highlighted, where NO in interplay with reactive oxygen species governs successful plant colonization, cell death, and establishment of resistance.
