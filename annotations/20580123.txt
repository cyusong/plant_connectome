['20580123', 'A photosensitive (phs1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana was isolated and  characterized. The PHS1 gene was cloned using a map-based approach. The gene was  found to encode a protein containing a deaminase-reductase domain that is  involved in the riboflavin pathway. The phenotype and growth of the phs1 mutant  were comparable to that of the wild-type when the plants were grown under low  light conditions. When the light intensity was increased, the mutant was  characterized by stunted growth and bleached leaves as well as a decrease in FNR  activity. The NADPH levels declined, whereas the NADP(+) levels increased,  leading to a decrease in the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio. The mutant suffered from severe  photooxidative damage with an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity and a  drastic reduction in the levels of chlorophyll and photosynthetic proteins.  Supplementing the mutant with exogenous FAD rescued the photosensitive phenotype,  even under increasing light intensity. The riboflavin pathway therefore plays an  important role in protecting plants from photooxidative damage.', '2010 Nov 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2010.05.005', 'Zhang']
