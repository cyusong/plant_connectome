Cytidinediphosphate diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) uses phosphatidic acid (PA) and cytidinetriphosphate to produce cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol, an intermediate for phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) synthesis. This study shows that CDS5, one of the five CDSs of the Oryza sativa (rice) genome, has multifaceted effects on plant growth and stress responses. The loss of CDS5 resulted in a decrease in PG and PI levels, defective thylakoid membranes, pale leaves in seedlings and growth retardation. In addition, the loss of CDS5 led to an elevated PA level and enhanced hyperosmotic tolerance. The inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD)-derived PA formation in cds5 restored the hyperosmotic stress tolerance of the mutant phenotype to that of the wild type, suggesting that CDS5 functions as a suppressor in PLD-derived PA signaling and negatively affects hyperosmotic stress tolerance.
