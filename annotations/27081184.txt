Antimicrobial compounds have critical roles in plant immunity; for example, Arabidopsis thaliana and other crucifers deploy phytoalexins and glucosinolate derivatives in defense against pathogens. The pathogen-responsive MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 have essential functions in the induction of camalexin, the major phytoalexin in Arabidopsis. In search of cyanide, a coproduct of ethylene and camalexin biosynthesis, we found that MPK3 and MPK6 also affect the accumulation of extracellular thiocyanate ion derived from the indole glucosinolate (IGS) pathway. Botrytis cinerea infection activates MPK3/MPK6, which promote indole-3-yl-methylglucosinolate (I3G) biosynthesis and its conversion to 4-methoxyindole-3-yl-methylglucosinolate (4MI3G). Gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that MPK3/MPK6 regulate the expression of MYB51 and MYB122, two key regulators of IGS biosynthesis, as well as CYP81F2 and IGMT1/IGMT2, which encode enzymes in the conversion of I3G to 4MI3G, through ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR6 (ERF6), a substrate of MPK3/MPK6. Under the action of PENETRATION2 (PEN2), an atypical myrosinase, and PEN3, an ATP binding cassette transporter, 4MI3G is converted to extracellular unstable antimicrobial compounds, possibly isothiocyanates that can react with nucleophiles and release the stable thiocyanate ion. Recent studies demonstrated the importance of PEN2/PEN3-dependent IGS derivatives in plant immunity. Here, we report that MPK3/MPK6 and their substrate ERF6 promote the biosynthesis of IGSs and the conversion of I3G to 4MI3G, a target of PEN2/PEN3-dependent chemical defenses in plant immunity.
