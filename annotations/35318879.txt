Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>; 1000 ppm) influences developing rice leaf formation, reducing leaf blade length and width as compared to rice grown under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (aCO<sub>2</sub>; 400 ppm). Since micro RNAs (miRNAs) are known to play multiple roles in plant development, we hypothesized that miRNAs might be involved in modulating leaf size under eCO<sub>2</sub> conditions. To identify miRNAs responding to eCO<sub>2</sub>, we profiled miRNA levels in developing rice leaves (P4; plastochron number of the fourth-youngest leaf) under eCO<sub>2</sub> using small RNA-seq. We detected 18 mature miRNA sequences for which expression levels varied more than two-fold between the eCO<sub>2</sub> and aCO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Among them, only miR396e and miR396f significantly differed between the two conditions. Additionally, the expression of <i>growth-regulating factors</i> (<i>GRFs</i>), potential target mRNA of miR396s, were repressed under the eCO<sub>2</sub> condition. We used an antisense oligonucleotide approach to confirm that single-strand DNA corresponding to the miR396e sequence effectively downregulated <i>GRF</i> expression in developing leaves, reducing the leaf blade length, such as for rice grown under eCO<sub>2</sub>. These results suggest that the miR396-<i>GRF</i> module is crucially relevant to controlling rice leaf blade length in eCO<sub>2</sub> environments.
