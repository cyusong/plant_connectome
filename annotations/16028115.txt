Plants exposed to photoinhibitory conditions respond by accumulation of the early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) with a potential photoprotective function. In Arabidopsis thaliana two genes (Elip1 and Elip2) encode for two ELIP proteins: evidence exists that the two genes are differentially regulated but their precise function is unclear. Mutants null for one or the other Elip gene can help in elucidating ELIPs role and here we describe the expression profile of ELIP1 and ELIP2, and the phenotype of such null mutants. Both ELIPs accumulate during greening of etiolated seedlings and in mature plants the transcripts fluctuate diurnally without protein accumulation. Steady-state transcript level of both genes increases in response to high light with transcription of Elip1 much more sensitive than that of Elip2 to increasing irradiation at 22 degrees C. At 4 degrees C instead Elip2 is strongly transcribed even at growing light. Furthermore, only ELIP1 accumulates under high light at 22 degrees C while both proteins accumulate at 4 degrees C. These results indicate the existence of a differential regulation of ELIPs expression in response to light or chilling stress with mechanisms active either at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Phenotypically, the mutants behave as the wild type as far as sensitivity to light- or light and cold-induced short-term photoinhibition, while both ELIPs are necessary to ensure a high rate of chlorophyll accumulation during deetiolation in continuous high light.
