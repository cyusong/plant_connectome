We previously isolated Nicotiana benthamiana matrix metalloprotease 1 (NMMP1) from tobacco leaves. The NMMP1 gene encodes a highly conserved, Zn-containing catalytic protease domain that functions as a factor in the plant's defense against bacterial pathogens. Expression of NMMP1 was strongly induced during interactions between tobacco and one of its pathogens, Phytophthora infestans. To elucidate the role of the NMMP1 in defense of N. benthamiana against fungal pathogens, we performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. NMMP1-overexpressing plants had stronger resistance responses against P. infestans infections than control plants, while silencing of NMMP1 resulted in greater susceptibility of the plants to the pathogen. This greater susceptibility correlated with fewer NMMP1 transcripts than the non-silenced control. We also examined cell death as a measure of disease. The amount of cell death induced by the necrosis-inducing P. infestans protein 1, PiNPP1, was dependent on NMMP1 in N. benthamiana. Potato plants overexpressing NMMP1 also had enhanced disease resistance against P. infestans. RT-PCR analysis of these transgenic potato plants revealed constitutive up-regulation of the potato defense gene NbPR5. NMMP1-overexpressing potato plants were taller and produced heavier tubers than control plants. We suggest a role for NMMP1in pathogen defense and development.
