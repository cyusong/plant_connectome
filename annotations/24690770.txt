Fungal disease resistance breeding, especially for the lineage-exclusion (LEB) is essential to meet the caloric demand of ever-growing population as diseases, especially caused by fungal and fungus-like pathogens are posing a visible and imminent threat to sustainable world food supply. This article provides a fresh perspective on the application of genomics in the LEB.
