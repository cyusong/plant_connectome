There are more than 100 GDSL lipases in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but only a few members have been functionally investigated. Moreover, no reports have ever given a comprehensive analysis of GDSLs in stomatal biology. Here, we systematically investigated the expression patterns of 19 putative <i>Guard-cell-enriched GDSL Lipases</i> (<i>GGLs</i>) at various developmental stages and in response to hormone and abiotic stress treatments. Gene expression analyses showed that these <i>GGLs</i> had diverse expression patterns. Fifteen <i>GGLs</i> were highly expressed in guard cells, with seven preferentially in guard cells. Most GGLs were localized in endoplasmic reticulum, and some were also localized in lipid droplets and nucleus. Some closely homologous <i>GGLs</i> exhibited similar expression patterns at various tissues and in response to hormone and abiotic stresses, or similar subcellular localization, suggesting the correlation of expression pattern and biological function, and the functional redundancy of <i>GGLs</i> in plant development and environmental adaptations. Further phenotypic identification of <i>ggl</i> mutants revealed that <i>GGL7</i>, <i>GGL14</i>, <i>GGL22</i>, and <i>GGL26</i> played unique and redundant roles in stomatal dynamics, stomatal density and morphology, and plant water relation. The present study provides unique resources for functional insights into these GGLs to control stomatal dynamics and development, plant growth, and adaptation to the environment.
