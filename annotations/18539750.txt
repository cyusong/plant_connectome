['18539750', 'Although participation of PEROXIN11 (PEX11), FISSION1 (FISl), and DYNAMIN-RELATED  PROTEIN (DRP) has been well established during induced peroxisome proliferation  in response to external stimuli, their roles in cell cycle-associated  constitutive replication/duplication have not been fully explored. Herein,  bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana  suspension cells revealed homooligomerization of all five PEX11 isoforms  (PEX11a-e) and heterooligomerizations of all five PEX11 isoforms with FIS1b, but  not FIS1a nor DRP3A. Intracellular protein targeting experiments demonstrated  that FIS1b, but not FIS1a nor DRP3A, targeted to peroxisomes only when  coexpressed with PEX11d or PEX11e. Simultaneous silencing of PEX11c-e or  individual silencing of DRP3A, but not FIS1a nor FIS1b, resulted in approximately  40% reductions in peroxisome number. During G2 in synchronized cell cultures,  peroxisomes sequentially enlarged, elongated, and then doubled in number, which  correlated with peaks in PEX11, FIS1, and DRP3A expression. Overall, these data  support a model for the replication of preexisting peroxisomes wherein PEX11c,  PEX11d, and PEX11e act cooperatively during G2 to promote peroxisome elongation  and recruitment of FIS1b to the peroxisome membrane, where DRP3A stimulates  fission of elongated peroxisomes into daughter peroxisomes, which are then  distributed between daughter cells.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.057679', 'Trelease']
