['11439140', 'During their life cycle, higher plants pass through a series of growth phases  that are characterized by the production of morphologically distinct vegetative  and reproductive organs and by different growth patterns. Three major phases have  been described in Arabidopsis: juvenile vegetative, adult vegetative, and  reproductive. In this report we describe a novel, phase-specific mutant in  Arabidopsis, compact inflorescence (cif). The most apparent aspect of the cif  phenotype is a strong reduction in the elongation of internodes in the  inflorescence, resulting in the formation of a floral cluster at the apical end  of all reproductive shoots. Elongation and expansion of adult vegetative rosette  leaves are also compromised in mutant plants. The onset of the cif trait  correlates closely with morphological changes marking the phase transition from  juvenile to adult, and mutant plants produce normal flowers and are fully  fertile. Hence the cif phenotype appears to be adult vegetative phase-specific.  Histological sections of mutant inflorescence internodes indicate normal tissue  specification, but reduced cell elongation compared to wild-type. compact  inflorescence is inherited as a two-gene trait involving the action of a  recessive and a dominant locus. These two cif genes appear to be key components  of a growth regulatory pathway that is closely linked to phase change, and  specifies critical aspects of plant growth and architecture including  inflorescence internode length.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01053.x', 'Sharrock']
