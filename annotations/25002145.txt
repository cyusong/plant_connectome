['25002145', 'DNA methylation patterns are dynamically controlled by DNA methylation and active  DNA demethylation, but the mechanisms of regulation of active DNA demethylation  are not well understood. Through forward genetic screens for Arabidopsis mutants  showing DNA hypermethylation at specific loci and increased silencing of reporter  genes, we identified IDM2 (increased DNA methylation 2) as a regulator of DNA  demethylation and gene silencing. IDM2 dysfunction causes DNA hypermethylation  and silencing of reporter genes and some endogenous genes. These effects of idm2  mutations are similar to those of mutations in IDM1, a regulator of active DNA  demethylation. IDM2 encodes an alpha-crystallin domain protein in the nucleus. IDM2  and IDM1 interact physically and partially colocalize at discrete subnuclear  foci. IDM2 is required for the full activity of H3K18 acetylation but not H3K23  acetylation of IDM1 in planta. Our results suggest that IDM2 functions in active  DNA demethylation and in antisilencing by regulating IDM1.', '2014 Aug 7', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2014.06.008', 'Zhu']
