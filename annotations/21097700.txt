['21097700', 'Posttranslational modification is an important element in circadian clock  function from cyanobacteria through plants and mammals. For example, a number of  key clock components are phosphorylated and thereby marked for subsequent  ubiquitination and degradation. Through forward genetic analysis we demonstrate  that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5; At4g31120) is a critical  determinant of circadian period in Arabidopsis. PRMT5 is coregulated with a set  of 1,253 genes that shows alterations in phase of expression in response to  entrainment to thermocycles versus photocycles in constant temperature. PRMT5  encodes a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that catalyzes the symmetric  dimethylation of arginine residues (Rsme2). Rsme2 modification has been observed  in many taxa, and targets include histones, components of the transcription  complex, and components of the spliceosome. Neither arginine methylation nor  PRMT5 has been implicated previously in circadian clock function, but the period  lengthening associated with mutational disruption of prmt5 indicates that Rsme2  is a decoration important for the Arabidopsis clock and possibly for clocks in  general.', '2010 Dec 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1011987107', 'McClung']
