Autopolyploids often exhibit plant characteristics different from their diploid ancestors and are frequently associated with altered genes expression controlling growth and development. TCP is a unique transcription factor family in plants that is closely related to plant growth and development. Based on transcriptome sequencing of <i>Chrysanthemum nankingense</i>, 23 full-length <i>TCP</i> genes were cloned. The expression of <i>CnTCP9</i> was most variable in tetraploids, at least threefold greater than diploids. Due to the lack of a <i>C. nankingense</i> transgenic system, we overexpressed <i>CnTCP9</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (Col-0) and <i>Chrysanthemum morifolium</i>. Overexpression of <i>CnTCP9</i> caused enlargement of leaves in <i>A. thaliana</i> and petals in <i>C. morifolium</i>, and the expression of genes downstream of the GA pathway in <i>C. morifolium</i> were increased. Our results suggest that autopolyploidization of <i>C. nankingense</i> led to differential expression of TCP family genes, thereby affecting plant characteristics by the GA pathway. This study improves the understanding of enlarged plant size after autopolyploidization.
