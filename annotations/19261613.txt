['19261613', 'Members of the CLC gene family either function as chloride channels or as  anion/proton exchangers. The plant AtClC-a uses the pH gradient across the  vacuolar membrane to accumulate the nutrient NO(3)(-) in this organelle. When  AtClC-a was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it mediated NO(3)(-)/H(+) exchange and  less efficiently mediated Cl(-)/H(+) exchange. Mutating the "gating glutamate"  Glu-203 to alanine resulted in an uncoupled anion conductance that was larger for  Cl(-) than NO(3)(-). Replacing the "proton glutamate" Glu-270 by alanine  abolished currents. These could be restored by the uncoupling E203A mutation.  Whereas mammalian endosomal ClC-4 and ClC-5 mediate stoichiometrically coupled  2Cl(-)/H(+) exchange, their NO(3)(-) transport is largely uncoupled from protons.  By contrast, the AtClC-a-mediated NO(3)(-) accumulation in plant vacuoles  requires tight NO(3)(-)/H(+) coupling. Comparison of AtClC-a and ClC-5 sequences  identified a proline in AtClC-a that is replaced by serine in all mammalian CLC  isoforms. When this proline was mutated to serine (P160S), Cl(-)/H(+) exchange of  AtClC-a proceeded as efficiently as NO(3)(-)/H(+) exchange, suggesting a role of  this residue in NO(3)(-)/H(+) exchange. Indeed, when the corresponding serine of  ClC-5 was replaced by proline, this Cl(-)/H(+) exchanger gained efficient  NO(3)(-)/H(+) coupling. When inserted into the model Torpedo chloride channel  ClC-0, the equivalent mutation increased nitrate relative to chloride  conductance. Hence, proline in the CLC pore signature sequence is important for  NO(3)(-)/H(+) exchange and NO(3)(-) conductance both in plants and mammals.  Gating and proton glutamates play similar roles in bacterial, plant, and  mammalian CLC anion/proton exchangers.', '2009 Apr 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M901170200', 'Jentsch']
