Target of Rapamycin (TOR) regulates multiple growth- and metabolic-related processes in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> as in all other eukaryotes. While several of these processes have been investigated in diverse Arabidopsis growth stages, little is known about hormonal and metabolic regulation of TOR during seed germination. This is mainly due to the fact that Arabidopsis knockout lines of TOR are embryo lethal. Here, we utilized the knockout lines of TOR-interacting protein, <i>REGULATORY-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN OF TOR 1B</i> (<i>RAPTOR1B</i>), to perform comprehensive hormone profiling during seed germination. We previously reported that RAPTOR1B positively regulates seed germination by maintaining the nutritional and hormonal balance. In the current analysis, dry and imbibed seeds as well as germinated seeds were subjected to detailed hormone analysis. Accordingly, the abscisic acid content of dry and imbibed <i>raptor1b</i> seeds was higher than that of WT, while the amounts of gibberellins were comparable after stratification. Further analysis showed that <i>raptor1b</i> seeds maintained higher levels of indole-3-acetic acid and jasmonates, namely jasmonic acid (JA) and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, even after stratification. The combination of this hormonal perturbation seems to be the driving factor for the observed delayed germination phenotypes in <i>raptor1b</i> seeds.
