Peanut is one of the most important oil crops in the world, the growth and productivity of which are severely affected by salt stress. 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) plays an important role in stress resistances. However, the roles of exogenous EBL on the salt tolerance of peanut remain unclear. In this study, peanut seedlings treated with 150 mM NaCl and with or without EBL spray were performed to investigate the roles of EBL on salt resistance. Under 150 mM NaCl conditions, foliar application of 0.1 µM EBL increased the activity of catalase and thereby could eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Similarly, EBL application promoted the accumulation of proline and soluble sugar, thus maintaining osmotic balance. Furthermore, foliar EBL spray enhanced the total chlorophyll content and high photosynthesis capacity. Transcriptome analysis showed that under NaCl stress, EBL treatment up-regulated expression levels of genes encoding peroxisomal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide carrier (<i>PMP34</i>), probable sucrose-phosphate synthase 2 (<i>SPS2</i>) beta-fructofuranosidase (<i>BFRUCT1</i>) and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters (<i>NHX7</i> and <i>NHX8)</i>, while down-regulated proline dehydrogenase 2 (<i>PRODH</i>). These findings provide valuable resources for salt resistance study in peanut and lay the foundation for using BR to enhance salt tolerance during peanut production.
