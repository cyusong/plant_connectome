Programmed cell death (PCD) of epidermal cells that cover adventitious root primordia in deepwater rice (Oryza sativa) is induced by submergence. Early suicide of epidermal cells may prevent injury to the growing root that emerges under flooding conditions. Induction of PCD is dependent on ethylene signaling and is further promoted by gibberellin (GA). Ethylene and GA act in a synergistic manner, indicating converging signaling pathways. Treatment of plants with GA alone did not promote PCD. Treatment with the GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol resulted in increased PCD in response to ethylene and GA presumably due to an increased sensitivity of epidermal cells to GA. Abscisic acid (ABA) was shown to efficiently delay ethylene-induced as well as GA-promoted cell death. The results point to ethylene signaling as a target of ABA inhibition of PCD. Accumulation of ethylene and GA and a decreased ABA level in the rice internode thus favor induction of epidermal cell death and ensure that PCD is initiated as an early response that precedes adventitious root growth.
