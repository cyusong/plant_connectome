The transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development is a critical developmental switch in flowering plants to ensure a successful life cycle. However, while the genes controlling flowering are well-known in model plants, they are less well-understood in crops. In this work, we generated potato lines both silenced and overexpressed for the expression of <i>StBBX24</i>, a clock-controlled gene encoding a B-box protein located in the cytosol and nuclear chromatin fraction. We revealed that <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> lines silenced for <i>StBBX24</i> expression displayed much earlier flowering than wild-type plants. Conversely, plants overexpressing <i>StBBX24</i> mostly did not produce flower buds other than wild-type plants. In addition, RT-qPCR analyses of transgenic silenced lines revealed substantial modifications in the expression of genes functioning in flowering. Furthermore, <i>S. tuberosum</i> lines silenced for <i>StBBX24</i> expression displayed susceptibility to high salinity with a lower capacity of the antioxidant system and strongly decreased expression of genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup> transporters that mediate salt tolerance, contrary to the plants with <i>StBBX24</i> overexpression. Altogether, these data reveal that StBBX24 participates in potato flowering repression and is involved in salt stress response.
