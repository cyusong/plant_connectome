['16359386', 'AtHKT1 is a sodium (Na+) transporter that functions in mediating tolerance to  salt stress. To investigate the membrane targeting of AtHKT1 and its expression  at the translational level, antibodies were generated against peptides  corresponding to the first pore of AtHKT1. Immunoelectron microscopy studies  using anti-AtHKT1 antibodies demonstrate that AtHKT1 is targeted to the plasma  membrane in xylem parenchyma cells in leaves. AtHKT1 expression in xylem  parenchyma cells was also confirmed by AtHKT1 promoter-GUS reporter gene  analyses. Interestingly, AtHKT1 disruption alleles caused large increases in the  Na+ content of the xylem sap and conversely reduced the Na+ content of the phloem  sap. The athkt1 mutant alleles had a smaller and inverse influence on the  potassium (K+) content compared with the Na+ content of the xylem, suggesting  that K+ transport may be indirectly affected. The expression of AtHKT1 was  modulated not only by the concentrations of Na+ and K+ but also by the osmolality  of non-ionic compounds. These findings show that AtHKT1 selectively unloads  sodium directly from xylem vessels to xylem parenchyma cells. AtHKT1 mediates  osmolality balance between xylem vessels and xylem parenchyma cells under saline  conditions. Thus AtHKT1 reduces the sodium content in xylem vessels and leaves,  thereby playing a central role in protecting plant leaves from salinity stress.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02595.x', 'Uozumi']
