Plant mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) appears to be important in photorespiration based on the reverse genetics research from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in recent years, but its roles in plant development have not been completely explored. Here, we identified a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mutant, fern-like, which displays pleiotropic phenotypes including dwarfism, yellowing, curly leaves, and increased axillary buds. Positional cloning and genetic and heterozygous complementation tests revealed that the underlying gene FERN encodes a 3-hydroxyl-ACP dehydratase enzyme involved in mtFAS. FERN was causally involved in tomato morphogenesis by affecting photorespiration, energy supply, and the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species. Based on lipidome data, FERN and the mtFAS pathway may modulate tomato development by influencing mitochondrial membrane lipid composition and other lipid metabolic pathways. These findings provide important insights into the roles and importance of mtFAS in tomato development.
