The OCP is structurally and functionally modular, consisting of a sensor domain, an effector domain and a keto-carotenoid. On photoactivation, the OCP converts from a stable orange form, OCP<sup>O</sup> , to a red form, OCP<sup>R</sup> . Activation is accompanied by a translocation of the carotenoid deeper into the effector domain. The increasing availability of cyanobacterial genomes has enabled the identification of new OCP families (OCP1, OCP2, OCPX). The fluorescence recovery protein (FRP) detaches OCP1 from the PBS core, accelerating its back-conversion to OCP<sup>O</sup> ; by contrast, other OCP families are not regulated by FRP. N-terminal domain homologs, the helical carotenoid proteins (HCPs), have been found among diverse cyanobacteria, occurring as multiple paralogous groups, with two representatives exhibiting strong singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> ) quenching (HCP2, HCP3) and another capable of dissipating PBS excitation (HCP4). Crystal structures are presently available for OCP1 and HCP1, and models of other HCP subtypes can be readily produced as a result of strong sequence conservation, providing new insights into the determinants of carotenoid binding and <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> quenching.
