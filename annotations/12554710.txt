['12554710', 'Mutants sensitive to ionizing radiation in yeast and mammals include an  assortment of DNA repair genes. The majority of these DNA repair genes are  involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In this study a forward  genetic screen is used to identify gamma-sensitive mutants of Arabidopsis  thaliana. The gamma-plantlet screen used here also reveals two general mutant  classes based on size of cotyledons and hypocotyls. One of the mutants discovered  is a homologue of the mammalian nucleotide excision repair gene ERCC1.', '2003 Feb', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erg069', 'Britt']
