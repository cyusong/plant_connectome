There is currently international interest in applying DNA barcoding as a tool for plant species discrimination and identification. In this study, we evaluated the utility of four candidate plant DNA barcoding regions [<i>rbcL</i>, <i>matK</i>, <i>trnL</i>-<i>F</i>, and internal transcribed spacer (<i>ITS</i>)] in seven genera of Gramineae including <i>Agropyron</i>, <i>Bromus</i>, <i>Elymus</i>, <i>Elytrigia</i>, <i>Festuca</i>, <i>Leymus</i>, and <i>Lolium</i>. Fourteen accessions were analyzed, and <i>matK</i> and <i>ITS</i> showed the highest species, subspecies, and variety discriminatory power, each resolving 11 accessions. Species discrimination using <i>rbcL</i> and <i>trnL</i>-<i>F</i> was lower, resolving 7 and 8 accessions, respectively. Subspecies and variety discrimination using <i>rbcL</i> and <i>trnL</i>-<i>F</i> could not identify 4 accessions of <i>Agropyron</i>. A technical system can be established using the proposed DNA barcode to rapidly and reliably identify the seven genera of Gramineae. This study serves as a "useful reference" for identifying the genetic diversity of grass germplasm resources. DNA barcoding can be utilized to uncover the relatives of different species within the same family or between different families. It can also be used to determine the related groups of important herbage, turfgrass, and crops and provide crucial background information for discovering excellent genes and improving existing crop varieties.
