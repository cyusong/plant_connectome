WUSCHEL (WUS) and WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) proteins determine stem cell maintenance for continual plant growth and development under changing environmental conditions. Nutrient availability is an environmental factor that substantially controls plant growth and development. However, how plant stem cell homeostasis is regulated under nutrient deficiency remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) plays an important role in nutrient sensing of stem cells in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Nutrient deficiency induced the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of cytosolic ICDH protein. ICDH can interact with WUS/WOX protein as a complex that further promotes WUS/WOX expression by binding to its promoter. WUS/WOX expression in the icdh-2 mutant was lower than that of wild-type plants under nutrient deficiency. Consistently, loss of ICDH function caused a more serious growth repression under nutrient deficiency that was independent of ICDH's catalytic activity. Therefore, cytosolic ICDH regulates stem cell homeostasis of plants in response to nutrient deficiency.
