['21521696', 'The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the  trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These  proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis  and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for  TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation  as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by  immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high  concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic  stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was  disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the  apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient  protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the  brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting  less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins,  TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data  demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance,  potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or  identity.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.168963', 'Bassham']
