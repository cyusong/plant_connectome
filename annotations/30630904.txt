Yang <i>et al</i> have raised criticism that the results reported by us would not be relevant for natural forests. We argue that productivity is positively related to species richness also in subtropical natural forests, and that both the species pools and the range of tree species richness used in our experiment are representative of many natural forests of this biome.

Species richness: !positively related to! Productivity 
Species pools: !representative of! Natural forests 
Tree species richness: !used in! Experiment
