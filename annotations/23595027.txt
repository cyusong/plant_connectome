['23595027', 'Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6 kinase (ITPK) phosphorylates inositol  1,3,4-trisphosphate to form inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol  1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate which can be finally transferred to inositol  hexaphosphate (IP(6)) and play important roles during plant growth and development.  There are 4 putative ITPK members in Arabidopsis. Expression pattern analysis  showed that ITPK2 is constitutively expressed in various tissues. A T-DNA  knockout mutant of ITPK2 was identified and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  analysis showed that the epidermis structure of seed coat was irregularly formed  in seeds of itpk2-1 mutant, resulting in the increased permeability of seed coat  to tetrazolium salts. Further analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass  spectrometry of lipid polyester monomers in cell wall confirmed a dramatic  decrease in composition of suberin and cutin, which relate to the permeability of  seed coat and the formation of which is accompanied with seed coat development.  These results indicate that ITPK2 plays an essential role in seed coat  development and lipid polyester barrier formation.', '2013 Jul', 'Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)', '10.1093/abbs/gmt039', 'Xue']
