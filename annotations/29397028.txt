CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from stems (CO<sub>2_stem</sub> ) accounts for a substantial fraction of tropical forest gross primary productivity, but the climate sensitivity of this flux remains poorly understood. We present a study of tropical forest CO<sub>2_stem</sub> from 215 trees across wet and dry seasons, at the world's longest running tropical forest drought experiment site. We show a 27% increase in wet season CO<sub>2_stem</sub> in the droughted forest relative to a control forest. This was driven by increasing CO<sub>2_stem</sub> in trees 10-40 cm diameter. Furthermore, we show that drought increases the proportion of maintenance to growth respiration in trees > 20 cm diameter, including large increases in maintenance respiration in the largest droughted trees, > 40 cm diameter. However, we found no clear taxonomic influence on CO<sub>2_stem</sub> and were unable to accurately predict how drought sensitivity altered ecosystem scale CO<sub>2_stem</sub> , due to substantial uncertainty introduced by contrasting methods previously employed to scale CO<sub>2_stem</sub> fluxes. Our findings indicate that under future scenarios of elevated drought, increases in CO<sub>2_stem</sub> may augment carbon losses, weakening or potentially reversing the tropical forest carbon sink. However, due to substantial uncertainties in scaling CO<sub>2_stem</sub> fluxes, stand-scale future estimates of changes in stem CO<sub>2</sub> emissions remain highly uncertain.
