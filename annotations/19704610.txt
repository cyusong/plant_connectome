In the auxin signal transduction, two protein families, Aux/IAAs and auxin response factors, play a crucial role just downstream of auxin F-box receptors. Distinct and overlapping phenotypes of the dominant Aux/IAA mutants suggest some functional differentiation of the Aux/IAA genes in auxin signaling. Taking advantage of unique phenotypes of the msg2/iaa19 mutants, we carried out promoter-exchange experiments, where cDNA of the msg2, axr2/iaa7 or slr/iaa14 gene was driven by the MSG2 or AXR2 promoter. The cDNAs were translationally fused to the green fluorescent protein gene to measure levels of expressed protein. Results showed that many abnormal phenotypes of the dominant Aux/IAA mutants were governed by their promoter activity, but some were dependent on their gene products. The latter result highlights the possible importance of Aux/IAA protein level controled by auxin F-box receptors.
