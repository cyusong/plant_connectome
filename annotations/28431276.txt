Sorghum plants grown with 5mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> showed symptoms of stress, such as reduced growth and photosynthesis, leaf chlorosis, and reddish roots. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity, by supplying carbon skeletons for ammonium assimilation, plays a pivotal role in tolerance to ammonium stress. This work investigated the effect of ammonium nutrition on PPC and PPCK gene expression, on PEPC activity, and on post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PEPC in leaves and roots of sorghum plants. Ammonium increased PEPC kinase (PEPCk) activity and the phosphorylation state of PEPC in leaves, both in light and in the dark, due to increased PPCK1 expression in leaves. This result resembled the effect of salinity on sorghum leaf PEPC and PEPCk, which is thought to allow a better functioning of PEPC in conditions that limit the income of reduced C. In roots, ammonium increased PEPC activity and the amount of monoubiquitinated PEPC. The first effect was related to increased PPC3 expression in roots. These results highlight the relevance of this specific isoenzyme (PPC3) in sorghum responses to ammonium stress. Although the role of monoubiquitination is not fully understood, it also increased in germinating seeds along with massive mobilization of reserves, a process in which the anaplerotic function of PEPC is of major importance.
