Plants have evolved two major ways to deal with nearby vegetation or shade: avoidance and tolerance. Moreover, some plants respond to shade in different ways; for example, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) undergoes an avoidance response to shade produced by vegetation, but its close relative <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> tolerates shade. How plants adopt opposite strategies to respond to the same environmental challenge is unknown. Here, using a genetic strategy, we identified the <i>C. hirsuta slender in shade1</i> mutants, which produce strongly elongated hypocotyls in response to shade. These mutants lack the phytochrome A (phyA) photoreceptor. Our findings suggest that <i>C. hirsuta</i> has evolved a highly efficient phyA-dependent pathway that suppresses hypocotyl elongation when challenged by shade from nearby vegetation. This suppression relies, at least in part, on stronger phyA activity in <i>C. hirsuta</i>; this is achieved by increased <i>ChPHYA</i> expression and protein accumulation combined with a stronger specific intrinsic repressor activity. We suggest that modulation of photoreceptor activity is a powerful mechanism in nature to achieve physiological variation (shade tolerance versus avoidance) for species to colonize different habitats.
