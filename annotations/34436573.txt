Significant variation in epidermal bladder cell (EBC) density and salt tolerance (ST) exists amongst quinoa accessions, suggesting that salt sequestration in EBCs is not the only mechanism conferring ST in this halophyte. In order to reveal other traits that may operate in tandem with salt sequestration in EBCs and whether these additional tolerance mechanisms acted mainly at the root or shoot level, two quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) accessions with contrasting ST and EBC densities (Q30, low ST with high EBC density versus Q68, with high ST and low EBC density) were studied. The results indicate that responses in roots, rather than in shoots, contributed to the greater ST in the accession with low EBC density. In particular, the tolerant accession had improved root plasma membrane integrity and K+ retention in the mature root zone in response to salt. Furthermore, superior ST in the tolerant Q68 was associated with faster and root-specific H2O2 accumulation and reactive oxygen species-induced K+ and Ca2+ fluxes in the root apex within 30 min after NaCl application. This was found to be associated with the constitutive up-regulation of the membrane-localized receptor kinases regulatory protein FERONIA in the tolerant accession. Taken together, this study shows that differential root signalling events upon salt exposure are essential for the halophytic quinoa; the failure to do this limits quinoa adaptation to salinity, independently of salt sequestration in EBCs.
