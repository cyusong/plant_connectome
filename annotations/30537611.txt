Post-germination plant growth depends on the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, spatiotemporal pH changes and Ca<sup>+2</sup> homeostasis, whose potential integration has been studied during Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek root growth. The dissipation of proton (H<sup>+</sup>) gradients across plasma membrane (PM) by CCCP (protonophore) and the inhibition of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by sodium orthovanadate repressed SOD (superoxide dismutase; EC 1.15.1.1) activity as revealed by spectrophotometric and native PAGE assay results. Similar results derived from treatment with DPI (NADPH oxidase inhibitor) and Tiron (O<sub>2</sub>- scavenger) denote a functional synchronization of SOD, PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and NOX, as the latter two enzymes are substrate sources for SOD (H<sup>+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub>-, respectively) and are involved in a feed-forward loop. After SOD inactivation, a decline in apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content was observed in each treatment group, emerging as a possible cause of the diminution of class III peroxidase (Prx; EC 1.11.1.7), which utilizes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a substrate. In agreement with the pivotal role of Ca<sup>+2</sup> in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and NOX activation, Ca<sup>+2</sup> homeostasis antagonists, i.e., LaCl<sub>3</sub> (Ca<sup>+2</sup> channel inhibitor), EGTA (Ca<sup>+2</sup> chelator) and LiCl (endosomal Ca<sup>+2</sup> release blocker), inhibited both SOD and Prx. Finally, a drastic reduction in apoplastic OH (hydroxyl radical) concentrations (induced by each treatment, leading to Prx inhibition) was observed via fluorometric analysis. A consequential inhibition of root growth observed under each treatment denotes the importance of the orchestrated functioning of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, NOX, Cu-Zn SOD and Prx during root growth. A working model demonstrating postulated enzymatic synchronization with an intervening role of Ca<sup>+2</sup> is proposed.
