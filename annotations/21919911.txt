We studied the seasonal fluctuation of soil respiration (R(S)), and its root-dependent (R(R)) and basal (R(B)) components, in a Vitis vinifera (Chardonnay) vineyard. The R(S) components were estimated through independent field methods (y-intercept and trenching) and modeled on the basis of a Q(10) response to soil temperature, and fine and coarse root respiration coefficients. The effect of assimilate availability on R(R) was assessed through a trunk girdling treatment. The apparent Q(10) for R(R) was twice that of R(B) (3.5 vs 1.6) and increased linearly with increasing vine root biomass. The fastest R(R) of fine roots was during rapid fruit growth and the fastest R(R) of coarse roots was immediately following fruit development. R(S) was estimated at 32.6 kg ha(-1) d(-1) (69% as a result of R(R) ) for the hottest month and at 7.6 kg ha(-1) d(-1) (18% as a result of R(R)) during winter dormancy. Annual R(S) was low compared with other natural and cultivated ecosystems: 5.4 Mg ha(-1) (46% as a result of R(R)). Our estimates of annual vineyard R(S) are the first for any horticultural crop and suggest that the assumption that they are similar to those of annual crops or forest trees might lead to an overestimation.
