['26546446', 'Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived phytohormones that control many  aspects of plant development, including shoot branching, leaf shape, stem  secondary thickening, and lateral root growth. In rice (Oryza sativa), SL  signaling requires the degradation of DWARF53 (D53), mediated by a complex  including D14 and D3, but in Arabidopsis thaliana, the components and mechanism  of SL signaling involving the D3 ortholog MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) are  unknown. Here, we show that SL-dependent regulation of shoot branching in  Arabidopsis requires three D53-like proteins, SUPPRESSOR OF MORE AXILLARY  GROWTH2-LIKE6 (SMXL6), SMXL7, and SMXL8. The smxl6 smxl7 smxl8 triple mutant  suppresses the highly branched phenotypes of max2 and the SL-deficient mutant  max3. Overexpression of a mutant form of SMXL6 that is resistant to SL-induced  ubiquitination and degradation enhances shoot branching. Exogenous application of  the SL analog rac-GR24 causes ubiquitination and degradation of SMXL6, 7, and 8;  this requires D14 and MAX2. D53-like SMXLs form complexes with MAX2 and  TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEIN2 (TPR2) and interact with D14 in a GR24-responsive  manner. Furthermore, D53-like SMXLs exhibit TPR2-dependent transcriptional  repression activity and repress the expression of BRANCHED1. Our findings reveal  that in Arabidopsis, D53-like SMXLs act with TPR2 to repress transcription and so  allow lateral bud outgrowth but that SL-induced degradation of D53-like proteins  activates transcription to inhibit outgrowth.', '2015 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00605', 'ORCID:']
