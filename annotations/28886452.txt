Polyamines (PAs) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the product of PA oxidation by polyamine oxidase (PAO), are potential players affecting plant growth, development and responses to abiotic/biotic stresses. Genetically modified Nicotiana tabacum plants with altered PA/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> homeostasis due to over/underexpression of the ZmPAO gene (S-ZmPAO/AS-ZmPAO, respectively) were assessed under heat stress (HS). Underexpression of ZmPAO correlates with increased thermotolerance of the photosynthetic machinery and improved biomass accumulation, accompanied by enhanced levels of the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, whereas ZmPAO overexpressors exhibit significant impairment of thermotolerance. These data provide important clues on PA catabolism/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/thermotolerance, which merit further exploitation.
