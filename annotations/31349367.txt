Plants endure challenging environments in which they are constantly threatened by diverse pathogens. The soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae is a devastating pathogen affecting many plant species including cotton, in which it significantly reduces crop yield and fiber quality. Melatonin involvement in plant immunity to pathogens has been reported, but the mechanisms of melatonin-induced plant resistance are unclear. In this study, the role of melatonin in enhancing cotton resistance to V. dahliae was investigated. At the transcriptome level, exogenous melatonin increased the expression of genes in phenylpropanoid, mevalonate (MVA), and gossypol pathways after V. dahliae inoculation. As a result, lignin and gossypol, the products of these metabolic pathways, significantly increased. Silencing the serotonin N-acetyltransferase 1 (GhSNAT1) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (GhCOMT) melatonin biosynthesis genes compromised cotton resistance, with reduced lignin and gossypol levels after V. dahliae inoculation. Exogenous melatonin pre-treatment prior to V. dahliae inoculation restored the level of cotton resistance reduced by the above gene silencing effects. Melatonin levels were higher in resistant cotton cultivars than in susceptible cultivars after V. dahliae inoculation. The findings indicate that melatonin affects lignin and gossypol synthesis genes in phenylpropanoid, MVA, and gossypol pathways, thereby enhancing cotton resistance to V. dahliae.
