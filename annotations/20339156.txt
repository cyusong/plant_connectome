Potassium (K(+)) is one of the essential macronutrients for plant growth and development. However, K(+) content in soils is usually limited so that the crop yields are restricted. Plants may adapt to K(+)-deficient environment by adjusting their physiological and morphological status, indicating that plants may have evolved their sensing and signaling mechanisms in response to K(+)-deficiency. This short review particularly discusses some components as possible sensors or signal transducers involved in plant sensing and signaling in response to K(+)-deficiency, such as K(+) channels and transporters, H(+)-ATPase, some cytoplasmic enzymes, etc. Possible involvement of Ca²(+) and ROS signals in plant responses to K(+)-deficiency is also discussed.
