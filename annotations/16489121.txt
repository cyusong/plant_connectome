['16489121', 'Precise control of gene expression is critical for embryo development in both  animals and plants. We report that Arabidopsis thaliana GLUTAMINE-RICH PROTEIN23  (GRP23) is a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein that functions as a potential  regulator of gene expression during early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.  Loss-of-function mutations of GRP23 caused the arrest of early embryo  development. The vast majority of the mutant embryos arrested before the 16-cell  dermatogen stage, and none of the grp23 embryos reached the heart stage. In  addition, 19% of the mutant embryos displayed aberrant cell division patterns.  GRP23 encodes a polypeptide with a Leu zipper domain, nine PPRs at the N  terminus, and a Gln-rich C-terminal domain with an unusual WQQ repeat. GRP23 is a  nuclear protein that physically interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit III in  both yeast and plant cells. GRP23 is expressed in developing embryos up to the  heart stage, as revealed by beta-glucuronidase reporter gene expression and RNA  in situ hybridization. Together, our data suggest that GRP23, by interaction with  RNA polymerase II, likely functions as a transcriptional regulator essential for  early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039495', 'Yang']
