Mosaic viral diseases affect sugarcane productivity worldwide. Mining disease resistance-associated molecular markers or genes is a key component of disease resistance breeding programs. In the present study, 285 F<sub>1</sub> progeny were produced from a cross between Yuetang 93-159, a moderately resistant variety, and ROC22, a highly susceptible variety. The mosaic disease symptoms of these progenies, with ROC22 as the control, were surveyed by natural infection under 11 different environmental conditions in the field and by artificial infections with a mixed <i>sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) and <i>sorghum mosaic virus</i> (SrMV) inoculum. Analysis of consolidated survey data enabled the identification of 29 immune, 55 highly resistant, 70 moderately resistant, 62 susceptible, and 40 highly susceptible progenies. The disease response data and a high-quality SNP genetic map were used in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The results showed that the correlation coefficients (0.26~0.91) between mosaic disease resistance and test environments were significant (<i>p</i>< 0.001), and that mosaic disease resistance was a highly heritable quantitative trait (<i>H<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.85). Seven mosaic resistance QTLs were located to the SNP genetic map, each QTL accounted for 3.57% ~ 17.10% of the phenotypic variation explained (PVE). Furthermore, 110 pathogen response genes and 69 transcription factors were identified in the QTLs interval. The expression levels of nine genes (<i>Soffic.07G0015370-1P</i>, <i>Soffic.09G0015410-2T</i>, <i>Soffic.09G0016460-1T</i>, <i>Soffic.09G0016460-1P</i>, <i>Soffic.09G0017080-3C</i>, <i>Soffic.09G0018730-3P</i>, <i>Soffic.09G0018730-3C</i>, <i>Soffic.09G0019920-3C</i> and <i>Soffic.03G0019710-2C</i>) were significantly different between resistant and susceptible progenies, indicating their key roles in sugarcane resistance to SCMV and SrMV infection. The seven QTLs and nine genes can provide a certain scientific reference to help sugarcane breeders develop varieties resistant to mosaic diseases.
