Ureidoglycolate is an intermediate in the degradation of the ureides, allantoin and allantoate, found in many organisms. In some leguminous plant species these compounds are used to transport recently fixed nitrogen in the root nodules to the aerial parts of the plant. In the present study, it was demonstrated that purified ureidoglycolases from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) do not produce glyoxylate, and can use phenylhydrazine as a substrate with K(m) values of 4.0 mM and 8.5 mM, respectively. Furthermore, these enzymes catalyse the transfer of the ureidoglycolyl group to phenylhydrazine to produce ureidoglycolyl phenylhydrazide, which degrades non-enzymatically to glyoxylate phenylhydrazone and urea. This supports their former classification as ureidoglycolate urea-lyases. The enzymatic reaction catalysed by the characterized ureidoglycolases uncovered here can be viewed as a novel type of phenylhydrazine ureidoglycolyl transferase. The implications of these findings for ureide metabolism in legume nitrogen metabolism are discussed.
