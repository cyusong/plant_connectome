Mangroves are salt-tolerant plant species that grow in coastal saline water and are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. In this study, we de novo assembled and functionally annotated the transcriptome of <i>Rhizophora stylosa</i>, the widely distributed mangrove from the largest mangrove family (Rhizophoraceae). The final transcriptome consists of 200,491 unigenes with an average length, and N50 of 912.7 and 1334 base pair, respectively. We then compared the genome-wide expression profiles between the two morphologically distinct natural populations of this species growing under different levels of salinity depending on their distance from the ocean. Among the 200,491 unigenes, 40,253 were identified as differentially expressed between the two populations, while 15,741 and 24,512 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Functional annotation assigned thousands of upregulated genes in saline environment to the categories related to abiotic stresses such as response to salt-, osmotic-, and oxidative-stress. Validation of those genes may contribute to a better understanding of adaptation in mangroves species. This study reported, for the first time, the transcriptome of <i>R. stylosa</i>, and the dynamic of it in response to salt stress and provided a valuable resource for elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the salt stress response in mangroves and other plants that live under stress.
