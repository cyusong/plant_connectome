We describe a highly efficient in vivo DNA assembly method, multiple-round in vivo site-specific assembly (MISSA), which facilitates plant multiple-gene transformation. MISSA is based on conjugational transfer, which is driven by donor strains, and two in vivo site-specific recombination events, which are mediated by inducible Cre recombinase and phage lambda site-specific recombination proteins in recipient strains, to enable in vivo transfer and in vivo assembly of multiple transgenic DNA. The assembly reactions can be performed circularly and iteratively through alternate use of the two specially designed donor vectors. As proof-of-principle experiments, we constructed a few plant multigene binary vectors. One of these vectors was generated by 15 rounds of MISSA reactions and was confirmed in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). As MISSA simplifies the tedious and time-consuming in vitro manipulations to a simple mixing of bacterial strains, it will greatly save time, effort, and expense associated with the assembly of multiple transgenic or synthetic DNA. The principle that underlies MISSA is applicable to engineering polygenic traits, biosynthetic pathways, or protein complexes in all organisms, such as Escherichia coli, yeast, plants, and animals. MISSA also has potential applications in synthetic biology, whether for basic theory or for applied biotechnology, aiming at the assembly of genetic pathways for the production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and industrial compounds from natural or synthetic DNA.
