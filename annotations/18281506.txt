['18281506', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] functions as a  site-specific signal on membranes to promote cytoskeletal reorganization and  membrane trafficking. Localization of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to apices of growing root  hairs and pollen tubes suggests that it plays an important role in tip growth.  However, its regulation and mode of action remain unclear. We found that  Arabidopsis thaliana PIP5K3 (for Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate 5-Kinase 3)  encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, a key enzyme producing  PtdIns(4,5)P2, that is preferentially expressed in growing root hairs. T-DNA  insertion mutations that substantially reduced the expression of PIP5K3 caused  significantly shorter root hairs than in the wild type. By contrast,  overexpression caused longer root hairs and multiple protruding sites on a single  trichoblast. A yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion of PIP5K3, driven by the  PIP5K3 promoter, complemented the short-root-hair phenotype. PIP5K3-YFP localized  to the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic space of elongating root hair apices, to  growing root hair bulges, and, notably, to sites about to form root hair bulges.  The signal was greatest in rapidly growing root hairs and quickly disappeared  when elongation ceased. These results provide evidence that PIP5K3 is involved in  localizing PtdIns(4,5)P2 to the elongating root hair apex and is a key regulator  of the machinery that initiates and promotes root hair tip growth.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056119', 'Aoyama']
