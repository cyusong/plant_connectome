Citrus plants are a highly mycotrophic species with high levels of fungal colonization. <i>Citrus aurantium</i> rootstocks typically show abundant root colonization by <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> three weeks after inoculation. Mycorrhizal symbiosis protects plants against multiple biotic stressors, however, such protection against spider mites remains controversial. We examined mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR) in citrus against the two-spotted spider mite <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>. Mycorrhized <i>C. aurantium</i> displayed reduced levels of damage in leaves and lower mite oviposition rates, compared to non-mycorrhized controls. Mycorrhization did not affect host choice of mites in Y-tube assays; of note, <i>C. aurantium</i> has innate strong antixenotic resistance against this mite. Analysis of metabolism pathways in mycorrhized citrus plants showed upregulated expression of the oxylipin-related genes <i>LOX-2</i> and <i>PR-3</i> early after infestation. Accordingly, jasmonic acid (JA), 12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA), and JA-Ile concentrations were increased by mycorrhization. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis revealed the amino acid, oxocarboxylic acid, and phenylpropanoid metabolism as the three major pathways with more hits at 24 h post infection (hpi) in mycorrhized plants. Interestingly, there was a transition to a priming profile of these pathways at 48 hpi following infestation. Three flavonoids (i.e., malic acid, coumaric acid, and diconiferyl alcohol) were among the priming compounds. A mixture containing all these compounds provided efficient protection against the mite. Unexpectedly, systemic resistance did not improve after 72 h of primary infestation, probably due to the innate strong systemic resistance of <i>C. aurantium</i>. This is the first study to show that MIR is functional against <i>T. urticae</i> in locally infested citrus leaves, which is mediated by a complex pool of secondary metabolites and is likely coordinated by priming of JA-dependent responses.
