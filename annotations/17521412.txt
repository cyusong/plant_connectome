['17521412', 'Methionine-derived glucosinolates belong to a class of plant secondary  metabolites that serve as chemoprotective compounds in plant biotic defense  reactions and also exhibit strong anticancerogenic properties beneficial to human  health. In a screen for the trans-activation potential of various transcription  factors toward glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, we could identify the HAG1 (HIGH  ALIPHATIC GLUCOSINOLATE 1, also referred to as MYB28) gene as a positive  regulator of aliphatic methionine-derived glucosinolates. The content of  aliphatic glucosinolates as well as transcript levels of aliphatic glucosinolate  biosynthetic genes were elevated in gain-of-function mutants and decreased in  HAG1 RNAi knock-down mutants. Pro(HAG1):GUS expression analysis revealed strong  HAG1 promoter activity in generative organs and mature leaves of A. thaliana  plants, the main sites of accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates. Mechanical  stimuli such as touch or wounding transiently induced HAG1/MYB28 expression in  inflorescences of flowering plants, and HAG1/MYB28 over-expression reduced insect  performance as revealed by weight gain assays with the generalist lepidopteran  herbivore Spodoptera exigua. Expression of HAG1/MYB28 was significantly induced  by glucose, indicating a novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism for the  integration of carbohydrate availability upon biotic challenge. We hypothesize  that HAG1/MYB28 is a novel regulator of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis that  controls the response to biotic challenges.', '2007 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03133.x', 'Flugge']
