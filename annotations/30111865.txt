['30111865', 'Resolving functions of closely linked genes is challenging or nearly impossible  with classical genetic tools. Four members of the Catharanthus roseus  receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) family are clustered on Arabidopsis  chromosome five. To resolve the potentially redundant functions of this subclass  of CrRLK1Ls named MEDOS1 to 4 (MDS1 to 4), we generated a single CRISPR/Cas9  transformation vector using a Golden Gate based cloning system to target all four  genes simultaneously. We introduce single mutations within and deletions between  MDS genes as well as knock-outs of the whole 11 kb gene cluster. The large MDS  cluster deletion was inherited in up to 25% of plants lacking the CRISPR/Cas9  construct in the T2 generation. In contrast to described phenotypes of already  characterized CrRLK1L mutants, quadruple mds knock-outs were fully fertile,  developed normal root hairs and trichomes and responded to pharmacological  inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis similar to wildtype. Recently, we  demonstrated the role of four CrRLK1L in growth adaptation to metal ion stress.  Here we show the involvement of MDS genes in response to Ni(2+) during hypocotyl  elongation and to Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) during root growth. Our finding supports the  model of an organ specific network of positively and negatively acting CrRLK1Ls.', '2018 Aug 15', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-018-30711-3', 'ORCID:']
