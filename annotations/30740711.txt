Organic acids are important components of overall fruit quality through flavor, taste, nutritional and medicinal values. Pollinated fig (Ficus carica L.) fruit quality is enhanced by increased acidity. We quantified the major organic acids and characterized the expression pattern of organic acid metabolic pathway-related genes in the reproductive part - inflorescence and non-reproductive part - receptacle of parthenocarpic and pollinated fig fruit during ripening. Essentially, pollinated fruit contains seeds in the inflorescence, as opposed to no seeds in the parthenocarpic inflorescence. The major organic acids - citrate and malate - were found in relatively high quantities in the inflorescence compared to the receptacle of both parthenocarpic and pollinated fig fruit. Notably, pollination increased citric acid content significantly in both inflorescence and receptacle. Genes related to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, citrate catabolism and glyoxylate cycle were identified in fig fruit. Expression levels of most of these genes were higher in inflorescences than in receptacles. In particular, FcPEPC and FcFUM (encoding fumarase) had significantly higher expression in the inflorescence of pollinated fruit. Most importantly, expression of the glyoxylate cycle genes FcMLS and FcICL (encoding malate synthase and isocitrate lyase, respectively) was induced to strikingly high levels in the inflorescence by pollination, and their expression level was highly positively correlated with the contents of all organic acids. Therefore, the glyoxylate cycle may be responsible for altering the accumulation of organic acids to upgrade the fruit taste during ripening, especially in the pollinated, seeded inflorescence.
