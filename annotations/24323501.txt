In addition to their role as a source of reduced carbon, sugars may directly or indirectly control a wide range of activities in plant cells, through transcriptional and post-translational regulation. This control has been studied in detail using Arabidopsis thaliana, where genetic analysis offers many possibilities. Much less is known about perennial woody species. For several years, various aspects of sugar sensing and signalling have been investigated in the grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berry, an organ that accumulates high concentrations of hexoses in the vacuoles of flesh cells. Here we review various aspects of this topic: the molecular basis of sugar transport and its regulation by sugars in grapevine; the functional analysis of several sugar-induced genes; the effects of some biotic and abiotic stresses on the sugar content of the berry; and finally the effects of exogenous sugar supply on the ripening process in field conditions. A picture of complex feedback and multiprocess regulation emerges from these data.
