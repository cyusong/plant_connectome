The plant cell wall is an extracellular matrix that envelopes cells, gives them structure and shape, constitutes the interface with symbionts, and defends plants against external biotic and abiotic stress factors. The assembly of this matrix is regulated and mediated by the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal elements define where new cell wall material is added and how fibrillar macromolecules are oriented in the wall. Inversely, the cytoskeleton is also key in the perception of mechanical cues generated by structural changes in the cell wall as well as the mediation of intracellular responses. We review the delivery processes of the cell wall precursors that are required for the cell wall assembly process and the structural continuity between the inside and the outside of the cell. We provide an overview of the different morphogenetic processes for which cell wall assembly is a crucial element and elaborate on relevant feedback mechanisms.
