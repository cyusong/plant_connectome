Phloem and xylem tissues are necessary for the allocation of nutrients and photoassimilates. However, how the long-distance transport of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) is coordinated with the central metabolism is largely unknown. To better understand how the genetic and environmental factors influence C and N transport, we analysed the metabolite profiles of phloem exudates and xylem saps of five Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown in low or non-limiting N supply. We observed that xylem saps were composed of 46 or 56% carbohydrates, 27 or 45% amino acids, and 5 or 13% organic acids in low or non-limiting N supply, respectively. In contrast, phloem exudates were composed of 76 or 86% carbohydrates, 7 or 18% amino acids, and 5 or 6% organic acids. Variation in N supply impacted amino acid, organic acid and sugar contents. When comparing low N and non-limiting N, the most striking differences were variations of glutamine, aspartate, and succinate abundance in the xylem saps and citrate and fumarate abundance in phloem exudates. In addition, we observed a substantial variation of metabolite content between genotypes, particularly under high N. The content of several organic acids, such as malate, citrate, fumarate, and succinate was affected by the genotype alone or by the interaction between genotype and N supply. This study confirmed that the response of the transport of nutrients in the phloem and the xylem to N availability is associated with the regulation of the central metabolism and could be an adaptive trait.
