To characterize the function of salicylic acid (SA) in acquired thermotolerance, the effects of heat shock (HS) on wild-type and sid2 (for SA induction deficient 2) was investigated. After HS treatment, the survival ratio of sid2 mutant was lower than that of wild-type. However, pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rescued the sid2 heat sensitivity. HsfA2 is a key component of acquired thermotolerance in Arabidopsis. The expression of HsfA2 induced by SA was highest among those of heat-inducible Hsfs (HsfA2, HsfA7a, HsfA3, HsfB1, and HsfB2) in response to HS. Furthermore, the application of AsA, an H2O2 scavenger, significantly reduced the expression level of HsfA2 induced by SA. Although SA enhanced the survival of sid2 mutant, no significant effect on the hsfA2 mutant was observed, suggesting that HsfA2 is responsible for SA-induced acquired thermotolerance as a downstream factor. Further, real-time PCR analysis revealed that after HS treatment, SA also up-regulated mRNA transcription of HS protein (Hsp) genes through AtHsfA2. Time course experiments showed an increase in the fluorescence intensity of DCF in the mitochondria occurred earlier than in other regions of the protoplasts in response to SA. The cytochrome reductase activity analysis in isolated mitochondria demonstrated that SA-induced mitochondrial ROS possibly originated from complex III in the respiration chain. Collectively, our data suggest that SA functions and acts upstream of AtHsfA2 in acquired thermotolerance, which requires a pathway with H2O2 production involved and is dependent on increased expression of Hsp genes.
