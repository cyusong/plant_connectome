['19767619', "Genetic and biochemical analyses of SRS2 homologs in fungi indicate a function in  the processing of homologous recombination (HR) intermediates. To date, no SRS2  homologs have been described and analyzed in higher eukaryotes. Here, we report  the first biochemical characterization of an SRS2 homolog from a multicellular  eukaryote, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We studied the basic properties of  AtSRS2 and were able to show that it is a functional 3'- to 5'-helicase.  Furthermore, we characterized its biochemical function on recombinogenic  intermediates and were able to show the unwinding of nicked Holliday junctions  (HJs) and partial HJs (PX junctions). For the first time, we demonstrated strand  annealing activity for an SRS2 homolog and characterized its strand pairing  activity in detail. Our results indicate that AtSRS2 has properties that enable  it to be involved in different steps during the processing of recombination  intermediates. On the one hand, it could be involved in the unwinding of an  elongating invading strand from a donor strand, while on the other hand, it could  be involved in the annealing of the elongated strand at a later step.", '2009 Nov', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkp753', 'Puchta']
