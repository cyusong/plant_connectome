Elongation of pollen tubes in pistils of Lilium longiflorum cv. Hinomoto after self-incompatible pollination was here found to be promoted by acetylcholine (ACh) and other choline derivatives, such as acetylthiocholine, l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine and chlorocholinechloride [CCC; (2-chloroethyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride]. Moreover, the elongation was promoted by neostigmine, a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE; acetylcholine-decomposing enzyme) (EC 3.1.1.7.) and activities of this and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; acetylcholine-forming enzyme) (EC 2.3.1.6.) in pistils were associated with self-incompatibility. The activity of ChAT was lower after self-incompatible as compared with cross-compatible pollination. Application of cAMP promoted ChAT activities in both cases, whereas activity of AChE in pistils after self-pollination was higher than that after cross-compatible pollination and was suppressed by cAMP in both cases. Furthermore, AChE activity was inhibited by treatment with neostigmine or heating. Our results indicate that the self-incompatibility with self-pollination is due to decrease of ACh and cAMP, causing reduction of ChAT and AC (adenylate cyclase) and concise elevation of AChE and PDE (cAMP phosphodiesterase), and therefore suppressed growth of pollen tubes.
