Formation of the vascular cylinder, a structure critical to water and nutrient transport in higher plants, is highly regulated. Here we identify WRKY15 as an important regulator that suppresses tracheary element (TE) differentiation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Overexpression of WRKY15 resulted in discontinuous protoxylem vessel files and TEs with reduced spiral wall thickening/lignification. Expression of a dominant-negative WRKY15 variant, WRKY15-EAR, led to extra protoxylem vessels and ectopic TEs with increased spiral wall thickening/lignification. Ectopic TE formation in the root cortex and hypocotyl/leaf epidermis reveals that the suppression of WRKY15 is sufficient to trigger the transdifferentiation of other types of cells to TEs. Expression profiling, RT-qPCR, and reporter analyses revealed that WRKY15 suppresses the expression of <i>VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN7</i> (<i>VND7</i>), a master transcriptional regulator that promotes TE differentiation. We propose that WRKY15 negatively regulates <i>VND7</i> expression indirectly based on (1) the absence of a W-box in the promoter of <i>VND7</i> and (2) the observation that <i>WRKY15</i> and <i>VND7</i> are expressed in different cells in the vascular cylinder, with <i>WRKY15</i> expressed in the procambial cells and <i>VND7</i> in the protoxylem poles of procambium and differentiating TEs. Future research is needed to reveal the details underlying the interaction of <i>WRKY15</i> and <i>VND7</i> in plant vascular development.
