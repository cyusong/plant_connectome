The frequency and orientation of cell division are regulated by intercellular signalling molecules; however, tissue-specific regulatory systems for cell divisions are only partially understood. Here, we report that the peptide hormone CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED 9/10 (CLE9/10) regulates two different developmental processes, stomatal lineage development and xylem development, through two distinct receptor systems in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that the receptor kinase HAESA-LIKE 1 (HSL1) is a CLE9/10 receptor that regulates stomatal lineage cell division, and BARELY NO MERISTEM (BAM) class receptor kinases are CLE9/10 receptors that regulate periclinal cell division of xylem precursor cells. Both HSL1 and BAM1 bind to CLE9/10, but only HSL1 recruits SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASES as co-receptors in the presence of CLE9/10, suggesting different signalling modes for these receptor systems.

CLE9/10: !regulates! stomatal lineage development
HSL1: !binds to! CLE9/10
HSL1: !recruits! SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASES
BAM1: !binds to! CLE9/10
BAM1: !regulates! periclinal cell division of xylem precursor cells
