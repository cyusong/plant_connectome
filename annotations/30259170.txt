Atmospheric p CO <sub>2</sub> impacts Quercus petraea biomass production and cell wall composition of the leaves in favor of cellulose at the expense of lignin, and enhances foliar non-structural carbohydrate levels and sucrose contents in a pCO <sub>2</sub> concentration-dependent manner. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.) was grown for ca. half a year from seeds at ambient control (525 ppm), 750, 900, and 1000 ppm atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> under controlled conditions. Increasing pCO<sub>2</sub> enhanced biomass production, modified the cell wall composition of the leaves in favor of cellulose at the expense of lignin, and enhanced the foliar non-structural carbohydrate level, in particular the sucrose content; as well as total N content of leaves by increased levels of all major N fractions, i.e., soluble proteins, total amino acids, and structural N. The enhanced total amino acid level was largely due to 2-ketoglutarate and oxalo acetate-derived compounds. Increasing pCO<sub>2</sub> alleviated oxidative stress in the leaves as indicated by reduced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents. High in vitro glutathione reductase activity at reduced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents suggests enhanced ROS scavenging, but increased lipid peroxidation may also have contributed, as indicated by a negative correlation between malone dialdehyde and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents. Almost all these effects were at least partially reversed, when pCO<sub>2</sub> exceeded 750 or 900 ppm. Apparently, the interaction of atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> with leaf structural and physiological traits of Q. petraea seedlings is characterized by a dynamic response depending on the pCO<sub>2</sub> level.
