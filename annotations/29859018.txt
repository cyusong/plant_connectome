Increased biomass and yield of plants grown under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] often corresponds to decreased grain N concentration ([N]), diminishing nutritional quality of crops. Legumes through their symbiotic N<sub>2</sub> fixation may be better able to maintain biomass [N] and grain [N] under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ], provided N<sub>2</sub> fixation is stimulated by elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] in line with growth and yield. In Mediterranean-type agroecosystems, N<sub>2</sub> fixation may be impaired by drought, and it is unclear whether elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] stimulation of N<sub>2</sub> fixation can overcome this impact in dry years. To address this question, we grew lentil under two [CO<sub>2</sub> ] (ambient ~400 ppm and elevated ~550 ppm) levels in a free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment facility over two growing seasons sharply contrasting in rainfall. Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] stimulated N<sub>2</sub> fixation through greater nodule number (+27%), mass (+18%), and specific fixation activity (+17%), and this stimulation was greater in the high than in the low rainfall/dry season. Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] depressed grain [N] (-4%) in the dry season. In contrast, grain [N] increased (+3%) in the high rainfall season under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ], as a consequence of greater post-flowering N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Our results suggest that the benefit for N<sub>2</sub> fixation from elevated [CO<sub>2</sub> ] is high as long as there is enough soil water to continue N<sub>2</sub> fixation during grain filling.
