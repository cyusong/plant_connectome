MicroProteins are small, single-domain proteins that regulate multidomain proteins by sequestering them into novel, often nonproductive, complexes. Several microProteins have been identified in plants and animals, most of which negatively regulate transcription factors. MicroProtein candidates that potentially target a wide range of different protein classes were recently identified in a computational approach. Here, we classified all Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microProteins and developed a synthetic microProtein approach to target specific protein classes, such as hydrolases, receptors, and lyases, in a proof-of-concept approach. Our findings reveal that microProteins can be used to influence different physiological processes, which makes them useful tools for posttranslational regulation in plants and potentially also in animals.
