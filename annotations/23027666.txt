['23027666', 'The related proteins D1 and D2 together build up the photosystem II reaction  center. Synthesis of D1 (PsbA) is highly regulated in all photosynthetic  organisms. The mechanisms and specific protein factors involved in controlled  expression of the psbA gene in higher plants are highly elusive. Here, we report  on the identification of a chloroplast-located protein, HCF244 (for high  chlorophyll fluorescence244), which is essentially required for translational  initiation of the psbA messenger RNA in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The  factor is highly conserved between land plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. HCF244  was identified by coexpression analysis of HCF173, which encodes a protein that  is also necessary for psbA translational initiation and in addition for  stabilization of this messenger RNA. Phenotypic characterization of the mutants  hcf244 and hcf173 suggests that the corresponding proteins operate cooperatively  during psbA translation. Immunolocalization studies detected the majority of the  two proteins at the thylakoid membrane. Both HCF244 and HCF173 are members of the  atypical short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, a modified group, which  has lost enzyme activity but acquires new functions in the metabolism of the  cell.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.205104', 'Westhoff']
