The roles of auxin in the regulation of symbiotic legume nodule formation are unclear. We recently showed that enhanced sensitivity to auxin resulting from overexpression of miR160 inhibits determinate nodule formation in soybean. We examined the roles of miR393 and miR164 in soybean (that forms determinate nodules) and Medicago truncatula (that forms indeterminate nodules). Our results together with previous studies suggest that indeterminate nodule formation requires a higher, but narrow window of auxin sensitivity and that miR164 regulation is not crucial for determinate nodule formation.
