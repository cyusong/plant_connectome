Modern semi-dwarf rice varieties of the "Green Revolution" require a high supply of nitrogen (N) fertilizer to produce high yields. A better understanding of the interplay between N metabolism and plant developmental processes is required for improved N-use efficiency and agricultural sustainability. Here, we show that strigolactones (SLs) modulate root metabolic and developmental adaptations to low N availability for ensuring efficient uptake and translocation of available N. The key repressor DWARF 53 (D53) of the SL signaling pathway interacts with the transcription factor GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) and prevents GRF4 from binding to its target gene promoters. N limitation induces the accumulation of SLs, which in turn promotes SL-mediated degradation of D53, leading to the release of GRF4 and thus promoting the expression of genes associated with N metabolism. N limitation also induces degradation of the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE 1 (SLR1) in an D14- and D53-dependent manner, effectively releasing GRF4 from competitive inhibition caused by SLR1. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying SL and gibberellin crosstalk in response to N availability, advancing our understanding of plant growth-metabolic coordination and facilitating the design of the strategies for improving N-use efficiency in high-yield crops.
