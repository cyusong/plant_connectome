* Arabidopsis cngc2 plants are hypersensitive to external calcium and exhibit reduced plant size and fertility, especially when they are treated with elevated but physiologically relevant levels of calcium. This report focuses on the role of cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (CNGC2) in plant fertility. * To determine the cause of the reduced fertility, we investigated the flower structure and growth potential of both male and female reproductive organs in cngc2 plants grown in high-calcium conditions. * cngc2 mutants had short stamens that may limit pollen deposition and pistils that were not conducive to pollen tube growth. * Our data indicate that sporophytic, but not gametophytic, defects are the main cause of the observed reduction in seed yield in cngc2 plants, and suggest that correct cyclic nucleotide and calcium signaling are important for cell elongation and pollen tube guidance.
