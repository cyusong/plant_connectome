The Anthropocene epoch is associated with the spreading of metals in the environment increasing oxidative and genotoxic stress on organisms. Interestingly, c. 520 plant species growing on metalliferous soils acquired the capacity to accumulate and tolerate a tremendous amount of nickel in their shoots. The wide phylogenetic distribution of these species suggests that nickel hyperaccumulation evolved multiple times independently. However, the exact nature of these mechanisms and whether they have been recruited convergently in distant species is not known. To address these questions, we have developed a cross-species RNA-Seq approach combining differential gene expression analysis and cluster of orthologous group annotation to identify genes linked to nickel hyperaccumulation in distant plant families. Our analysis reveals candidate orthologous genes encoding convergent function involved in nickel hyperaccumulation, including the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites and cell wall organization. Our data also point out that the high expression of IREG/Ferroportin transporters recurrently emerged as a mechanism involved in nickel hyperaccumulation in plants. We further provide genetic evidence in the hyperaccumulator Noccaea caerulescens for the role of the NcIREG2 transporter in nickel sequestration in vacuoles. Our results provide molecular tools to better understand the mechanisms of nickel hyperaccumulation and study their evolution in plants.
