Plant viruses may exhibit age-dependent tissue preference in their hosts but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we provide several lines of evidence to reveal the determining role of a protein of the Nicotiana benthamiana chloroplast Hsp70 (NbcpHsp70) family, NbcpHsp70-2, involved in the preference of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) to infect older tissues. NbcpHsp70 family proteins were identified in complexes pulled down with BaMV replicase as the bait. Among the isoforms of NbcpHsp70, only the specific silencing of NbcpHsp70-2 resulted in the significant decrease of BaMV RNA in N. benthamiana protopalsts, indicating that NbcpHsp70-2 is involved in the efficient replication of BaMV RNA. We further identified the age-dependent import regulation signal contained in the transit peptide of NbcpHsp70-2. Deletion, overexpression, and substitution experiments revealed that the signal in the transit peptide of NbcpHsp70-2 is crucial for both the import of NbcpHsp70-2 into older chloroplasts and the preference of BaMV for infecting older leaves of N. benthamiana. Together, these data demonstrated that BaMV may exploit a cellular age-dependent transportation mechanism to target a suitable environment for viral replication.
