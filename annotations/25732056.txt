['25732056', 'Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient required for plant growth and  development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, several families of Zn transporters engaged  in Zn import, export and intracellular compartmentalization play important roles  in Zn homeostasis. We describe a novel Zn transporter, A. thaliana metal  tolerance protein 12 (AtMTP12), which belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator  family. AtMTP12 is predicted to consist of 798 amino acids and have 14  transmembrane segments. The expression of AtMTP12 in suspension-cultured cells  was not affected by Zn deficiency or excess. Heterologous expression in a mutant  of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that lacks Msc2p, an orthologue of  AtMTP12, revealed that AtMTP12 complements the growth phenotype of the msc2  mutant when AtMTP5t1, one of the splicing variants of AtMTP5, is coexpressed.  Transient expression of AtMTP12-fused green fluorescent protein in A. thaliana  mesophyll protoplasts demonstrated that AtMTP12 is localized to the Golgi  apparatus. Moreover, AtMTP12 and AtMTP5t1 interact in the Golgi, as determined by  a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. These results suggest that  AtMTP12 forms a functional complex with AtMTP5t1 to transport Zn into the Golgi.  DATABASE: Nucleotide sequence data for full-length of AtMTP12 is available in the  DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database under accession number AB986563.', '2015 May', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/febs.13252', 'Maeshima']
