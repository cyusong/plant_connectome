The spikelet is a unique inflorescence structure of grass. The molecular mechanism that controls the development of the spikelet remains unclear. In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet mutant, multi-floret spikelet1 (mfs1), that showed delayed transformation of spikelet meristems to floral meristems, which resulted in an extra hull-like organ and an elongated rachilla. In addition, the sterile lemma was homeotically converted to the rudimentary glume and the body of the palea was degenerated in mfs1. These results suggest that the MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 (MFS1) gene plays an important role in the regulation of spikelet meristem determinacy and floral organ identity. MFS1 belongs to an unknown function clade in the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family. The MFS1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized in the nucleus. MFS1 messenger RNA is expressed in various tissues, especially in the spikelet and floral meristems. Furthermore, our findings suggest that MFS1 positively regulates the expression of LONG STERILE LEMMA and the INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1)-like genes SUPERNUMERARY BRACT and OsIDS1.
