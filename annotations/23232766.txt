MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in numerous developmental and metabolic processes in animals and plants. Although the framework of miRNA biogenesis and function is established, the mechanism of miRNA degradation or modification remains to be investigated in plants. Mature miRNAs may be truncated or added nucleotides to generate variants. A detailed analysis of small RNA deep sequencing data sets resulted in the cloning of a large number of variants derived from larch miRNAs. Many 5'- and/or 3'-end truncated versions of miRNAs suggested that larch miRNAs might be degraded through either 5'-3' or 3'-5'. The relative abundance of variants truncated from 3'-end was higher than that of 5'-end for most miRNAs. The addition of adenine, uridine, and cytidine to the 3'-end of miRNAs was globally present, and the subtle variability in isomiR abundance might be regulated and biologically meaningful. It is the first report for cytidine addition in plant, and our examination of published small RNA deep sequencing data sets of Arabidopsis, rice, and moss suggests that cytidine addition to miRNA 3'-end exists broadly in plants. In addition, the nucleotide addition might be associated with 3'-5' miRNA degradation. Our results provide valuable information for a genome-wide survey of miRNA truncation and modification in larch or plants.
