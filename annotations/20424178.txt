A leaf develops from a few cells that grow, divide, and differentiate to form a complex organ that is precisely positioned relative to its neighbors. How cells communicate to achieve such coordinated growth and development is the focus of this review. We discuss (1) how the stem cells within the shoot meristem gain competence to form organs, (2) what determines the positioning and initiation of new organs, and (3) how the new organ attains its characteristic shape and polarity. Special emphasis is given to the recent integration of mathematics and physics in the study of leaf development.
