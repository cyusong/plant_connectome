As inducers of nodulation (<i>nod</i>) genes, flavonoids play an important role in the symbiotic interaction between rhizobia and legumes. However, in addition to the control of expression of <i>nod</i> genes, many other effects of flavonoids on rhizobial cells have been described. Here, we show that the flavonoid naringenin stimulates the growth of the photosynthetic <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp. strain ORS285. This growth-stimulating effect was still observed for strain ORS285 with <i>nodD1</i>, <i>nodD2</i>, or the naringenin-degrading <i>fde</i> operon deleted. Phenotypic microarray analysis indicates that in cells grown in the presence of naringenin, the glycerol and fatty acid metabolism is activated. Moreover, electron microscopic and enzymatic analyses show that polyhydroxy alkanoate metabolism is altered in cells grown in the presence of naringenin. Although strain ORS285 was able to degrade naringenin, a fraction was converted into an intensely yellow-colored molecule with an <i>m/z</i> (+) of 363.0716. Further analysis indicates that this molecule is a hydroxylated and O-methylated form of naringenin. In contrast to naringenin, this derivative did not induce <i>nod</i> gene expression, but it did stimulate the growth of strain ORS285. We hypothesize that the growth stimulation and metabolic changes induced by naringenin are part of a mechanism to facilitate the colonization and infection of naringenin-exuding host plants.
