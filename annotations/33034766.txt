The supramolecular organization of the photosystem supercomplexes in the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana belonging to Trebouxiophyceae are essentially the same as those of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii belonging to Chlorophyceae. The photosynthetic conversion of light energy into chemical energy is performed by photosystems II and I (PSII and PSI) embedded within the thylakoid membranes. In plants and green algae, PSII and PSI comprise the core complex and light-harvesting complexes (LHCII and LHCI), forming PSII-LHCII and PSI-LHCI supercomplexes, respectively. The structural information about photosystem supercomplexes of green algae has been limited to chlorophytic algae. Here, to obtain an insight into the evolution of Chlorophyta, we determined the supramolecular organization of the PSII-LHCII and PSI-LHCI supercomplexes from the freshwater green alga Chlorella sorokiniana, which belongs to Trebouxiophyceae. The obtained results showed that the supramolecular organizations of the photosystem supercomplexes in C. sorokiniana were essentially the same as those of the model green alga C. reinhardtii, which belongs to Chlorophyceae, namely PSII-LHCII supercomplex formed the C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub> configuration and PSI-LHCI supercomplex was associated with 10 LHCI subunits.

PSII: !forms! C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>
PSI: !forms! 10 LHCI subunits
PSII-LHCII: !same as! Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
PSI-LHCI: !same as! Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
