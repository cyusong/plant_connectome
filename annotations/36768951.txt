Chilling injury owing to low temperatures severely affects the growth and development of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>.L) seedlings during the early and late spring seasons. The existing maize germplasm is deficient in the resources required to improve maize's ability to tolerate cold injury. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce and identify excellent gene/QTLs that confer cold tolerance to maize for sustainable crop production. Wild relatives of maize, such as <i>Z</i>. <i>perennis</i> and <i>Tripsacum dactyloides,</i> are strongly tolerant to cold and can be used to improve the cold tolerance of maize. In a previous study, a genetic bridge among maize that utilized <i>Z. perennis</i> and <i>T. dactyloides</i> was created and used to obtain a highly cold-tolerant maize introgression line (MIL)-IB030 by backcross breeding. In this study, two candidate genes that control relative electrical conductivity were located on MIL-IB030 by forward genetics combined with a weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The results of the phenotypic, genotypic, gene expression, and functional verification suggest that two candidate genes positively regulate cold tolerance in MIL-IB030 and could be used to improve the cold tolerance of cultivated maize. This study provides a workable route to introduce and mine excellent genes/QTLs to improve the cold tolerance of maize and also lays a theoretical and practical foundation to improve cultivated maize against low-temperature stress.
