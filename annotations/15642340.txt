['15642340', 'Activity of the plant mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) can be regulated by  organic acids, notably pyruvate. To date, only two well-conserved cysteine  residues have been implicated in this process. We report the functional  expression of two AOX isozymes (Sauromatum guttatum Sg-AOX and Arabidopsis  thaliana At-AOX1a) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Comparison of the response of  these two isozymes to pyruvate in isolated yeast mitochondria and disrupted  mitochondrial membranes reveals that in contrast to At-AOX1a, Sg-AOX activity is  insensitive to pyruvate and appears to be in a constitutively active state. As  both of these isozymes conserve the two cysteines, we propose that such  contrasting behaviour must be a direct result of differences in their amino acid  sequence and have subsequently identified novel candidate residues.', '2005 Jan 17', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2004.10.107', 'Moore']
