['28406987', 'Plant-parasitic nematodes are destructive pests causing losses of billions of  dollars annually. An effective plant defence against pathogens relies on the  recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by  surface-localised receptors leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity  (PTI). Extensive studies have been conducted to characterise the role of PTI in  various models of plant-pathogen interactions. However, far less is known about  the role of PTI in roots in general and in plant-nematode interactions in  particular. Here we show that nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitor/s is/are  capable of inducing PTI in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune  co-receptor BAK1. Consistent with the role played by BAK1, we identified a  leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, termed NILR1 that is specifically  regulated upon infection by nematodes. We show that NILR1 is essential for PTI  responses initiated by nematodes and nilr1 loss-of-function mutants are  hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes. To our knowledge, NILR1 is the  first example of an immune receptor that is involved in induction of basal  immunity (PTI) in plants or in animals in response to nematodes. Manipulation of  NILR1 will provide new options for nematode control in crop plants in future.', '2017 Apr', 'PLoS Pathog', '10.1371/journal.ppat.1006284', 'ORCID:']
