['30765478', 'Plant immunity depends on fast and specific transcriptional reprogramming  triggered by the perception of biotic stresses. Numerous studies have been  conducted to better understand the response of plants to the generalist herbivore  two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae). However, how plants perceive mites  and how this perception is translated into changes in gene expression are largely  unknown. In this work, we identified a gene induced in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) upon spider mite attack that encodes a two-domain protein containing  predicted lectin and Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domains. The gene, previously  named PP2-A5, belongs to the Phloem Protein2 family. Biotic assays showed that  PP2-A5 confers tolerance to T. urticae Overexpression or knockout of PP2-A5 leads  to transcriptional reprogramming that alters the balance of hormone accumulation  and corresponding signaling pathways. The nucleocytoplasmic location of this  protein supports a direct interaction with regulators of gene transcription,  suggesting that the combination of two putative signaling domains in a single  protein may provide a novel mechanism for regulating gene expression. Together,  our results suggest that PP2-A5 improves the ability to defend against T. urticae  by participating in the tight regulation of hormonal cross talk upon mite  feeding. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism by which this  two-domain protein functions and to clarify its molecular role in signaling  following a spider mite attack.', '2019 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00951', 'ORCID:']
