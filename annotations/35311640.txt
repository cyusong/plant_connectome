The fern <i>Ceratopteris richardii</i> has been studied as a model organism for over 50 years because it is easy to grow and has a short life cycle. In particular, as the first homosporous vascular plant for which genomic resources were developed, <i>C. richardii</i> has been an important system for studying plant evolution. However, we know relatively little about the natural history of <i>C. richardii.</i> In this article, we summarize what is known about this aspect of <i>C. richardii</i>, and discuss how learning more about its natural history could greatly increase our understanding of the evolution of land plants.
