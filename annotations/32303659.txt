Regulation of grain size is crucial for improving crop yield and is also a basic aspect in developmental biology. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying grain size control in crops remain largely unknown despite their central importance. Here, we report that the MEI2-LIKE PROTEIN4 (OML4) encoded by the <i>LARGE1</i> gene is phosphorylated by GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE2 (GSK2) and negatively controls grain size and weight in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Loss of function of <i>OML4</i> leads to large and heavy grains, while overexpression of <i>OML4</i> causes small and light grains. OML4 regulates grain size by restricting cell expansion in the spikelet hull. <i>OML4</i> is expressed in developing panicles and grains, and the GFP-OML4 fusion protein is localized in the nuclei. Biochemical analyses show that the GSK2 physically interacts with OML4 and phosphorylates it, thereby possibly influencing the stability of OML4. Genetic analyses support that GSK2 and OML4 act, at least in part, in a common pathway to control grain size in rice. These results reveal the genetic and molecular mechanism of a GSK2-OML4 regulatory module in grain size control, suggesting that this pathway is a suitable target for improving seed size and weight in crops.
