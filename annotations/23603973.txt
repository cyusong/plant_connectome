Autophagy is a major pathway for the delivery of proteins or organelles to be degraded in the vacuole and recycled. It can be induced by abiotic stresses, senescence, and pathogen infection. Recent research has shown that autophagy is activated by ER stress. Here we review the major progress that has been made in the study of autophagy and ER stress in plants, and describe the links between ER stress and autophagy to guide further study on how autophagy is regulated in response to ER stress.

ER stress: !induces! Autophagy
Autophagy: !activated by! ER stress
Autophagy: !delivers! proteins/organelles
Autophagy: !recycles! proteins/organelles
