['25908862', "The preprophase band of microtubules performs the crucial function of marking the  plane of cell division. Although the preprophase band depolymerises at the onset  of mitosis, the division plane is 'memorized' by a cortical division zone to  which the phragmoplast is attracted during cytokinesis. Proteins have been  discovered that are part of the molecular memory but little is known about how  they contribute to phragmoplast guidance. Previously, we found that the  microtubule-associated protein AIR9 is found in the cortical division zone at  preprophase and returns during cell plate insertion but is absent from the cortex  during the intervening mitosis. To identify new components of the preprophase  memory, we searched for proteins that interact with AIR9. We detected the  kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein, KCBP, which can be visualized at the  predicted cortical site throughout division. A truncation study of KCBP indicates  that its MyTH4-FERM domain is required for linking the motor domain to the  cortex. These results suggest a mechanism by which minus-end-directed KCBP helps  guide the centrifugally expanding phragmoplast to the cortical division site.", '2015 Jun 1', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.156570', 'Lloyd']
