['21628525', 'Although the multilayered structure of the plant cuticle was discovered many  years ago, the molecular basis of its formation and the functional relevance of  the layers are not understood. Here, we present the permeable cuticle1 (pec1)  mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which displays features associated with a highly  permeable cuticle in several organs. In pec1 flowers, typical cutin monomers,  such as omega-hydroxylated fatty acids and 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate, are reduced to  40% of wild-type levels and are accompanied by the appearance of lipidic  inclusions within the epidermal cell. The cuticular layer of the cell wall,  rather than the cuticle proper, is structurally altered in pec1 petals.  Therefore, a significant role for the formation of the diffusion barrier in  petals can be attributed to this layer. Thus, pec1 defines a new class of  mutants. The phenotypes of the pec1 mutant are caused by the knockout of ATP  BINDING CASSETTEG32 (ABCG32), an ABC transporter from the PLEIOTROPIC DRUG  RESISTANCE family that is localized at the plasma membrane of epidermal cells in  a polar manner toward the surface of the organs. Our results suggest that ABCG32  is involved in the formation of the cuticular layer of the cell wall, most likely  by exporting particular cutin precursors from the epidermal cell.', '2011 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.083121', 'Nawrath']
