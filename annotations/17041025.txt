['17041025', 'Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation/deconjugation to heat shock  transcription factors regulates DNA binding of the peptides and activation of  heat shock protein gene expression that modulates thermal adaptation in  metazoans. SIZ1 is a SUMO E3 ligase that facilitates SUMO conjugation to  substrate target proteins (sumoylation) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  siz1 T-DNA insertional mutations (siz1-2 and siz1-3; Miura et al., 2005) cause  basal, but not acquired, thermosensitivity that occurs in conjunction with  hyperaccumulation of salicylic acid (SA). NahG encodes a salicylate hydroxylase,  and expression in siz1-2 seedlings reduces endogenous SA accumulation to that of  wild-type levels and further increases thermosensitivity. High temperature  induces SUMO1/2 conjugation to peptides in wild type but to a substantially  lesser degree in siz1 mutants. However, heat shock-induced expression of genes,  including heat shock proteins, ascorbate peroxidase 1 and 2, is similar in siz1  and wild-type seedlings. Together, these results indicate that SIZ1 and, by  inference, sumoylation facilitate basal thermotolerance through processes that  are SA independent.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.088831', 'Hasegawa']
