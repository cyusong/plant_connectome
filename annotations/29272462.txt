Plant pathogens have evolved several strategies to manipulate the biology of their hosts to facilitate colonization, growth to high levels in plant tissue, and production of disease. One of the less well known of these strategies is the synthesis of plant hormones and hormone analogs, and there is growing evidence that modulation of host hormone signaling is important during pathogenesis. Several plant pathogens produce the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and/or virulence factors that modulate host auxin signaling. Auxin is well known for being involved in many aspects of plant growth and development, but recent findings have revealed that elevated IAA levels or enhanced auxin signaling can also promote disease development in some plant-pathogen interactions. In addition to stimulating plant cell growth during infection by gall-forming bacteria, auxin and auxin signaling can antagonize plant defense responses. Auxin can also act as a microbial signaling molecule to impact the biology of some pathogens directly. In this review, we summarize recent progress towards elucidating the roles that auxin production, modification of host auxin signaling, and direct effects of auxin on pathogens play during pathogenesis, with emphasis on the impacts of auxin on interactions with bacterial pathogens.
