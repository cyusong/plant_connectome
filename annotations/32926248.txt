This study is the first to demonstrate that GA<sub>4</sub>-induced dormancy release is associated with the NF-Y complex, which interacts with gibberellin inhibitor RGL2 in Japanese apricot. Seasonal dormancy is not only vital for the survival in cold winter but also affects flowering of temperate fruit trees and the dormancy release depends on the accumulation of the cold temperatures (Chilling requirement-CR). To understand the mechanism of dormancy release in deciduous fruit crops, we compared miRNA sequencing data during the transition stage from paradormancy to dormancy release in the Japanese apricot and found that the miR169 family showed significant differentially up-regulated expression during dormancy induction and was down-regulated during the dormancy release periods. The 5' RACE assay and RT-qPCR validated its target gene NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y subunit A (NF-YA), which exhibited the opposite expression pattern. Further study showed that exogenous GA<sub>4</sub> could inhibit the expression of the gibberellic acid (GA) signal transduction suppressor PmRGL2 (RGA-LIKE 2) and promote the expression of NF-Y. Moreover, the interaction between the NF-Y family and GA inhibitor PmRGL2 was verified by the yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) system and a bimolecular fluorescence complementarity (BiFC) experiment. These results suggest that synergistic regulation of the NF-Y and PmRGL2 complex leads to the activation of dormancy release induced by GA<sub>4</sub>. These findings will help to elucidate the functional and regulatory roles of miR169 and NF-Y complex in seasonal bud dormancy induced by GA in Japanese apricot and provide new insights for the discovery of dormancy release mechanisms in woody plants.
