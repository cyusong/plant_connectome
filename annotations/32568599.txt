Fusarium wilt is the most destructive fungal disease in flax, limiting flax cultivation in all the main flax and linseed growing countries. The causative agent is seedborne and soilborne fungus <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lini.</i> Here, we report, for the first time, genome assemblies of five highly pathogenic isolates of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lini</i>, namely monoisolate 39 and strains F329, F324, F282, F287. In addition, syntenic analysis provided a powerful approach to distinguish between core and lineage-specific parts of the genome. These results lay a solid foundation for comparative genomics studies of plant fungal pathogens, evolution of pathogenicity, and virulence factors underlying the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions, thus eventually offering solutions to <i>Fusarium</i> disease control.
