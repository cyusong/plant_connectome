This article is introductory to the series of works presented in this special issue on the homeostasis and the signaling roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants. Upper half of this article briefly describes the history of the ROS study in the field of plant immunity research initiated by the observation that the attacks by pathogenic microorganisms possibly stimulate the burst of ROS production in the plant tissues. The topics covered in the series of works presented here include the plants' responses to abiotic oxidative stress (atmospheric ozone), regulation of seed germination, chemical interaction between parasitic and host plants and the draught tolerance, all controlled through homeostasis of ROS at biochemical and molecular biological levels. Lastly a discussion forum was proposed to further deepen our understanding of ROS behaviors in plants.
