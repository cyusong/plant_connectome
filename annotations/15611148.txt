The filamentous gametophyte of the moss Physcomitrella patens consists of two filament types called chloronemata and caulonemata. Chloronemal cells are photosynthetically active with numerous chloroplasts, while caulonemata help to spread the colony by radial growth. The balance between the two filament types is affected by external factors such as light and plant hormones. In the present study, caulonema formation and chloronemal branching have been monitored during high and low light conditions and in the presence of glucose, auxin, or cytokinin. These experiments were performed both in a wild-type strain and in a hxk1 knockout mutant which lacks the major hexokinase of Physcomitrella. It was found that caulonema formation is induced by high energy conditions such as high light and external glucose, while chloronemal branching is stimulated by low energy conditions such as reduced light, and in the hxk1 mutant. The hxk1 mutation also causes buds to appear on chloronemal filaments, which is rarely seen in the wild type, and shows increased sensitivity to cytokinin and abscisic acid. Based on these findings a model is proposed in which the energy supply of the moss colony regulates the balance between chloronemal and caulonemal growth.
