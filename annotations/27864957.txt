Here, I extend the recently introduced 'fast-slow continuum and reproductive strategy' framework to quantify the variation in plant life history strategies world-wide. I use high-resolution demographic information from 625 plant species and show that this framework predicts not only key demographic properties, such as population growth rate and demographic resilience, but also has important connections to the leaf economics spectrum, biogeographical characteristics, evolutionary biology and conservation biology. This framework may allow plant biologists to unlock powerful global plant predictions from a handful of open-access field measurements.
