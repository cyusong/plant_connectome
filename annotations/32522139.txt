We aimed to screen cold-tolerant introgression lines (ILs) of bell pepper and investigate stress responses of these bell peppers under low temperature. Seedlings of cold-resistant wild-type bell pepper CA157, cultivated bell pepper CA52, and their ILs were evaluated for their tolerance to low temperature. Electrical conductivity measurement was performed on ILs and two parents. Then, contents of physiological and biochemical indexes including malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, and soluble sugar content were examined. Moreover, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase (POD) activities were further investigated. Finally, the chlorophyll fluorescence (PSII) parameters in all pant leaves were examined. A total of 22 IL plants showed better resistance than their recurrent parent CA52. CL122 was one of the most outstanding plants in ILs that had similar performance with wild bell pepper CA157. Cold resistance analysis based on physiological and biochemical indexes showed that factors such as electrical conductivity, MDA, and PSII were closely related to cold resistance among CA157, CA52, and CL122 under low-temperature stress. In conclusion, ILs constructed in the current study might be used for cold resistance gene introgression between wild and cultured species. Moreover, CL122 might be a novel bridge material for understanding low-temperature response in bell pepper. Furthermore, electrical conductivity, MDA, and PSII might be used to identify the low-temperature resistance of bell pepper plants in a period of obvious differentiation.
