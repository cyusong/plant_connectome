['35310653', 'Tetraspanins (TETs) function as key molecular scaffolds for surface signal  recognition and transduction via the assembly of tetraspanin-enriched  microdomains. TETs\' function in mammalian has been intensively investigated for  the organization of multimolecular membrane complexes, regulation of cell  migration and cellular adhesion, whereas plant TET studies lag far behind. Animal  and plant TETs share similar topologies, despite the hallmark of "CCG" in the  large extracellular loop of animal TETs, plant TETs contain a plant specific  GCCK/RP motif and more conserved cysteine residues. Here, we showed that the  GCCK/RP motif is responsible for TET protein association with the plasma  membrane. Moreover, the conserved cysteine residues located within or neighboring  the GCCK/RP motif are both crucial for TET anchoring to membrane. During virus  infection, the intact TET3 protein enhanced but GCCK/RP motif or cysteine  residues-deficient TET3 variants abolished the cell-to-cell movement capability  of virus. This study provides cellular evidence that the GCCK/RP motif and the  conserved cysteine residues are the primary determinants for the distribution and  function of TET proteins in Arabidopsis.', '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.805633', 'Chen']
