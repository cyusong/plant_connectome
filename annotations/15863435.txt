Root hairs are an excellent model system to study cell developmental processes as they are easily accessible, single-celled, long tubular extensions of root epidermal cells. In a genetic approach to identify loci important for root hair development, we have isolated eight der (deformed root hairs) mutants from an ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized Arabidopsis population. The der lines represent five new loci involved in root hair development and show a variety of abnormalities in root hair morphology, indicating that different root hair developmental stages are affected. A double mutant analysis with the short root hair actin2 mutant der1-2 confirmed that the der mutants are disturbed at different time points of root hair formation. Auxin and ethylene are known to be important for trichoblast cell fate determination and root hair elongation. Here, we show that they are able to suppress the phenotype of two der mutants. As the auxin- and ethylene-responsive der mutants are affected at different stages of root hair formation, our results demonstrate that the function of auxin and ethylene is not limited to cell differentiation and root hair elongation but that the two hormones are effective throughout the whole root hair developmental process.
