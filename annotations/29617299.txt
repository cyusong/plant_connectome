The <i>spr2</i> mutation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), which disrupts function of FATTY ACID DESATURASE 7 (FAD7), confers resistance to the potato aphid (<i>Macrosiphum euphorbiae</i>) and modifies the plant&rsquo;s C6 volatile profiles. To investigate whether C6 volatiles play a role in resistance, <i>HYDROPEROXIDE LYASE</i> (<i>HPL</i>), which encodes a critical enzyme in C6 volatile synthesis, was silenced in wild-type tomato plants and <i>spr2</i> mutants. Silencing <i>HPL</i> in wild-type tomato increased potato aphid host preference and reproduction on 5-week old plants but had no influence on 3-week old plants. The <i>spr2</i> mutation, in contrast, conferred strong aphid resistance at both 3 and 5 weeks, and silencing <i>HPL</i> in <i>spr2</i> did not compromise this aphid resistance. Moreover, a mutation in the <i>FAD7</i> gene in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> also conferred resistance to the green peach aphid (<i>Myzus persicae</i>) in a genetic background that carries a null mutation in <i>HPL</i>. These results indicate that <i>HPL</i> contributes to certain forms of aphid resistance in tomato, but that the effects of <i>FAD7</i> on aphids in tomato and Arabidopsis are distinct from and independent of <i>HPL</i>.
