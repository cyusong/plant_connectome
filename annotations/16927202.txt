PvLHY and Lhcb expression has been studied in primary bean leaves after exposure of etiolated leaves to two or three white light-pulses and under different photoperiods. Under the tested photoperiods, the steady-state mRNA levels exhibit diurnal oscillations with zenith in the morning between ZT21 and 4 for PvLHY and between ZT4 and 6 for Lhcb. Nadir is in the evening between ZT12 and 18 for PvLHY and ZT18 and 24 for Lhcb. Light-pulses to etiolated seedlings induce a differentiated acute response that is reciprocally correlated with the amplitude of the following circadian cycle. In addition, the clock modulates the duration of the acute response (descending part of the curve included), which according to the phase of the rhythm at light application extends from 7 to 18 h. This constitutes the response dynamics of the Phaseolus clock to light. Similarly, the waveform of PvLHY and Lhcb expression during the day of different photoperiods resembles in induction capability (accomplishment of peak after lights-on) and duration (from lights-on phase to trough) the phase-dependent progression of acute response in etiolated seedlings. Consequently, the peak of Lhcb (all tested photoperiods) and PvLHY (in LD 18:6) attained in the photophase corresponds to the acute response peak, while the peak of PvLHY during the scotophase (in LD 12:12 and 6:18) corresponds to the circadian peak. Thus, the effect of the response dynamics in the photoperiod determines the coincidence of the peak with the photo- or scotophase, respectively. This represents a new model mechanism for the adaptation of the Phaseolus clock to light.

PvLHY: !exhibits diurnal oscillations with zenith! morning
Lhcb: !exhibits diurnal oscillations with zenith! morning
Light-pulses: !induces acute response! PvLHY/Lhcb
Clock: !modulates duration of acute response! PvLHY/Lhcb
Photoperiods: !determines coincidence of peak! photo-/scotophase
