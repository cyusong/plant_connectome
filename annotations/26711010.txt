['26711010', "DNA methylation directed by 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)  plays critical roles in gene regulation and transposon silencing in Arabidopsis.  24-nt siRNAs are known to be processed from double-stranded RNAs by Dicer-like 3  (DCL3) and loaded into the effector Argonaute 4 (AGO4). Here we report a distinct  class of siRNAs independent of DCLs (sidRNAs). sidRNAs are present as ladders of   approximately  20-60 nt in length, often having the same 5' ends but differing in 3' ends by  1-nt steps. We further show that sidRNAs are associated with AGO4 and capable of  directing DNA methylation. Finally we show that sidRNA production depends on  distributive 3'-5' exonucleases. Our findings suggest an alternative route for  siRNA biogenesis. Precursor transcripts are bound by AGO4 and subsequently  subjected to 3'-5' exonucleolytic trimming for maturation. We propose that  sidRNAs generated through this route are the initial triggers of de novo DNA  methylation.", '2016 Jan 21', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2015.11.015', 'Qi']
