For many years we have studied the processes involved in producing miRNAs in plants and the numerous differences from their metazoan counterpart. A well-defined catalytic process, mostly carried out by the RNase III enzyme DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), it was identified early after the discovery of RNAi and was followed by the isolation of a plethora of miRNA biogenesis cofactors. The production of miRNAs, which later are loaded in ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins to perform their RNA silencing functions both within the cell and non-cell autonomously, appears to be a highly regulated and dynamic process. Many regulatory events during miRNA biogenesis require the action of specific proteins. However, in recent years, many post-transcriptional modifications, structural features, and coupling with other cellular processing emerged as critical elements controlling the production of miRNA and, thus, a plant's physiology. This review discusses new evidence that has changed the way we understand how miRNAs are produced in plants. We also provide an updated view of the miRNA biogenesis pathways, focusing on the gaps in our knowledge and the most compelling questions that remain open.

DCL1: !catalyzes! miRNA production
AGO: !loads! miRNAs
post-transcriptional modifications: !regulate! miRNA production
structural features: !regulate! miRNA production
coupling with other cellular processing: !regulate! miRNA production
