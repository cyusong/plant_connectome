DNA damage response (DDR) in eukaryotic cells is initiated in the chromatin context. DNA damage and repair depend on or have influence on the chromatin dynamics associated with genome stability. Epigenetic modifiers, such as chromatin remodelers, histone modifiers, DNA (de-)methylation enzymes, and noncoding RNAs regulate DDR signaling and DNA repair by affecting chromatin dynamics. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the understanding of plant DDR and DNA repair. SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1, RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED1 (RBR1)/E2FA, and NAC103 have been proven to be key players in the mediation of DDR signaling in plants, while plant-specific chromatin remodelers, such as DECREASED DNA METHYLATION1, contribute to chromatin dynamics for DNA repair. There is accumulating evidence that plant epigenetic modifiers are involved in DDR and DNA repair. In this review, I examine how DDR and DNA repair machineries are concertedly regulated in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by a variety of epigenetic modifiers directing chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modification. This review will aid in updating our knowledge on DDR and DNA repair in plants.
