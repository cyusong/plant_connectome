Maintaining proper DNA methylation levels in the genome requires active demethylation of DNA. However, removing the methyl group from a modified cytosine is chemically difficult and therefore, the underlying mechanism of demethylation had remained unclear for many years. The discovery of the first eukaryotic DNA demethylase, Arabidopsis thaliana REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), led to elucidation of the 5-methylcytosine base excision repair mechanism of active DNA demethylation. In the 20 years since ROS1 was discovered, our understanding of this active DNA demethylation pathway, as well as its regulation and biological functions in plants, has greatly expanded. These exciting developments have laid the groundwork for further dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of active DNA demethylation, with potential applications in epigenome editing to facilitate crop breeding and gene therapy.
