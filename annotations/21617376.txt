Stomata are formed by pairs of surrounding guard cells and perform important roles in photosynthesis, transpiration and innate immunity of terrestrial plants. Ionic solutes in the cytosol of guard cells are important for cell turgor and volume change. Consequently, transmembrane flux of ions such as K+, Cl-, and malate2- through K+ channels and anion channels of guard cells are a direct driving force for turgor change, while the opening of calcium permeable channels can serve as a trigger of cytosolic free calcium concentration elevations or oscillations, which play second messenger roles. In plants, heterotrimeric G proteins have fewer members than in animals, but they are well investigated and found to regulate these channels and to play fundamental roles in guard cell function. This mini-review focuses on the recent understanding of G-protein regulation of ion channels on the plasma membrane of guard cells and their participation in stomatal movements.
