AT-hook motif nuclear localization (AHL) proteins belong to a family of transcription factors, and play important roles in plant growth and development and response to various stresses through protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. To better understand the <i>Brassica napus AHL</i> gene family, <i>AHL</i> genes in <i>B. napus</i> and related species were analyzed. Using <i>Arabidopsis</i> as a reference, 122 <i>AHL</i> gene family members were first identified in <i>B. napus</i>. According to the phylogenetic tree and gene organization, the BnaAHLs were classified into two clades (Clade-A and Clade-B) and three types (Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III). Gene organization and motif distribution analysis suggested that the <i>AHL</i> gene family is relatively conserved during evolution. These <i>BnaAHLs</i> are unevenly distributed on 38 chromosomes and expanded by whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. And large-scale loss events have also occurred in evolution. All types of <i>BnaAHLs</i> are subject to purification or neutral selection, while some positive selection sites are also identified in Type-II and Type-III groups. At the same time, the purification effect of Type-I members are stronger than that of the others. In addition, RNA-seq data and <i>cis</i>-acting element analysis also suggested that the BnaAHLs play important roles in <i>B. napus</i> growth and development, as well as in response to some abiotic and biotic stresses. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified some important BnaAHL-binding proteins, which also play key roles in plant growth and development. This study is helpful to fully understand the origin and evolution of the <i>AHL</i> gene in <i>B. napus</i>, and lays the foundation for their functional studies.
