Plant auxin is essential in plant growth and development. However, the molecular mechanisms of auxin involvement in plant immunity are unclear. Here, we addressed the function of the cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) miR393-TIR1 module in plant defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection via auxin perception and signaling. <i>GhTIR1</i> was directedly cleaved by ghr-miR393 according to mRNA degradome data, 5'-RACE analysis, and a GUS reporter assay. Ghr-miR393 knockdown significantly increased plant susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i> compared to the control, while ghr-miR393 overexpression and <i>GhTIR1</i> knockdown significantly increased plant resistance. External indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) application significantly enhanced susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i> in ghr-miR393 knockdown and control plants compared to mock treatment, and only slightly increased susceptibility in overexpressing ghr-miR393 and GhTIR1-silenced plants. Application of external PEO-IAA (an auxin antagonist) had a contrary trend with IAA application. Based on yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, GhTIR1 interacted with GhIAA14 in the nucleus, and <i>GhIAA14</i> knockdown reduced plant resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> infection. The results suggested that the ghr-miR393-GhTIR1 module regulates plant defense via auxin perception and signaling. Additionally, simultaneous knockdown of <i>GhTIR1</i> and <i>GhICS1</i> significantly increased plant susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i> compared to the control, indicating that salicylic acid (SA) accumulation is vital for the ghr-miR393-GhTIR1 module to regulates plant resistance. Transcriptome data also demonstrated that <i>GhTIR1</i> knockdown significantly downregulated expression of auxin-related genes and upregulated expression of SA-related genes. Overall, the ghr-miR393-GhTIR1 module participates in plant response to <i>V. dahliae</i> infection via IAA perception and signaling partially depending on the SA defense pathway.
