['7890741', 'In order to study the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes of the plant Arabidopsis  thaliana, polyclonal antibodies were raised against five of the tryptophan  biosynthetic pathway proteins: anthranilate synthase alpha subunit,  phosphoribosylanthranilate transferase, phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase, and  the tryptophan synthase alpha and beta subunits. Immunoblot analysis of  Arabidopsis leaf protein extracts revealed that the antibodies identify the  corresponding proteins that are enriched in Arabidopsis chloroplast fractions.  Precursors of phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase and tryptophan synthase alpha  subunit were synthesized by in vitro translation. The precursors were efficiently  imported and processed by isolated spinach chloroplasts, and the cleavage sites  within the precursors were determined. These results provide the first direct  evidence that the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes from Arabidopsis are  synthesized as higher molecular weight precursors and then imported into  chloroplasts and processed into their mature forms.', '1995 Mar 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.270.11.6081', 'Last']
