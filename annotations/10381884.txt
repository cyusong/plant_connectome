['10381884', 'The photosynthetic apparatus in plant cells is associated with membranes of the  thylakoids within the chloroplast and is embedded into a highly specialized lipid  matrix. Diacylglycerol galactolipids are common in thylakoid membranes but are  excluded from all others. Isolation of the gene DGD1, encoding a  galactosyltransferase-like protein, now provides insights into assembly of the  thylakoid lipid matrix and subcellular lipid trafficking in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '1999 Jun 25', 'Science', '10.1126/science.284.5423.2181', 'Benning']
