NADP-thioredoxin reductases (NTRs) reduce thioredoxins (Trxs), using NADPH as a reductant, together constituting complete redox systems (NTS). Beside NTRA and NTRB targeted to both cytosol and mitochondria of plant cells, there is in chloroplasts an unusual NTR (NTRC) harbouring a Trx domain in a C-terminal extension, as recently reported in Oryza sativa. Although NTRC may constitute a complete NTS, it was described as a bifunctional enzyme. Because the gene is only present in photosynthetic organisms and the protein in green tissues, NTRC was thought to have a role restricted to photosynthetic cells. To determine whether NTRC from dicot plants is a bifunctional enzyme or a complete NTS, as well as to identify its putative target, NTRC from Medicago truncatula was cloned and NTRA was cloned for comparison. Here evidence is presented that MtNTRC (i) acts as an NTS and reduces dithiobisnitrobenzoate (DTNB) with a turnover (0.62 s(-1)) similar to that measured with MtNTRA in the presence of a Trxh (0.81 s(-1)); (ii) is able to use both NADPH (k(M)=2.4 microM) and NADH (k(M)=11 microM) as cofactors; (iii) efficiently reduces BAS1, a plastidial peroxiredoxin; and (iv) is expressed in both leaves and stems but unexpectedly is even more abundant in cotyledons from dry and germinating seeds. Because BAS1 is also present in both green tissues and seeds, NTRC/BAS1 may be involved in the scavenging of peroxides produced in green tissues during the day or the night and in seeds during germination. These results suggest different roles for NTRC in monocot and dicot plants.
