['16889647', 'Specific recognition of Hyaloperonospora parasitica isolate Cala2 by Arabidopsis  thaliana Ws-0 is mediated by the resistance gene RPP1A. Transient expression of  different truncations of RPP1A in tobacco leaves revealed that its TIR-NB-ARC  portion is sufficient to induce an elicitor-independent cell death. In stable  transgenic lines of Arabidopsis, overexpression of the RPP1A TIR-NB-ARC domains  (E12) using the 35S promoter leads to broad-spectrum resistance to virulent  strains of H. parasitica and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. The TIR-NB-ARC-mediated  constitutive immunity is due to activation of the salicylic acid-dependent  resistance pathway and is relieved by either a mutation in EDS1 or the presence  of the salicylate hydroxylase gene, NahG. Growth of 35S::E12 plants is reduced, a  phenotype observed in many constitutively resistant mutants. RPP1A carries a  hydrophobic peptide at its N-terminus that directs the RPP1A protein into  membranes, though it may not be the sole determinant mediating membrane  association of RPP1A. Two-phase partitioning and sucrose density gradient  sedimentation established that RPP1A resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or  Golgi apparatus.', '2006 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02834.x', 'Jones']
