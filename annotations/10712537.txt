['10712537', "Using Arabidopsis, we analyzed the effect of omission of a nitrogen source and of  the addition of different nitrogen-containing compounds on the extractable  activity and the enzyme and mRNA accumulation of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate  reductase (APR). During 72 h without a nitrogen source, the APR activity  decreased to 70% and 50% of controls in leaves and roots, respectively, while  cysteine (Cys) and glutathione contents were not affected. Northern and western  analysis revealed that the decrease of APR activity was correlated with decreased  mRNA and enzyme levels. The reduced APR activity in roots could be fully restored  within 24 h by the addition of 4 mM each of NO(3)(-), NH(4)(+), or glutamine  (Gln), or 1 mM O-acetylserine (OAS). (35)SO(4)(2-) feeding showed that after  addition of NH(4)(+), Gln, or OAS to nitrogen-starved plants, incorporation of  (35)S into proteins significantly increased in roots; however, glutathione and  Cys labeling was higher only with Gln and OAS or with OAS alone, respectively.  OAS strongly increased mRNA levels of all three APR isoforms in roots and also  those of sulfite reductase, Cys synthase, and serine acetyltransferase. Our data  demonstrate that sulfate reduction is regulated by nitrogen nutrition at the  transcriptional level and that OAS plays a major role in this regulation.", '2000 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.122.3.737', 'Kopriva']
