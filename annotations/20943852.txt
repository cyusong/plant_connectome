The MOS4-associated complex (MAC) is a highly conserved nuclear protein complex associated with the spliceosome. We recently purified the MAC from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) nuclei, identified its potential components by mass spectrometry, and showed that at least five core proteins in the MAC are required for defense responses in plants. Here, we report the characterization of a putative RNA-binding protein identified in the MAC named MAC5A and its close homolog MAC5B. We confirmed that MAC5A is a component of the MAC through coimmunoprecipitation with the previously described MAC protein CELL DIVISION CYCLE5 from Arabidopsis. In addition, like all other characterized MAC proteins, MAC5A fused to the Green Fluorescent Protein localizes to the nucleus. Double mutant analysis revealed that MAC5A and MAC5B are unequally redundant and that a double mac5a mac5b mutant results in lethality. Probably due to this partial redundancy, mac5a and mac5b single mutants do not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to virulent or avirulent pathogen infection. However, like other MAC mutations, mac5a-1 partially suppresses the autoimmune phenotypes of suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive1 (snc1), a gain-of-function mutant that expresses a deregulated Resistance protein. Our results suggest that MAC5A is a component of the MAC that contributes to snc1- mediated autoimmunity.
