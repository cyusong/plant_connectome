Root rot, mainly caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>, is the most destructive disease affecting lily (<i>Lilium</i> spp.) production. The WRKY transcription factors (TFs) have important roles during plant immune responses. To clarify the effects of WRKY TFs on plant defense responses to pathogens, a WRKY gene (<i>LrWRKY2</i>) was isolated from <i>Lilium regale</i> Wilson, which is a wild lily species highly resistant to <i>F. oxysporum</i>. The expression of <i>LrWRKY2</i>, which encodes a nuclear protein, is induced by various hormones (methyl jasmonate, ethephon, salicylic acid, and hydrogen peroxide) and by <i>F. oxysporum</i> infection. In this study, <i>LrWRKY2</i>-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants were more resistant to <i>F. oxysporum</i> than the wild-type plants. Moreover, the expression levels of jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway-related genes (<i>NtAOC, NtAOS, NtKAT, NtPACX, NtJMT, NtOPR</i>, and <i>NtLOX</i>), pathogenesis-related genes (<i>NtCHI, NtGlu2</i>, and <i>NtPR-1</i>), and antioxidant stress-related superoxide dismutase genes (<i>NtSOD, NtCu-ZnSOD</i>, and <i>MnSOD</i>) were significantly up-regulated in <i>LrWRKY2</i> transgenic tobacco lines. Additionally, the transient expression of a hairpin RNA targeting <i>LrWRKY2</i> increased the susceptibility of <i>L. regale</i> scales to <i>F. oxysporum</i>. Furthermore, an <i>F. oxysporum</i> resistance gene (<i>LrCHI2</i>) encoding a chitinase was isolated from <i>L. regale</i>. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that LrWRKY2 can bind to the <i>LrCHI2</i> promoter containing the W-box element. Yeast one-hybrid assay results suggested that LrWRKY2 can activate <i>LrCHI2</i> transcription. An examination of transgenic tobacco transformed with <i>LrWRKY2</i> and the <i>LrCHI2</i> promoter revealed that LrWRKY2 activates the <i>LrCHI2</i> promoter. Therefore, in <i>L. regale</i>, LrWRKY2 is an important positive regulator that contributes to plant defense responses to <i>F. oxysporum</i> by modulating <i>LrCHI2</i> expression.
