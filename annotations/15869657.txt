Root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was investigated in industrially polluted grassland characterized by exceptionally high phosphorus levels (up to 120 g kg(-1) soil). Along a pollution-induced nitrogen gradient, soil and tissue element concentrations of Artemisia vulgaris plants and their mycorrhizal status were determined. Additionally, we compared mycorrhization rates and above-ground biomass of A. vulgaris at N-fertilized and control plots in the N-poor area. Despite high soil and tissue P concentrations, plants from N-deficient plots, which were characterized by low tissue N concentrations and N : P ratios, were strongly colonized by AMF, whereas at a plot with comparable P levels, but higher soil and plant N concentrations and N : P ratios, mycorrhization rates were significantly lower. Correlation analyses revealed a negative relationship between percentage root colonization of A. vulgaris by AMF and both tissue N concentration and N : P ratio. Accordingly, in the fertilization experiment, control plants had higher mycorrhization rates than N-fertilized plants, whereas the species attained higher biomass at N-fertilized plots. The results suggest that N deficiency stimulates root colonization by AMF in this extraordinarily P-rich field site.

N: !stimulates! root colonization by AMF

N : P ratio: !negatively correlates with! percentage root colonization of A. vulgaris by AMF
N-fertilized plants: !have lower! mycorrhization rates than control plants
N-fertilized plots: !enhance! above-ground biomass of A. vulgaris
