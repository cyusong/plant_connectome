['19065152', "Messenger RNA (mRNA) turnover in eukaryotic cells begins with shortening of the  poly (A) tail at the 3' end, a process called deadenylation. In yeast, the  deadenylation reaction is predominantly mediated by CCR4 and CCR4-associated  factor 1 (CAF1), two components of the well-characterised protein complex named  CCR4-NOT. We report here that AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b, putative Arabidopsis homologs  of the yeast CAF1 gene, partially complement the growth defect of the yeast caf1  mutant in the presence of caffeine or at high temperatures. The expression of  AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b is induced by multiple stress-related hormones and stimuli.  Both AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b show deadenylation activity in vitro and point mutations  in the predicted active sites disrupt this activity. T-DNA insertion mutants  disrupting the expression of AtCAF1a and/or AtCAF1b are defective in  deadenylation of stress-related mRNAs, indicating that the two AtCAF1 proteins  are involved in regulated mRNA deadenylation in vivo. Interestingly, the single  and double mutants of AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b show reduced expression of  pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PR1 and PR2 and are more susceptible to  Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) infection, whereas transgenic  plants over-expressing AtCAF1a show elevated expression of PR1 and PR2 and  increased resistance to the same pathogen. Our results suggest roles of the  AtCAF1 proteins in regulated mRNA deadenylation and defence responses to pathogen  infections.", '2009 Mar', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2008.317', 'Li']
