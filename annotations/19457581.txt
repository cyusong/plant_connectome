The genes SlSTM1 and SlSTM2 (orthologs of Arabidopsis SHOOT MERISTEMLESS) and SlCUC (an ortholog of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 and CUC2) of the dioecious species Silene latifolia have been proposed to control the gynoecium suppression pathway in developing flowers. In a mutant of S. latifolia (K034) that produces no males but only asexual and imperfect female (female-like) flowers, both on the same individual, gynoecia are completely suppressed in asexual flowers and partially suppressed in female-like flowers. To determine whether these two epigenetic phenotypes in gynoecium development are caused by changes in SlSTM and SlCUC expression, we performed in situ hybridization with probes of SlSTM and SlCUC. We found two different pattern of gene expression in flower buds prior to the onset of phenotypic differentiation, which were similar to the reciprocal expression of the two genes described in male and female wild-type plants. In young K034 flower buds, 14.3% of developing structures showed female and the rest male determination. This ratio corresponds to the ratio of female-like to asexual flowers eventually produced by the K034 plants. The same ratio (7-16%) was not only found in the original mutants but also in the first and second backcross generations and in vegetative clones of the original mutant line. Hence, the switch-like and reciprocal SlSTM and SlCUC expression patterns in K034 correspond to the gynoecium suppression patterns in the wild type, suggesting that the mutation(s) responsible for the two mutant genotypes acts upstream of SlSTM and SlCUC.
