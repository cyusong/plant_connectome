Jasmonates play important roles in several plant developmental processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. This study identified a gene encoding jasmonate resistant 1 (JAR1) protein that catalyzes the production of bioactive jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L), designated as TaJAR1B. The nucleotide sequence of TaJAR1B and amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein exhibited high identity and similarity with other plant JAR1s. Feeding the culture of E. coli cells heterologously expressing TaJAR1B with jasmonic acid (JA) resulted in the production of JA-Ile, indicating the functionality of TaJAR1B in converting JA to JA-Ile. TaJAR1B was highly expressed in the internodes of adult plants and maturing seeds. Salt treatment induced the expression level of TaJAR1B in seedling tissues. Our results indicate that TaJAR1B encodes a functional JAR and is involved in the regulation of plant growth and developmental processes and response to salinity in wheat.
