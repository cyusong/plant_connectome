The Taenia solium HP6/TSOL18 antigen was produced in carrot cells, yielding an immunogenic protein that induced significant protection in an experimental murine model against T. crassiceps cysticercosis when orally administered. This result supports the potential of HP6/TSOL18-carrot as a low-cost anti-cysticercosis vaccine candidate. Cysticercosis is a zoonosis caused by Taenia solium that can be prevented by interrupting the parasite life cycle through pig vaccination. Several injectable vaccine candidates have been reported, but the logistic difficulties and costs for its application limited its use in nationwide control programs. Oral plant-based vaccines can deal with this limitation, because of their easy administration and low cost. A stable expression of the HP6/TSOL18 anti-T. solium cysticercosis protective antigen in carrot calli transformed with an optimized transgene is herein reported. An antigen accumulation up to 14 µg g(-1) of dry-weight biomass was achieved in the generated carrot lines. Mouse immunization with one of the transformed calli induced both specific IgG and IgA anti-HP6/TSOL18 antibodies. A statistically significant reduction in the expected number of T. crassiceps cysticerci was observed in mice orally immunized with carrot-made HP6/TSOL18, in a similar extent to that obtained by subcutaneous immunization with recombinant HP6/TSOL18 protein. In this study, a new oral plant-made version of the HP6/TSOL18 anti-cysticercosis vaccine is reported. The vaccine candidate should be further tested against porcine cysticercosis.
