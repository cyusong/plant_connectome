Plant sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) encoded by genes of the same sub-family are generally considered as redundant in promoting vesicle-associated membrane fusion events. Nonetheless, the application of innovative experimental approaches highlighted that members of the same gene sub-family often have different functional specificities. In this work, two closely related Qc-SNAREs--the AtSYP51 and the AtSYP52--are compared in their ability to influence different secretory pathways. Their role in the vesicle sorting to the central vacuole has been revised and they were found to have a novel inhibitory function. When transiently overexpressed, the SYP51 and the SYP52 distributed between the TGN and the tonoplast. Our data demonstrate that these SYPs (syntaxin of plants) act as t-SNARE when present on the membrane of TGN/PVC, whereas they behave as inhibitory or interfering SNAREs (i-SNAREs) when they accumulate on the tonoplast. Moreover, the performed functional analysis indicated that the AtSYP51 and the AtSYP52 roles differ in the traffic to the vacuole. The findings are a novel contribution to the functional characterization of plant SNAREs that reveals additional non-fusogenic roles.
