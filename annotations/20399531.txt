The effects of the interaction between Mn and Cd on the growth of the white lupin (Lupinus albus), uptake of these metals, their accumulation, and effects on heavy metal stress indicators were studied under glasshouse conditions. Plants were grown with and without Mn and/or Cd for 4 weeks. The absence of Mn and Cd led to lipid peroxidation-induced loss of flavonoids and anthocyanins in the roots, reduced the size of the plant canopy, and led to the appearance of proteoid roots. Sensitivity to Cd in white lupin was enhanced by a low Mn supply, despite lower Cd uptake and accumulation (leaf Mn:Cd concentration ratio <3), as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation in the leaves and strong inhibition of growth. However, when the Mn supply was adequate, the plants showed few symptoms of Cd toxicity, even though Cd uptake and accumulation increased. A Mn:Cd ratio of up to 20 was enough to minimize Cd stress in the leaf, reflecting the plants' relative tolerance to Cd under such conditions. Irrespective of the Mn supply, the increase in antioxidant compounds observed in the roots of Cd-treated plants might act as a protective mechanism by minimizing the oxidative stress caused by Cd exposure. In summary, high leaf Mn concentrations seem to render white lupins more tolerant to Cd stress.
