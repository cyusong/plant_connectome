Psb28 is a soluble protein in the photosystem II (PSII) complex, but its role in the drought stress response of wheat remains unclear. Here, we functionally characterized the <i>TaPsb28</i> gene, which positively regulates drought tolerance in wheat. When the full-length 546-bp <i>TaPsb28</i> cDNA was transferred into <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, it was located in the guard cell chloroplast around the stroma. Overexpression of <i>TaPsb28</i> conferred drought tolerance, as exhibited by the increases in the survival rate. Transgenic plants maintained lower MDA content and higher chlorophyll content by inducing chlorophyll synthase (<i>ChlG</i>) gene transcription. The content of abscisic acid (ABA) and zeatin increased significantly in wild-type (WT) plants under drought stress, and the transcriptional expression levels of <i>RD22</i>, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (<i>DFR</i>) and anthocyanin reductase (<i>ANR</i>) genes were induced, thus enhancing the contents of endogenous cyanidin, delphinidin, and proanthocyanidins. However, in transgenic plants, although anthocyanins were further aggregated, the ABA increase was inhibited, zeatin was restored to the control level under drought stress, and stomatal closure was promoted. These findings indicate ABA and zeatin have opposite synergistic effects in the process of drought tolerance caused by <i>TaPsb28</i> because only after the effect of zeatin is alleviated can ABA better play its role in promoting anthocyanin accumulation and stomatal closure, thus enhancing the drought tolerance of transgenic plants. The results suggest that overexpression of <i>TaPsb28</i> exerts a positive role in the drought response by influencing the functional metabolism of endogenous hormones. The understanding acquired through the research laid a foundation for further in-depth investigation of the function of <i>TaPsb28</i> in drought resistance in wheat, especially its relationship with anthocyanidin accumulation.
