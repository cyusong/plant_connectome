The existence of a proteolytic system which can specifically recognize and cleave proteins in mitochondria is now well established. The components of this system comprise processing peptidases, ATP-dependent peptidases and oligopeptidases. A short overview of experimentally confirmed proteases mainly from Arabidopsis thaliana is provided. The role of the mitochondrial peptidases in plant growth and development is emphasized. We also discuss the possibility of existence of as yet unidentified plant homologs of yeast mitochondrial ATP-independent proteases.
