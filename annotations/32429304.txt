Plant-parasitic nematodes secrete a series of effectors to promote parasitism by modulating host immunity, but the detailed molecular mechanism is ambiguous. Animal parasites secrete macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-like proteins for evasion of host immune systems, in which their biochemical activities play essential roles. Previous research demonstrated that MiMIF-2 effector was secreted by <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> and modulated host immunity by interacting with annexins. In this study, we show that MiMIF-2 had tautomerase activity and protected nematodes against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage. <i>MiMIF-2</i> expression not only decreased the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation during nematode infection in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but also suppressed Bax-induced cell death by inhibiting reactive oxygen species burst in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Further, RNA-seq transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR showed that the expression of some heat-shock proteins was down regulated in <i>MiMIF-2</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. After treatment with flg22, RNA-seq transcriptome analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes in <i>MiMIF-2</i> expressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> were pointed to plant hormone signal transduction, compound metabolism and plant defense. RT-qPCR and metabolomic results confirmed that salicylic acid (SA) related marker genes and SA content were significantly decreased. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of how MiMIF-2 modulates plant immunity and broaden knowledge of the intricate relationship between <i>M. incognita</i> and host plants.
