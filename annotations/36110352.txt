Mining novel and less utilized thousand grain weight (TGW) related genes are useful for improving wheat yield. In this study, a recombinant inbred line population from a cross between Zhongkemai 138 (ZKM138, high TGW) and Chuanmai 44 (CM44, low TGW) was used to construct a new Wheat 50K SNP array-derived genetic map that spanned 1,936.59 cM and contained 4, 139 markers. Based on this map, ninety-one quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected for eight grain-related traits in six environments. Among 58 QTLs, whose superior alleles were contributed by ZKM138, <i>QTgw.cib-6A</i> was a noticeable major stable QTL and was also highlighted by bulked segregant analysis with RNA sequencing (BSR-Seq). It had a pyramiding effect on TGW enhancement but no significant trade-off effect on grain number per spike or tiller number, with two other QTLs (<i>QTgw.cib-2A.2</i> and <i>QTgw.cib-6D</i>), possibly explaining the excellent grain performance of ZKM138. After comparison with known loci, <i>QTgw.cib-6A</i> was deduced to be a novel locus that differed from nearby <i>TaGW2</i> and <i>TaBT1</i>. Seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) and thirty-nine kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were finally developed to narrow the candidate interval of <i>QTgw.cib-6A</i> to 4.1 Mb. Only six genes in this interval were regarded as the most likely candidate genes. <i>QTgw.cib-6A</i> was further validated in different genetic backgrounds and presented 88.6% transmissibility of the ZKM138-genotype and a 16.4% increase of TGW in ZKM138 derivatives. And the geographic pattern of this locus revealed that its superior allele is present in only 6.47% of 433 Chinese modern wheat varieties, indicating its potential contribution to further high-yield breeding.
