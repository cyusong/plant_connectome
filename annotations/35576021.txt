Using late blight resistance genes targeting conservative effectors of Phytophthora infestans and the constructing gene pyramids may lead to durable, broad-spectrum resistance, which could be accelerated through genetic engineering. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most important food crops worldwide. In 2020, potato production was estimated to be more than 359 million tons according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Potato is affected by many pathogens, among which Phytophthora infestans, causing late blight, is of the most economic importance. Crop protection against late blight requires intensive use of fungicides, which has an impact on the environment and humans. Therefore, new potato cultivars have been bred using resistance genes against P. infestans (Rpi genes) that originate from wild relatives of potato. Such programmes were initiated 100 years ago, but the process is complex and long. The development of genetic engineering techniques has enabled the direct transfer of resistance genes from potato wild species to cultivars and easier pyramiding of multiple Rpi genes, which potentially increases the durability and spectrum of potato resistance to rapidly evolving P. infestans strains. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge concerning Rpi genes. We also discuss the use of Rpi genes in breeding as well as their detection in existing potato cultivars. Last, we review new sources of Rpi genes and new methods used to identify them and discuss interactions between P. infestans and host.
