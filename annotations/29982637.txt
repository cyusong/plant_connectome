['29982637', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that repress gene  expression. In plants, the RNase III enzyme Dicer-like (DCL1) processes primary  miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) into miRNAs. Here, we show that SMALL1 (SMA1), a homolog of  the DEAD-box pre-mRNA splicing factor Prp28, plays essential roles in miRNA  biogenesis in Arabidopsis. A hypomorphic sma1-1 mutation causes growth defects  and reduces miRNA accumulation correlated with increased target transcript  levels. SMA1 interacts with the DCL1 complex and positively influences pri-miRNA  processing. Moreover, SMA1 binds the promoter region of genes encoding pri-miRNAs  (MIRs) and is required for MIR transcription. Furthermore, SMA1 also enhances the  abundance of the DCL1 protein levels through promoting the splicing of the DCL1  pre-mRNAs. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the function of  SMA1/Prp28 in regulating miRNA abundance in plants.', '2018 Sep 28', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gky591', 'Yu']
