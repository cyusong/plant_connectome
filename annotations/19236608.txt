Chinese brake fern Pteris vittata hyperaccumulates arsenic in its fronds. In a study to identify brake fern cDNAs in arsenic resistance, we implicated a glutaredoxin, PvGRX5, because when expressed in Escherichia coli, it improved arsenic tolerance in recombinant bacteria. Here, we asked whether PvGRX5 transgenic expression would alter plant arsenic tolerance and metabolism. Two lines of Arabidopsis thaliana constitutively expressing PvGrx5 cDNA were compared with vector control and wild-type lines. PvGRX5-expressors were significantly more tolerant to arsenic compared with control lines based on germination, root growth and whole plant growth under imposed arsenic stress. PvGRX5-expressors contained significantly lower total arsenic compared with control lines following treatment with arsenate. Additionally, PvGRX5-expressors were significantly more efficient in their arsenate reduction in vivo. Together, our results indicate that PvGRX5 has a role in arsenic tolerance via improving arsenate reduction and regulating cellular arsenic levels. Paradoxically, our results suggest that PvGRX5 from the arsenic hyperaccumulator fern can be used in a novel biotechnological solution to decrease arsenic in crops.
