The aim of this Special Issue on "Plant Natural Products for Human Health" is to compile a series of scientific reports to demonstrate the medicinal potential of plant natural products, such as in vitro and in vivo activities, clinical effects, mechanisms of action, structure-activity relationships, and pharmacokinetic properties. With the global trend growing in popularity for botanical dietary supplements and phytopharmaceuticals, it is hoped that this Special Issue would serve as a timely reference for researchers and scholars who are interested in the discovery of potentially useful molecules from plant sources for health-related applications.
