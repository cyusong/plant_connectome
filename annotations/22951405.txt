['22951405', 'As energy sources and structural components, sugars are the central regulators of  plant growth and development. In addition to the abundant natural sugars in  plants, more than 50 different kinds of rare sugars exist in nature, several of  which show distinct roles in plant growth and development. Recently, one of the  rare sugars, D-allose, an epimer of D-glucose at C3, is found to suppress plant  hormone gibberellin (GA) signaling in rice. Scaffold protein RACK1A in the model  plant Arabidopsis is implicated in the GA pathway as rack1a knockout mutants show  insensitivity to GA in GA-induced seed germination. Using genetic knockout lines  and a reporter gene, the functional role of RACK1A in the D-allose pathway was  investigated. It was found that the rack1a knockout seeds showed hypersensitivity  to D-allose-induced inhibition of seed germination, implicating a role for RACK1A  in the D-allose mediated suppression of seed germination. On the other hand, a  functional RACK1A in the background of the double knockout mutations in the other  two RACK1 isoforms, rack1b/rack1c, showed significant resistance to the D-allose  induced inhibition of seed germination. The collective results implicate the  RACK1A in the D-allose mediated seed germination inhibition pathway. Elucidation  of the rare sugar signaling mechanism will help to advance understanding of this  less studied but important cellular signaling pathway.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.21995', 'Ullah']
