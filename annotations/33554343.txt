Arsenic stress causes rapid transcriptional responses in plants. However, transcriptional regulators of arsenic-induced gene expression in plants remain less well known. To date, forward genetic screens have proven limited for dissecting arsenic response mechanisms. We hypothesized that this may be due to the extensive genetic redundancy present in plant genomes. To overcome this limitation, we pursued a forward genetic screen for arsenite tolerance using a randomized library of plants expressing >2,000 artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs). This library was designed to knock-down diverse combinations of homologous gene family members within sub-clades of transcription factor and transporter gene families. We identified six transformant lines showing an altered response to arsenite in root growth assays. Further characterization of an amiRNA line targeting closely homologous CBF and ERF transcription factors show that the CBF1,2 and 3 transcription factors negatively regulate arsenite sensitivity. Furthermore, the ERF34 and ERF35 transcription factors are required for cadmium resistance. Generation of CRISPR lines, higher-order T-DNA mutants and gene expression analyses, further support our findings. These ERF transcription factors differentially regulate arsenite sensitivity and cadmium tolerance.
