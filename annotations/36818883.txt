Soil pollution by heavy metals and climate change pose substantial threats to the habitat suitability of cash crops. Discussing the suitability of cash crops in this context is necessary for the conservation and management of species. We developed a comprehensive evaluation system that is universally applicable to all plants stressed by heavy metal pollution. The MaxEnt model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of <i>Ligusticum chuanxiong</i> Hort within the study area (Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Chongqing) based on current and future climate conditions (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios). We established the current Cd pollution status in the study area using kriging interpolation and kernel density. Additionally, the three scenarios were used in prediction models to simulate future Cd pollution conditions based on current Cd pollution data. The current and future priority planting areas for <i>L. chuanxiong</i> were determined by overlay analysis, and two levels of results were obtained. The results revealed that the current first- and secondary-priority planting areas for <i>L. chuanxiong</i> were 2.06 ×10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup> and 1.64 ×10<sup>4</sup> km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Of these areas, the seven primary and twelve secondary counties for current <i>L. chuanxiong</i> cultivation should be given higher priority; these areas include Meishan, Qionglai, Pujiang, and other regions. Furthermore, all the priority zones based on the current and future scenarios were mainly concentrated on the Chengdu Plain, southeastern Sichuan and northern Chongqing. Future planning results indicated that Renshou, Pingwu, Meishan, Qionglai, Pengshan, and other regions are very important for <i>L. chuanxiong</i> planting, and a pessimistic scenario will negatively impact this potential planting. The spatial dynamics of priority areas in 2050 and 2070 clearly fluctuated under different prediction scenarios and were mainly distributed in northern Sichuan and western Chongqing. Given these results, taking reasonable measures to replan and manage these areas is necessary. This study provides. not only a useful reference for the protection and cultivation of <i>L. chuanxiong</i>, but also a framework for analyzing other cash crops.
