['30737513', 'Eukaryotic mRNAs frequently contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs),  encoding small peptides that may control translation of the main ORF (mORF).  Here, we report the characterization of a distinct bicistronic transcript in  Arabidopsis. We analysed loss-of-function phenotypes of the inorganic  polyphosphatase TRIPHOSPHATE TUNNEL METALLOENZYME 3 (AtTTM3), and found that  catalytically inactive versions of the enzyme could fully complement embryo and  growth-related phenotypes. We could rationalize these puzzling findings by  characterizing a uORF in the AtTTM3 locus encoding CELL DIVISION CYCLE PROTEIN 26  (CDC26), an orthologue of the cell cycle regulator. We demonstrate that AtCDC26  is part of the plant anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), regulates  accumulation of APC/C target proteins and controls cell division, growth and  embryo development. AtCDC26 and AtTTM3 are translated from a single transcript  conserved across the plant lineage. While there is no apparent biochemical  connection between the two gene products, AtTTM3 coordinates AtCDC26 translation  by recruiting the transcript into polysomes. Our work highlights that uORFs may  encode functional proteins in plant genomes.', '2019 Feb', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-019-0358-3', 'ORCID:']
