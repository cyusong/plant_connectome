Clubroot disease, caused by <i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i>, is a devastating disease that results in substantial yield loss in <i>Brassicaceae</i> crops worldwide. In this study, we identified a clubroot disease resistance (CR) <i>Brassica napus</i>, "Kc84R," which was obtained by mutation breeding. Genetic analysis revealed that the CR trait of "Kc84R" was controlled by a single dominant locus. We used the bulked segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-seq) approach, combined with genetic mapping based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to identify CR loci from the F<sub>2</sub> population derived from crossing CR "Kc84R" and clubroot susceptible "855S." The CR locus was mapped to a region between markers <i>Bn</i>SNP14198336 and <i>Bn</i>SNP14462201 on the A03 chromosome, and this fragment of 267 kb contained 68 annotated candidate genes. Furthermore, we performed the CR relation screening of candidate genes with the model species Arabidopsis. An ERF family transcriptional activator, <i>Bn</i>ERF034, was identified to be associated with the CR, and the corresponding Arabidopsis homozygous knockout mutants exhibited more pronounced resistance compared with the wild-type Col-0 and the transgenic lines of <i>BnERF034</i> in response to <i>P. brassicae</i> infection. Additionally, the expression analysis between resistant and susceptible materials indicated that <i>BnERF034</i> was identified to be the most likely CR candidate for the resistance in Kc84R. To conclude, this study reveals a novel gene responsible for CR. Further analysis of <i>BnERF034</i> may reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the CR of plants and provide a theoretical basis for <i>Brassicaceae</i> resistance breeding.
