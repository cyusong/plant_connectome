The predicted repertoire of type III secretion system effectors (T3SEs) in <i>Erwinia tracheiphila</i>, causal agent of cucurbit bacterial wilt, is much larger than in xylem pathogens in the closely related genera <i>Erwinia</i> and <i>Pantoea</i>. The genomes of strains BHKY and SCR3, which represent distinct <i>E. tracheiphila</i> clades, encode at least 6 clade-specific and 12 shared T3SEs. The strains expressed the majority of the T3SE genes examined in planta. Among the shared T3SE genes, <i>eop1</i> was expressed most highly in both strains in squash (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i>) and muskmelon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) but the clade-specific gene <i>avrRpm2</i> was expressed 40- to 900-fold more than <i>eop1</i> in BHKY. The T3SEs AvrRpm2, Eop1, SrfC, and DspE contributed to BHKY virulence on squash and muskmelon, as shown using combinatorial mutants involving six T3SEs, whereas OspG and AvrB4 contributed to BHKY virulence only on muskmelon, demonstrating host-specific virulence functions. Moreover, Eop1 was functionally redundant with AvrRpm2, SrfC, OspG, and AvrB4 in BHKY, and BHKY mutants lacking up to five effector genes showed similar virulence to mutants lacking only two genes. The T3SEs OspG, AvrB4, and DspE contributed additively to SCR3 virulence on muskmelon and were not functionally redundant with Eop1. Rather, loss of <i>eop1</i> and <i>avrB4</i> restored wild-type virulence to the <i>avrB4</i> mutant, suggesting that Eop1 suppresses a functionally redundant effector in SCR3. These results highlight functional differences in effector inventories between two <i>E. tracheiphila</i> clades, provide the first evidence of OspG as a phytopathogen effector, and suggest that Eop1 may be a metaeffector influencing virulence.
