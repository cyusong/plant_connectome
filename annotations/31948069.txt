['31948069', 'Formins are evolutionarily conserved multi-domain proteins participating in the  control of both actin and microtubule dynamics. Angiosperm formins form two  evolutionarily distinct families, Class I and Class II, with class-specific  domain layouts. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has 21 formin-encoding loci,  including 10 Class II members. In this study, we analyze the subcellular  localization of two A. thaliana Class II formins exhibiting typical domain  organization, the so far uncharacterized formin AtFH13 (At5g58160) and its  distant homolog AtFH14 (At1g31810), previously reported to bind microtubules.  Fluorescent protein-tagged full length formins and their individual domains were  transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves under the control of a  constitutive promoter and their subcellular localization (including  co-localization with cytoskeletal structures and the endoplasmic reticulum) was  examined using confocal microscopy. While the two formins exhibit distinct and  only partially overlapping localization patterns, they both associate with  microtubules via the conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain and with the  periphery of the endoplasmic reticulum, at least in part via the N-terminal PTEN  (Phosphatase and Tensin)-like domain. Surprisingly, FH2 domains of AtFH13 and  AtFH14 can form heterodimers in the yeast two-hybrid assay-a first case of  potentially biologically relevant formin heterodimerization mediated solely by  the FH2 domain.', '2020 Jan 5', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms21010348', 'ORCID:']
