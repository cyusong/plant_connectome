['27609835', 'Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathways have been well-characterized in  bacteria and chloroplasts. Genes encoding a TatC protein are found in almost all  plant mitochondrial genomes but to date these have not been extensively  investigated. For the first time it could be demonstrated that this  mitochondrial-encoded TatC is a functional gene that is translated into a protein  in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana A TatB--like subunit localized to the  inner membrane was also identified that is nuclear-encoded and is essential for  plant growth and development, indicating that plants potentially require a Tat  pathway for mitochondrial biogenesis.', '2016 Oct 15', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.190975', 'Soll']
