A lot of researches have been focused on the evolution and function of MYB transcription factors (TFs). For revealing the formation of petunia flower color diversity, MYB gene family in petunia was identified and analyzed. In this study, a total of 155 MYB genes, including 40 1R-MYBs, 106 R2R3-MYBs, 7 R1R2R3-MYBs and 2 4R-MYBs, have been identified in the <i>Petunia axillaris</i> genome. Most R2R3 genes contain three exons and two introns, whereas the number of PaMYB introns varies from 0 to 12. The R2R3-MYB members could be divided into 28 subgroups. Analysis of gene structure and protein motifs revealed that members within the same subgroup presented similar exon/intron and motif organization, further supporting the results of phylogenetic analysis. Genes in subgroup 10, 11 and 21 were mainly expressed in petal, not in vegetative tissues. Genes in subgroup 9, 19, 25 and 27 expressed in all tissues, but the expression patterns of each gene were different. According to the promoter analysis, five R2R3-MYB and two MYB-related genes contained MBSI cis-element, which was involved in flavonoid biosynthetic regulation. <i>PaMYB100/DPL</i> has been reported to positively regulate to pigmentation. However, although <i>PaMYB82</i>, <i>PaMYB68</i> and <i>Pa1RMYB36</i> contained MBSI cis-element, their function in flavonoid biosynthesis has not been revealed. Consistent with existing knowledge, PaMYBs in subgroup 11 had similar function to AtMYBs in subgroup 6, genes in which played an important role in anthocyanin biosynthesis. In addition, <i>PaMYB1</i> and <i>PaMYB40</i> belonged to P9 (S7) and were potentially involved in regulation of flavonoid synthesis in petunia vegetative organs. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the MYB gene family in petunia and lays a significant foundation for future studies on the function and evolution of MYB genes in petunia.
