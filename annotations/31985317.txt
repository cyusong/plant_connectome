Carbon dioxide efflux (<i>E</i><sub>s</sub>) from the base of <i>Cycas micronesica</i> K.D. Hill stems was quantified in four locations containing healthy populations and in one location with populations threatened by non-native insect herbivores in order to determine the influence of reduced plant health on <i>E</i><sub>s</sub>. Minimal variation of <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> occurred among the four locations with healthy plants, and <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> ranged from 1.68 to 1.79 µmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup>. The threatened <i>in situ</i> populations were on the island of Guam, where recent invasions of non-native insects have caused epidemic plant mortality, and the <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> was 0.59 µmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup>. This is the first known report of <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> for any cycad species, and the values for the unique pachycaulous stem form fit in the lower half of the range of published <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> for woody trees. The results illuminate the potential for using <i>E</i><sub>s</sub> to screen <i>in situ C. micronesica</i> populations to identify the individual trees with the greatest likelihood of surviving conservation measures.
