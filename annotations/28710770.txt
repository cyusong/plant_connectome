['28710770', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades are conserved mechanisms of  signal transduction across eukaryotes. Despite the importance of MPK proteins in  signaling events, specific roles for many Arabidopsis MPK proteins remain  unknown. Multiple studies have suggested roles for MPK signaling in a variety of  auxin-related processes. To identify MPK proteins with roles in auxin response,  we screened mpk insertional alleles and identified mpk1-1 as a mutant that  displays hypersensitivity in auxin-responsive cell expansion assays. Further,  mutants defective in the upstream MAP kinase kinase MKK3 also display  hypersensitivity in auxin-responsive cell expansion assays, suggesting that this  MPK cascade affects auxin-influenced cell expansion. We found that MPK1 interacts  with and phosphorylates ROP BINDING PROTEIN KINASE 1 (RBK1), a protein kinase  that interacts with members of the Rho-like GTPases from Plants (ROP) small  GTPase family. Similar to mpk1-1 and mkk3-1 mutants, rbk1 insertional mutants  display auxin hypersensitivity, consistent with a possible role for RBK1  downstream of MPK1 in influencing auxin-responsive cell expansion. We found that  RBK1 directly phosphorylates ROP4 and ROP6, supporting the possibility that RBK1  effects on auxin-responsive cell expansion are mediated through  phosphorylation-dependent modulation of ROP activity. Our data suggest a MKK3 *  MPK1 * RBK1 phosphorylation cascade that may provide a dynamic module for  altering cell expansion.', '2017 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13635', 'ORCID:']
