Sugar acts as a signal molecule and plays a pivotal role in plant development and stress response. Neutral/alkaline invertases found only in photosynthetic bacteria and plants is sucrose-specific enzymes cleave sucrose into glucose and fructose. We have identified a gene for neutral/alkaline invertase in Arabidopsis designated as AtCYT-INV1 which is involved in sugar/ABA signaling and plays multiple roles in plant development and osmotic stress-induced inhibition on lateral root growth.
