Phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is a thylakoid-embedded electron carrier essential for photosynthesis. Paradoxically, we found that phylloquinone biosynthesis is retained in the nonphotosynthetic holoparasite <i>Phelipanche aegyptiaca</i> (Egyptian broomrape). The phylloquinone pathway genes are preferentially expressed during development of the invasive organ, the haustorium, and exhibit strong coexpression with redox-active proteins known to be involved in parasitism. Unlike in photoautotrophic taxa, the late pathway genes of the holoparasite lack the chloroplast-targeting sequence and their proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane instead. Plasma membrane phylloquinone may enable <i>Phelipanche</i> to sense changes in the redox environment during host interactions. The N-truncated isoforms are conserved in several other Orobanchaceae root holoparasites, and interestingly, in a number of closely related photoautotrophic species as well. This suggests an ancient origin of distinct phylloquinone pathways predating the evolution of parasitic plants in the Orobanchaceae. These findings represent exciting opportunities to probe plasma membrane phylloquinone function and diversification in parasitic and nonparasitic plant responses to external redox chemistry in the rhizosphere.
