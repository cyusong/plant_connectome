['25609555', 'Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by plant pattern  recognition receptors to activate PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI).  Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), as well as other cytoplasmic kinases,  integrate upstream immune signals and, in turn, dissect PTI signaling via  different substrates to regulate defense responses. However, only a few direct  substrates of these signaling kinases have been identified. Here, we show that  PAMP perception enhances phosphorylation of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ETHYL  METHANESULFONATE-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1), a transcription factor involved in  brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway, through pathogen-induced MAPKs in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). BES1 interacts with MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN  KINASE6 (MPK6) and is phosphorylated by MPK6. bes1 loss-of-function mutants  display compromised resistance to bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv  tomato DC3000. BES1 S286A/S137A double mutation (BES1(SSAA)) impairs PAMP-induced  phosphorylation and fails to restore bacterial resistance in bes1 mutant,  indicating a positive role of BES1 phosphorylation in plant immunity. BES1 is  phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase3 (GSK3)-like kinase BR-insensitive2  (BIN2), a negative regulator of BR signaling. BR perception inhibits BIN2  activity, allowing dephosphorylation of BES1 to regulate plant development.  However, BES1(SSAA) does not affect BR-mediated plant growth, suggesting  differential residue requirements for the modulation of BES1 phosphorylation in  PTI and BR signaling. Our study identifies BES1 as a unique direct substrate of  MPK6 in PTI signaling. This finding reveals MAPK-mediated BES1 phosphorylation as  another BES1 modulation mechanism in plant cell signaling, in addition to  GSK3-like kinase-mediated BES1 phosphorylation and F box protein-mediated BES1  degradation.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.250985', 'Zhang']
