Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes successfully exploit various phytohormone signaling pathways to establish a new hormonal equilibrium that facilitates nematode parasitism. Although it is largely accepted that ethylene regulates plant responses to nematode infection, a mechanistic understanding of how ethylene shapes plant-nematode interactions remains largely unknown. In this study, we examined the involvement of various components regulating ethylene perception and signaling in establishing Arabidopsis susceptibility to the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii using a large set of well-characterized single and higher order mutants. Our analyses revealed the existence of two pathways that separately engage ethylene with salicylic acid (SA) and cytokinin signaling during plant response to nematode infection. One pathway involves the canonical ethylene signaling pathway in which activation of ethylene signaling results in suppression of SA-based immunity. The second pathway involves the ethylene receptor ETR1, which signals independently of SA acid to affect immunity, instead altering cytokinin-mediated regulation of downstream components. Our results reveal important mechanisms through which cyst nematodes exploit components of ethylene perception and signaling to affect the balance of hormonal signaling through ethylene interaction with SA and cytokinin networks. This hormonal interaction overcomes plant defense and provokes a susceptible response.
