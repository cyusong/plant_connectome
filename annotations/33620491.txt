In response to changing light quantity and quality, photosynthetic organisms perform state transitions, a process which optimizes photosynthetic yield and mitigates photo-damage. The serine/threonine-protein kinase STN7 phosphorylates the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (PSII; light-harvesting complex II), which then migrates from PSII to photosystem I (PSI), thereby rebalancing the light excitation energy between the photosystems and restoring the redox poise of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Two conserved cysteines forming intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds in the lumenal domain (LD) of STN7 are essential for the kinase activity although it is still unknown how activation of the kinase is regulated. In this study, we show lumen thiol oxidoreductase 1 (LTO1) is co-expressed with STN7 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and interacts with the LD of STN7 in vitro and in vivo. LTO1 contains thioredoxin (TRX)-like and vitamin K epoxide reductase domains which are related to the disulfide-bond formation system in bacteria. We further show that the TRX-like domain of LTO1 is able to oxidize the conserved lumenal cysteines of STN7 in vitro. In addition, loss of LTO1 affects the kinase activity of STN7 in Arabidopsis. Based on these results, we propose that LTO1 helps to maintain STN7 in an oxidized active state in state 2 through redox interactions between the lumenal cysteines of STN7 and LTO1.
