Targeted gene regulation on a genome-wide scale is a powerful strategy for interrogating, perturbing, and engineering cellular systems. Recent advances with the RNA-mediated Cas9 endonuclease derived from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) systems have dramatically transformed our ability to specifically modify intact genomes of diverse cells and organisms. The CRISPR-Cas system has been adapted as an efficient, facile, and robust gene-targeting technology with the potential for high-throughput and multiplexed genome engineering. Exciting breakthroughs in understanding the mechanisms of the CRISPR-Cas system and its enormous potential for applications across basic science, agricultural and biotechnology.
