This research provides comprehensive insight into the molecular networks and molecular mechanisms underlying D. officinale flower development. Flowers are complex reproductive organs and play a crucial role in plant propagation, while also providing sustenance for insects and natural bioactive metabolites for humans. However, knowledge about gene regulation and floral metabolomes in flowers is limited. In this study, we used an important orchid species (Dendrobium officinale), whose flowers can be used to make herbal tea, to perform transcriptome sequencing and metabolic profiling of early- and medium-stage flower buds, as well as opened flowers, to provide comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying flower development. A total of 8019 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 239 differentiated metabolites were found. The transcription factors that were identified and analyzed belong exclusively to the MIKC-type MADS-box proteins and auxin responsive factors that are known to be involved in flower development. The expression of genes involved in chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis strongly matched the metabolite accumulation patterns. The genes related to flavonoid and polysaccharide biosynthesis were active during flower development. Interestingly, indole-3-acetic acid and abscisic acid, whose trend of accumulation was inverse during flower development, may play an important role in this process. Collectively, the identification of DEGs and differentiated metabolites could help to illustrate the regulatory networks and molecular mechanisms important for flower development in this orchid.
