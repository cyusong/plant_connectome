Plant cell deformations are driven by cell pressurization and mechanical constraints imposed by the nanoscale architecture of the cell wall, but how these factors are controlled at the genetic and molecular levels to achieve different types of cell deformation is unclear. Here, we used stomatal guard cells to investigate the influences of wall mechanics and turgor pressure on cell deformation and demonstrate that the expression of the pectin-modifying gene PECTATE LYASE LIKE12 (PLL12) is required for normal stomatal dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using nanoindentation and finite element modeling to simultaneously measure wall modulus and turgor pressure, we found that both values undergo dynamic changes during induced stomatal opening and closure. PLL12 is required for guard cells to maintain normal wall modulus and turgor pressure during stomatal responses to light and to tune the levels of calcium crosslinked pectin in guard cell walls. Guard cell-specific knockdown of PLL12 caused defects in stomatal responses and reduced leaf growth, which were associated with lower cell proliferation but normal cell expansion. Together, these results force us to revise our view of how wall-modifying genes modulate wall mechanics and cell pressurization to accomplish the dynamic cellular deformations that underlie stomatal function and tissue growth in plants.
