['26452715', 'Yak1 is a member of dual-specificity Tyr phosphorylation-regulated kinases  (DYRKs) that are evolutionarily conserved. The downstream targets of Yak1 and  their functions are largely unknown. Here, a homologous protein AtYAK1 was  identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and the phosphoprotein profiles of the wild  type and an atyak1 mutant were compared on two-dimensional gel following Pro-Q  Diamond phosphoprotein gel staining. Annexin1, Annexin2 and RBD were  phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues by the AtYak1 kinase. Annexin1,  Annexin2 and Annexin4 were also phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. Our study  demonstrated that AtYak1 is a dual specificity protein kinase in Arabidopsis that  may regulate the phosphorylation status of the annexin family proteins.', '2015 Oct 24', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2015.09.025', 'Xiong']
