Cellular total RNA level is usually stable, although it may increase gradually during growth or seed germination, or decrease gradually under environmental stresses. However, we found that plant cell RNA could be doubled within 48 h in response to herbicide-induced Mg-protoporphyrin and heme accumulation or a high level of sugar treatment. This rapid RNA multiplication is important for effective cellular resistance to oxidative stress, such as high-light and herbicide co-stress conditions, where the plastid-signalling defective mutant gun1 shows an apparent phenotype (more severe photobleaching). Hexokinase is required for sugar-induced RNA multiplication. While both sugar and Mg-protoporphyrin IX require plastid protein GUN1 and a nuclear transcription factor ABI4, haem appears to function through an independent pathway to control RNA multiplication. The transcription co-factor CAAT binding protein mediates the rapid RNA multiplication in plant cells in all the cases.
