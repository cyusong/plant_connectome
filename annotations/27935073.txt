Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ), two important signaling molecules, are stimulated in plants by abiotic stresses. In this study, we investigated the role of NO and its interplay with H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in the response of self-grafted (S-G) and salt-tolerant pumpkin-grafted (Cucurbita maxima × C. moschata) cucumber seedlings to 80 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub> )<sub>2</sub> stress. Endogenous NO and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production in S-G seedlings increased in a time-dependent manner, reaching maximum levels after 24 h of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub> )<sub>2</sub> stress. In contrast, a transient increase in NO production, accompanied by H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, was observed at 2 h in rootstock-grafted plants. N<sup>w</sup> -Nitro-l-Arg methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), tungstate, an inhibitor of nitrate reductase (NR), and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethy-limidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), a scavenger of NO, were found to significantly inhibit NO accumulation induced by salt stress in rootstock-grafted seedlings. H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production was unaffected by these stress conditions. Ca(NO<sub>3</sub> )<sub>2</sub> stress-induced NO accumulation was blocked by pretreatment with an H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> scavenger (dimethylthiourea, DMTU) and an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium, DPI). In addition, maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), as well as the activities and transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes, were significantly decreased by salt stress in rootstock grafted seedlings after pretreatment with these above inhibitors; antioxidant enzyme transcript levels and activities were higher in rootstock-grafted seedlings compared with S-G seedlings. These results suggest that rootstock grafting could alleviate the oxidative damage induced by Ca(NO<sub>3</sub> )<sub>2</sub> stress in cucumber seedlings, an effect that may be attributable to the involvement of NO in H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -dependent antioxidative metabolism.
