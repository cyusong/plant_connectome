Traditionally, reference genomes in crop species rely on the assembly of one accession, thus occulting most of intraspecific diversity. However, rearrangements, gene duplications, and transposable element content may have a large impact on the genomic structure, which could generate new phenotypic traits. Comparing two <i>Brassica rapa</i> genomes recently sequenced and assembled using long-read technology and optical mapping, we investigated structural variants and repetitive content between the two accessions and genome size variation among a core collection. We explored the structural consequences of the presence of large repeated sequences in <i>B. rapa</i> 'Z1' genome vs. the <i>B. rapa</i> 'Chiifu' genome, using comparative genomics and cytogenetic approaches. First, we showed that large genomic variants on chromosomes A05, A06, A09, and A10 are due to large insertions and inversions when comparing <i>B. rapa</i> 'Z1' and <i>B. rapa</i> 'Chiifu' at the origin of important length differences in some chromosomes. For instance, lengths of 'Z1' and 'Chiifu' A06 chromosomes were estimated <i>in silico</i> to be 55 and 29 Mb, respectively. To validate these observations, we compared using fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) the two A06 chromosomes present in an F1 hybrid produced by crossing these two varieties. We confirmed a length difference of 17.6% between the A06 chromosomes of 'Z1' compared to 'Chiifu.' Alternatively, using a copy number variation approach, we were able to quantify the presence of a higher number of rDNA and gypsy elements in 'Z1' genome compared to 'Chiifu' on different chromosomes including A06. Using flow cytometry, the total genome size of 12 <i>Brassica</i> accessions corresponding to a <i>B. rapa</i> available core collection was estimated and revealed a genome size variation of up to 16% between these accessions as well as some shared inversions. This study revealed the contribution of long-read sequencing of new accessions belonging to different cultigroups of <i>B. rapa</i> and highlighted the potential impact of differential insertion of repeat elements and inversions of large genomic regions in genome size intraspecific variability.
