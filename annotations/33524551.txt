Growth and immunity are opposing processes that compete for cellular resources, and proper resource allocation is crucial for plant survival. BSK1 plays a key role in the regulation of both growth and immunity by associating with BRI1 and FLS2, respectively. However, it remains unclear how two antagonistic signals co-opt BSK1 to induce signal-specific activation. Here we show that the dynamic spatial reorganization of BSK1 within the plasma membrane underlies the mechanism of signal-specific activation for growth or immunity. Resting BSK1 localizes to membrane rafts as complexes. Unlike BSK1-associated FLS2 and BRI1, flg22 or exogenous brassinosteroid (BR) treatment did not decrease BSK1 levels at the plasma membrane (PM) but rather induced BSK1 multimerization and dissociation from FLS2/BSK1 or BRI1/BSK1, respectively. Moreover, flg22-activated BSK1 translocated from membrane rafts to non-membrane-raft regions, whereas BR-activated BSK1 remained in membrane rafts. When applied together with flg22, BR suppressed various flg22-induced BSK1 activities such as BSK1 dissociation from FLS2/BSK1, BSK1 interaction with MAPKKK5, and BSK translocation together with MAPKKK5. Taken together, this study provides a unique insight into how the precise control of BSK1 spatiotemporal organization regulates the signaling specificity to balance plant growth and immunity.
