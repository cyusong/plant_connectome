Auxin, represented by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), has for a long time been studied mainly with respect to the development of land plants, and recent evidence confirms that canonical nuclear auxin signaling is a land plant apomorphy. Increasing sequential and physiological data show that the presence of auxin transport machinery pre-dates the emergence of canonical signaling. In this review, we summarize the present state of knowledge regarding the origins of auxin transport in the green lineage (Viridiplantae), integrating both data from wet lab experiments and sequence evidence on the presence of PIN-FORMED (PIN), PIN-LIKES (PILS), and AUXIN RESISTANT 1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) homologs. We discuss a high divergence of auxin carrier homologs among algal lineages and emphasize the urgent need for the establishment of good molecular biology models from within the streptophyte green algae. We further postulate and discuss two hypotheses for the ancestral role of auxin in the green lineage. First, auxin was present as a by-product of cell metabolism and the evolution of its transport was stimulated by the need for IAA sequestration and cell detoxification. Second, auxin was primarily a signaling compound, possibly of bacterial origin, and its activity in the pre-plant green algae was a consequence of long-term co-existence with bacteria in shared ecological consortia.
