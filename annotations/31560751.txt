Histone methylation plays a fundamental role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression driven by developmental and environmental cues in plants, including Arabidopsis. Histone methyltransferases and demethylases act as 'writers' and 'erasers' of methylation at lysine and/or arginine residues of core histones, respectively. A third group of proteins, the 'readers', recognize and interpret the methylation marks. Emerging evidence confirms the crucial roles of histone methylation in multiple biological processes throughout the plant life cycle. In this review, we summarize the regulatory mechanisms of lysine methylation, especially at histone H3 tails, and focus on the recent advances regarding the roles of lysine methylation in Arabidopsis development, from seed performance to reproductive development, and in callus formation.
