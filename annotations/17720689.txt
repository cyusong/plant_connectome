The Arabidopsis mutant hypersenescence 1 (hys1), that is allelic to constitutive expresser of pathogenesis-related genes 5 (cpr5), displays phenotypes related to glucose signalling and defence responses. In the present study, it is shown that the hys1 mutation boosts the inhibitory effects of glucose upon the greening of seedlings and reduces the antagonistic activities of ethylene and cytokinin toward this inhibition. Neither the glucose content nor the sensitivities to ethylene, cytokinin, and abscisic acid were found to differ between wild-type and hys1 seedlings. However, disruption of the gene encoding hexokinase1 (HXK1), which acts as a glucose sensor, partially suppressed the glucose hypersensitive phenotype of the hys1 mutant. These results thus suggest that the hys1 mutation promotes a process associated with the HXK1-mediated glucose response during greening. By contrast, additional hys1 phenotypes, including an increase in salicylic acid (SA), production of abnormal trichomes, and early senescence, were not suppressed by the loss of HXK1. Surprisingly, the hxk1 and hys1 mutations acted synergistically towards an increased SA accumulation. Hence, HYS1/CPR5 appears to be a versatile protein that modulates both the HXK1-mediated glucose response and various HXK1-indepndent processes that are involved in growth control. A possible role for HYS1/CPR5 as a component of the networks that regulate growth control is discussed.
