['18000043', 'Auxin is an essential regulator for plant development. To elucidate the  mechanisms by which auxin regulates plant development, we isolated an Arabidopsis  mutant naked pins in yuc mutants 1 (npy1) that develops pin-like inflorescences  and fails to initiate any flowers in yuc1 yuc4, a background that is defective in  auxin biosynthesis. The phenotypes of npy1 yuc1 yuc4 triple mutants closely  resemble those of Arabidopsis mutants pin-formed1 (pin1), pinoid (pid), and  monopteros (mp), which are defective in either auxin transport or auxin  signaling. NPY1 belongs to a large family of proteins and is homologous to  NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH3), a BTB/POZ protein that regulates phototropic  responses along with the protein kinase PHOT1 (Phototropin 1). We demonstrate  that NPY1 works with the protein kinase PID, which is homologous to PHOT1, to  regulate auxin-mediated plant development. The npy1 pid double mutants fail to  form any cotyledons, a phenotype that is also observed in yuc1 yuc4 pid triple  mutants. Interestingly, both auxin-regulated organogenesis and phototropic  responses require an auxin response factor (ARF). Disruption of ARF7/NPH4 leads  to nonphototropic hypocotyls and arf5/mp forms pin-like inflorescences. Whereas  the PHOT1/NPH3 pathway is regulated by light, our data suggest that the PID/NPY1  pathway may be regulated by auxin synthesized by the YUC flavin monooxygenases.  Our findings put YUCs, PID, and NPY1 into a genetic framework for further  dissecting the mechanisms of auxin action in plant development.', '2007 Nov 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0708506104', 'Zhao']
