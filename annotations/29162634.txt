Recent progress has revealed aspects of the molecular mechanisms that allow myosin motors to carry outtheir physiological functions.

Myosin: !carries out! Physiological functions
Gene: !affects! Myosin
Gene: !localizes to! Cellular structures
Gene: !interacts with! Other proteins
Gene: !enhances! Motor activity
Gene: !represses! Motor activity
Gene: !synthesizes! Myosin
