Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (called pistillody) has been reported in cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) having the cytoplasm of a wild relative species, Aegilops crassa. Our previous studies indicated that pistillody is caused by alterations of the class B MADS-box gene expression pattern associated with mitochondrial gene(s) in the Ae. crassa cytoplasm. To elucidate the nuclear gene involved in the cross-talk between pistillody-related mitochondrial gene(s) and nuclear homeotic genes, we performed cDNA subtraction analysis using cDNAs derived from young spikes of a pistillody line and a normal line. As a result, we identified a protein kinase gene, WPPK1 (wheat pistillody-related protein kinase 1), which is upregulated in the young spikes of the pistillody line. RT-PCR analysis indicated that WPPK1 is strongly expressed in pistils and pistil-like stamens in the pistillody line, suggesting that it is involved in the formation of pistil-like stamens as well as pistils. The full-length cDNA sequence for WPPK1 showed high similarity with a flowering plant PVPK-1 protein kinase, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that it is a member of AGC group protein kinases. Furthermore, a phosphorylation assay indicated that it has protein kinase activity. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that WPPK1 is expressed in developing pistils and pistil-like stamens as well as in their primordia. These indicate that in the alloplasmic line, WPPK1 plays a role in formation and development of pistil-like stamens.
