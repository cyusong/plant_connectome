Saline soils are a major challenge in agriculture, and salinization is increasing worldwide due to climate change and destructive agricultural practices. Excessive amounts of salt in soils cause imbalances in ion distribution, physiological dehydration, and oxidative stress in plants. Breeding and genetic engineering methods to improve plant salt tolerance and the better use of saline soils are being explored; however, these approaches can take decades to accomplish. A shorter-term approach to improve plant salt tolerance is to be inoculated with bacteria with high salt tolerance or adjusting the balance of bacteria in the rhizosphere, including endosymbiotic bacteria (living in roots or forming a symbiont) and exosymbiotic bacteria (living on roots). Rhizosphere bacteria promote plant growth and alleviate salt stress by providing minerals (such as nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium) and hormones (including auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid) or by reducing ethylene production. Plant growth-promoting rhizosphere bacteria are a promising tool to restore agricultural lands and improve plant growth in saline soils. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of plant growth-promoting bacteria under salt stress and their applications for improving plant salt tolerance to provide a theoretical basis for further use in agricultural systems.
