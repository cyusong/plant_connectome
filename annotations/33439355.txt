Genome-wide identification, tissue-specific and stress expression analyses and functional characterization of PbrATG8s genes were conducted and the role of PbrATG8c in Botryosphaeria dothidea resistance was further investigated. Autophagy plays an important role in plant growth, development and stress tolerance. ATG8 has been reported to be an autophagy marker in many species. However, there is little information regarding ATG8 family members in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd). We performed a genome-wide analysis and identified nine PbrATG8 gene family members in pear. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PbrATG8 genes clustered into four major groups (Groups I-IV). Eight PbrATG8 genes were successfully mapped to 6 of the 17 chromosomes of the pear genome. The synteny results showed that two pairs are collinear. Gene expression data showed that all genes were differentially expressed in a range of pear tissues. Transcript analysis of PbrATG8 genes under dehydration, salt and pathogen infection stresses revealed that PbrATG8c responded to all test stresses. The PbrATG8c protein was localized in the nucleus and membrane. The silencing of PbrATG8c decreased the resistance to Botryosphaeria dothidea in pear. This study provides insights and rich resources for subsequent investigations of autophagy in pear.
