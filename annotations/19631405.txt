Perception of elicitors triggers plant defense responses via various early signal transduction pathways. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) stimulates defense responses in grapevine (Vitis vinifera). We investigated the involvement of various partners (calcium, ROS, reversible phosphorylation) in MeJA-induced responses by using a pharmacological approach. We used specific calcium channel effectors and inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases, superoxide dismutase and NAD(P)H oxidase and investigated production of stilbenes (resveratrol and its glucoside, piceid, the major form), which are the grapevine phytoalexins. RNA accumulation of two genes encoding enzymes involved in stilbene synthesis (PAL and STS), three genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins (CHIT4C, PIN and GLU) and one gene encoding an enzyme producing jasmonates (LOX) were also assessed. Calcium and its origin seemed to play a major role in MeJA-induced grapevine defense responses. Phytoalexin production was strongly affected if calcium from the influx plasma membrane was inhibited, whereas calcium from the intracellular compartments did not seem to be involved. ROS production seemed to interfere with MeJA-stimulated defense responses, and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events also played a direct role.
