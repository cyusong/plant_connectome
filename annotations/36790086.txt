N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP) accumulates in pathogen-inoculated and distant leaves of the Arabidopsis shoot and induces systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in dependence of the salicylic acid (SA) receptor NPR1. We report here that SAR triggered by exogenous NHP treatment requires the function of the transcription factors TGA2/5/6 in addition to NPR1, and is further positively affected by TGA1/4. Consistently, a tga2/5/6 triple knockout mutant is fully impaired in NHP-induced SAR gene expression, while a tga1/4 double mutant shows an attenuated, partial transcriptional response to NHP. Moreover, tga2/5/6 and tga1/4 exhibited fully and strongly impaired pathogen-triggered SAR, respectively, while SA-induced resistance was more moderately compromised in both lines. At the same time, tga2/5/6 was not and tga1/4 only partially impaired in the accumulation of NHP and SA at sites of bacterial attack. Strikingly, SAR gene expression in the systemic tissue induced by local bacterial inoculation or locally applied NHP fully required functional TGA2/5/6 and largely depended on TGA1/4 factors. The systemic accumulation of NHP and SA was attenuated but not abolished in the SAR-compromised and transcriptionally blocked tga mutants, suggesting their transport from inoculated to systemic tissue. Our results indicate the existence of a critical TGA- and NPR1-dependent transcriptional module that mediates the induction of SAR and systemic defence gene expression by NHP.
