['10521521', 'The abnormal inflorescence meristem1 (aim1) mutation affects inflorescence and  floral development in Arabidopsis. After the transition to reproductive growth,  the aim1 inflorescence meristem becomes disorganized, producing abnormal floral  meristems and resulting in plants with severely reduced fertility. The derived  amino acid sequence of AIM1 shows extensive similarity to the cucumber  multifunctional protein involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids, which  possesses l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydrolyase, l-3-hydroxyacyl-dehydrogenase,  d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase, and Delta(3), Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerase  activities. A defect in beta-oxidation has been confirmed by demonstrating the  resistance of the aim1 mutant to 2,4-diphenoxybutyric acid, which is converted to  the herbicide 2,4-D by the beta-oxidation pathway. In addition, the loss of AIM1  alters the fatty acid composition of the mature adult plant.', '1999 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.10.1911', 'Bleecker']
