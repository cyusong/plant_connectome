Arabidopsis CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1/SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (COP1/SPA) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that prevents photomorphogenesis in darkness by ubiquitinating and subsequently degrading light-responsive transcription factors. Upon light perception, photoreceptors directly interact with the COP1/SPA complex to suppress its activity. In blue light (450-500 nm of visible spectrum), COP1/SPA activity is inhibited by the cryptochrome photoreceptors (CRY1 and CRY2), FKF1 from the ZEITLUPE family as well as phytochrome A. Together, these photoreceptors regulate vital aspects of plant growth and development from seedling stage to the induction of flowering. This review presents and discusses the recent advances in blue light-mediated suppression of COP1/SPA activity.
