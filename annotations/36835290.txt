As sessile organisms, plants have evolved complex mechanisms to rapidly respond to ever-changing ambient temperatures. Temperature response in plants is modulated by a multilayer regulatory network, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Alternative splicing (AS) is an essential post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Extensive studies have confirmed its key role in plant temperature response, from adjustment to diurnal and seasonal temperature changes to response to extreme temperatures, which has been well documented by previous reviews. As a key node in the temperature response regulatory network, AS can be modulated by various upstream regulations, such as chromatin modification, transcription rate, RNA binding proteins, RNA structure and RNA modifications. Meanwhile, a number of downstream mechanisms are affected by AS, such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, translation efficiency and production of different protein variants. In this review, we focus on the links between splicing regulation and other mechanisms in plant temperature response. Recent advances regarding how AS is regulated and the following consequences in gene functional modulation in plant temperature response will be discussed. Substantial evidence suggests that a multilayer regulatory network integrating AS in plant temperature response has been unveiled.
