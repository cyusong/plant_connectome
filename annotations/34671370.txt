Abiotic stresses, such as salinity, drought, and nutrient deficiency adversely affect nitrogen (N) uptake and assimilation in plants. However, the regulation of N metabolism and N pathway genes in <i>Sophora japonica</i> under abiotic stresses is unclear. <i>Sophora japonica</i> seedlings were subjected to drought (5% polyethylene glycol 6,000), salinity (75mM NaCl), or low N (0.01mM NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) for 3weeks in a semi-hydroponic phenotyping platform. Salinity and low N negatively affected plant growth, while drought promoted root growth and inhibited aboveground growth. The NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ratio increased under all three treatments with the exception of a reduction in leaves under salinity. Drought significantly increased leaf NO<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup> concentrations. Nitrate reductase (NR) activity was unaltered or increased under stresses with the exception of a reduction in leaves under salinity. Drought enhanced ammonium assimilation with increased glutamate synthase (GOGAT) activity, although glutamine synthetase (GS) activity remained unchanged, whereas salinity and low N inhibited ammonium assimilation with decreased GS activity under salt stress and decreased GOGAT activity under low N treatment. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity also changed dramatically under different stresses. Additionally, expression changes of genes involved in N reduction and assimilation were generally consistent with related enzyme activities. In roots, ammonium transporters, especially <i>SjAMT1.1</i> and <i>SjAMT2.1a</i>, showed higher transcription under all three stresses; however, most nitrate transporters <i>(NRTs)</i> were upregulated under salinity but unchanged under drought. <i>SjNRT2.4</i>, <i>SjNRT2.5</i>, and <i>SjNRT3.1</i> were highly induced by low N. These results indicate that N uptake and metabolism processes respond differently to drought, salinity, and low N conditions in <i>S. japonica</i> seedlings, possibly playing key roles in plant resistance to environmental stress.
