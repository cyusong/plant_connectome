BRZ-INSENSITIVE-LONG HYPOCOTYL 1 (BIL1)/BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) is a master transcription factor of brassinosteroid (BR) signalling. The varieties of nucleobase recognition of the NN-BRRE-core motif (NNCGTG), one of variant G-box motifs, distinguish BIL1/BZR1 from basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, underlying the specific regulation of BR-responsive genes. Here, we show the non-canonical bHLH dimer formation of BIL1/BZR1 to optimize the interaction network with DNA and the orientation of a key residue for NN-BRRE-core motif recognition.
