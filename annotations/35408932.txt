Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play crucial roles in almost all biological processes in plants. They transduce extracellular cues into cells, typically through linear and sequential phosphorylation and activation of members of the signaling cascades. However, accumulating data suggest various regulatory mechanisms of plant MAPK cascades in addition to the traditional phosphorylation pathway, in concert with their large numbers and coordinated roles in plant responses to complex ectocytic signals. Here, we highlight recent studies that describe the uncanonical mechanism of regulation of MAPK cascades, regarding the activation of each tier of the signaling cascades. More particularly, we discuss the unusual role for MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) in the regulation of MAPK cascades, as accumulating data suggest the non-MAPKKK function of many MAPKKKs. In addition, future work on the biochemical activation of MAPK members that needs attention will be discussed.

MAPK cascade: !transduces! extracellular cues 
MAPKKKs: !regulate! MAPK cascades 
MAPKKKs: !have non-MAPKKK functions!
