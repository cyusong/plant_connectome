Flowering time influences reproductive success in plants and has a significant impact on yield in grain crops. Flowering time is regulated by a variety of environmental factors, with daylength often playing an important role. Crops can be categorized into different types according to their photoperiod requirements for flowering. For instance, long-day crops include wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), and pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), while short-day crops include rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Understanding the molecular regulation of flowering and genotypic variation therein is important for molecular breeding and crop improvement. This paper reviews the regulation of flowering in different crop species with a particular focus on how photoperiod-related genes facilitate adaptation to local environments.
