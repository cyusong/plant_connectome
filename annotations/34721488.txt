Microscopic wood identification plays a critical role in many economically important areas in wood science. Historically, producing and curating relevant and representative microscopic cross-section images of wood species is limited to highly experienced and trained anatomists. This manuscript demonstrates the feasibility of generating synthetic microscopic cross-sections of hardwood species. We leveraged a publicly available dataset of 119 hardwood species to train a style-based generative adversarial network (GAN). The proposed GAN generated anatomically accurate cross-section images with remarkable fidelity to actual data. Quantitative metrics corroborated the capacity of the generative model in capturing complex wood structure by resulting in a Fréchet inception distance score of 17.38. Image diversity was calculated using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). The SSIM results confirmed that the GAN approach can successfully synthesize diverse images. To confirm the usefulness and realism of the GAN generated images, eight professional wood anatomists in two experience levels participated in a visual Turing test and correctly identified fake and actual images at rates of 48.3 and 43.7%, respectively, with no statistical difference when compared to random guess. The generative model can synthesize realistic, diverse, and meaningful high-resolution microscope cross-section images that are virtually indistinguishable from real images. Furthermore, the framework presented may be suitable for improving current deep learning models, helping understand potential breeding between species, and may be used as an educational tool.
