Sulphur (S) fertilization has beneficial effects on yield and protein composition of mature wheat kernels. However, to understand the impact of S fertilization on storage protein composition, synthesis of S-containing compounds and their distribution during grain development has to be examined. A pot experiment with Triticum aestivum cultivar Türkis under three S fertilization levels (0 g, 0.1 g und 0.2 g S per pot) and a late S fertilization level at ear emergence was carried out. Stalk and leaves, flag leaves, ears and kernels were harvested separately during grain development at ear emergence, milk ripeness and maturity, and analyzed for elemental S, sulphate, glutathione, and protein concentration. Sulphate is the major S compound in stalk, leaf and ears at the start of grain development, whereas glutathione is more important for synthesis of S-containing proteins in the grain. The discrepancy of S concentration comparing low and high S fertilization became obvious after milk ripeness. The N/S ratios in ears at ear emergence and milk ripeness reflected the later N/S ratio in mature grain. Late S fertilization increased sulphate concentrations in the flag leaf within a short period of about two weeks at ear emergence. Late S fertilization prevented S deficiency in late stages of wheat growth and further enabled equal concentrations of S, glutathione and protein in all wheat organs compared to an S application only at sowing.

Glutathione: !more important for synthesis of S-containing proteins in! grain 
Late S fertilization: !increased sulphate concentrations in! flag leaf 
Late S fertilization: !prevented S deficiency in! late stages of wheat growth
