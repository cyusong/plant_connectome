['10639184', 'The control of cell proliferation during organogenesis plays an important role in  initiation, growth, and acquisition of the intrinsic size of organs in higher  plants. To understand the developmental mechanism that controls intrinsic organ  size by regulating the number and extent of cell division during organogenesis,  we examined the function of the Arabidopsis regulatory gene AINTEGUMENATA (ANT).  Previous observations revealed that ANT regulates cell division in integuments  during ovule development and is necessary for floral organ growth. Here we show  that ANT controls plant organ cell number and organ size throughout shoot  development. Loss of ANT function reduces the size of all lateral shoot organs by  decreasing cell number. Conversely, gain of ANT function, via ectopic expression  of a 35S::ANT transgene, enlarges embryonic and all shoot organs without altering  superficial morphology by increasing cell number in both Arabidopsis and tobacco  plants. This hyperplasia results from an extended period of cell proliferation  and organ growth. Furthermore, cells ectopically expressing ANT in fully  differentiated organs exhibit neoplastic activity by producing calli and  adventitious roots and shoots. Based on these results, we propose that ANT  regulates cell proliferation and organ growth by maintaining the meristematic  competence of cells during organogenesis.', '2000 Jan 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.97.2.942', 'Fischer']
