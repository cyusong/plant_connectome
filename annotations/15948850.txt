We tested whether pollen grain size (PGS) shows heritable variation in three independent populations of Mimulus guttatus by imposing artificial selection for this character. In addition, we looked for correlated responses to selection in a range of 15 other floral characters. Heritable variation in PGS was found in all three populations, with heritabilities of between 19 and 40% (average 30%). After three generations, upward and downward lines differed on average by 30% in pollen volume. No consistent patterns of correlated response were found in other characters, indicating that PGS can respond to selective forces acting on PGS alone. Possible selection mechanisms on PGS in this species could include intermale selection, if large pollen grains produce more competitive gametophytes; or optimization of patterns of resource allocation, if local mate competition varies.
