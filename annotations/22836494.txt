Isoflavonoids are plant natural compounds predominantly found in leguminous plant. They play important functions in both nitrogen fixation and stress resistance. Many clinical studies have linked dietary intake of isoflavonoids to human health benefits. Binding of 14-3-3 proteins to GmMYB176, an isoflavonoid regulator, modulates expression of key isoflavonoids gene expression and its biosynthesis. We have recently demonstrated that the interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with GmMYB176 regulates nuclear-cytoplasmic localization of GmMYB176 thereby affecting target gene expression. Here, we report GmMYB62 as a new R1 MYB client protein of soybean 14-3-3s that may function together with GmMYB176 for gene regulation in soybean.
