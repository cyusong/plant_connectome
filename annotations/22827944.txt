Regulation of chlorophyll metabolism comprises strong transcriptional control together with a range of post-translational mechanisms during chloroplast biogenesis. Recently we reported that chlorophyll biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana roots is regulated by auxin/cytokinin signaling via the combination of two transcription factors, LONG-HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and GOLDEN2-LIKE2 (GLK2). In this study, we examined the involvement of cis-elements in the expression of chlorophyll biosynthesis genes. Searches for predicted cis-elements in key chlorophyll biosynthesis genes and their co-expressed genes revealed coexistence of the G-box motif and the CCAATC motif, which may be targeted by HY5 and GLK factors, respectively, in their promoter regions. Deletion of the G-box from the promoter of the CHLH gene encoding the H subunit of Mg-chelatase resulted in the absence of its expression in roots but not in shoots, showing a differing involvement of the G-box in CHLH expression between shoots and roots. Our data suggest that transcription factors and cis-elements participating chlorophyll biosynthesis are substantially changed during organ differentiation, which may be linked to the differentiation of plastids.
