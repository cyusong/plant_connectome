The reproductive processes of several deciduous trees are highly sensitive to Zn deficiency. An understanding of the patterns of Zn storage and remobilization during bud development and bud break is critical for the development of fertilization strategies to prevent deficiencies and may be valuable in selection and breeding programs to develop more Zn-resilient cultivars. In this study, we provide insights into the in situ distribution of Zn in almond reproductive organs at tissue, cellular, and subcellular scales using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence. The concentrations of Zn in different parts of the vegetative and reproductive tissues were also analysed. Our results show that the small branches subtending the flower and fruit, pollen grain, transmitting tissues of styles, and seed embryo are all important storage sites for Zn. An increase in Zn concentrations in almond reproductive organs mostly occur during the expanding growth phase, such as bud-flush and the mid-fruit enlargement stage; however, Zn transport to floral parts and fruit tissues was restricted at the pedicel and seed coat, suggesting a bottleneck in the export of Zn from the mother plant to filial tissues. Our results provide direct visual evidence for in-situ Zn distribution within the reproductive tissues of a deciduous tree species.
