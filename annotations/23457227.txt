Pairs of genes within eukaryotic genomes are often located on opposite DNA strands such that transcription generates cis-natural sense antisense transcripts (cis-NATs). This orientation of genes has been associated with the biogenesis of splice variants and natural antisense small RNAs. Here, in an analysis of currently available data, we report that within Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), protein-coding cis-NATs are also characterized by high abundance, high coexpression, and broad expression. Our results suggest that a permissive chromatin environment may have led to the proximity of these genes. Compared with other genes, cis-NAT-encoding genes have enriched low-nucleosome-density regions, high levels of histone H3 lysine-9 acetylation, and low levels of H3 lysine-27 trimethylation. Promoters associated with broadly expressed genes are preferentially found in the 5' regulatory sequences of cis-NAT-encoding genes. Our results further suggest that natural antisense small RNA production from cis-NATs is limited. Small RNAs sequenced from natural antisense small RNA biogenesis mutants including dcl1, dcl2, dcl3, and rdr6 map to cis-NATs as frequently as small RNAs sequenced from wild-type plants. Future work will investigate if the positive transcriptional regulation of overlapping protein-coding genes contributes to the prevalence of these genes within other eukaryotic genomes.
