['36176689', 'The vacuole is an important organelle with multiple functions in plants, and the  tonoplast that wraps the vacuole also plays essential roles in intracellular  trafficking and ion homeostasis. Previous studies found that tonoplast proton  pumps regulate embryo development and morphogenesis through their effects on  vacuole biogenesis and distribution, as well as polar auxin transport and  concomitant auxin gradient. However, the precise roles of the tonoplast proton  pumps in gametophyte development remain unclear. Here we demonstrated that the  lack of two types of tonoplast proton pumps or the absence of V-ATPase alone  leads to abnormal development and nuclear localization of female gametophyte  (FG), and slowed endosperm nuclei division after fertilization of the central  cell. We further revealed that V-ATPase regulates auxin levels in ovules through  coordinating the content and localization of PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) protein, hence  influencing nuclear spacing between centra cell and egg cell, and subsequent  endosperm development. Collectively, our findings revealed a crucial role of  V-ATPase in auxin-mediated FG development in Arabidopsis and expanded our  understanding of the functions of tonoplast proton pumps in seed plants  reproductive development.', '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.1006735', 'Lin']
