['26611158', 'Seed dormancy and germination are important physiological processes during the  life cycle of a seed plant. Recently, auxin has been characterized as a positive  regulator that functions during seed dormancy and as a negative regulator during  germination. Through chemical genetic screenings, we have identified a small  molecule, germostatin (GS), which effectively inhibits seed germination in  Arabidopsis. GSR1 (germostatin resistance locus 1) encodes a tandem plant  homeodomain (PHD) finger protein, identified by screening GS-resistant mutants.  Certain PHD fingers of GSR1 are capable of binding unmethylated H3K4, which has  been reported as an epigenetic mark of gene transcriptional repression.  Biochemical studies show that GSR1 physically interacts with the transcriptional  repressor ARF16 and attenuates the intensity of interaction of IAA17/ARF16 by  directly interacting with IAA17 to release ARF16. Further results show that  axr3-1, arf10 arf16 are hyposensitive to GS, and gsr1 not only resists  auxin-mediated inhibition of seed germination but also displays decreased  dormancy. We therefore propose that GSR1 may form a co-repressor with ARF16 to  regulate seed germination. Besides promoting auxin biosynthesis via upregulating  expression of YUCCA1, GS also enhances auxin responses by inducing degradation of  DIotaIota-VENUS and upregulating expression of DR5-GFP. In summary, we identified GSR1  as a member of the auxin-mediated seed germination genetic network, and GS, a  small non-auxin molecule that specifically acts on auxin-mediated seed  germination.', '2016 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13086', 'Zhao']
