The MYB transcription factors regulate plant growth, development, and defense responses. However, information about the <i>MYB</i> gene family in <i>Ipomoea</i> species is rare. Herein, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide comparative analysis of this gene family among seven <i>Ipomoea</i> species, sweet potato (<i>I. batatas</i>), <i>I. trifida</i>, <i>I. triloba</i>, <i>I. nil</i>, <i>I. purpurea</i>, <i>I. cairica</i>, and <i>I. aquatic</i>, and identified 296, 430, 411, 291, 226, 281, and 277 <i>MYB</i> genes, respectively. The identified <i>MYB</i> genes were classified into five types: <i>1R</i>-<i>MYB</i> (<i>MYB</i>-related), <i>2R</i>-<i>MYB</i> (<i>R2R3</i>-<i>MYB</i>), <i>3R</i>-<i>MYB</i> (<i>R1R2R3</i>-<i>MYB</i>), <i>4R</i>-<i>MYB</i>, and <i>5R-MYB</i>, and the <i>MYB-related</i> or <i>R2R3</i>-<i>MYB</i> type was the most abundant <i>MYB</i> genes in the seven species. The <i>Ipomoea MYB</i> genes were classed into distinct subgroups based on the phylogenetic topology and the classification of the <i>MYB</i> superfamily in Arabidopsis. Analysis of gene structure and protein motifs revealed that members within the same phylogenetic group presented similar exon/intron and motif organization. The identified <i>MYB</i> genes were unevenly mapped on the chromosomes of each <i>Ipomoea</i> species. Duplication analysis indicated that segmental and tandem duplications contribute to expanding the <i>Ipomoea MYB</i> genes. Non-synonymous substitution (Ka) to synonymous substitution (Ks) [Ka/Ks] analysis showed that the duplicated <i>Ipomoea MYB</i> genes are mainly under purifying selection. Numerous <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements related to stress responses were detected in the <i>MYB</i> promoters. Six sweet potato transcriptome datasets referring to abiotic and biotic stresses were analyzed, and <i>MYB</i> different expression genes' (DEGs') responses to stress treatments were detected. Moreover, 10 sweet potato <i>MYB</i> DEGs were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. The results revealed that four responded to biotic stress (stem nematodes and <i>Ceratocystis fimbriata</i> pathogen infection) and six responded to the biotic stress (cold, drought, and salt). The results may provide new insights into the evolution of <i>MYB</i> genes in the <i>Ipomoea</i> genome and contribute to the future molecular breeding of sweet potatoes.
