Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced by respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs) at the apoplast, play a key role in local and systemic cell-to-cell signaling, required for plant acclimation to stress. Here we reveal that the Arabidopsis thaliana leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase H2O2-INDUCED CA2+ INCREASES 1 (HPCA1) acts as a central ROS receptor required for the propagation of cell-to-cell ROS signals, systemic signaling in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses, stress responses at the local and systemic tissues, and plant acclimation to stress, following a local treatment of high light (HL) stress. We further report that HPCA1 is required for systemic calcium signals, but not systemic membrane depolarization responses, and identify the calcium-permeable channel MECHANOSENSITIVE ION CHANNEL LIKE 3, CALCINEURIN B-LIKE CALCIUM SENSOR 4 (CBL4), CBL4-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 26 and Sucrose-non-fermenting-1-related Protein Kinase 2.6/OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) as required for the propagation of cell-to-cell ROS signals. In addition, we identify serine residues S343 and S347 of RBOHD (the putative targets of OST1) as playing a key role in cell-to-cell ROS signaling in response to a local application of HL stress. Our findings reveal that HPCA1 plays a key role in mediating and coordinating systemic cell-to-cell ROS and calcium signals required for plant acclimation to stress.
