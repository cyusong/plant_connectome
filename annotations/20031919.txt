['20031919', 'Arabidopsis UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a UV-B-specific signaling component  that regulates expression of a range of genes concerned with UV protection. Here,  we investigate the interaction of UVR8 with chromatin. Using antibodies specific  to UVR8 in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with wild-type plants, we  show that native UVR8 binds to chromatin in vivo. Similar experiments using an  anti-GFP antibody with plants expressing a GFP-UVR8 fusion show that UVR8  associates with a relatively small region of chromatin containing the HY5 gene.  UVR8 interacts with chromatin containing the promoter regions of other genes, but  not with all the genes it regulates. UV-B is not required for the interaction of  UVR8 with chromatin because association with several gene loci is observed in the  absence of UV-B. Pull-down assays demonstrate that UVR8 associates with histones  in vivo and competition experiments indicate that the interaction is  preferentially with histone H2B. ChIP experiments using antibodies that recognize  specific histone modifications indicate that the UV-B-stimulated transcription of  some genes may be correlated with histone modification. In particular, the ELIP1  promoter showed a significant enrichment of diacetyl histone H3 (K9/K14)  following UV-B exposure. These findings increase understanding of the interaction  of the key UV-B-specific regulator UVR8 with chromatin.', '2008 Jan', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssm012', 'Jenkins']
