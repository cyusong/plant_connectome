['8000000', 'Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG deaminase) is an early enzyme of the pathway for  chlorophyll and heme synthesis. Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers, based  on amino acid sequence data for purified PBG deaminase from pea, a fragment was  amplified from Arabidopsis genomic DNA by PCR, and then used to isolate both a  cDNA and a genomic clone for PBG deaminase from Arabidopsis. The cDNA, shown to  be full-length by primer extension, encodes a precursor protein of 382 residues,  which can be imported into isolated chloroplasts and processed to the mature  size. The genomic clone encodes an identical sequence to the cDNA, except for the  presence of four introns within the coding region of the mature protein, and 1.7  kb of upstream sequence. There is no obvious TATA box within 50 bp of the  transcription start. Southern blot analysis suggests that PBG deaminase is  encoded by a single gene in the Arabidopsis genome, and RNase protection  experiments demonstrated that this gene is expressed in both leaves and roots.  These results support the conclusion that there is only one form of PBG deaminase  in all plant cells, which is located in the plastid.', '1994 Nov', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00028854', 'Smith']
