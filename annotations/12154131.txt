['12154131', 'Leaf peroxisomes are present in greening cotyledons and contain enzymes of the  glycolate pathway that functions in photorespiration. However, only a few leaf  peroxisomal proteins, that is hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR), glycolate oxidase  (GO) and alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (AGT1), have been characterized,  and other functions in leaf peroxisomes have not been solved. To better  understand the functions of leaf peroxisomes, we established a method to isolate  leaf peroxisomes of greening cotyledons. We analyzed 53 proteins by MALDI-TOF MS  and then identified 29 proteins. Among them, five proteins are related to the  glycolate pathway, four proteins function in scavenging of hydrogen peroxide and  additionally 20 novel leaf peroxisomal proteins were identified. In particular,  protein kinases and protein phosphatase were first identified as peroxisomal  proteins suggesting that protein phosphorylation is one of the regulatory  mechanisms in leaf peroxisomes. Novel leaf peroxisomal proteins contained five  PTS1-like proteins that have sequences where one amino acid is substituted with  another one in PTS1 sequences. The PTS1 motif was suggested to have novel PTS1  sequences.', '2002 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcf101', 'Nishimura']
