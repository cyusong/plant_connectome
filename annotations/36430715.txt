Drought, bringing the risks of agricultural production losses, is becoming a globally environmental stress. Previous results suggested that legumes with nodules exhibited superior drought tolerance compared with the non-nodule group. To investigate the molecular mechanism of rhizobium symbiosis impacting drought tolerance, transcriptome and sRNAome sequencing were performed to identify the potential mRNA-miRNA-ncRNA dynamic network. Our results revealed that seedlings with active nodules exhibited enhanced drought tolerance by reserving energy, synthesizing N-glycans, and medicating systemic acquired resistance due to the early effects of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) triggered in contrast to the drought susceptible with inactive nodules. The improved drought tolerance might be involved in the decreased expression levels of miRNA such as mtr_miR169l-5p, mtr_miR398b, and mtr_miR398c and its target genes in seedlings with active nodules. Based on the negative expression pattern between miRNA and its target genes, we constructed an mRNA-miR169l-ncRNA ceRNA network. During severe drought stress, the lncRNA alternative splicings <i>TCONS_00049507</i> and <i>TCONS_00049510</i> competitively interacted with mtr_miR169l-5p, which upregulated the expression of NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) transcription factor subfamily NF-YA genes <i>MtNF-YA2</i> and <i>MtNF-YA3</i> to regulate their downstream drought-response genes. Our results emphasized the importance of SNF plants affecting drought tolerance. In conclusion, our work provides insight into ceRNA involvement in rhizobium symbiosis contributing to drought tolerance and provides molecular evidence for future study.
