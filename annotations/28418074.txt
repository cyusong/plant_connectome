Even though the connections between polyploidy and species interactions have been recognized for some time, we are only just beginning to test whether WGD affects community context. Here I review the sparse information on polyploidy and community context and then present a set of hypotheses for future work. Thus far, community-level studies of polyploids suggest an array of outcomes, from no changes in community context to shifts in the abundance and composition of interacting species. I propose a number of mechanisms for how WGD could alter community context and how the emergence of polyploids in populations could also alter the community context of parental diploids and other plant species. Resolving how and when these changes are expected to occur will require a deeper understanding of the connections among WGD, phenotypic changes, and the direct and indirect effects of species interactions.
