Plants are exposed to varied biotic stresses, including sequential or simultaneous attack by insects and pathogens. To overcome these complex stresses, plants must perceive each of the stresses, then integrate and relay the information throughout the plant body and eventually activate local and systemic resistance responses. Previous molecular genetic studies identified jasmonic acid and salicylic acid as key plant hormones of wound and immune responses. These hormones, combined with their antagonistic interaction, play critical roles in the initiation and regulation of defense responses against insects and pathogens. Aside from molecular and genetic information, the latest in vivo imaging technology has revealed that plant defense responses are regulated spatially and temporally. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of local and systemic defense responses against wounding and diseases with a focus on past and recent advances in imaging technologies. We discuss how imaging-based multiparametric analysis has improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic plant stress responses. We also emphasize the importance of compiling the knowledge generated from individual studies on plant wounding and immune responses for a more seamless understanding of plant defense responses in the natural environment.
