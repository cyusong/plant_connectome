The citrate content of strawberry fruits affects their organoleptic quality. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of citric acid metabolism in strawberry fruits. In this study, the R2R3-MYB transcription factor FaMYB5 was identified and placed in the R2R3-MYB subfamily. FaMYB5 is found in the nucleus and shows tissue- and stage-specific expression levels. Citric acid content was positively correlated with FaMYB5 transcript levels. Upregulated FaMYB5 increased citric acid accumulation in transient FaMYB5-overexpressing strawberry fruits, whereas transient RNA silencing of FaMYB5 in strawberry fruits resulted in a reduction of citric acid content. The role of FaMYB5 was verified using stable transgenic NC89 tobacco. Furthermore, a yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that FaMYB5 influences citric acid accumulation by binding to the FaACO (aconitase), FaGAD (glutamate decarboxylase), and FaCS2 (citrate synthase) promoters. Dual-luciferase assays were used to demonstrate that FaMYB5 could activate FaCS2 expression and repress the transcription levels of FaACO and FaGAD. This study identified important roles of FaMYB5 in the regulation of citric acid metabolism and provided a potential target for improving strawberry fruit taste in horticultural crops.
