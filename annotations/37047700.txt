During the early seedling stage, rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) must overcome low-temperature stress. While a few cold-tolerance genes have been characterized, further excavation of cold-resistance genes is still needed. In this study, we identified a cold-induced transcription factor-LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX)-in rice. OsLUX was found to be specifically expressed in leaf blades and upregulated by both cold stress and circadian rhythm. The full-length OsLUX showed autoactivation activity, and the OsLUX protein localized throughout the entire onion cell. Overexpressing <i>OsLUX</i> resulted in increased cold tolerance and reduced ion leakage under cold-stress conditions during the seedling stage. In contrast, the knockout of <i>OsLUX</i> decreased seedling cold tolerance and showed higher ion leakage compared to the wild type. Furthermore, overexpressing <i>OsLUX</i> upregulated the expression levels of oxidative stress-responsive genes, which improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability and enhanced tolerance to chilling stress. Promoter analysis showed that the <i>OsLUX</i> promoter contains two dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) motifs at positions -510/-505 (GTCGGa) and -162/-170 (cCACCGccc), which indicated that OsDREB1s and OsDREB2s probably regulate <i>OsLUX</i> expression by binding to the motif to respond to cold stress. Thus, OsLUX may act as a downstream gene of the DREB pathway. These results demonstrate that OsLUX serves as a positive regulatory factor of cold stress and that overexpressing OsLUX could be used in rice breeding programs to enhance abiotic stress tolerance.
