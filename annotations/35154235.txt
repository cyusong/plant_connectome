Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential plant growth- and development-regulating phytohormones. When applied exogenously, BRs ameliorate heat shock (HS)-induced cell damage and enhance plant thermotolerance; however, the molecular mechanism by which BRs regulate plant thermotolerance is unknown. In this study, by analyzing the thermotolerance of a series of BR signaling mutants and plants that overexpressed different BR signaling components, we obtained comprehensive data showing that BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) plays a major role in mediating the crosstalk between BR signaling and plant HS responses. By RNA-Seq, 608 HS- and BIN2-regulated genes were identified. An analysis of the 1-kb promoter sequences of these genes showed enrichment of an abscisic acid (ABA) INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5)-binding <i>cis</i>-element. Physiological studies showed that thermotolerance was reduced in <i>bin2-1</i> mutant and <i>ABI5-OX</i> plants but increased in the <i>abi5</i> mutant, and that the <i>abi5</i> mutation could recover the thermotolerance of <i>bin2-1</i> plants to a wild-type level, suggesting that ABI5 functions downstream of BIN2 in regulating plant thermotolerance. Further, HS treatment increased the cellular abundance of BIN2. Both <i>bin2-1</i> mutant and <i>BIN2-OX</i> plants showed early flowering, while the <i>BIN2</i> loss-of-function mutant <i>bin2-3 bil1 bil2</i> flowered late. Given these findings, we propose that under HS conditions plants increase BIN2 activity to promote early flowering and ensure species survival; however, this reduces the thermotolerance and survivability of individual plants partially by activating ABI5.
