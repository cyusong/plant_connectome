Efforts to maximize yields of food crops can be undermined by abiotic stress factors, particularly those related to climate change. Here, we use a range of physiological methods to detect the individual and combined effects of heat and drought stress on three contrasting varieties of tomato: Hybrid 61, Moskvich, and Nagcarlang. Seedlings were acclimated under the following treatment regimes: CONTROL (25-36°C; well-watered), DRY (25-36°C; 20% field capacity), HOT (25-42°C; well-watered) and HOT+DRY (25-42°C; 20% field capacity). In each treatment, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, chlorophyll content, and several chlorophyll fluorescence variables (both in situ and in vitro following a heat shock treatment) were measured. Plants from the HOT treatment remained statistically similar to the CONTROL plants in most of the measured parameters, while those from the DRY treatment and especially the HOT+DRY treatment showed clear effects of abiotic stress. Hybrid 61 showed considerable resilience to heat and drought stress compared to the other varieties, with significantly cooler leaves (one day after treatments imposed) and significantly higher Fv/Fm values both in situ and in vitro. The genotypic differences in resilience to heat stress were only apparent under water-limited conditions, highlighting the need to consider leaf temperature rather than air temperature when testing for tolerance to heat stress. The most effective parameters for discriminating genotypic variation in heat and drought stress were in vitro Fv/Fm and chlorophyll content.
