The three homeologues of wheat NCED2 were identified; the wheat NCED2A and CYP707A1B affect seed ABA level and dormancy but not leaf ABA level and transpirational water loss in Arabidopsis. Biosynthesis and catabolism of abscisic acid (ABA) in plants are primarily regulated by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) and ABA 8'-hydroxylase (ABA8'OH), respectively. The present study identified the complete coding sequences of a second NCED gene, designated as TaNCED2, and its homeologues (TaNCED2A, TaNCED2B and TaNCED2D) in hexaploid wheat, and characterized its functionality in seed dormancy and leaf dehydration tolerance using the TaNCED2A homeologue. The study also investigated the role of the B genome copy of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 707A1 (CYP707A1) gene of hexaploid wheat (TaCYP707A1B), which encodes ABA8'OH, in regulating the two traits as this has not been studied before. Ectopic expression of TaNCED2A and TaCYP707A1B in Arabidopsis resulted in altered seed ABA level and dormancy with no effect on leaf ABA content and transpirational water loss. To gain insights into the physiological roles of TaNCED2 and TaCYP707A1 in wheat, the study examined their spatiotemporal expression patterns and determined the genomic contributions of transcripts to their total expression.
