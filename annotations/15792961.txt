['15792961', 'The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains 13 myosin XI isoforms. Here we  prepared a specific antibody against a peptide that mimics a unique C-terminal  region from the myosin XI isoform, MYA2. The resulting antibody was used to  demonstrate that MYA2 in Arabidopsis protein extracts co-sedimented with actin  filaments and dissociated from the filaments with ATP treatment.  Immunolocalization studies showed that MYA2 co-localized predominantly with actin  filaments in clustered punctuate dots in leaf epidermal cells, root hair cells  and suspension-cultured cells. In a transgenic plant in which peroxisomes are  labeled with green fluorescent protein, some MYA2 signals were localized on  peroxisomes in an actin-dependent manner. We propose that the peroxisome is one  of the cargos translocated by MYA2 on actin filaments.', '2005 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pci085', 'Yokota']
