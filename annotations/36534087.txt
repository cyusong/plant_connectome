Salt stress is one of the major causes of reduced crop production, limiting agricultural development globally. Plants have evolved with complex systems to maintain the balance between growth and stress responses, where signaling pathways such as hormone signaling play key roles. Recent studies revealed that hormones are modulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). Previously, two sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) inbred lines with different salt tolerance were identified: the salt-tolerant M-81E and the salt-sensitive Roma. The levels of endogenous hormones in M-81E and Roma varied differently under salt stress, showing a different balance between growth and stress responses. miRNA and degradome sequencing showed that the expression of many upstream transcription factors regulating signal transduction and hormone-responsive genes was directly induced by differentially expressed miRNAs, whose levels were very different between the two sweet sorghum lines. Furthermore, the effects of representative miRNAs on salt tolerance in sorghum were verified through a transformation system mediated by Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Also, miR-6225-5p reduced the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the miR-6225-5p-overexpressing line by inhibiting the expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake gene SbGLR3.1 in the root epidermis and affected salt tolerance in sorghum. This study provides evidence for miRNA-mediated growth and stress responses in sweet sorghum.
