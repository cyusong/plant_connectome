Plants cope with aluminum (Al) toxicity by secreting organic acids (OAs) into the apoplastic space, which is driven by proton (H<sup>+</sup>) pumps. Here, we show that mutation of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) subunit a2 (VHA-a2) and VHA-a3 of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase enhances Al resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>vha-a2 vha-a3</i> mutant plants displayed less Al sensitivity with less Al accumulation in roots compared to wild-type plants when grown under excessive Al<sup>3+</sup> Interestingly, in response to Al<sup>3+</sup> exposure, plants showed decreased vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> pump activity and reduced expression of <i>VHA-a2</i> and <i>VHA-a3</i>, which were accompanied by increased plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> pump (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) activity. Genetic analysis of plants with altered PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity established a correlation between Al-induced increase in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and enhanced Al resistance in <i>vha-a2 vha-a3</i> plants. We determined that external OAs, such as malate and citrate whose secretion is driven by PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, increased with PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity upon Al stress. On the other hand, elevated secretion of malate and citrate in <i>vha-a2 vha-a3</i> root exudates appeared to be independent of OAs metabolism and tolerance of phosphate starvation but was likely related to impaired vacuolar sequestration. These results suggest that coordination of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase dictates the distribution of OAs into either the vacuolar lumen or the apoplastic space that, in turn, determines Al tolerance capacity in plants.
