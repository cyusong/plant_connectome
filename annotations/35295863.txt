Sugarcane (<i>Saccharum</i> spp.) is a prominent source of sugar and serves as bioenergy/biomass feedstock globally. Multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, and cold, adversely affect sugarcane yield. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are components of G-protein-mediated signaling affecting plant growth, development, and stress responses. Here, we identified a GPCR-like protein (<i>ShGPCR1</i>) from sugarcane and energy cane (<i>Saccharum</i> spp. hybrids) and characterized its function in conferring tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. <i>ShGPCR1</i> protein sequence contained nine predicted transmembrane (TM) domains connected by four extracellular and four intracellular loops, which could interact with various ligands and heterotrimeric G proteins in the cells. <i>ShGPCR1</i> sequence displayed other signature features of a GPCR, such as a putative guanidine triphosphate (GTP)-binding domain, as well as multiple myristoylation and protein phosphorylation sites, presumably important for its biochemical function. Expression of <i>ShGPCR1</i> was upregulated by drought, salinity, and cold stresses. Subcellular imaging and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) measurements revealed that <i>ShGPCR1</i> predominantly localized to the plasma membrane and enhanced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in response to GTP, respectively. Furthermore, constitutive overexpression of <i>ShGPCR1</i> in sugarcane conferred tolerance to the three stressors. The stress-tolerance phenotype of the transgenic lines corresponded with activation of multiple drought-, salinity-, and cold-stress marker genes, such as <i>Saccharum</i> spp. <i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT</i>, <i>DEHYDRIN</i>, <i>DROUGHT RESPONSIVE 4</i>, <i>GALACTINOL SYNTHASE, ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR 3</i>, <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 1</i>, <i>VACUOLAR Na+/H+ ANTIPORTER 1</i>, <i>NAM</i>/<i>ATAF1/2</i>/<i>CUC2</i>, <i>COLD RESPONSIVE FACTOR</i> 2, and <i>ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 3</i>. We suggest that <i>ShGPCR1</i> plays a key role in conferring tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, and the engineered lines may be useful to enhance sugarcane production in marginal environments with fewer resources.
