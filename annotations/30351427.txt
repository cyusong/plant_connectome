['30351427', 'Plant organ development to a specific size and shape is controlled by cell  proliferation and cell expansion. Here, we identify a novel Myb-like Arabidopsis  gene, Development Related Myb-like1 (DRMY1), which controls cell expansion in  both vegetative and reproductive organs. DRMY1 is strongly expressed in  developing organs and its expression is reduced by ethylene while it is induced  by ABA. DRMY1 has a Myb-like DNA-binding domain, which is predominantly localized  in the nucleus and does not exhibit transcriptional activation activity. The  loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutant drmy1 shows reduced organ growth and cell  expansion, which is associated with changes in the cell wall matrix  polysaccharides. Interestingly, overexpression of DRMY1 in Arabidopsis does not  lead to enhanced organ growth. Expression of genes involved in cell wall  biosynthesis/remodeling, ribosome biogenesis and in ethylene and ABA signaling  pathways is changed with the deficiency of DRMY1. Our results suggest that DRMY1  plays an essential role in organ development by regulating cell expansion either  directly by affecting cell wall architecture and/or cytoplasmic growth or  indirectly through the ethylene and/or ABA signaling pathways.', '2019 Feb 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcy207', 'Luo']
