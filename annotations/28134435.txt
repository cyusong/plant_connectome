Domestication provides an important model for the study of evolution, and information learned from domestication research aids in the continued improvement of crop species. Recent progress in de novo assembly and whole-genome resequencing of wild and cultivated soybean genomes, in addition to new archeological discoveries, sheds light on the origin of this important crop and provides a clearer view on the modes of artificial selection that drove soybean domestication and diversification. This novel genomic information enables the search for polymorphisms that underlie variation in agronomic traits and highlights genes that exhibit a signature of selection, leading to the identification of a number of candidate genes that may have played important roles in soybean domestication, diversification and improvement. These discoveries provide a novel point of comparison on the evolutionary bases of important agronomic traits among different crop species.
