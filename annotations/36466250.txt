In wheat, the leaf chlorophyll content in flag leaves is closely related to the degree of phosphorus stress. Identifying major genes/loci associated with chlorophyll content in flag leaves under different phosphorus conditions is critical for breeding wheat varieties resistant to low phosphorus (P). Under normal, medium, and low phosphorus conditions, the chlorophyll content of flag leaves was investigated by a double haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between two popular wheat varieties Jinmai 47 and Jinmai 84, at different grain filling stages. Chlorophyll content of the DH population and parents decreased gradually during the S1 to the S3 stages and rapidly at the S4 stage. At the S4 stage, the chlorophyll content of the DH population under low phosphorus conditions was significantly lower than under normal phosphate conditions. Using a wheat 15K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel, a total of 157 QTLs were found to be associated with chlorophyll content in flag leaf and were identified under three phosphorus conditions. The phenotypic variation explained (PVE) ranged from 3.07 to 31.66%. Under three different phosphorus conditions, 36, 30, and 48 QTLs for chlorophyll content were identified, respectively. Six major QTLs <i>Qchl.saw-2B.1</i>, <i>Qchl.saw-3B.1</i>, <i>Qchl.saw-4D.1</i>, <i>Qchl.saw-4D.2</i>, <i>Qchl.saw-5A.9</i> and <i>Qchl.saw-6A.4</i> could be detected under multiple phosphorus conditions in which <i>Qchl.saw-4D.1</i>, <i>Qchl.saw-4D.2</i>, and <i>Qchl.saw-6A.4</i> were revealed to be novel major QTLs. Moreover, the closely linked SNP markers of <i>Qchl.saw-4D.1</i> and <i>Qchl.saw-4D.2</i> were validated as KASP markers in a DH population sharing the common parent Jinmai 84, showed extreme significance (<i>P <</i>0.01) in more than three environments under different phosphorus conditions, which has the potential to be utilized in molecular marker-assisted breeding for low phosphorus tolerance in wheat.
