Novel cytochrome P450s, CYP81B140 and CYP81B141 from Plumbago zeylanica were functionally characterized to understand their involvement in polyketide plumbagin biosynthesis. Further, we propose 3-methyl-1-8-naphthalenediol and isoshinanolone as intermediates for plumbagin biosynthesis. Plumbago zeylanica L. (P. zeylanica) is a medicinally important plant belonging to the family Plumbaginaceae. It comprises the most abundant naphthoquinone plumbagin having anti-cancer activity. Only the polyketide synthase (PKS) enzyme has been identified from the biosynthetic pathway which catalyzes iterative condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA molecules. The plumbagin biosynthesis involves hydroxylation, oxidation, hydration and dehydration of intermediate compounds which are expected to be catalyzed by cytochrome P450s (CYPs). To identify the CYPs, co-expression analysis was carried out using PKS as a candidate gene. Out of the eight identified CYPs, CYP81B140 and CYP81B141 have similar expression with PKS and belong to the CYP81 family. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that CYP81B140 and CYP81B141 cluster with CYPs from CYP81B, CYP81D, CYP81E and CYP81AA subfamilies which are known to be involved in the hydroxylation and oxidation reactions. Moreover, artificial microRNA-mediated transient individual silencing and co-silencing of CYP81B140 and CYP81B141 significantly reduced plumbagin and increased the 3-methyl-1-8-naphthalenediol and isoshinanolone content. Based on metabolite analysis, we proposed that 3-methyl-1-8-naphthalenediol and isoshinanolone function as intermediates for plumbagin biosynthesis. Transient silencing, over-expression and docking analysis revealed that CYP81B140 is involved in C-1 oxidation, C-4 hydroxylation and [C2-C3] hydration of 3-methyl-1-8-naphthalenediol to form isoshinanolone, whereas CYP81B141 is catalyzing [C2-C3] dehydration and C-4 oxidation of isoshinanolone to form plumbagin. Our results indicated that both CYP81B140 and CYP81B141 are promiscuous and necessary for plumbagin biosynthesis. This is the first report of identification and functional characterization of P. zeylanica-specific CYPs involved in plumbagin biosynthetic pathway and in general hexaketide synthesis in plants.
