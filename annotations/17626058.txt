['17626058', 'Complex organisms consist of a multitude of cell types arranged in a precise  spatial relation to each other. Arabidopsis roots generally exhibit radial tissue  organization; however, within a tissue layer, cells are not identical. Specific  vascular cell types are arranged in diametrically opposed longitudinal files that  maximize the distance between them and create a bilaterally symmetric (diarch)  root. Mutations in the LONESOME HIGHWAY (LHW) gene eliminate bilateral symmetry  and reduce the number of cells in the center of the root, resulting in roots with  only single xylem and phloem poles. LHW does not appear to be required for the  creation of any specific cell type, but coordinately controls the number of all  vascular cell types by regulating the size of the pool of cells from which they  arise. We cloned LHW and found that it encodes a protein with weak sequence  similarity to basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-domain proteins. LHW is a  transcriptional activator in vitro. In plants, LHW is nuclear-localized and is  expressed in the root meristems, where we hypothesize it acts independently of  other known root-patterning genes to promote the production of stele cells, but  might also indirectly feed into established regulatory networks for the  maintenance of the root meristem.', '2007 Aug', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.006296', 'Bergmann']
