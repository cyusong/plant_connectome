['10655235', 'Vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) is a potent antioxidant and cellular reductant  present at millimolar concentrations in plants. This small molecule has roles in  the reduction of prosthetic metal ions, cell wall expansion, cell division, and  in the detoxification of reactive oxygen generated by photosynthesis and adverse  environmental conditions. However, unlike in animals, the biosynthesis of  ascorbic acid (AsA) in plants is only beginning to be unraveled. The previously  described AsA-deficient Arabidopsis mutant vtc1 (vitamin c-1) was recently shown  to have a defect in GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, providing strong evidence for  the recently proposed role of GDP-mannose in AsA biosynthesis. To genetically  define other AsA biosynthetic loci, we have used a novel AsA assay to isolate  four vtc mutants that define three additional VTC loci. We have also isolated a  second mutant allele of VTC1. The four loci represented by the vtc mutant  collection have been genetically characterized and mapped onto the Arabidopsis  genome. The vtc mutants have differing ozone sensitivities. In addition, two of  the mutants, vtc2-1 and vtc2-2, have unusually low levels of AsA in the leaf  tissue of mature plants.', '2000 Feb', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/154.2.847', 'Last']
