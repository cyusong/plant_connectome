Multiple cellular events like dynamic actin reorganization and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production were demonstrated to be involved in abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. However, the relationship between them as well as the underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that H(2)O(2) generation is indispensable for ABA induction of actin reorganization in guard cells of Arabidopsis that requires the presence of ARP2/3 complex. H(2)O(2) -induced stomatal closure was delayed in the mutants of arpc4 and arpc5, and the rate of actin reorganization was slowed down in arpc4 and arpc5 in response to H(2)O(2), suggesting that ARP2/3-mediated actin nucleation is required for H(2)O(2) -induced actin cytoskeleton remodelling. Furthermore, the expression of H(2)O(2) biosynthetic related gene AtrbohD and the accumulation of H(2)O(2) was delayed in response to ABA in arpc4 and arpc5, demonstrating that misregulated actin dynamics affects H(2)O(2) production upon ABA treatment. These results support a possible causal relation between the production of H(2)O(2) and actin dynamics in ABA-mediated guard cell signalling: ABA triggers H(2)O(2) generation that causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton partially mediated by ARP2/3 complex, and ARP2/3 complex-mediated actin dynamics may feedback regulate H(2)O(2) production.
