During exponential phase, the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cell line cv Virginia Bright Italia-0 divides axially to produce linear cell files of distinct polarity. This axial division is controlled by exogenous auxin. We used exponential tobacco cv Virginia Bright Italia-0 cells to dissect early auxin signaling, with cell division and cell elongation as physiological markers. Experiments with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) demonstrated that these 2 auxin species affect cell division and cell elongation differentially; NAA stimulates cell elongation at concentrations that are much lower than those required to stimulate cell division. In contrast, 2,4-D promotes cell division but not cell elongation. Pertussis toxin, a blocker of heterotrimeric G-proteins, inhibits the stimulation of cell division by 2,4-D but does not affect cell elongation. Aluminum tetrafluoride, an activator of the G-proteins, can induce cell division at NAA concentrations that are not permissive for division and even in the absence of any exogenous auxin. The data are discussed in a model where the two different auxins activate two different pathways for the control of cell division and cell elongation.
