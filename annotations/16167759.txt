The type two secretion system (T2S) is important for virulence of a number of gram-negative bacterial plant pathogens. Most of the T2S-secreted proteins that have been characterized to date are involved in degrading different components of plant cell walls. Functional redundancy appears to exist among T2S-secreted proteins because significant effects on virulence are observed only in strains in which multiple secreted proteins are mutated. Several T2S-secreted proteins have been shown to induce plant defense responses, including hypersensitive response-like reactions. Bacterial pathogens can suppress these defense responses, and recent results indicate that suppression is mediated through the type three secretion system.
