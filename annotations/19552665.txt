Populus cathayana Rehd., a dioecious tree species, occupies a wide range of habitats in southwest China. Both males and females were grown under two regimes of photoperiod, from mid-length to short-day photoperiod (SD shift), or to long-day photoperiod (LD shift). SD shift triggered leaf senescence in both males and females by decreasing net photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E), and chlorophyll pigment (Chl), non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) contents, while increasing abscisic acid (ABA), malonaldehyde (MDA) and free proline (Pro) contents. The antioxidant enzyme (e.g. POD, CAT and SOD) activities and capability to maintain ultrastructural integrity also decreased under SD shift. Males exhibited faster leaf senescence than did females, as shown by greater decreases in A, E, Chl and IAA. However, males maintained a less senescent stage than did females, as indicated by higher values of A, Chl, NSC, IAA and antioxidant enzyme activities. Conversely, A, E, NSC and IAA contents and antioxidant enzyme activities were enhanced by lower O(2)(*-) in females, whereas reduced by higher O(2)(*-) in males under LD shift. Such sex-dependent responses of P. cathayana to photoperiod transitions showed that males and females possess different adaptabilities, which may relate to sex-specific leaf senescence speed under changing environments.
