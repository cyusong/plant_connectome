In response to hypoxia under submergence, plants switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic fermentation, which leads to the accumulation of the end product, ethanol. We previously reported that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> autophagy-deficient mutants show increased sensitivity to ethanol treatment, indicating that ethanol is likely involved in regulating the autophagy-mediated hypoxia response. Here, using a transcriptomic analysis, we identified 3909 genes in Arabidopsis seedlings that were differentially expressed in response to ethanol treatment, including 2487 upregulated and 1422 downregulated genes. Ethanol treatment significantly upregulated genes involved in autophagy and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Using transgenic lines expressing <i>AUTOPHAGY-RELATED PROTEIN 8e</i> fused to green fluorescent protein (<i>GFP-ATG8e</i>), we confirmed that exogenous ethanol treatment promotes autophagosome formation in vivo. Phenotypic analysis showed that deletions in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene in <i>adh1</i> mutants result in attenuated submergence tolerance, decreased accumulation of ATG proteins, and diminished submergence-induced autophagosome formation. Compared to the submergence-tolerant Arabidopsis accession Columbia (Col-0), the submergence-intolerant accession Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>) displayed hypersensitivity to ethanol treatment; we linked these phenotypes to differences in the functions of ADH1 and the autophagy machinery between these accessions. Thus, ethanol promotes autophagy-mediated submergence tolerance in Arabidopsis.
