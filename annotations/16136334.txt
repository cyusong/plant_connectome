Expression of the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolC gene in Panax ginseng callus cells results in formation of tumors that are capable to form roots. The selection of non-root forming tumor clusters yielded the embryogenic 2c3 callus line, which formed somatic embryos and shoots independently of external growth factors. Although the 2c3 somatic embryos developed through a typical embryogenesis process, they terminated prematurely and repeatedly formed adventitious shoot meristems and embryo-like structures. A part of the shoots and somatic embryos formed enlarged and fasciated meristems. This is the first indication of the rolC gene embryogenic effect and, to our knowledge, the first indication that a single gene of non-plant origin can induce somatic embryogenesis in plants.
