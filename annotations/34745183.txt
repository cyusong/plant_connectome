During photosynthesis, organisms respond to their energy demand and ensure the supply of energy and redox equivalents that sustain metabolism. Hence, the photosynthetic apparatus can, and in fact should, be treated as an integrated supply-demand system. Any imbalance in the energy produced and consumed can lead to adverse reactions, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reaction centres of both photosystems are known sites of ROS production. Here, we investigate in particular the central role of Photosystem I (PSI) in this tightly regulated system. Using a computational approach we have expanded a previously published mechanistic model of C3 photosynthesis by including ROS producing and scavenging reactions around PSI. These include two water to water reactions mediated by Plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) and Mehler and the ascorbate-glutathione (ASC-GSH) cycle, as a main non-enzymatic antioxidant. We have used this model to predict flux distributions through alternative electron pathways under various environmental stress conditions by systematically varying light intensity and enzymatic activity of key reactions. In particular, we studied the link between ROS formation and activation of pathways around PSI as potential scavenging mechanisms. This work shines light on the role of alternative electron pathways in photosynthetic acclimation and investigates the effect of environmental perturbations on PSI activity in the context of metabolic productivity.
