We found GmNAC06 plays an important role in salt stress responses through the phenotypic, physiological and molecular analyses of OE, VC, and Mutant composite soybean. Salinization affects 20% of all cultivated land worldwide because of the high salinity of irrigation water and the excessive use of water, and this amount is increasing daily. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) have been found to be involved in salt stress. In this study, a soybean NAC gene, GmNAC06 (Glyma06g21020.1), was cloned and functionally characterized. The results of expression analysis suggested that salt stress could influence the expression level of GmNAC06. The subcellular localization analysis results suggested that GmNAC06 may function as a transcription factor. Under salt stress, the overexpression technology combined with CRISPR-Cas9 system found that GmNAC06 could cause the accumulation of proline and glycine betaine to alleviate or avoid the negative effects of ROS; similarly, it could control the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios in hairy roots to maintain ionic homeostasis. The fresh weight of the transgenic hairy roots and the histochemical ROS staining of wild leaves suggested that transgenic hairy roots influence the function of wild leaves under salt stress conditions. Moreover, the expression levels of GmUBC2 and GmHKT1 were higher in the GmNAC06 hairy roots than in the control. Thus, the overexpression of GmNAC06 in hairy roots notably causes an entire composite plant to exhibit salt tolerance. The phenotype of composite soybean plants and transgenic Arabidopsis plants suggest that GmNAC06 plays a role in response to salt stress and could be useful in generating salt tolerant transgenic crops.
