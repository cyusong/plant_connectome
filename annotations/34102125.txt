In recent years, the diversity of eukaryotic microbes has been greatly expanded by recognising or discovering new major branches of the algal tree of life. A new study defines the phylogenetic home for an elusive marine planktonic lineage previously known only by plastidial rRNA genes, placing it in a new class of the phylum Haptophyta.
