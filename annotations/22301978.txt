Somatic embryogenesis (SE) in Cichorium involves dedifferentiation and redifferentiation of single cells and can be induced by specific in vitro culture conditions. We have tested the effect of various treatments on the incidence of SE (ISE) of an interspecific embryogenic hybrid (C.만ndivia x C.말ntybus) and of different commercial chicories (C.만ndivia and C.말ntybus) that are typically recalcitrant to SE in standard culture conditions. We found that the ISE of the hybrid is significantly increased by pretreatment of tissues by submersion in solutions of glycerol, abscisic acid, spermine, putrescine or of combinations of these compounds. Interestingly, the most efficient of these pretreatments also had an unexpectedly high effect on the ISE of the C.말ntybus cultivars. The ISE of the hybrid and of the commercial chicories were increased when explants were co-cultured with highly embryogenic chicory explants or when they were cultured in conditioned medium. These observations established that unidentified SE-promoting factors are released in the culture medium. HPLC analyses of secreted Arabino-Galactan Proteins (AGPs), which are known to stimulate SE, did not allow identifying a fraction containing differentially abundant AGP candidates. However, pointing to their role in promoting SE, we found that the hybrid had a drastically higher ISE when amino sugars and L-Proline, the putative precursors of secreted AGPs, were both added to the medium.
