Eight variants in ZmHKT1 promoter were significantly associated with root diameter, four haplotypes based on these significant variants were found, and Hap2 has the largest root diameter. Roots play an important role in uptake of water, nutrients and plant anchorage. Identification of gene and corresponding SNPs associated with root traits would enable develop maize lines with better root traits that might help to improve capacity for absorbing nutrients and water acquisition. The genomic sequences of a salt tolerance gene ZmHKT1 was resequenced in 349 maize inbred lines, and the association between nucleotide polymorphisms and seedling root traits was detected. A total of 269 variants in ZmHKT1 were identified, including 226 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 43 insertions and deletions. The gene displayed high level of nucleotide diversity, especially in non-genic regions. A total of 19 variations in untranslated region of ZmHKT1 were found to be associated with six seedling traits. Eight variants in promoter region were significantly associated with average root diameter (ARD), four haplotypes were found based on these significant variants, and Hap2 has the largest ARD. Two SNPs in high-linkage disequilibrium (SNP-415 and SNP 2169) with pleiotropic effects were significantly associated with plant height, root surface area, root volume, and shoot dry weight. This result revealed that ZmHKT1 was an important contributor to the phenotypic variations of seedling root traits in maize, these significant variants could use to develop functional markers to improve root traits.
