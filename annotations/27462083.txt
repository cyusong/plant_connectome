['27462083', 'Omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acids (omega-7s) are specifically enriched in the  aleurone of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. We found significant  natural variation in seed omega-7 content and used a Multiparent Advanced Generation  Inter-Cross population to fine-map a major quantitative trait loci to a region  containing ACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN DESATURASE1 (AAD1) and AAD3 We found that  AAD3 expression is localized to the aleurone where mutants show an approximately  50% reduction in omega-7 content. By contrast, AAD1 is localized to the embryo where  mutants show a small reduction in omega-9 content. Enzymatic analysis has previously  shown that AAD family members possess both stearoyl- and palmitoyl-ACP Delta(9)  desaturase activity, including the predominant isoform SUPPRESSOR OF SALICYLIC  ACID INSENSITIVE2. However, aad3 ssi2 aleurone contained the same amount of omega-7s  as aad3 Within the AAD family, AAD3 shares the highest degree of sequence  similarity with AAD2 and AAD4. Mutant analysis showed that AAD2 also contributes  to omega-7 production in the aleurone, and aad3 aad2 exhibits an approximately 85%  reduction in omega-7s Mutant analysis also showed that FATTY ACID ELONGASE1 is  required for the production of very long chain omega-7s in the aleurone. Together,  these data provide genetic evidence that the omega-7 pathway proceeds via Delta(9)  desaturation of palmitoyl-ACP followed by elongation of the product.  Interestingly, significant variation was also identified in the omega-7 content of  Brassica napus aleurone, with the highest level detected being approximately 47%  of total fatty acids.', '2016 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.00836', 'Eastmond']
