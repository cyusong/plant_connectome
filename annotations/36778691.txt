Hexokinase1 (HXK1) is a bifunctional enzyme that plays indispensable roles in plant growth, nitrogen utilization, and stress resistance. However, information on the HXK family members of strawberries and their functions in glucose sensing and metabolic regulation is scarce. In the present study, four HXKs were firstly identified in the genome of <i>Fragaria vesca</i> and <i>F. pentaphylla</i>. The conserved domains of the HXK1s were confirmed, and a site-directed mutation (S177A) was introduced into the FpHXK1. <i>FpHXK1</i>, which shares the highest identity with the <i>AtHXK1</i> was able to restore the glucose sensitivity and developmental defects of the Arabidopsis <i>gin2-1</i> mutant, but not its kinase-activity-impaired mutant (<i>FpHXK1<sup>S177A</sup></i> ). The transcription of <i>FpHXK1</i> was dramatically up-regulated under PEG-simulated drought stress conditions. The inhibition of the HXK kinase activity delayed the strawberry plant's responses to drought stress. Transient overexpression of the <i>FpHXK1</i> and its kinase-impaired mutant differentially affected the level of glucose, sucrose, anthocyanins, and total phenols in strawberry fruits. All these results indicated that the FpHXK1, acting as a glucose sensor, was involved in drought stress response and sugar metabolism depending on its kinase activity.
