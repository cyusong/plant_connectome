['8528278', 'Eleven loci that play a role in the synthesis of flavonoids in Arabidopsis are  described. Mutations at these loci, collectively named transparent testa (tt),  disrupt the synthesis of brown pigments in the seed coat (testa). Several of  these loci (tt3, tt4, tt5 and ttg) are also required for the accumulation of  purple anthocyanins in leaves and stems and one locus (ttg) plays additional  roles in trichome and root hair development. Specific functions were previously  assigned to tt1-7 and ttg. Here, the results of additional genetic, biochemical  and molecular analyses of these mutants are described. Genetic map positions were  determined for tt8, tt9 and tt10. Thin-layer chromatography identified tissue-  and locus-specific differences in the flavonols and anthocyanidins synthesized by  mutant and wild-type plants. It was found that UV light reveals distinct  differences in the floral tissues of tt3, tt4, tt5, tt6 and ttg, even though  these tissues are indistinguishable under visible light. Evidence was also  uncovered that tt8 and ttg specifically affect dihydroflavonol reductase gene  expression. A summary of these and previously published results are incorporated  into an overview of the genetics of flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.', '1995 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1995.08050659.x', 'Goodman']
