The SAND domain protein ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) functions as a trithorax group factor that regulates a variety of developmental processes in Arabidopsis. We have recently shown that ULT1 regulates developmental patterning in the gynoecia and leaves. ULT1 acts together with the KANADI1 (KAN1) transcription factor to pattern the apical-basal axis during gynoecium formation, whereas the 2 genes act antagonistically to pattern the adaxial-abaxial axis during both gynoecium and leaf formation. In particular, our data showed that ULT1 is necessary for the kan1 adaxialized organ phenotype. Here, we observe the internal structure of ult1, kan1 and ult1 kan1 rosette leaves to better understand the suppression of the kan1 adaxialized leaf polarity defect by ult1 mutations. Our results indicate that ULT1 and KAN1 act antagonistically to pattern the adaxial-abaxial axis in leaves by establishing the asymmetry of the internal cell layers.
