['25944099', 'A key step of the cell cycle is the entry into the DNA replication phase that  typically commits cells to divide. However, little is known about the molecular  mechanisms regulating this transition in plants. Here, we investigated the  function of FBL17 (F BOX-LIKE17), an Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein  previously shown to govern the progression through the second mitosis during  pollen development. Our work reveals that FBL17 function is not restricted to  gametogenesis. FBL17 transcripts accumulate in both proliferating and postmitotic  cell types of Arabidopsis plants. Loss of FBL17 function drastically reduces  plant growth by altering cell division activity in both shoot and root apical  meristems. In fbl17 mutant plants, DNA replication is severely impaired and  endoreplication is fully suppressed. At the molecular level, lack of FBL17  increases the stability of the CDK (CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE) inhibitor  KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 known to switch off CDKA;1 kinase activity. Despite the  strong inhibition of cell proliferation in fbl17, some cells are still able to  enter S phase and eventually to divide, but they exhibit a strong DNA damage  response and often missegregate chromosomes. Altogether, these data indicate that  the F-box protein FBL17 acts as a master cell cycle regulator during the diploid  sporophyte phase of the plant.', '2015 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.135301', 'Genschik']
