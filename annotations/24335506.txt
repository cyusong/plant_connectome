['24335506', 'Proper copper (Cu) homeostasis is required by living organisms to maintain  essential cellular functions. In the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana), the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 (SPL7) transcription  factor participates in reprogramming global gene expression during Cu  insufficiency in order to improve the metal uptake and prioritize its  distribution to Cu proteins of major importance. As a consequence, spl7 null  mutants show morphological and physiological disorders during Cu-limited growth,  resulting in lower fresh weight, reduced root elongation, and chlorosis. On the  other hand, the Arabidopsis KIN17 homolog belongs to a well-conserved family of  essential eukaryotic nuclear proteins known to be stress activated and involved  in DNA and possibly RNA metabolism in mammals. In the study presented here, we  uncovered that Arabidopsis KIN17 participates in promoting the Cu deficiency  response by means of a direct interaction with SPL7. Moreover, the double mutant  kin17-1 spl7-2 displays an enhanced Cu-dependent phenotype involving growth  arrest, oxidative stress, floral bud abortion, and pollen inviability. Taken  together, the data presented here provide evidence for SPL7 and KIN17 protein  interaction as a point of convergence in response to both Cu deficiency and  oxidative stress.', '2014 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.228239', 'Huijser']
