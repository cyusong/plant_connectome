Wood (secondary xylem) formation is regulated by auxin, which plays a pivotal role as an integrator of developmental and environmental cues. However, our current knowledge of auxin-signaling during wood formation is incomplete. Our previous genome-wide analysis of <i>Aux</i>/<i>IAAs</i> in <i>Eucalyptus grandis</i> showed the presence of the non-canonical paralog member <i>EgrIAA20</i> that is preferentially expressed in cambium. We analyzed its cellular localization using a GFP fusion protein and its transcriptional activity using transactivation assays, and demonstrated its nuclear localization and strong auxin response repressor activity. In addition, we functionally tested the role of <i>EgrIAA20</i> by constitutive overexpression in <i>Arabidopsis</i> to investigate for phenotypic changes in secondary xylem formation. Transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants overexpressing <i>EgrIAA20</i> were smaller and displayed impaired development of secondary fibers, but not of other wood cell types. The inhibition in fiber development specifically affected their cell wall lignification. We performed yeast-two-hybrid assays to identify <i>EgrIAA20</i> protein partners during wood formation in <i>Eucalyptus</i>, and identified EgrIAA9A, whose ortholog PtoIAA9 in poplar is also known to be involved in wood formation. Altogether, we showed that <i>EgrIAA20</i> is an important auxin signaling component specifically involved in controlling the lignification of wood fibers.
