['24902892', 'Plant root system plasticity is critical for survival in changing environmental  conditions. One important aspect of root architecture is lateral root  development, a complex process regulated by hormone, environmental and protein  signalling pathways. Here we show, using molecular genetic approaches, that the  MYB transcription factor AtMYB93 is a novel negative regulator of lateral root  development in Arabidopsis. We identify AtMYB93 as an interaction partner of the  lateral-root-promoting ARABIDILLO proteins. Atmyb93 mutants have faster lateral  root developmental progression and enhanced lateral root densities, while  AtMYB93-overexpressing lines display the opposite phenotype. AtMYB93 is expressed  strongly, specifically and transiently in the endodermal cells overlying early  lateral root primordia and is additionally induced by auxin in the basal meristem  of the primary root. Furthermore, Atmyb93 mutant lateral root development is  insensitive to auxin, indicating that AtMYB93 is required for normal auxin  responses during lateral root development. We propose that AtMYB93 is part of a  novel auxin-induced negative feedback loop stimulated in a select few endodermal  cells early during lateral root development, ensuring that lateral roots only  develop when absolutely required. Putative AtMYB93 homologues are detected  throughout flowering plants and represent promising targets for manipulating root  systems in diverse crop species.', '2014 Sep', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.12879', 'Coates']
