Arabidopsis GBF1/ZBF2 is a bZIP transcription factor that plays dual but opposite regulatory roles in cryptochrome-mediated blue light signaling. Here, we show the genetic and molecular interrelation of GBF1 with two well characterized negative regulators of light signaling, COP1 and SPA1, in photomorphogenic growth and light-regulated gene expression. Our results further reveal that GBF1 protein is less abundant in the dark-grown seedlings and is degraded by a proteasome-mediated pathway independent of COP1 and SPA1. Furthermore, COP1 physically interacts with GBF1 and is required for the optimum accumulation of GBF1 protein in light-grown seedlings. Taken together, this study provides a mechanistic view of concerted function of three important regulators in Arabidopsis seedling development.
