GASA proteins are characterized by an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal conserved GASA domain with 12 invariant cysteine residues. Despite being widely distributed among plant species, their functions are not completely elucidated and little is known about their mechanism of action. This review focuses on the current knowledge about the molecular structure, protein subcellular localization and phytohormones responses of this up-and-coming family of peptides. Furthermore, we discussed the roles of GASA proteins in plant growth and development, plant responses to biotic or abiotic stresses and their participation in phytohormonal signaling integration.
