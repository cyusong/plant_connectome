Precise and site-specific nitrogen (N) fertilizer management of vegetables is essential to improve the N use efficiency considering temporal and spatial fertility variations among fields, while the current N fertilizer recommendation methods are proved to be time- and labor-consuming. To establish a site-specific N topdressing algorithm for bok choy (<i>Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis</i>), using a hand-held GreenSeeker canopy sensor, we conducted field experiments in the years 2014, 2017, and 2020. Two planting densities, viz, high (123,000 plants ha<sup>-1</sup>) in Year I and low (57,000 plants ha<sup>-1</sup>) in Year II, whereas, combined densities in Year III were used to evaluate the effect of five N application rates (0, 45, 109, 157, and 205 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>). A robust relationship was observed between the sensor-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the ratio vegetation index (RVI), and the yield potential without topdressing (YP<sub>0</sub>) at the rosette stage, and 81-84% of the variability at high density and 76-79% of that at low density could be explained. By combining the densities and years, the <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> value increased to 0.90. Additionally, the rosette stage was identified as the earliest stage for reliably predicting the response index at harvest (RI<sub>Harvest</sub>), based on the response index derived from NDVI (RI<sub>NDVI</sub>) and RVI (RI<sub>RVI</sub>), with <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> values of 0.59-0.67 at high density and 0.53-0.65 at low density. When using the combined results, the RI<sub>RVI</sub> performed 6.12% better than the RI<sub>NDVI</sub>, and 52% of the variability could be explained. This study demonstrates the good potential of establishing a sensor-based N topdressing algorithm for bok choy, which could contribute to the sustainable development of vegetable production.
