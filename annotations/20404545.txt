RNA-directed modification of histones is essential for maintenance of heterochromatin in higher eukaryotes. In plants, cytosine methylation, especially in non-CG sequence contexts, is tightly related to inactive chromatin, but the mechanisms regulating the coexistence of cytosine methylation and repressive histone modification remain obscure. We recently revealed that MORPHEUS' MOLECULE1 (MOM1) of Arabidopsis thaliana silences endogenous loci related to transposons and homologous to the 24-nt siRNAs accumulated in wild type plants, and suggested that MOM1 transduces RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) signals to repressive histone modification. In this addendum, we focus on the involvement of MOM1 in multiple transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) pathways.

MOM1: !transduces! RdDM signals 
RdDM: !represses! histone modification 
MOM1: !silences! endogenous loci 
endogenous loci: !related to! transposons 
MOM1: !involves in! TGS pathways
