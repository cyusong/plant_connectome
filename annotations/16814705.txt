Potassium channel function is fundamental to many physiological processes in plants. In this issue of Cell, identify a protein complex in Arabidopsis consisting of a potassium channel, a protein kinase, and a calcium sensor. This study reveals that plants cope with limited soil potassium by coupling potassium channel activation to a cellular calcium signaling network.
