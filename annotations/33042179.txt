Kiwifruit bacterial canker, caused by the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i> (Psa), is a destructive disease in the kiwifruit industry globally. Consequently, understanding the mechanism of defense against pathogens in kiwifruit could facilitate the development of effective novel protection strategies. The <i>Non-expressor of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>) is a critical component of the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent signaling pathway. Here, a novel kiwifruit <i>NPR1</i>-like gene, designated <i>AeNPR1a</i>, was isolated by using PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. The full-length cDNA consisted of 1952 base pairs with a 1,746-bp open-reading frame encoding a 582 amino acid protein. Homology analysis showed that the AeNPR1a protein is significantly similar to the VvNPR1 of grape. A 2.0 Kb 5'-flanking region of <i>AeNPR1a</i> was isolated, and sequence identification revealed the presence of several putative cis-regulatory elements, including basic elements, defense and stress response elements, and binding sites for WRKY transcription factors. Real-time quantitative PCR results demonstrated that <i>AeNPR1a</i> had different expression patterns in various tissues, and its transcription could be induced by phytohormone treatment and Psa inoculation. The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that AeNPR1a interacts with AeTGA2. Constitutive expression of <i>AeNPR1a</i> induced the expression of pathogenesis-related gene in transgenic tobacco plants and enhanced tolerance to bacterial pathogens. In addition, <i>AeNPR1a</i> expression could restore basal resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (Pst) in <i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>npr1-1</i> mutant. Our data suggest that <i>AeNPR1a</i> gene is likely to play a pivotal role in defense responses in kiwifruit.
