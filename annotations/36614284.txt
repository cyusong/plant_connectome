Plants are constantly exposed to environmental stresses. Local stimuli sensed by one part of a plant are translated into long-distance signals that can influence the activities in distant tissues. Changes in levels of phytohormones in distant parts of the plant occur in response to various local stimuli. The regulation of hormone levels can be mediated by long-distance electrical signals, which are also induced by local stimulation. We consider the crosstalk between electrical signals and phytohormones and identify interaction points, as well as provide insights into the integration nodes that involve changes in pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS levels. This review also provides an overview of our current knowledge of how electrical signals and hormones work together to induce a systemic response.
