The oilseed rape plant's transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage is important to its yield. This transition is controlled by a large group of flowering time genes that respond to environmental and endogenous cues. The role of jasmonates in flowering is almost unknown in Brassicaceae, even in the genus Arabidopsis. In this paper, the clear effect of exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on the flowering time, floral organ morphology, and transcript levels of a group of genes implicated in floral development is shown. In controlled greenhouse experiments, we found that the effect of MeJA depended on both plant genotype and jasmonate dosage. MeJA promoted maximum flowering when it was applied to the cultivars of early flowering types of oilseed rape, such as cultivars Mei-Jian and Fu-You 4. In addition, a concentration of 100 microM resulted in the most number of early open flowers, in comparison with the results obtained for concentrations of 50 and 80 microM. Furthermore, the application of high concentrations of MeJA (100 microM) also produced various kinds of abnormal flowers. Our results demonstrated that the combined actions of the floral identity genes, specifically BnAP1, BnAP2, BnAP3, BnAG1, and BnPI3, as reflected by their respective relative transcript levels, were responsible for causing the different kinds of flower abnormalities previously undescribed in oilseed rape. We expect our assay to be an enriching addition to the body of work that attempts to understand the signaling function of jasmonates in the floral inductive pathway.
