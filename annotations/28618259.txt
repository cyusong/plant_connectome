Plant-derived smoke - butenolide, called at present karrikin 1 (KAR<sub>1</sub>) is known as an important inductor of seed germination and seedling growth. In this study, tricyclic butenolides were synthesized and their effects on germination of dormant and non-dormant Avena fatua caryopses were compared, as were also their effects versus those of KAR<sub>1</sub> on seedling growth. KAR<sub>1</sub> was found to be most effective and to completely remove dormancy. Butenolides, rac-8 and (S)-8a, showed a low stimulatory effect on germination of dormant caryopses, visible only when applied at very high concentrations. These compounds used at concentrations 100 times those of KAR<sub>1</sub> similarly increased the speed of germination and vigor of non-dormant caryopses. Likewise, growth of coleoptiles and their fresh weight were increased by KAR<sub>1</sub> as well as by rac-8 and (S)-8a to a similar value. KAR<sub>1</sub> and rac-8 were more effective than (S)-8a in increasing root growth. The results shown indicate that the presence of an aromatic ring in the absence of methyl group at C3 induced a much lower, or a similar, effect on germination of dormant and non-dormant Avena fatua caryopses and seedling growth compared to KAR<sub>1</sub>, but only when used at much higher concentrations. The simultaneous presence of a methyl group at C3 and an aromatic ring in the compound rac-7 exerted only a slight effect on the root growth.
