['11402195', 'The committed step in the biosynthesis of the phytochrome chromophore  phytochromobilin involves the oxidative cleavage of heme by a heme oxygenase (HO)  to form biliverdin IXalpha. Through positional cloning of the photomorphogenic  mutant hy1, the Arabidopsis HO (designated AtHO1) responsible for much of  phytochromobilin synthesis recently was identified. Using the AtHO1 sequence, we  identified families of HO genes in a number of plants that cluster into two  subfamilies (HO1- and HO2-like). The tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) yg-2 and  Nicotiana plumbaginifolia pew1 photomorphogenic mutants are defective in specific  HO genes. Phenotypic analysis of a T-DNA insertion mutant of Arabidopsis HO2  revealed that the second HO subfamily also contributes to phytochromobilin  synthesis. Homozygous ho2-1 plants show decreased chlorophyll accumulation,  reduced growth rate, accelerated flowering time, and reduced de-etiolation. A  mixture of apo- and holo-phyA was detected in etiolated ho2-1 seedlings,  suggesting that phytochromobilin is limiting in this mutant, even in the presence  of functional AtHO1. The patterns of Arabidopsis HO1 and HO2 expression suggest  that the products of both genes overlap temporally and spatially. Taken together,  the family of HOs is important for phytochrome-mediated development in a number  of plants and that each family member may uniquely contribute to the  phytochromobilin pool needed to assemble holo-phytochromes.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.126.2.656', 'Vierstra']
