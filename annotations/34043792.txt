Cotton, one of the most important crops in the world, produces natural fiber materials for the textile industry. WRKY transcription factors play important roles in plant development and stress responses. However, little is known about whether and how WRKY transcription factors regulate fiber development of cotton so far. In this study, we show that a fiber-preferential WRKY transcription factor, GhWRKY16, positively regulates fiber initiation and elongation. GhWRKY16-silenced transgenic cotton displayed a remarkably reduced number of fiber protrusions on the ovule and shorter fibers compared to the wild-type. During early fiber development, GhWRKY16 directly binds to the promoters of GhHOX3, GhMYB109, GhCesA6D-D11, and GhMYB25 to induce their expression, thereby promoting fiber initiation and elongation. Moreover, GhWRKY16 is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase GhMPK3-1 at residues T-130 and S-260. Phosphorylated GhWRKY16 directly activates the transcription of GhMYB25, GhHOX3, GhMYB109, and GhCesA6D-D11 for early fiber development. Thus, our data demonstrate that GhWRKY16 plays a crucial role in fiber initiation and elongation, and that GhWRKY16 phosphorylation by GhMPK3-1 is essential for the transcriptional activation on downstream genes during the fiber development of cotton.
