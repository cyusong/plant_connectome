['16427632', 'WNK (with no lysine (K)) protein kinases are found in many eukaryotes and share a  unique active site. Here, we report that a member of the Arabidopsis WNK family  (AtWNK8) interacts with subunit C of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) via a  short C-terminal domain. AtWNK8 is shown to autophosphorylate intermolecularly  and to phosphorylate Arabidopsis subunit C (AtVHA-C) at multiple sites as  determined by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Furthermore, we show that AtVHA-C and other  V-ATPase subunits are phosphorylated when V1-complexes are used as substrates for  AtWNK8. Taken together, our results provide evidence that V-ATPases are potential  targets of WNK kinases and their associated signaling pathways.', '2006 Feb 6', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.01.018', 'Schumacher']
