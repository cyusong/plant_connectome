*The patterning of epidermal cell types in Arabidopsis is an excellent model for studying the molecular basis of cell specification. Trichome and root hair formation is controlled by a transcriptional activator complex that induces the homeobox gene GLABRA2 (GL2) and some single-repeat R3 MYB genes (single MYB). However, it remains unclear how the actions of GL2 and single MYBs are coordinated to regulate epidermal patterning. *GL2 is thought to act downstream of single MYBs to regulate trichome and root hair development. In order to test this hypothesis genetically, double and higher order mutants between gl2 and single myb were generated. *In these mutants, the glabrous phenotypes observed in the gl2 single mutants were partially recovered, suggesting that single MYBs may not act solely through GL2 to regulate trichome development. On the other hand, double and higher order mutants between gl2 and single myb phenocopied the root hair phenotype of gl2 single mutants, suggesting that GL2 and single MYBs act in a common pathway to regulate root hair patterning. *These findings reveal distinct relationships between GL2 and single MYBs in the regulation of trichome vs root hair development, and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of epidermal patterning.
