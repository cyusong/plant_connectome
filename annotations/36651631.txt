Plants exude secondary metabolites from the roots to shape the composition and function of their microbiome. Many of these compounds are known for their anti-microbial activities and play a role in plant immunity, such as the indole-derived phytoalexin camalexin. Here we studied the dynamics of camalexin synthesis and exudation upon interaction of Arabidopsis thaliana with the plant growth promoting bacteria Pseudomonas sp. CH267 or the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae PG1. We show that while camalexin accumulation and exudation is more rapidly but transiently induced upon interaction with the growth promoting bacteria, the pathogen induces higher and more stable camalexin levels. By combination of experiments with cut shoots and roots, and grafting of wild-type plants with mutants in camalexin synthesis, we showed that while camalexin can be produced and released by both organs, in intact plants exuded camalexin originates in the shoots. We also reveal that the root specific CYP71A27 protein specifically affects the outcome of the interaction with the plant growth promoting bacteria and that its transcript levels are controlled by a shoot derived signal. In conclusion, camalexin synthesis seems to be controlled on a whole plant level and is coordinated between the shoots and the roots.
