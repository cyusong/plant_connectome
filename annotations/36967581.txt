Plant root systems rely on a functionally diverse range of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to, among other benefits, extend their nutrient foraging. Extended nutrient foraging is likely of greatest importance to coarse-rooted plants, yet few studies have examined the link between root traits and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition. Here, we examine the relationship between root diameter and the composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities in a range of native and exotic plant species. We characterized the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities of 30 co-occurring native and exotic montane grassland/shrubland plant species in New Zealand. We found that plant root diameter and native/exotic status both strongly correlated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition. Coarse-rooted plants had a lower diversity of mycorrhizal fungi compared with fine-rooted plants and associated less with generalist fungal partners. Exotic plants had a lower diversity of fungi and fewer associations with nondominant families of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi compared with native plants. These observational patterns suggest that plants may differentially associate with fungal partners based on their root traits, with coarse-rooted plants being more specific in their associations. Furthermore, exotic plants may associate with dominant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal taxa as a strategy in invasion.
