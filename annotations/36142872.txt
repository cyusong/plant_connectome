Brassinosteroids (BRs), a novel plant hormone, are widely involved in plant growth and stress response processes. Nitric oxide (NO), as an important gas signaling molecule, can regulate target protein activity, subcellular localization and function in response to various stresses through post-translational <i>S</i>-nitrosylation modifications. However, the relationship between BR and NO in alleviating low-temperature stress of mini Chinese cabbage remains unclear. The hydroponic experiment combined with the pharmacological and molecular biological method was conducted to study the alleviating mechanism of BR at low temperature in mini Chinese cabbage. The results showed that low temperature inhibited the growth of mini Chinese cabbage seedlings, as evidenced by dwarf plants and yellow leaves. Treatment with 0.05 mg/L BR and 50 µM NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) significantly increased the leaf area, stem diameter, chlorophyll content, dry and fresh weight and proline content. Meanwhile, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in 0.05 mg/L BR- and 50 µM GSNO-treated leaves were significantly lower than those in other treated leaves under low-temperature conditions. In addition, BR and GSNO applications induced an increase in NO and S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels in vivo under low-temperature stress. Similarly, spraying BR after the elimination of NO also increased the level of <i>S</i>-nitrosylation in vivo, while spraying GSNO after inhibiting BR biosynthesis decreased the level of NO and SNO in vivo. In contrast, the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (<i>BrGSNOR</i>) relative expression level and GSNOR enzyme activity were downregulated and inhibited by BR treatment, GSNO treatment and spraying BR after NO clearance, while the relative expression level of <i>BrGSNOR</i> was upregulated and GSNOR enzyme activity was also increased when spraying GSNO after inhibiting BR synthesis. Meanwhile, the biotin switch assay showed that exogenous BR increased the level of total nitrosylated protein in vivo under low-temperature stress. These results suggested that BR might act as an upstream signal of NO, induced the increase of NO content in vivo and then induced the protein <i>S</i>-nitrosylation modification to alleviate the damage of mini Chinese cabbage seedlings under low-temperature stress.
