Flowering is crucial for sexual reproductive success in angiosperms. The core regulatory factors, such as <i>FT</i>, <i>FUL</i>, and <i>SOC1</i>, are responsible for promoting flowering. <i>BRANCHED 1</i> (<i>BRC1</i>) is a TCP transcription factor gene that plays an important role in the regulation of branching and flowering in diverse plant species. However, the functions of <i>BjuBRC1</i> in <i>Brassica juncea</i> are largely unknown. In this study, four homologs of <i>BjuBRC1</i> were identified and the mechanism by which <i>BjuBRC1</i> may function in the regulation of flowering time was investigated. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that BjuBRC1 contained a conserved TCP domain with two nuclear localization signals. A subcellular localization assay verified the nuclear localization of BjuBRC1. Expression analysis revealed that <i>BjuBRC1</i>-1 was induced by short days and was expressed abundantly in the leaf, flower, and floral bud but not in the root and stem in <i>B. juncea</i>. Overexpression of <i>BjuBRC1</i>-1 in the <i>Arabidopsis brc1</i> mutant showed that <i>BjuBRC1</i>-1 delayed flowering time. Bimolecular fluorescent complementary and luciferase complementation assays showed that four BjuBRC1 proteins could interact with BjuFT <i>in vivo</i>. Notably, BjuBRC1 proteins formed heterodimers <i>in vivo</i> that may impact on their function of negatively regulating flowering time. Yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase reporter, and luciferase activity assays showed that BjuBRC1-1 could directly bind to the promoter of <i>BjuFUL</i>, but not <i>BjuFT</i> or <i>BjuSOC1</i>, to repress its expression. These results were supported by the reduced expression of <i>AtFUL</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> overexpressing <i>BjuBRC1</i>-1. Taken together, the results indicate that <i>BjuBRC1</i> genes likely have a conserved function in the negative regulation of flowering in <i>B. juncea</i>.
