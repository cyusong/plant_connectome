Plant cells have a remarkable plasticity that allows cellular reprogramming from differentiated cells and subsequent tissue regeneration. Callus formation occurs from pericycle-like cells through a lateral root developmental pathway, and even aerial parts can also undergo the cell fate transition. Pluripotent calli are then subjected primarily to shoot regeneration in in vitro tissue culture. Successful completion of plant regeneration from aerial explants thus entails a two-step conversion of tissue identity. Here we show that a single chromatin modifier, ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX 4 (ATX4)/SET DOMAIN GROUP 16, is dynamically regulated during plant regeneration to address proper callus formation and shoot regeneration. The ATX4 protein massively activates shoot identity genes by conferring H3K4me3 deposition at the loci. ATX4-deficient mutants display strong silencing of shoot identity and thus enhanced callus formation. Subsequently, de novo shoot organogenesis from calli is impaired in atx4 mutants. These results indicate that a series of epigenetic reprogramming of tissue identity underlies plant regeneration, and molecular components defining tissue identity can be used as invaluable genetic sources for improving crop transformation efficiency.

ATX4: !confers! H3K4me3 deposition
ATX4: !silences! shoot identity
atx4 mutants: !impaired! de novo shoot organogenesis
