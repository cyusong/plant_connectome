Apple ring rot is a severe disease that affects the yield and quality of apple fruits worldwide. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that involved in this process still remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that apple POZ/BTB CONTAINING-PROTEIN 1 (MdPOB1), a BTB-BACK domain E3 ligase protein, functions to suppress apple pathogen defense against Botryosphaeria dothidea (B. dothidea). Both in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that MdPOB1 interacted directly with and degraded apple U-box E3 ligase MdPUB29, a well-established positive regulator of plant innate immunity, through the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway. A series of transgenic analyses in apple fruits demonstrated that MdPOB1 affected apple pathogen defense against B. dothidea at least partially, if not completely, via regulating MdPUB29. Additionally, it was found that the apple pathogen defense against B. dothidea was correlated with the H2O2 contents and the relative expression of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis- and SA signaling-related genes, which might be regulated via degradation of MdPUB29 by MdPOB1. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of the MdPOB1 modulation of apple ring rot resistance, which occur by directly regulating potential downstream target protein MdPUB29 for proteasomal degradation in apple.
