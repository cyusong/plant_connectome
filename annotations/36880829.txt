The genus <i>Colletotrichum</i> includes nine major clades with 252 species and 15 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. <i>Colletotrichum</i> spp. are one of the top fungal plant pathogens causing anthracnose and pre- and post-harvest fruit rots worldwide. Apple orchards are imperiled by devastating losses from apple bitter rot ranging from 24 to 98%, which is a serious disease caused by several species of <i>Colletotrichum</i>. Bitter rot is also a major postharvest rot disease with <i>C. fioriniae</i> leading to 2 - 14 % of unmarketable fruit in commercial apple storages. Dominant species causing apple bitter rot in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. are <i>C. fioriniae</i> from the <i>Colletotrichum acutatum</i> species complex (CASC), and <i>C. chrysophilum</i> and <i>C. noveboracense</i> from the <i>C. gloeosporioides</i> species complex (CGSC). <i>C. fioriniae</i> is the dominant species causing apple bitter rot in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. <i>C. chrysophilum</i> was first identified on banana and cashew but has been recently found as the second most dominant species causing apple bitter rot in the Mid-Atlantic. As the third most dominant pathogen, <i>C. noveboracense</i> MB 836581 was identified as a novel species in the CGSC causing apple bitter rot in the Mid-Atlantic.<i>C. nupharicola</i> is a sister group to <i>C. fructicola</i> and <i>C. noveboracense</i>, also causing bitter rot on apple. We deliver resources of 10 new genomes including two isolates of <i>C. fioriniae</i>, three isolates of <i>C. chrysophilum</i>, three isolates of <i>C. noveboracense</i> and two isolates of <i>C. nupharicola</i> collected from apple fruit, yellow waterlily and <i>Juglans nigra</i>.
