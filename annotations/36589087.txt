Transcriptome sequencing or RNA-Sequencing is a high-resolution, sensitive and high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach used to study non-model plants and other organisms. In other words, it is an assembly of RNA transcripts from individual or whole samples of functional and developmental stages. RNA-<i>Seq</i> is a significant technique for identifying gene predictions and mining functional analysis that improves gene ontology understanding mechanisms of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, but there is limited information available on this topic. Transcriptomics research on different types of plants can assist researchers to understand functional genes in better ways and regulatory processes to improve breeding selection and cultivation practices. In recent years, several advancements in RNA-<i>Seq</i> technology have been made for the characterization of the transcriptomes of distinct cell types in biological tissues in an efficient manner. RNA-Seq technologies are briefly introduced and examined in terms of their scientific applications. In a nutshell, it introduces all transcriptome sequencing and analysis techniques, as well as their applications in plant biology research. This review will focus on numerous existing and forthcoming strategies for improving transcriptome sequencing technologies for functional gene mining in various plants using RNA- Seq technology, based on the principles, development, and applications.
