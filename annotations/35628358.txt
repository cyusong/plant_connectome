<i>Myrothamnus flabellifolia</i> is the only woody resurrection plant found in the world. It has a strong tolerance to drought and can survive long-term exposure to desiccated environments. However, few genes related to its drought tolerance have been functionally characterized and the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress tolerance of <i>M. flabellifolia</i> are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated a dehydration-inducible bHLH transcription factor gene <i>MfbHLH145</i> from <i>M. flabellifolia</i>. Heterologous expression of <i>MfbHLH145</i> enhanced the drought and salt tolerance of Arabidopsis. It can not only promote root system development under short-term stresses, but also improve growth performance under long-term treatments. Further investigation showed that <i>MfbHLH145</i> contributes to enhanced leaf water retention capacity through the promotion of stomatal closure, increased osmolyte accumulation, and decreased stress-induced oxidative damage through an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. These results suggest that <i>MfbHLH145</i> may be involved in the positive regulation of stress responses in <i>M. flabellifolia</i>. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the survival of <i>M. flabellifolia</i> in extreme dehydration conditions.
