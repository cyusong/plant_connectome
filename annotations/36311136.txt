Brassinosteroids (BRs) are important phytohormones that play a vital role in plant drought tolerance, but their mechanisms in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.) are poorly understood. Numerous basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family genes are involved in the responses to both BRs and drought stress. <i>GhBEE3-Like</i>, a bHLH transcription factor, is repressed by both 24-epi-BL (an active BR substance) and PEG8000 (drought simulation) treatments in cotton. Moreover, GhBZR1, a crucial transcription factor in BR signaling pathway, directly binds to the E-box element in <i>GhBEE3-Like</i> promoter region and inhibits its expression, which has been confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and dual luciferase reporter assay. Functional analysis revealed that <i>Arabidopsis</i> with <i>GhBEE3-Like</i> overexpression had drought sensitive phenotype, while <i>GhBEE3-Like</i> knock-down cotton plants obtained by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology were more tolerant to drought stress. Furthermore, the expression levels of three stress-related genes, <i>GhERD10</i>, <i>GhCDPK1</i> and <i>GhRD26</i>, were significantly higher in <i>GhBEE3-Like</i> knock-down cotton than in control cotton after drought treatment. These results suggest that <i>GhBEE3-Like</i> is inhibited by BRs which elevates the expressions of stress-related genes to enhance plant drought tolerance. This study lays the foundation for understanding the mechanisms of BR-regulated drought tolerance and establishment of drought-resistant cotton lines.
