<i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is a soilborne fungus and the primary causal agent of vascular wilt diseases worldwide. The fungus produces melanized microsclerotia that are crucially important for the survival and spread of <i>V. dahliae</i>. There are no fungicides available that are both effective and environmentally friendly to suppress the fungus. Previously, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> C232 was isolated from soil and was demonstrated to suppress microsclerotia formation in <i>V. dahliae</i>. In this study, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that the antifungal substance is actually a mixture of lipopeptides. Exposure of <i>V. dahliae</i> to these lipopeptides resulted in hyphal swelling, cell lysis, and downregulation of melanin-related genes. RNA sequencing analyses of the lipopeptide-suppressed transcriptome during microsclerotial development revealed that 5,974 genes (2,131 upregulated and 3,843 downregulated) were differentially expressed versus nonsuppressive conditions. Furthermore, gene ontology enrichment analyses revealed that genes involved in response to stress, cellular metabolic processes, and translation were significantly enriched. Additionally, the lipopeptides inhibited expression of genes associated with secondary metabolism, protein catabolism, and the high-osmolarity glycerol response signaling pathway. Together, these findings provide evidence for the mechanism by which <i>B. subtilis</i> lipopeptides suppress microsclerotia formation. The transcriptomic insight garnered here may facilitate the development of biological agents to combat Verticillium wilt.
