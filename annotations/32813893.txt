At local spatial scales, loss of genetic diversity within species can lead to species loss. Few studies, however, have examined plant genotypic diversity effects across trophic levels. We investigated genotypic diversity effects of Phragmites australis on belowground biomass and soil nematode communities. Our results revealed that belowground plant biomass and nematode abundance responses to plant genotypic diversity were uncoupled. Decreasing plant genotypic diversity decreased the abundance of lower, but not higher trophic level nematodes. Low plant genotypic diversity also decreased the structural footprint and functional indices of nematodes, indicating lowered metabolic functioning of higher trophic level nematodes and decreased soil food web stability. Our study suggests that plant genotypic diversity effects differ across trophic levels, taxonomic groups and ecosystem functions and that decreasing plant genotypic diversity could destabilise belowground food webs. This highlights the importance of conserving intraspecific plant diversity.
