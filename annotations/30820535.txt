The process of plant fertilization provides an outstanding example of refined control of gene expression. During this elegant process, subtle communication occurs between neighboring cells, based on chemical signals, that induces cellular mechanisms of patterning and growth. Having faced an immediate issue of self-incompatibility responses, the pathway to fertilization starts once the stigmatic cells recognize a compatible pollen grain, and it continues with numerous players interacting to affect pollen tube growth and the puzzling process of navigation along the transmitting tract. The pollen tube goes through a guidance process that begins with a preovular stage (i.e. prior to the influence of the target ovule), with interactions with factors from the transmitting tissue. In the subsequent ovular-guidance stage a specific relationship develops between the pollen tube and its target ovule. This stage is divided into the funicular and micropylar guidance steps, with numerous receptors working in signalling cascades. Finally, just after the pollen tube has passed beyond the synergids, fusion of the gametes occurs and the developing seed-the ultimate aim of the process-will start to mature. In this paper, we review the existing knowledge of the crucial biological processes involved in pollen-pistil interactions that give rise to the new seed.
