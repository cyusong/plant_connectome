Plants deposit hydrophobic polymers, such as lignin or suberin, in their root cell walls to protect inner tissues and facilitate selective uptake of solutes. Insights into how individual root tissues contribute to polymer formation are important for elucidation of ultrastructure, function, and development of these protective barriers. Although the pathways responsible for production of the barrier constituents are established, our models lack spatiotemporal resolution-especially in roots-thus, the source of monomeric barrier components is not clear. This is mainly due to our restricted ability to manipulate synthesis of the broadly important phenylpropanoid pathway, as mutants in this pathway display lethal or pleiotropic phenotypes. Here, we overcome this challenge by exploiting highly controlled in vivo repression systems. We provide strong evidence that autonomous production of phenylpropanoids is essential for establishment of the endodermal Casparian strip as well as adherence of the suberin matrix to the cell wall of endodermis and cork. Our work highlights that, in roots, the phenylpropanoid pathway is under tight spatiotemporal control and serves distinct roles in barrier formation across tissues and developmental zones. This becomes evident in the late endodermis, where repression of phenylpropanoid production leads to active removal of suberin in pre-suberized cells, indicating that endodermal suberin depositions might embody a steady state between continuous synthesis and degradation.
