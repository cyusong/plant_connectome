Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a central metabolite and the acetyl source for protein acetylation, particularly histone acetylation that promotes gene expression. However, the effect of acetyl-CoA levels on histone acetylation status in plants remains unknown. Here, we show that malfunctioned cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase1 (ACC1) in Arabidopsis leads to elevated levels of acetyl-CoA and promotes histone hyperacetylation predominantly at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27). The increase of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase which cleaves citrate to acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm, and requires histone acetyltransferase GCN5. A comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome in combination with the genome-wide H3K27ac profiles of acc1 mutants demonstrate the dynamic changes in H3K27ac, gene transcripts and metabolites occurring in the cell by the increased levels of acetyl-CoA. This study suggests that H3K27ac is an important link between cytosolic acetyl-CoA level and gene expression in response to the dynamic metabolic environments in plants.

Acetyl-CoA: !promotes! histone acetylation 
Malfunctioned ACC1: !elevates! acetyl-CoA levels 
H3K27ac: !increases! with elevated acetyl-CoA 
ATP-citrate lyase: !cleaves! citrate to acetyl-CoA 
GCN5: !requires! histone acetyltransferase 
H3K27ac: !links! cytosolic acetyl-CoA level and gene expression
