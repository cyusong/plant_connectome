The extraradical hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are colonized by different bacteria in natural and agricultural systems, but the mechanisms by which AM fungi interact with the hyphosphere soil microbiome and influence soil organic phosphorus (P) mobilization remain unclear. We grew Medicago in two-compartment microcosms, inoculated with Rhizophagus irregularis, or not, in the root compartment and set up P treatments (without P, with P addition as KH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> or nonsoluble phytate) in the hyphal compartment. We studied the processes of soil P turnover and characterized the microbiome functional profiles for P turnover in the hyphosphere soil by metagenomic sequencing. Compared with the bulk soil, the hyphosphere soil of R. irregularis was inhabited by a specific bacterial community and their functional profiles for P turnover was stimulated. At the species level, the shift in hyphosphere soil microbiome was characterized by the recruitment of the genome bin2.39 harbouring both gcd and phoD genes and genome bin2.97 harbouring the phoD gene, which synergistically drove nonsoluble phytate mobilization in the hyphosphere soil. Our results suggest that AM fungi recruits a specific hyphosphere soil microbiome and stimulated their functional profiles for P turnover to enhance utilization of phytate.
