Advanced transcriptome analyses have revealed the existence of various RNA species. In our previous study, a large number of non-protein-coding RNAs including antisense transcripts were identified using an Arabidopsis tiling array. Most of the antisense transcripts exhibited co-expression with sense transcripts during stress treatments or seed imbibition. Here, we report that antisense transcripts exhibit differential expression patterns to sense transcripts in distinct developmental tissues. In addition, RNA ligase-mediated RACE analysis identified the existence of 5'-capped and -uncapped antisense transcripts. These observations provide additional insight into antisense transcripts.
