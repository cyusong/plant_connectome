Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects and causes crown galls in dicot plants by transferring T-DNA from the Ti plasmid to the host plant via a type IV secretion system. This process requires appropriate environmental conditions, certain plant secretions, and bacterial regulators. In our previous work, a member of the LysR family of transcriptional regulators (LsrB) in Sinorhizobium meliloti was found to modulate its symbiotic interactions with the host plant alfalfa. However, the function of its homolog in A. tumefaciens remains unclear. In this study, we show that the LsrB protein of A. tumefaciens is required for efficient transformation of host plants. A lsrB deletion mutant of A. tumefaciens exhibits a number of defects, including in succinoglycan production, attachment, and resistance to oxidative stress and iron limitation. RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that 465 genes were significantly differentially expressed (upregulation of 162 genes and downregulation of 303 genes) in the mutant, compared with the wild-type strain, including those involved in succinoglycan production, iron transporter, and detoxification enzymes for oxidative stress. Moreover, expression of the lsrB gene from S. meliloti, Brucella abortus, or A. tumefaciens rescued the defects observed in the S. meliloti or A. tumefaciens lsrB deletion mutant. Our findings suggest that a conserved mechanism of LsrB function exists in symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria of the family Rhizobiaceae.
