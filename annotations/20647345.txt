['20647345', 'Polycomb-group (Pc-G) proteins are important regulators of many developmental  processes in plants and animals and repress gene expression by imparting histone  H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Here, we present the identification of  the novel, plant-specific Arabidopsis thaliana protein BLISTER (BLI), which  interacts with the Pc-G histone methyltransferase CURLY LEAF (CLF). We map the  interaction of BLI with CLF to a predicted coiled-coil domain in BLI that shares  similarity with STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE OF CHROMOSOMES proteins. BLI colocalizes  with CLF in the nucleus, shows an overlapping expression pattern with CLF  throughout plant development that is strongest in dividing cells, and represses a  subset of Pc-G target genes. Loss of BLI results in a pleiotropic developmental  mutant phenotype, indicating that BLI prevents premature differentiation.  Furthermore, bli mutants exhibit severe epidermal defects, including loss of cell  adhesion, outgrowth of cells, and increased cotyledon cell size. As these  phenotypes have not been observed in Pc-G mutants, we propose that BLI has  functions related to Pc-G proteins but can also act independently in Arabidopsis  development.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.073403', 'Schubert']
