The three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of cells in tissues provides an anatomical basis for analyzing physiological and biochemical aspects of plant and animal cellular development and function. In this study, we established a protocol for tissue clearing and 3D imaging in rice. Our protocol is based on three improvements: clearing with iTOMEI (clearing solution suitable for plants), developing microscopic conditions in which the Z step is optimized for 3D reconstruction, and optimizing cell-wall staining. Our protocol successfully 3D imaged rice shoot apical meristems, florets, and root apical meristems at cellular resolution throughout whole tissues. Using fluorescent reporters of auxin signaling in rice root tips, we also revealed the 3D distribution of auxin signaling events that are activated in the columella, quiescent center, and multiple rows of cells in the stele of the root apical meristem. Examination of cells with higher levels of auxin signaling revealed that only the central row of cells was connected to the quiescent center. Our method provides opportunities to observe the 3D arrangement of cells in rice tissues.
