Plant architecture is a complex agronomic trait and a major factor of crop yield, which is affected by several important hormones. Strigolactones (SLs) are identified as a new class hormoneinhibiting branching in many plant species and have been shown to be involved in various developmental processes. Genetical and chemical modulation of the SL pathway is recognized as a promising approach to modify plant architecture. However, whether and how the genes involved in the SL pathway could be utilized in breeding still remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a partial loss-of-function allele of the SL biosynthesis gene, HIGH TILLERING AND DWARF 1/DWARF17 (HTD1/D17), which encodes CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 (CCD7), increases tiller number and improves grain yield in rice. We found that the HTD1 gene had been widely utilized and co-selected with Semidwarf 1 (SD1), both contributing to the improvement of plant architecture in modern rice varieties since the Green Revolution in the 1960s. Understanding how phytohormone pathway genes regulate plant architecture and how they have been utilized and selected in breeding will lay the foundation for developing the rational approaches toward improving crop yield.
