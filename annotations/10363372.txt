['10363372', 'Until recently, only cytosolic acyl-CoA binding proteins (ACBPs) have been  characterized. The isolation of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding a novel  membrane-associated ACBP that accumulates in developing seeds, designated ACBP1,  has provided evidence for the existence of membrane-associated forms of ACBPs  (Chye, 1998, Plant Mol. Biol. 38, 827-838). We now report on the isolation of its  corresponding gene from an A. thaliana Columbia genomic library using the ACBP1  cDNA as a hybridization probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis of Arabidopsis ACBP1  showed that its promoter lacks a TATA box, resembling the promoters of rat,  Drosophila and human genes encoding cytosolic ACBP and suggesting that it is a  housekeeping gene. We show by Western blot analysis that ACBP1 expression in  developing seeds coincides with lipid deposition and that homologues of  membrane-associated ACBP1 exist in other plants. Using light microscopy, we show  that ACBP1 is strongly expressed in the embryo at the cotyledons, hypocotyl,  procambium of the axis and in most peripheral cells of the cotyledons and  hypocotyl. Immunogold labelling localized ACBP1 to vesicles, to the plasma  membrane especially at epidermal cells of heart, torpedo and cotyledonary stage  embryos, and to the cell wall of the outer integument cells at the seed coat. Our  results suggest that ACBP1 is involved in intermembrane lipid transport from the  ER via vesicles to the plasma membrane where it could maintain a  membrane-associated acyl pool; its immunolocalization to the cell wall of outer  integument cells at the seed coat suggests a role in cuticle and cutin formation.', '1999 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00443.x', 'Zee']
