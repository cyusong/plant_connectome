Mung bean is an important grain-legume crop and its sprout is an economical and nutrient vegetable for the public, but the genetic regulation of anthocyanin production, which is an antioxidant in mung bean, remains elusive. In our study, we characterized a subgroup (SG) 6 R2R3-MYB anthocyanin activator VrMYB90 and a SG 4 R2R3-MYB anthocyanin repressor VrMYB3, which synergistically function in regulating anthocyanin synthesis with VrbHLHA transcription factor. The overexpressed VrMYB90 protein activates the expression of VrMYB3 and VrbHLHA in mung bean hair roots, and also promotes VrDFR and VrANS transcript levels by directly binding to the corresponding promoters at specific motifs (CAACTG and CCGTTG). VrMYB90 interacts with VrbHLHA to enhance its regulatory activities on VrDFR and VrANS. Furthermore, the interaction between VrMYB3 with VrMYB90 and VrbHLHA could result in the restriction of anthocyanin synthesis to prevent excessive anthocyanin accumulation. Our results demonstrate that the VrMYB90 protein, in conjunction with VrMYB3 and VrbHLHA, forms a key regulatory module to fine-tune anthocyanin synthesis in mung bean.
