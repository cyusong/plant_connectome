Grain shape is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). A rice mutant (JF178) with long and large grains has been used in a breeding program for over a decade, but its genetic basis has been unclear. Here, a semi-dominant QTL, designated Large Grain Size 1 (LGS1), was cloned and the potential molecular mechanism of LGS1 function was studied. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) and a map-based approach were employed to clone the LGS1 locus. LGS1 encodes the OsGRF4 transcription factor and contains a 2 bp missense mutation in the coding region that coincides with the putative pairing site of miRNA396. The LGS1 transcript levels in the mutant line were found to be higher than the lgs1 transcript levels in the control plants, suggesting that the mutation might disrupt the pairing of the LGS1 mRNA with miR396. In addition to producing larger grains, LGS1 also enhanced cold tolerance at the seedling stage and increased the survival rate of seedlings after cold stress treatment. These findings indicate that the mutation in LGS1 appears to disturb the GRF4-miR396 stress response network and results in the development of enlarged grains and enhancement of cold tolerance in rice.
