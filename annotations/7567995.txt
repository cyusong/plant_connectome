['7567995', 'Plant lipoxygenases are thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of  lipid-derived signaling molecules. The potential involvement of a specific  Arabidopsis thaliana lipoxygenase isozyme, LOX2, in the biosynthesis of the plant  growth regulators jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid was investigated. Our  characterization of LOX2 indicates that the protein is targeted to chloroplasts.  The physiological role of this chloroplast lipoxygenase was analyzed in  transgenic plants where cosuppression reduced LOX2 accumulation. The reduction in  LOX2 levels caused no obvious changes in plant growth or in the accumulation of  abscisic acid. However, the wound-induced accumulation of JA observed in control  plants was absent in leaves of transgenic plants that lacked LOX2. Thus, LOX2 is  required for the wound-induced synthesis of the plant growth regulator JA in  leaves. We also examined the expression of a wound- and JA-inducible Arabidopsis  gene, vsp, in transgenic and control plants. Leaves of transgenic plants lacking  LOX2 accumulated less vsp mRNA than did control leaves in response to wounding.  This result suggests that wound-induced JA (or some other LOX2-requiring  component of the wound response pathway) is involved in the wound-induced  regulation of this gene.', '1995 Sep 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.92.19.8675', 'Mullet']
