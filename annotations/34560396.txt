Vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase, VHA) is a highly conserved, ATP-driven multisubunit proton pump that is widely distributed in all eukaryotic cells. V-ATPase consists of two domains formed by at least 13 different subunits, the membrane peripheral V<sub>1</sub> domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and the membrane-integral V<sub>0</sub> domain responsible for proton translocation. V-ATPase plays an essential role in energizing secondary active transport and is indispensable to plants. In addition to multiple stress responses, plant V-ATPase is also implicated in physiological processes such as growth, development, and morphogenesis. Based on the identification of distinct V-ATPase mutants and advances in luminal pH measurements in vivo, it has been revealed that this holoenzyme complex plays a pivotal role in pH homeostasis of the plant endomembrane system and endocytic and secretory trafficking. Here, we review recent progress in comprehending the biochemical properties and physiological functions of plant V-ATPase and explore the topics that require further elucidation.
