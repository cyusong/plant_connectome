The hypersensitive response has been mostly studied by molecular and biochemical methods after sample destruction. The development of imaging techniques allows the monitoring of physiological changes before any signs of cell death. Here, we follow the early steps of a hypersensitive-like response induced by the bacterial elicitor harpin in Nicotiana sp. We describe cytological modifications after inoculation of the harpin protein, using confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), an interferometric-based microscopy. The changes detected by CFM occurred 5 h after harpin infiltration and corresponded to a redistribution of the chloroplasts from the upper to the inner regions of the palisade mesophyll cells which could be related to a perturbation in the microtubule network. Using OCT, we were able to detect a decrease in chloroplast backscattered signal as early as 30 min after harpin infiltration. A simple physical model, which accounted for the structure and distribution of thylakoid membranes, suggested that this loss of scattering could be associated with a modification in the refractive index of the thylakoid membranes. Our OCT observations were correlated with a decrease in photosynthesis, emphasizing changes in chloroplast structure as one of the earliest hallmarks of plant hypersensitive cell death.
