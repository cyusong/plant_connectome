Plant growth research produces a catalogue of complex open questions. We argue that plant growth is a highly mechanical process, and that mathematics gives an underlying framework with which to probe its fundamental unrevealed mechanisms. This review serves to illustrate the biological insights afforded by mathematical modelling and demonstrate the breadth of mathematically rich problems available within plant sciences, thereby promoting a mutual appreciation across the disciplines. On the one hand, we explain the general mathematical principles behind mechanical growth models; on the other, we describe how modelling addresses specific problems in microscale cell wall mechanics, tip growth, morphogenesis, and stress feedback. We conclude by identifying possible future directions for both biologists and mathematicians, including as yet unanswered questions within various topics, stressing that interdisciplinary collaboration is vital for tackling the challenge of understanding plant growth mechanics.
