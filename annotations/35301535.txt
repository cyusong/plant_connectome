Analyzing only one cell allows the changes and characteristics of intracellular metabolites during the chromosome segregation process to be precisely captured and mitotic sub-phases to be dissected at the metabolite level.

Gene: !affects! Metabolite level
Gene: !dissects! Mitotic sub-phases
Gene: !captures! Intracellular metabolites
