['29982821', 'The reticulate leaf vein pattern typical of angiosperms is proposed to have been  a driving force for their evolutionary success. Vein pattern is established  through auxin canalization via the auxin efflux protein PINFORMED1 (PIN1). During  formation of vein loops, PIN1 cellular localization is increasingly restricted to  either the basal side of cells in the lower domain or to the apical side in the  upper domain. We previously identified the gene FORKED1 (FKD1) to be required for  PIN1 asymmetric localization and for the formation of closed vein loops. FKD1  encodes a plant-specific protein with a domain of unknown function (DUF828) and a  Pleckstrin-like homology domain. The Arabidopsis genome encodes eight similar  proteins, which we term the FORKED1-LIKE (FL) gene family. Five FL family members  localize primarily to the trans-Golgi network or the Golgi, and several  co-localize with FKD1-green flourescent protein (GFP) and RABA1c, suggesting  action in the secretory pathway. While single FL gene family mutations do not  result in vein pattern defects, triple mutants with mutations in FKD1, FL2, and  FL3 result in a more symmetric PIN1 localization and a highly disconnected vein  pattern. Our data suggest that FL genes act redundantly with FKD1 in the  secretory pathway to establish appropriate PIN1 localization in provascular  tissue.', '2018 Sep 14', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ery248', 'Schultz']
