This study demonstrates a potential signaling pathway of CO 2-dependent stimulation in lateral root (LR) formation. Elevated CO 2 increases production of nitric oxide (NO), which subsequently stimulates the generation of cytosolic Ca (2+) concentration by activating plasma membrane and/or intracellular Ca (2+)-permeable channels. Meanwhile, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), as one of the main NO source, requires Ca (2+) and CaM as cofactors. This complex interaction involves transduction cascades of multiple signals that lead to the LR formation and development. Finally, this review highlights the the role of Ca (2+) in the process that elevated CO 2 enhances the development of LRs through increased NO level.
