The narrow base of genetic diversity of modern rice varieties is mainly attributed to the overuse of the common backbone parents that leads to the lack of varied favorable alleles in the process of breeding new varieties. Introgression lines (ILs) developed by a backcross strategy combined with marker-assisted selection (MAS) are powerful prebreeding tools for broadening the genetic base of existing cultivars. They have high power for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) either with major or minor effects, and are used for precisely evaluating the genetic effects of QTLs and detecting the gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions due to their low genetic background noise. ILs developed from multiple donors in a fixed background can be used as an IL platform to identify the best alleles or allele combinations for breeding by design. In the present paper, we reviewed the recent achievements from ILs in rice functional genomics research and breeding, including the genetic dissection of complex traits, identification of elite alleles and background-independent and epistatic QTLs, analysis of genetic interaction, and genetic improvement of single and multiple target traits. We also discussed how to develop ILs for further identification of new elite alleles, and how to utilize IL platforms for rice genetic improvement.
