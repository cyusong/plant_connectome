Given their diverse mating systems and recent divergence, wild tomatoes (<i>Solanum</i> section <i>Lycopersicon</i>) have become an attractive model system to study ecological divergence, the build-up of reproductive barriers, and the causes and consequences of the breakdown of self-incompatibility. Here we report on a lesser-studied group of species known as the "Arcanum" group, comprising the nominal species <i>Solanum arcanum</i>, <i>Solanum chmielewskii</i>, and <i>Solanum neorickii</i>. The latter two taxa are self-compatible but are thought to self-fertilize at different rates, given their distinct manifestations of the morphological "selfing syndrome." Based on experimental crossings and transcriptome sequencing of a total of 39 different genotypes from as many accessions representing each species' geographic range, we provide compelling evidence for deep genealogical divisions within <i>S. arcanum</i>; only the self-incompatible lineage known as "var. marañón" has close genealogical ties to the two self-compatible species. Moreover, there is evidence under multiple inference schemes for different geographic subsets of <i>S. arcanum</i> var. marañón being closest to <i>S. chmielewskii</i> and <i>S. neorickii</i>, respectively. To broadly characterize the population-genomic consequences of these recent mating-system transitions and their associated speciation events, we fit demographic models indicating strong reductions in effective population size, congruent with reduced nucleotide and <i>S</i>-locus diversity in the two independently derived self-compatible species.
