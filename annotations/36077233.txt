Bordeaux mixture (Bm) is a copper (Cu)-based pesticide that has been widely used for controlling citrus scab and citrus canker. However, frequent spraying of Bm is toxic to citrus. To our knowledge, few studies are available that discuss how the photosynthetic characteristics and chloroplast ultrastructure of citrus leaves are affected by Cu toxicity induced by excessive Bm. In the study, two-year-old seedlings of <i>Citrus grandis</i> (<i>C. grandis</i>) and <i>Citrus sinensis</i> (<i>C. sinensis</i>), which were precultured in pots, were foliar-sprayed with deionized water (as control) or Bm diluted 500-fold at intervals of 7 days for 6 times (4 times as recommended by the manufacturer) to investigate the leaf Cu absorption, photosynthesis, chloroplast ultrastructure and antioxidant enzymatic activities. Bm foliar-sprayed 6 times on citrus seedlings increased the leaf Cu content, decreased the photosynthetic pigments content and destroyed the chloroplast ultrastructure, which induced leaf chlorosis and photosynthetic inhibition. A lower Cu absorption, a higher light photon-electron transfer efficiency, a relative integrity of chloroplast ultrastructure and a promoted antioxidant protection contributed to a higher photosynthetic activity of <i>C. grandis</i> than <i>C. sinensis</i> under excessive spraying of Bm. The present study provides crucial references for screening and selecting citrus species with a higher tolerance to Cu toxicity induced by excessive Bm.
