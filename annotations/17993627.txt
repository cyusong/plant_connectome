['17993627', 'Root NO(3)(-) efflux to the outer medium is a component of NO(3)(-) net uptake  and can even overcome influx upon various stresses. Its role and molecular basis  are unknown. Following a functional biochemical approach, NAXT1 (for NITRATE  EXCRETION TRANSPORTER1) was identified by mass spectrometry in the plasma  membrane (PM) of Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells, a localization confirmed  using a NAXT1-Green Fluorescent Protein fusion protein. NAXT1 belongs to a  subclass of seven NAXT members from the large NITRATE TRANSPORTER1/PEPTIDE  TRANSPORTER family and is mainly expressed in the cortex of mature roots. The  passive NO(3)(-) transport activity (K(m) = 5 mM) in isolated root PM,  electrically coupled to the ATP-dependant H(+)-pumping activity, is inhibited by  anti-NAXT antibodies. In standard culture conditions, NO(3)(-) contents were  altered in plants expressing NAXT-interfering RNAs but not in naxt1 mutant  plants. Upon acid load, unidirectional root NO(3)(-) efflux markedly increased in  wild-type plants, leading to a prolonged NO(3)(-) excretion regime concomitant  with a decrease in root NO(3)(-) content. In vivo and in vitro mutant phenotypes  revealed that this response is mediated by NAXT1, whose expression is upregulated  at the posttranscriptional level. Strong medium acidification generated a similar  response. In vitro, the passive efflux of NO(3)(-) (but not of Cl(-)) was  strongly impaired in naxt1 mutant PM. This identification of NO(3)(-) efflux  transporters at the PM of plant cells opens the way to molecular studies of the  physiological role of NO(3)(-) efflux in stressed or unstressed plants.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048173', 'Gibrat']
