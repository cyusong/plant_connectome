In proteins, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) reacts with redox-sensitive cysteines to form cysteine sulfenic acid, also known as <i>S</i>-sulfenylation. These cysteine oxidation events can steer diverse cellular processes by altering protein interactions, trafficking, conformation, and function. Previously, we had identified <i>S</i>-sulfenylated proteins by using a tagged proteinaceous probe based on the yeast AP-1-like (Yap1) transcription factor that specifically reacts with sulfenic acids and traps them through a mixed disulfide bond. However, the identity of the <i>S</i>-sulfenylated amino acid residues within a protein remained enigmatic. By using the same transgenic YAP1C probe, we present here a technological advancement to identify <i>in situ</i> sulfenylated cysteine sites in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> cells under control condition and oxidative stress. Briefly, the total extract of transgenic YAP1C <i>A. thaliana</i> cells was initially purified on IgG-Sepharose beads, followed by a tryptic digest. Then, the mixed disulfide-linked peptides were further enriched at the peptide level on an anti-YAP1C-derived peptide (C<sub>598</sub>SEIWDR) antibody. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis with pLink 2 identified 1,745 YAP1C cross-linked peptides, indicating sulfenylated cysteines in over 1,000 proteins. Approximately 55% of these YAP1C-linked cysteines had previously been reported as redox-sensitive cysteines (<i>S</i>-sulfenylation, <i>S</i>-nitrosylation, and reversibly oxidized cysteines). The presented methodology provides a noninvasive approach to identify sulfenylated cysteines in any species that can be genetically modified.
