Directed growth of roots in relation to a moisture gradient is called hydrotropism. The no hydrotropic response (nhr1) mutant of Arabidopsis lacks a hydrotropic response, and shows a stronger gravitropic response than that of wild type (wt) in a medium with an osmotic gradient. Local application of abscisic acid (ABA) to seeds or root tips of nhr1 increased root downward growth, indicating the critical role of ABA in tropisms. Wt roots germinated and treated with ABA in this system were strongly gravitropic, even though they had almost no starch amyloplasts in the root-cap columella cells. Hydrotropically stimulated nhr1 roots, with or without ABA, maintained starch in the amyloplasts, as opposed to those of wt. Hence, the near-absence (wt) or abundant presence (nhr1) of starch granules does not influence the extent of downward gravitropism of the roots in an osmotic gradient medium. Starch degradation in the wt might help the root sustain osmotic stress and carry out hydrotropism, instead of reducing gravity responsiveness. nhr1 roots might be hydrotropically inactive because they maintain this starch reserve in the columella cells, sustaining both their turgor and growth, and in effect minimizing the need for hydrotropism and at least partially disabling its mechanism. We conclude that ABA and water stress are critical regulators of root tropic responses.
