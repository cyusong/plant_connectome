It is well known that cadmium (Cd) pollution inhibits plant growth, but how this metal impacts leaf growth processes at the cellular and molecular level is still largely unknown. In the current study, we show that Cd specifically accumulates in the meristematic tissue of the growing maize leaf, while Cd concentration in the elongation zone rapidly declines as the deposition rates diminish and cell volumes increase due to cell expansion. A kinematic analysis shows that, at the cellular level, a lower number of meristematic cells together with a significantly longer cell cycle duration explain the inhibition of leaf growth by Cd. Flow cytometry analysis suggests an inhibition of the G1/S transition, resulting in a lower proportion of cells in the S phase and reduced endoreduplication in expanding cells under Cd stress. Lower cell cycle activity is also reflected by lower expression levels of key cell cycle genes (putative wee1, cyclin-B2-4, and minichromosome maintenance4). Cell elongation rates are also inhibited by Cd, which is possibly linked to the inhibited endoreduplication. Taken together, our results complement studies on Cd-induced growth inhibition in roots and link inhibited cell cycle progression to Cd deposition in the leaf meristem.
