In plants, the importance of phospholipid signaling in responses to environmental stresses is becoming well documented. The involvement of phospholipids in abscisic acid (ABA) responses is also established. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the stimulation of phospholipase D (PLD) activity and plasma membrane anion currents by ABA were both required for RAB18 expression in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells. In this study, we show that the total lipids extracted from ABA-treated cells mimic ABA in activating plasmalemma anion currents and induction of RAB18 expression. Moreover, ABA evokes within 5 min a transient 1.7-fold increase in phosphatidic acid (PA) followed by a sevenfold increase in diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) at 20 min. PA activated plasmalemma anion currents but was incapable of triggering RAB18 expression. By contrast, DGPP mimicked ABA on anion currents and was also able to stimulate RAB18 expression. Here we show the role of DGPP as phospholipid second messenger in ABA signaling.

ABA: !stimulates! PLD activity 
ABA: !induces! RAB18 expression 
Total lipids: !mimic! ABA 
PA: !activates! plasmalemma anion currents 
PA: !inhibits! RAB18 expression 
DGPP: !mimics! ABA 
DGPP: !stimulates! RAB18 expression
