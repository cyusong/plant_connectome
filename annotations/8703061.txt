['8703061', 'The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) modulates a variety of developmental processes  and responses to environmental stress in higher plants. A collection of  mutations, designated era, in Arabidopsis thaliana that confer an enhanced  response to exogenous ABA includes mutations in the Era1 gene, which encodes the  beta subunit of a protein farnesyl transferase. In yeast and mammalian systems,  farnesyl transferases modify several signal transduction proteins for membrane  localization. The era1 mutants suggest that a negative regulator of ABA  sensitivity must be acted on by a farnesyl transferase to function.', '1996 Aug 30', 'Science', '10.1126/science.273.5279.1239', 'McCourt']
