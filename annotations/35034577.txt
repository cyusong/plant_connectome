DEK is associated with DNA replication and break repair, mRNA splicing, and transcriptional regulation, which had been studied in humans and mammals. The function of DEK in plants was poorly understood. In this study, <i>GhDEK</i>2D was identified in <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> by genome-wide and post-translational modifications. GhDEK2D had been phosphorylated, acetylated and ubiquitylated under <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (<i>Vd</i>) challenge. The <i>GhDEK2D</i>-silenced cotton decreased resistance against <i>Vd</i>. In <i>GhDEK2D</i>-silenced cotton plants, the reactive oxygen species was activated, the callose, xylogen, hypersensitive reaction (HR) and expression levels of defense-related genes were reduced. Homozygous overexpressing-GhDEK2D transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines were more resistant to Verticillium wilt (Vw). We propose that GhDEK2D was a potential molecular target for improving resistance to Vw in cotton.
