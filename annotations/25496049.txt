Plants as sessile organisms are strongly challenged by environmental stresses. Many plants species are able to cold-acclimate, acquiring higher freezing tolerance upon exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures. Among a plethora of adaptational processes, this involves the accumulation of cold regulated (COR) proteins that are assumed to stabilize and protect cellular structures during freezing. However, their molecular functions are largely unknown. We recently reported a comprehensive study of 2 intrinsically disordered cold regulated chloroplast proteins, COR15A and COR15B from Arabidopsis thaliana. They are necessary for full cold acclimation. During freezing, they stabilize leaf cells through folding and binding to chloroplast membranes. Contrary to evidence from in-vitro experiments, they play no role in enzyme stabilization in vivo. Elucidating these major functional and structural characteristics and estimation of protein abundance allow us to propose a detailed model for the mode of action of the two COR15 proteins.

COR15A: !stabilizes! Leaf cells
COR15B: !binds to! Chloroplast membranes
COR15A: !necessary for! Cold acclimation
COR15B: !plays no role in! Enzyme stabilization
