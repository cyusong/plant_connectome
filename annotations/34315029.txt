During germination, the availability of sugars, oxygen, or cellular energy fluctuates under dynamic environmental conditions, likely affecting the global RNA profile of rice genes. Most genes that exhibit sugar-regulation in rice embryos under aerobic conditions are responsive to low energy and anaerobic conditions, indicating that sugar regulation is strongly associated with energy and anaerobic signaling. The interference pattern of sugar regulation by either anaerobic or low energy conditions indicates that induction is likely the more prevalent regulatory mechanism than repression for altering the expression of sugar-regulated genes. Among the aerobically sugar-regulated genes, limited genes exhibit sugar regulation under anaerobic conditions, indicating that anaerobic conditions strongly influence sugar regulated gene expression. Anaerobically responsive genes substantially overlap with low energy responsive genes. In particular, the expression levels of anaerobically downregulated genes are consistent with those provoked by low energy conditions, suggesting that anaerobic downregulation results from the prevention of aerobic respiration due to the absence of the final electron acceptor, i.e., molecular oxygen. It has been noted that abscisic acid (ABA) responsive genes are over representative of genes upregulated under low energy conditions, in contrast to downregulated genes. This suggests that either ABA itself or upstream signaling components of the ABA signaling pathway are likely to be involved in the signaling pathways activated by low energy conditions.
