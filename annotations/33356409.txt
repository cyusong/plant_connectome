<i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i> is a phytopathogen that causes devastating bacterial canker in kiwifruit. Among five biovars defined by genetic, biochemical, and virulence traits, <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i> biovar 3 (Psa3) is the most aggressive and is responsible for the most recent reported outbreaks; however, the molecular basis of its heightened virulence is unclear. Therefore, we designed the first <i>P. syringae</i> multistrain whole-genome microarray, encompassing biovars Psa1, Psa2, and Psa3 and the well-established model <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i>, and analyzed early bacterial responses to an apoplast-like minimal medium. Transcriptomic profiling revealed i) the strong activation in Psa3 of all hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity (<i>hrp</i>) and <i>hrp</i> conserved (<i>hrc</i>) cluster genes, encoding components of the type III secretion system required for bacterial pathogenicity and involved in responses to environmental signals; ii) potential repression of the <i>hrp</i>/<i>hrc</i> cluster in Psa2; and iii) activation of flagellum-dependent cell motility and chemotaxis genes in Psa1. The detailed investigation of three gene families encoding upstream regulatory proteins (histidine kinases, their cognate response regulators, and proteins with diguanylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase domains) indicated that cyclic di-GMP may be a key regulator of virulence in <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i> biovars. The gene expression data were supported by the quantification of biofilm formation. Our findings suggest that diverse early responses to the host apoplast, even among bacteria belonging to the same pathovar, can lead to different virulence strategies and may explain the differing outcomes of infections. Based on our detailed structural analysis of <i>hrp</i> operons, we also propose a revision of <i>hrp</i> cluster organization and operon regulation in <i>P. syringae.</i>[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
