K-type cytoplasmic male sterility (KCMS) lines were ideal material for three-line hybrid wheat system due to the major role in hybrid wheat production. In this study, the morphology of developing microspore and mature pollen was compared between a KCMS line and its near-isogenic restorer line (KCMS-NIL). The most striking difference is that the microspore was unable to develop into tricellular pollen in the KCMS line. MicroRNA plays vital roles in flowering and gametophyte development. Small RNA sequencing identified a total of 274 known and 401 novel miRNAs differentially expressed between two lines or two developmental stages. Most of miRNAs with high abundance were differentially expressed at the uninucleate stage, and their expression level recovered or remained at the binucleate stage. Further degradome sequencing identified target genes which were mainly enriched in transcription regulation, phytohormone signaling and RNA degradation pathways. Combining with the transcriptome data, a correlation was found between the abnormal anther development, such as postmeiotic mitosis cessation, deformative pollen wall and the chromosome condensation of the vegetative cell, and the alterations in the related miRNA and their targets expression profiles. According to the correlation and pathway analysis, we propose a hypothetic miRNA-mediated network for the control of KCMS restoration.
