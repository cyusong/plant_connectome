Magnani et al. found that net carbon (C) sequestration of temperate and boreal forests is clearly driven by nitrogen (N) deposition. From the positive relationship between average net ecosystem production (NEP) and wet N deposition, the authors further conclude that "no signs of N saturation were apparent" in the studied forests and that this is "casting doubts on the risk of widespread ecosystem nitrogen saturation". Nitrogen additions can clearly alter net ecosystem production, but net ecosystem production cannot be used as an indicator of N saturation.

N deposition: !affects! NEP
N deposition: !increases! C sequestration
N saturation: !not indicated by! NEP
N saturation: !casts doubt on! risk of widespread ecosystem nitrogen saturation
