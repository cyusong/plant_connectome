Elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (eCO<sub>2</sub>) regulate plant architecture and susceptibility to insects. We explored the mechanisms underpinning these responses in wild type (WT) peas and mutants defective in either strigolactone (SL) synthesis or signaling. All genotypes had increased shoot height and branching, dry weights and carbohydrate levels under eCO<sub>2</sub>, demonstrating that SLs are not required for shoot acclimation to eCO<sub>2</sub>. Since shoot levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) tended to be lower in SL signaling mutants than the WT under ambient conditions, we compared pea aphid performance on these lines under both CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Aphid fecundity was increased in the SL mutants compared to the WT under both ambient and eCO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Aphid infestation significantly decreased levels of JA, isopentenyladenine, <i>trans</i>-zeatin and gibberellin A4 and increased ethylene precursor ACC, gibberellin A1, gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) and SA accumulation in all lines. However, GA<sub>3</sub> levels were increased less in the SL signaling mutants than the WT. These studies provide new insights into phytohormone responses in this specific aphid/host interaction and suggest that SLs and gibberellins are part of the network of phytohormones that participate in host susceptibility.
