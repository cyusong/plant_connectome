Plant-pathogen interactions result in disease development in a susceptible host. Plants actively resist pathogens via a complex immune system comprising both surface-localized receptors that sense the extracellular space as well as intracellular receptors recognizing pathogen effectors. To date, the majority of cloned resistance genes encode intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor proteins. Recent discoveries have revealed tandem kinase proteins (TKPs) as another important family of intracellular proteins involved in plant immune responses. Five TKP genes-barley <i>Rpg1</i> and wheat <i>WTK1</i> (<i>Yr15</i>), <i>WTK2</i> (<i>Sr60</i>), <i>WTK3</i> (<i>Pm24</i>), and <i>WTK4</i>-protect against devastating fungal diseases. Moreover, a large diversity and numerous putative TKPs exist across the plant kingdom. This review explores our current knowledge of TKPs and serves as a basis for future studies that aim to develop and exploit a deeper understanding of innate plant immunity receptor proteins.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
