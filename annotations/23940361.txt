Transposable elements (TEs) can drive evolution by creating genetic and epigenetic variation. Although examples of adaptive TE insertions are accumulating, proof that epigenetic information carried by such "domesticated" TEs has been coopted to control host gene function is still limited. We show that COPIA-R7, a TE inserted into the Arabidopsis thaliana disease resistance gene RPP7 recruited the histone mark H3K9me2 to this locus. H3K9me2 levels at COPIA-R7 affect the choice between two alternative RPP7 polyadenylation sites in the pre-mRNA and, thereby, influence the critical balance between RPP7-coding and non-RPP7-coding transcript isoforms. Function of RPP7 is fully dependent on high levels of H3K9me2 at COPIA-R7. We present a direct in vivo demonstration for cooption of a TE-associated histone mark to the epigenetic control of pre-mRNA processing and establish a unique mechanism for regulation of plant immune surveillance gene expression. Our results functionally link a histone mark to alternative polyadenylation and the balance between distinct transcript isoforms from a single gene.
