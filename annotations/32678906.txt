Plant phenotypes caused by mineral deficiencies differ depending on growth conditions. We recently reported that the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana was severely inhibited on MGRL-based zinc (Zn)-deficient medium but not on Murashige-Skoog-based Zn-deficient medium. Here, we explored the underlying reason for the phenotypic differences in Arabidopsis grown on the different media. The root growth and chlorophyll contents reduced by Zn deficiency were rescued by the addition of extra manganese (Mn) during short-term growth (10 or 14 d). However, this treatment did not affect the growth recovery after long-term growth (38 d). To investigate the reason for plant recovery from Zn deficiency, we performed the RNA-seq analysis of the roots grown on the Zn-basal medium and the Zn-depleted medium with/without additional Mn. Principal component analysis of the RNA-seq data showed that the gene expression patterns of plants on the Zn-basal medium were similar to those on the Zn-depleted medium with Mn, whereas those on the Zn-depleted medium without Mn were different from the others. The expression of several transcription factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes was upregulated in only plants on the Zn-depleted medium without Mn. Consistent with the gene expression data, ROS accumulation in the roots grown on this medium was higher than those grown in other conditions. These results suggest that plants accumulate ROS and reduce their biomass under undesirable growth conditions, such as Zn depletion. Taken together, this study shows that the addition of extra Mn to the Zn-depleted medium induces transcriptional changes in ROS-related genes, thereby alleviating short-term growth inhibition due to Zn deficiency.
