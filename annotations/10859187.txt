['10859187', 'Acquired thermotolerance is a complex physiological phenomenon that enables  plants to survive normally lethal temperatures. This study characterizes the  temperature sensitivity of Arabidopsis using a chlorophyll accumulation bioassay,  describes a procedure for selection of acquired thermotolerance mutants, and  provides the physiological characterization of one mutant (AtTS02) isolated by  this procedure. Exposure of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings to 48 degrees C or 50  degrees C for 30 min blocks subsequent chlorophyll accumulation and is eventually  lethal. Arabidopsis seedlings can be protected against the effects of a 50  degrees C, 30-min challenge by a 4-h pre-incubation at 38 degrees C. By the use  of the milder challenge, 44 degrees C for 30 min, and protective pretreatment,  mutants lacking components of the acquired thermotolerance system were isolated.  Putative mutants isolated by this procedure exhibited chlorophyll accumulation  levels (our measure of acquired thermotolerance) ranging from 10% to 98% of  control seedling levels following pre-incubation at 38 degrees C and challenge at  50 degrees C. The induction temperatures for maximum acquired thermotolerance  prior to a high temperature challenge were the same in AtTS02 and RLD seedlings,  although the absolute level of chlorophyll accumulation was reduced in the  mutant. Genetic analysis showed that the loss of acquired thermotolerance in  AtTS02 was a recessive trait. The pattern of proteins synthesized at 25 degrees C  and 38 degrees C in the RLD and AtTS02 revealed the reduction in the level of a  27-kD heat shock protein in AtTS02. Genetic analysis showed that the reduction of  this protein level was correlated with the acquired thermotolerance phenotype.', '2000 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.123.2.575', 'Oliver']
