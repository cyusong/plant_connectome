Root lodging poses a major threat to maize production, resulting in reduced grain yield and quality, and increased harvest costs. Here, we combined expressional, genetic, and cytological studies to demonstrate a role of ZmYUC2 and ZmYUC4 in regulating gravitropic response of the brace root and lodging resistance in maize. We show that both ZmYUC2 and ZmYUC4 are preferentially expressed in root tips with partially overlapping expression patterns, and the protein products of ZmYUC2 and ZmYUC4 are localized in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The Zmyuc4 single mutant and Zmyuc2/4 double mutant exhibit enlarged brace root angle compared with the wild-type plants, with larger brace root angle being observed in the Zmyuc2/4 double mutant. Consistently, the brace root tips of the Zmyuc4 single mutant and Zmyuc2/4 double mutant accumulate less auxin and are defective in proper reallocation of auxin in response to gravi-stimuli. Furthermore, we show that the Zmyuc4 single mutant and the Zmyuc2/4 double mutant display obviously enhanced root lodging resistance. Our combined results demonstrate that ZmYUC2- and ZmYUC4-mediated local auxin biosynthesis is required for normal gravity response of the brace roots and provide effective targets for breeding root lodging resistant maize cultivars.
