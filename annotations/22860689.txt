['22860689', 'In recent years, multiple factors involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB)  repair have been characterised in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using homologous  sequences in somatic cells, DSBs are mainly repaired by two different pathways:  synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) and single-strand annealing (SSA). By  applying recombination substrates in which recombination is initiated by the  induction of a site-specific DSB by the homing endonuclease I-SceI, we were able  to characterise the involvement of different factors in both pathways. The  nucleases MRE11 and COM1, both involved in DSB end processing, were not required  for either SDSA or SSA in our assay system. Both SDSA and SSA were even more  efficient without MRE11, in accordance with the fact that a loss of MRE11 might  negatively affect the efficiency of non-homologous end joining. Loss of the  classical recombinase RAD51 or its two paralogues RAD51C and XRCC3, as well as  the SWI2/SNF2 remodelling factor RAD54, resulted in a drastic deficiency in SDSA  but had hardly any influence on SSA, confirming that a strand exchange reaction  is only required for SDSA. The helicase FANCM, which is postulated to be involved  in the stabilisation of recombination intermediates, is surprisingly not only  needed for SDSA but to a lesser extent also for SSA. Both SSA and SDSA were  affected only weakly when the SMC6B protein, implicated in sister chromatid  recombination, was absent, indicating that SSA and SDSA are in most cases  intrachromatid recombination reactions.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05119.x', 'Puchta']
