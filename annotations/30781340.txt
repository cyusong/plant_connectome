Recent studies have demonstrated that strigolactones (SLs) also participate in the regulation of stress adaptation; however, the regulatory mechanism remains elusive. In this study, the homolog of <i>More Axillary Branches 2</i>, which encodes a key component in SL signaling, in the perennial oil plant <i>Sapium sebiferum</i> was identified and functionally characterized in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The results showed that the expression of <i>SsMAX2</i> in <i>S. sebiferum</i> seedlings was stress-responsive, and <i>SsMAX2</i> overexpression (OE) in <i>Arabidopsis</i> significantly promoted resistance to drought, osmotic, and salt stresses. Moreover, <i>SsMAX2</i> OE lines exhibited decreased chlorophyll degradation, increased soluble sugar and proline accumulation, and lower water loss ratio in response to the stresses. Importantly, anthocyanin biosynthesis and the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), were enhanced in the <i>SsMAX2</i> OE lines, which further led to a significant reduction in hydrogen peroxide levels. Additionally, the <i>SsMAX2</i> OE lines exhibited higher expression level of several abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis genes, suggesting potential interactions between SL and ABA in the regulation of stress adaptation. Overall, we provide physiological and biochemical evidence demonstrating the pivotal role of <i>SsMAX2</i> in the regulation of osmotic, drought, and salt stress resistance and show that <i>MAX2</i> can be a genetic target to improve stress tolerance.
