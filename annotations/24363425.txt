Plants control the time at which they flower in order to ensure reproductive success. This control is underpinned by precision in gene regulation acting through genetically separable pathways. The genetic dissection of this process in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has led to the recurrent identification of plant-specific and highly conserved RNA 3' end processing factors required to control flowering by specifically controlling transcription of mRNA encoding the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Here, we review the features of these RNA-processing and RNA-associated proteins, and the complex architecture of coding and non-coding RNA transcription at the FLC locus. We discuss alternative concepts that might explain how these RNA-processing events regulate FLC transcription and hence control flowering time.

RNA-processing factor: !controls! FLC transcription 
RNA-processing factor: !regulates! flowering time 
FLC transcription: !affects! flowering time 
RNA-associated proteins: !interact with! RNA-processing factors 
coding and non-coding RNA transcription: !occurs at! FLC locus
