Phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1) and capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (CCS) are two major genes responsible for fruit color variation in pepper (Capsicum spp.). However, the role of PSY2 remains unknown. We used a systemic approach to examine the genetic factors responsible for the yellow fruit color of C. annuum 'MicroPep Yellow' (MY) and to determine the role of PSY2 in fruit color. We detected complete deletion of PSY1 and a retrotransposon insertion in CCS. Despite the loss of PSY1 and CCS function, both MY and mutant F2 plants from a cross between MY and the 'MicroPep Red' (MR) accumulated basal levels of carotenoids, indicating that other PSY genes may complement the loss of PSY1. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that PSY2 was constitutively expressed in both MR and MY fruits, and a color complementation assay using Escherichia coli revealed that PSY2 was capable of biosynthesizing a carotenoid. Virus-induced gene silencing of PSY2 in MY resulted in white fruits. These findings indicate that PSY2 can compensate for the absence of PSY1 in pepper fruit, resulting in the yellow color of MY fruits.
