Chemical defoliation is an important part of cotton mechanical harvesting, which can effectively reduce the impurity content. Thidiazuron (TDZ) is the most used chemical defoliant on cotton. To better clarify the mechanism of TDZ promoting cotton leaf abscission, a greenhouse experiment was conducted on two cotton cultivars (CRI 12 and CRI 49) by using 100 mg L<sup>-1</sup> TDZ at the eight-true-leaf stage. Results showed that TDZ significantly promoted the formation of leaf abscission zone and leaf abscission. Although the antioxidant enzyme activities were improved, the reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of TDZ increased significantly compared with CK (water). The photosynthesis system was destroyed as net photosynthesis (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), and stomatal conductance (Gs) decreased dramatically by TDZ. Furthermore, comparative RNA-seq analysis of the leaves showed that all of the photosynthetic related genes were downregulated and the oxidation-reduction process participated in leaf shedding caused by TDZ. Consequently, a hypothesis involving possible cross-talk between ROS metabolism and photosynthesis jointly regulating cotton leaf abscission is proposed. Our findings not only provide important insights into leaf shedding-associated changes induced by TDZ in cotton, but also highlight the possibility that the ROS and photosynthesis may play a critical role in the organ shedding process in other crops.
