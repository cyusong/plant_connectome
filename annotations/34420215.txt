Osmotic stress influences root system architecture, and polar auxin transport (PAT) is well established to regulate root growth and development. However, how PAT responds to osmotic stress at the molecular level remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored whether and how the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED3 (PIN3) participates in osmotic stress-induced root growth inhibition in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We observed that osmotic stress induces a HD-ZIP II transcription factor-encoding gene HOMEODOMAIN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA2 (HAT2) expression in roots. The hat2 loss-of-function mutant is less sensitive to osmotic stress in terms of root meristem growth. Consistent with this phenotype, whereas the auxin response is downregulated in wild-type roots under osmotic stress, the inhibition of auxin response by osmotic stress was alleviated in hat2 roots. Conversely, transgenic lines overexpressing HAT2 (Pro35S::HAT2) had shorter roots and reduced auxin accumulation compared with wild-type plants. PIN3 expression was significantly reduced in the Pro35S::HAT2 lines. We determined that osmotic stress-mediated repression of PIN3 was alleviated in the hat2 mutant because HAT2 normally binds to the promoter of PIN3 and inhibits its expression. Taken together, our data revealed that osmotic stress inhibits root growth via HAT2, which regulates auxin activity by directly repressing PIN3 transcription.
