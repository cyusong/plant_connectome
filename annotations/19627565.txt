The mechanisms by which stomata respond to red light and CO(2) are unknown, but much of the current literature assumes that these mechanisms reside wholly within the guard cells. However, responses of guard cells in isolated epidermes are typically much smaller than those in leaves, and there are several lines of evidence in the literature suggesting that the mesophyll is necessary for these responses in leaves. This paper advances the opinion that although guard cells may have small direct responses to red light and CO(2), most of the stomatal response to these factors in leaves is caused by an unknown signal that originates in the mesophyll.

Mesophyll: !sends signal to! Guard Cells
Guard Cells: !respond to! Red Light & CO2
