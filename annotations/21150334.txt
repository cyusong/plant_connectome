Cyanobacteria sense and respond to changes in an ambient light environment using highly specialized photoreceptors coupled to signal transduction pathways. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is currently used as a model system to study light signal transduction in cyanobacteria. Recently, several important players, including photoreceptors and other signaling partners, have been identified in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. However, the nature of the molecules that act as UV/blue light sensors (and their downstream signaling mechanism) has not been elucidated. It has been postulated that pterins might serve as possible photoreceptor pigments for some behavioral responses induced by UV/blue light. By investigating the photomovement of wild-type and a pgtA mutant to UV/blue light, we demonstrated that cyanopterin is indeed involved in inhibiting negative phototaxis under UV/blue light. In this addendum, we provide additional evidence showing that the UV/blue action spectrum of the phototactic response coincides with the fluorescence spectrum of the in vivo cyanobacterial cryptochrome, DASH. Based on these results, we discuss the potential role of pterin as a UV-A absorbing chromophore of the cryptochrome in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
