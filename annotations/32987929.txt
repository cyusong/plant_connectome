In the present study, we have shown the transcriptional changes in a chlorosis model transgenic tobacco plant, i-amiCHLI, in which an artificial micro RNA is expressed in a chemically inducible manner to silence the expression of <i>CHLI</i> genes encoding a subunit of a chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme. Comparison to the inducer-treated and untreated control non-transformants and untreated i-amiCHLI revealed that 3568 and 3582 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the inducer-treated i-amiCHLI plants. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated the upregulation of the genes related to innate immune responses, and cell death pathways, and the downregulation of genes for photosynthesis, plastid organization, and primary and secondary metabolic pathways in the inducer-treated i-amiCHLI plants. The cell death in the chlorotic tissues with a preceding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was observed in the inducer-treated i-amiCHLI plants, confirming the activation of the immune response. The involvement of activated innate immune response in the chlorosis development was supported by the comparative expression analysis between the two transgenic chlorosis model systems, i-amiCHLI and i-hpHSP90C, in which nuclear genes encoding different chloroplast proteins were similarly silenced.
