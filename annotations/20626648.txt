['20626648', 'CLAVATA1 (CLV1), CLV2, CLV3, CORYNE (CRN), BAM1 and BAM2 are key regulators that  function at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of plants to promote differentiation  by limiting the size of the organizing center that maintains stem cell identity  in neighboring cells. Previous results have indicated that the extracellular  domain of the receptor kinase CLV1 binds to the CLV3-derived CLE ligand. The  biochemical role of the receptor-like protein CLV2 has remained largely unknown.  Although genetic analysis suggested that CLV2, together with the membrane kinase  CRN, acts in parallel with CLV1, recent studies using transient expression  indicated that CLV2 and CRN from a complex with CLV1. Here, we report detection  of distinct CLV2-CRN heteromultimeric and CLV1-BAM multimeric complexes in  transient expression in tobacco and in Arabidopsis meristems. Weaker interactions  between the two complexes were detectable in transient expression. We also find  that CLV2 alone generates a membrane-localized CLE binding activity independent  of CLV1. CLV2, CLV1 and the CLV1 homologs BAM1 and BAM2 all bind to the  CLV3-derived CLE peptide with similar kinetics, but BAM receptors show a broader  range of interactions with different CLE peptides. Finally, we show that BAM and  CLV1 overexpression can compensate for the loss of CLV2 function in vivo. These  results suggest two parallel ligand-binding receptor complexes controlling stem  cell specification in Arabidopsis.', '2010 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04295.x', 'Clark']
