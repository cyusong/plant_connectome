Photooxidation is the major physiological performance of the Lagerstroemia indica chlorosis mutant gl1 under field conditions. The mechanisms of the progressive symptoms of oxidative damage from the lower older leaves to the upper mature leaves are complicated and still unclear. The aim of this work was to investigate the physiological mechanisms of oxidative stress from the perspective of the photosynthetic metabolites. The phytosynthetic metabolites of gl1 mutant changed significantly compared to wild type (WT) L. indica, such as by increasing phenolics, decreasing soluble sugar, protein and ascorbate, and redistributing antioxidant enzyme activities. The co-accumulation of phenolics and guaiacol-POD in gl1 mutant promote the removal of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as well the increase of phenoxyl radicals levels. Furthermore, the ion balance was significantly disturbed and Fe accumulated the most among these fluctuating nutrients in the leaves of gl1 mutant. The accumulated Fe was found neither in the chloroplasts nor in the cell wall of the leaves and became unshielded Fe, which favors the Fenton/Haber-Weiss reaction and stabilizes the phenoxyl radicals in metal complexation. The results suggested that the increase of phenolics and Fe accumulation were obviously involved in oxidative damage of gl1 mutant.
