Polar auxin transport (PAT) plays a critical role in the regulation of plant growth and development. Auxin influx carrier AUX1 is predominantly localized to the upper side of specific root cells in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GTPase activating protein in rice, could induce the accumulation of AUX1. But the mechanism is poorly known. Here we reported that over-expression of ARF-GAP could reduce the thickness and bundling of microfilament (MF) which possibly could greatly interfere with the endocytosis of AUX1 early endosome; but not the exocytosis of AUX1 recycling endosome. Therefore, AFR-GAP over-expression suppressed-MF bundling is likely involved in regulating endocytosis of Auxin influx carrier AUX1 and in mediating auxin dependent plant development.
