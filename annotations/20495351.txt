Genes coding for drought response element binding (DREB) proteins regulate transcription of a large number of downstream genes involved in the plant response to abiotic stresses. However the regulation of DREB genes themselves is not well understood. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified the over-represented motifs in promoters of DREB genes of sorghum and rice as compared to all the other promoters in their genomes. Aligned orthologous promoter pairs of sorghum and rice DREBs were then used to identify co-localized motifs from among the over-represented ones, assuming that such motifs were likely to play a regulatory role. Finally the motifs over-represented in sorghum DREBs in comparison to their rice orthologs were identified. Results indicated over-representation of motifs pertaining to calcium, light, sugar, and hormone signaling in the DREB promoters. The co-localized motifs in DREB promoters were mainly those involved in abscisic acid-, light- and calcium-mediated regulation. These motifs along with others pertaining to ethylene signaling were over-represented in sorghum DREB promoters as compared to their orthologs from rice and could possibly contribute to its drought tolerance. Besides calcium, an integration of abscisic acid, ethylene, auxin and methyl jasmonate signaling was probably involved in regulating expression of the drought response through DREB transcription factors.
