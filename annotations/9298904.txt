['9298904', 'Brassinosteroids are a class of growth-promoting regulators that play a key role  throughout plant development. Despite their importance, nothing is known of the  mechanism of action of these steroid hormones. We describe the identification of  18 Arabidopsis dwarf mutants that are unable to respond to exogenously added  brassinosteroid, a phenotype that might be expected for brassinosteroid signaling  mutants. All 18 mutations define alleles of a single previously described gene,  BRI1. We cloned BRI1 and examined its expression pattern. It encodes a  ubiquitously expressed putative receptor kinase. The extracellular domain  contains 25 tandem leucine-rich repeats that resemble repeats found in animal  hormone receptors, plant disease resistance genes, and genes involved in unknown  signaling pathways controlling plant development.', '1997 Sep 5', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80357-8', 'Chory']
