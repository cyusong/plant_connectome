The Brassicaceae family halophyte Thellungiella halophila has a high salinity tolerance and serves as a valuable halophytic genetic model plant with experimental convenience similar to Arabidopsis thaliana. A cDNA library of Thellungiella was generated from salt-treated seedlings including rosettes and roots. More than 1 000 randomly selected clones were sequenced and 946 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated. The accession numbers of our EST data are available online in the GenBank database from EC598928 to EC599965. In total 679 unique clusters were assembled, and 632 (93%) had BLASTX hits in the nr databases and 7% are Thellungiella unique. According to the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy, 385 of 679 unigenes were categorized. Compared with public Arabidopsis microarray data, our results provide more potential salt tolerance genes in Thellungiella. These results will provide a broader coverage into Thellungiella transcriptome and benefit the discovery of salt tolerance related genes.
