Although roots are mainly embedded in the soil, recent studies revealed that light regulates mineral nutrient uptake by roots. However, it remains unclear whether the change in root system architecture in response to different rhizosphere nutrient statuses involves light signaling. Here, we report that blue light regulates primary root growth inhibition under phosphate-deficient conditions through the cryptochromes and their downstream signaling factors. We showed that the inhibition of root elongation by low phosphate requires blue light signal perception at the shoot and transduction to the root. In this process, SPA1 and COP1 play a negative role while HY5 plays a positive role. Further experiments revealed that HY5 is able to migrate from the shoot to root and that the shoot-derived HY5 autoactivates root HY5 and regulates primary root growth by directly activating the expression of LPR1, a suppressor of root growth under phosphate starvation. Taken together, our study reveals a regulatory mechanism by which blue light signaling regulates phosphate deficiency-induced primary root growth inhibition, providing new insights into the crosstalk between light and nutrient signaling.
