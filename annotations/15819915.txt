Fitness of individual plants and of populations depends on the rates of survival, growth and fecundity. This study tested whether vital rates were differentially affected by biotic interactions and water availability. The effects of manipulations of above-ground competition (through clipping) and water availability (through water addition) on the vital rates of seedlings of three species (Viola elatior Fries, Viola pumila Chaix and Viola stagnina Kit.) were analysed in dry, mesic and wet grasslands. Water addition and grassland type had the largest effects on survival (accounting for 41 and 24% of total variation, respectively) across species. Height growth rate was positively affected by grassland type (19%) and water addition (12%) and varied among species (8%), while leaf accumulation rates and reproduction were affected by grassland type and clipping. The data suggested facilitative effects of the canopy on seedling survival in the dry grassland. This study presents evidence that environmental conditions and biotic interactions may have differential effects on seedling survival, growth and reproduction. The findings highlight the complex interplay between spatial and temporal environmental variation and biotic interactions in structuring plant communities.
