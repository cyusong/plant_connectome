['27014322', 'Polyamines (PAs) are small aliphatic polycations that are found ubiquitously in  all organisms. In plants, PAs are involved in diverse biological processes such  as growth, development, and stress responses. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the  arginine decarboxylase enzymes (ADC1 and 2) catalyze the first step of PA  biosynthesis. For a better understanding of PA biological functions, mutants in  PA biosynthesis have been generated; however, the double adc1/adc2 mutant is not  viable in A. thaliana. In this study, we generated non-lethal A. thaliana lines  through an artificial microRNA that simultaneously silenced the two ADC genes  (amiR:ADC). The generated transgenic lines (amiR:ADC-L1 and -L2) showed reduced  AtADC1 and AtADC2 transcript levels. For further analyses the amiR:ADC-L2 line  was selected. We found that the amiR:ADC-L2 line showed a significant decrease of  their PA levels. The co-silencing revealed a stunted growth in A. thaliana  seedlings, plantlets and delay in its flowering rate; these phenotypes were  reverted with PA treatment. In addition, amiR:ADC-L2 plants displayed two seed  phenotypes, such as yellow and brownish seeds. The yellow mutant seeds were  smaller than adc1, adc2 mutants and wild type seeds; however, the brownish were  the smallest seeds with arrested embryos at the torpedo stage. These data  reinforce the importance of PA homeostasis in the plant development processes.', '2016', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2016.00300', 'Jimenez-Bremont']
