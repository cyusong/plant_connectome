Although transcriptome changes have long been recognized as a mechanism to induce tentative substitution of expressed genes in diverse biological processes in plants, the regulation of translation-the final step of the central dogma of molecular biology-emerged as an alternative and prominent layer in defining the output of genes. Despite these demands, the genome-wide analysis of protein synthesis has posed technical challenges, resulting in the plant translatome being poorly understood. The development of ribosome profiling promises to address the hidden aspects of translation, and its application to plants is revolutionizing our knowledge of the translatome. This review outlines the array of recent findings provided by ribosome profiling and illustrates the power of the versatile technique in green organisms.
