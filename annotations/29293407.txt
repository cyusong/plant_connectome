The phytohormone jasmonates (JAs) regulate plant development, growth, secondary metabolism, and defense responses. JAs act through CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) to induce the degradation of JA ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, and activate JAZ-repressed transcription factors to regulate plant response. We previously showed that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and MYB members of the WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex interacted with JAZs and mediated JA-induced anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation. In this study, we showed that the C-terminal domain of the bHLH members (GLABRA3 [GL3], ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 [EGL3] and TRANSPARENT TESTA8 [TT8]) interacted with JAZs in yeast and plant, and mediated dimerizations between the bHLH members. Our study provides further understanding of the bHLH members of the WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex in JA pathway.
