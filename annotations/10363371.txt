['10363371', 'Mutations in the LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.  (Arabidopsis) confer a late-flowering phenotype, indicating that LD normally  functions to promote the floral transition. RNA and protein blot analyses, along  with the analysis of transgenic plants containing a fusion between a genomic  fragment of LD and the reporter gene uidA (GUS), indicate that LD is expressed  primarily ipical proliferative regions of the shoot and root, including the shoot  apical meristem and leaf primordia. Subcellular localization studies indicate  that LD is a nuclear protein, consistent with its previously proposed  transcriptional regulatory role. We have also found that in an apetala1  cauliflower (ap1 cal) background the ld mutation converts the reproductive shoot  apex to a more vegetative state, a phenotype that is similar to that seen for the  leafy (lfy) mutant. Furthermore, in situ hybridization analysis indicates that  LFY levels are drastically reduced at the apex of ld ap1 cal plants after  bolting. These data are consistent with the idea that at least one function of LD  is to participate in the regulation of LFY.', '1999 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00442.x', 'Amasino']
