The narrow genetic base of tomato poses serious challenges in breeding. Hence, with the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein9 (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing, fast and efficient breeding has become possible in tomato breeding. Many traits have been edited and functionally characterized using CRISPR/Cas9 in tomato such as plant architecture and flower characters (e.g. leaf, stem, flower, male sterility, fruit, parthenocarpy), fruit ripening, quality and nutrition (e.g., lycopene, carotenoid, GABA, TSS, anthocyanin, shelf-life), disease resistance (e.g. TYLCV, powdery mildew, late blight), abiotic stress tolerance (e.g. heat, drought, salinity), C-N metabolism, and herbicide resistance. CRISPR/Cas9 has been proven in introgression of <i>de novo</i> domestication of elite traits from wild relatives to the cultivated tomato and vice versa. Innovations in CRISPR/Cas allow the use of online tools for single guide RNA design and multiplexing, cloning (e.g. Golden Gate cloning, GoldenBraid, and BioBrick technology), robust CRISPR/Cas constructs, efficient transformation protocols such as <i>Agrobacterium</i>, and DNA-free protoplast method for Cas9-gRNAs ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) complex, Cas9 variants like PAM-free Cas12a, and Cas9-NG/XNG-Cas9, homologous recombination (HR)-based gene knock-in (HKI) by geminivirus replicon, and base/prime editing (Target-AID technology). This mini-review highlights the current research advances in CRISPR/Cas for fast and efficient breeding of tomato.
