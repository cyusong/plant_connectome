Soybean staygreen syndrome, characterized by delayed leaf and stem senescence, abnormal pods, and aborted seeds, has recently become a serious and prominent problem in soybean production. Although the pest Riptortus pedestris has received increasing attention as the possible cause of staygreen syndrome, the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we clarify that direct feeding by R. pedestris, not transmission of a pathogen by this pest, is the primary cause of typical soybean staygreen syndrome and that critical feeding damage occurs at the early pod stage. Transcriptome profiling of soybean indicated that many signal transduction pathways, including photoperiod, hormone, defense response, and photosynthesis, respond to R. pedestris infestation. Importantly, we discovered that members of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene family were suppressed by R. pedestris infestation, and overexpression of floral inducer GmFT2a attenuates staygreen symptoms by mediating soybean defense response and photosynthesis. Together, our findings systematically illustrate the association between pest infestation and soybean staygreen syndrome and provide the basis for establishing a targeted soybean pest prevention and control system.
