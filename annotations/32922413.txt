Salt stress is one of the main factors that affect both growth and development of plants. Maintaining K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> balance in the cytoplasm is important for metabolism as well as salt resistance in plants. In the present study, we monitored the growth (height and diameter) of transgenic <i>Populus alba</i> × <i>P. berolinensis</i> trees (ABJ01) carrying <i>JERF36s</i> gene (a tomato jasmonic/ethylene responsive factors gene) over 4 years, which showed faster growth and significant salt tolerance compared with non-transgenic poplar trees (9#). The expression of <i>NHX1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> genes that encode Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the vacuole and plasma membranes was measured in leaves under NaCl stress. Non-invasive micro-test techniques (NMT) were used to analyse ion flux of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup> in the root tip of seedlings under treatment with100 mM NaCl for 7, 15, and 30 days. Results showed that the expression of <i>NHX1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> was much higher in ABJ01 compared with 9#, and the Na<sup>+</sup> efflux and H<sup>+</sup> influx fluxes of root were remarkable higher in ABJ01 than in 9#, but K<sup>+</sup> efflux exhibited lower level. All above suggest that salt stress induces <i>NHX1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> to a greater expression level in ABJ01, resulting in the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter to better maintain K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> balance in the cytoplasm of this enhanced salt resistant variety. This may help us to better understand the mechanism of transgenic poplars with improving salt tolerance by overexpressing <i>JERF36s</i> and could provide a basis for future breeding programs aimed at improving salt resistance in transgenic poplar.
