CRISPR-Cas is a powerful double-strand-break technology with wide-ranging applications from gene discovery to commercial product development. Thus far, this tool has been almost exclusively used for gene knockouts and deletions, with a few examples of gene edits and targeted gene insertions. Here, we demonstrate the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to mediate targeted 75.5-Mb pericentric inversion in chromosome 2 in one of the elite maize inbred lines from Corteva Agriscience. This inversion unlocks a large chromosomal region containing substantial genetic variance for recombination, thus providing opportunities for the development of new maize varieties with improved phenotypes.
