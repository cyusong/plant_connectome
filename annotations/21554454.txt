Plant genomes are earmarked with defined patterns of chromatin marks. Little is known about the stability of these epigenomes when related, but distinct genomes are brought together by intra-species hybridization. Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and their reciprocal hybrids were used as a model system to investigate the dynamics of histone modification patterns. The genome-wide distribution of histone modifications H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 in the inbred parental accessions Col-0, C24 and Cvi and their hybrid offspring was compared by chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with genome tiling array hybridization. The analysis revealed that, in addition to DNA sequence polymorphisms, chromatin modification variations exist among accessions of A. thaliana. The range of these variations was higher for H3K27me3 (typically a repressive mark) than for H3K4me2 (typically an active mark). H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 were rather stable in response to intra-species hybridization, with mainly additive inheritance in hybrid offspring. In conclusion, intra-species hybridization does not result in gross changes to chromatin modifications.
