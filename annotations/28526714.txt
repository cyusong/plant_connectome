['28526714', 'Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor that binds CCAAT  elements. The NF-Y trimer is composed of a Histone Fold Domain (HFD) dimer  (NF-YB/NF-YC) and NF-YA, which confers DNA sequence specificity. NF-YA shares a  conserved domain with the CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1 (CCT) proteins. We show  that CONSTANS (CO/B-BOX PROTEIN1 BBX1), a master flowering regulator, forms a  trimer with Arabidopsis thaliana NF-YB2/NF-YC3 to efficiently bind the CORE  element of the FLOWERING LOCUS T promoter. We term this complex NF-CO. Using  saturation mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and RNA-sequencing  profiling of co, nf-yb, and nf-yc mutants, we identify CCACA elements as the core  NF-CO binding site. CO physically interacts with the same HFD surface required  for NF-YA association, as determined by mutations in NF-YB2 and NF-YC9, and  tested in vitro and in vivo. The co-7 mutation in the CCT domain, corresponding  to an NF-YA arginine directly involved in CCAAT recognition, abolishes NF-CO  binding to DNA. In summary, a unifying molecular mechanism of CO function relates  it to the NF-YA paradigm, as part of a trimeric complex imparting sequence  specificity to HFD/DNA interactions. It is likely that members of the large CCT  family participate in similar complexes with At-NF-YB and At-NF-YC, broadening  HFD combinatorial possibilities in terms of trimerization, DNA binding  specificities, and transcriptional regulation.', '2017 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00864', 'ORCID:']
