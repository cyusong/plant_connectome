Orchids are members of the Orchidaceae, one of the largest families of flowering plants, and occupy a wide range of ecological habitats with highly specialized reproductive features. They exhibit unique developmental characteristics, such as generation of storage organs during flowering and spectacular floral morphological features, which contribute to their reproductive success in different habitats in response to various environmental cues. Here we review current understanding of the molecular genetic basis of orchid reproductive development, including flowering time control, floral patterning and flower color, with a focus on the orchid genes that have been functionally validated in plants. Furthermore, we summarize recent progress in annotating orchid genomes, and discuss how integration of high-quality orchid genome sequences with other advanced tools, such as the ever-improving multi-omics approaches and genome editing technologies as well as orchid-specific technical platforms, could open up new avenues to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of highly specialized reproductive organs and strategies in orchids.
