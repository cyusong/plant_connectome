['19513806', 'Although abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene have antagonistic functions in the  control of plant growth and development, including seed germination and early  seedling development, it remains unknown whether a convergent point exists  between these two signaling pathways or whether they operate in parallel in  Arabidopsis thaliana. To elucidate this issue, four ethylene mutants, ctr1, ein2,  ein3, and ein6, were crossed with aba2 (also known as gin1-3) to generate double  mutants. Genetic epistasis analysis revealed that all of the resulting double  mutants displayed aba2 mutant phenotypes with a small plant size and wiltiness  when grown in soil or on agar plates. Further ethylene sensitivity or triple  response analyses demonstrated that these double mutants also retained the ctr1  or ein mutant phenotypes, showing ethylene constitutive triple and insensitive  responses, respectively. Our current data therefore demonstrate that ABA and  ethylene act in parallel, at least in primary signal transduction pathways.  Moreover, by microarray analysis we found that an ACC oxidase (ACO) was  significantly upregulated in the aba2 mutant, whereas the 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID  DIOXYGENASE 3 (NCED3) gene in ein2 was upregulated, and both the ABSCISIC ACID  INSENSITIVE1 (ABI1) and cytochrome P450, family 707, subfamily A, polypeptide 2  (CYP707A2) genes in etr1-1 were downregulated. These data further suggest that  ABA and ethylene may control the hormonal biosynthesis, catabolism, or signaling  of each other to enhance their antagonistic effects upon seed germination and  early seedling growth.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-009-9509-7', 'Lin']
