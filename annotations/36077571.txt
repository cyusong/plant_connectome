CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing technology provides straightforward, proficient, and multifunctional ways for the site-directed modification of organism genomes and genes. The application of CRISPR-based technology in plants has a vast potential value in gene function research, germplasm innovation, and genetic improvement. The complexity of woody plants genome may pose significant challenges in the application and expansion of various new editing techniques, such as Cas9, 12, 13, and 14 effectors, base editing, particularly for timberland species with a long life span, huge genome, and ploidy. Therefore, many novel optimisms have been drawn to molecular breeding research based on woody plants. This review summarizes the recent development of CRISPR/Cas applications for essential traits, including wood properties, flowering, biological stress, abiotic stress, growth, and development in woody plants. We outlined the current problems and future development trends of this technology in germplasm and the improvement of products in woody plants.
