Increasing planting density is one of the most effective ways to improve crop yield. However, one major factor that limits crop planting density is the weakened immunity of plants to pathogens and insects caused by dim light (DL) under shade conditions. The molecular mechanism underlying how DL compromises plant immunity remains unclear. Here, we report that DL reduces rice (Oryza sativa) resistance against brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) by elevating ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling in a Phytochrome B (OsPHYB)-dependent manner. The DL-reduced BPH resistance is relieved in osphyB mutants, but aggravated in OsPHYB overexpressing plants. Further, we found that DL reduces the nuclear accumulation of OsphyB, thus alleviating Phytochrome Interacting Factor Like14 (OsPIL14) degradation, consequently leading to the up-regulation of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate Oxidase1 (OsACO1) and an increase in ET levels. In addition, we found that nuclear OsphyB stabilizes Ethylene Insensitive Like2 (OsEIL2) by competitively interacting with EIN3 Binding F-Box Protein (OsEBF1) to enhance ET signaling in rice, which contrasts with previous findings that phyB blocks ET signaling by facilitating Ethylene Insensitive3 (EIN3) degradation in other plant species. Thus, enhanced ET biosynthesis and signaling reduces BPH resistance under DL conditions. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the light-regulated ET pathway and host-insect interactions and potential strategies for sustainable insect management.
