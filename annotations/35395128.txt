Fruit ripening is a complex developmental process, which is modulated by both transcriptional and post-translational events. Control of fruit ripening is important in maintaining moderate quality traits and minimizing postharvest deterioration. In this study, we discovered that the transcription factor MaMYB4 acts as a negative regulator of fruit ripening in banana. The protein levels of MaMYB4 decreased gradually with banana fruit ripening, paralleling ethylene production, and decline in firmness. DNA affinity purification sequencing combined with RNA-sequencing analyses showed that MaMYB4 preferentially binds to the promoters of various ripening-associated genes including ethylene biosynthetic and cell wall modifying genes. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MaMYB4 in tomato delayed tomato fruit ripening, which was accompanied by downregulation of ethylene biosynthetic and cell wall modifying genes. Importantly, two RING finger E3 ligases MaBRG2/3, whose protein accumulation increased progressively with fruit ripening, were found to interact with and ubiquitinate MaMYB4, contributing to decreased accumulation of MaMYB4 during fruit ripening. Transient overexpression of MaMYB4 and MaBRG2/3 in banana fruit ripening delayed or promoted fruit ripening by inhibiting or stimulating ethylene biosynthesis, respectively. Taken together, we demonstrate that MaMYB4 negatively modulates banana fruit ripening, and that MaMYB4 abundance could be regulated by protein ubiquitination, thus providing insights into the role of MaMYB4 in controlling fruit ripening at both transcriptional and post-translational levels.
