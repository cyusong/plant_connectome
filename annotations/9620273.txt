['9620273', 'Recent discoveries of plant retinoblastoma (Rb) protein homologues and D-type  cyclins suggest that control of the onset of cell division in plants may have  stronger parallels with mammalian G1/S controls than with yeasts. In mammals, the  Rb protein interacts specifically with D-type cyclins and regulates cell  proliferation by binding and inhibiting E2F transcription factors. However, the  developmental role of Rb in plants and its potential interaction with cell cycle  regulators is unknown. We show that the maize Rb homologue ZmRb-1 is temporally  and spatially regulated during maize leaf development. ZmRb-1 is highly expressed  in differentiating cells, but almost undetectable in proliferating cells. In  vitro, both ZmRb-1 and human Rb bind all classes of plant D-type cyclins with the  involvement of a conserved N-terminal Leu-x-Cys-x-Glu (LxCxE) Rb-interaction  motif. This binding is strongly reduced by mutation of the conserved Cys-470 of  ZmRb-1. ZmRb-1 binds human and Drosophila E2F, and inhibits transcriptional  activation of human E2F. We also show that ZmRb-1 is a good in vitro substrate  for all human G1/S protein kinases. The functional conservation of proteins that  control the G1/S transition in mammals and plants points to the existence of  plant E2F homologues. We conclude that evolution of Rb and cyclin D proteins  occurred after separation of the fungi from the higher eukaryotic lineage, but  preceded the divergence of plant and animal kingdoms.', '1998 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1005902226256', 'Murray']
