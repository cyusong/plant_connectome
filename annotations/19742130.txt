Land plants are anchored in one place for most of their life cycle and therefore must constantly adapt their growth and metabolism to abiotic stresses such as light intensity, temperature and the availability of water and essential minerals. Thus, plants' subsistence depends on their ability to regulate rapidly gene expression in order to adapt their physiology to their environment. Recent studies indicate that post-transcriptional regulations of gene expression play an important role in how plants respond to abiotic stresses. We will review the different mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of nuclear genes expression including messenger RNA (mRNA) processing, stability, localization and protein translation, and discuss their relative importance for plant adaptation to abiotic stress.
