['9596629', "The Arabidopsis HY5 gene has been defined genetically as a positive regulator of  photomorphogenesis and recently has been shown to encode a basic leucine zipper  type of transcription factor. Here, we report that HY5 is constitutively nuclear  localized and is involved in light regulation of transcriptional activity of the  promoters containing the G-box, a well-characterized light-responsive element  (LRE). In vitro DNA binding studies suggested that HY5 can bind specifically to  the G-box DNA sequences but not to any of the other LREs present in the  light-responsive promoters examined. High-irradiance light activation of two  synthetic promoters containing either the consensus G-box alone or the G-box  combined with the GATA motif (another LRE) and the native Arabidopsis ribulose  bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene RBCS-1A promoter, which has an  essential copy of the G-box, was significantly compromised in the hy5 mutant. The  hy5 mutation's effect on the high-irradiance light activation of gene expression  was observed in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues. Furthermore,  the characteristic phytochrome-mediated red light- and far-red light-reversible  low-fluence induction of the G-box-containing promoters was diminished  specifically in hy5 plants. These results suggest that HY5 may interact directly  with the G-box in the promoters of light-inducible genes to mediate  light-controlled transcriptional activity.", '1998 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.5.673', 'Wei']
