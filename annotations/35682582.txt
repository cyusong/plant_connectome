As a common abiotic stress, drought severely impairs the growth, development, and even survival of plants. Here we report a transcription factor, <i>Caragana korshinskii</i> REVOLUTA(CkREV), which can bidirectionally regulate the expression of the critical enzyme gene <i>CkYUC5</i> in auxin synthesis according to external environment changes, so as to control the biosynthesis of auxin and further enhance the drought resistance of plants. Quantitative analysis reveals that the expression level of both <i>CkYUC5</i> and <i>AtYUC5</i> is down-regulated after <i>C. korshinskii</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> are exposed to drought. Functional verification of CkREV reveals that CkREV up-regulates the expression of <i>AtYUC5</i> in transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> under common conditions, while down-regulating it under drought conditions. Meanwhile, the expression of <i>CkYUC5</i> is also down-regulated in <i>C. korshinskii</i> leaves instantaneously overexpressing CkREV. We apply a dual-luciferase reporter system to discover that CkREV can bind to the promoter of <i>CkYUC5</i> to regulate its expression, which is further proved by EMSA and Y1H esxperiments. Functional verification of CkREV in <i>C. korshinskii</i> and transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> shows that CkREV can regulate the expression of <i>CkYUC5</i> and <i>AtYUC5</i> in a contrary way, maintaining the equilibrium of plants between growth and drought resisting. CkREV can positively regulate the expression of <i>CkYUC5</i> to promote auxin synthesis in favor of growth under normal development. However, CkREV can also respond to external signals and negatively regulate the expression of <i>CkYUC5</i>, which inhibits auxin synthesis in order to reduce growth rate, lower water demands, and eventually improve the drought resistance of plants.
