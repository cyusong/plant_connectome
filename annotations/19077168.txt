['19077168', "Light is one of the most important environmental factors that regulate plant  development. Here we report that a mutation in the Arabidopsis FIERY1 gene (FRY1)  caused a shortened hypocotyl and shorter petioles, most dramatically under  low-intensity red light and less pronounced under far-red and blue-light  conditions. Furthermore, the fry1 mutant flowered late, probably due to a reduced  level of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcript. However, although the transcript  level of FRY1 was light-regulated, the chlorophyll level and the expression of  typical light-regulated genes were not affected in the fry1 mutant. FRY1 is known  as a regulator of abiotic stress responses, and its protein product has dual  enzymatic activity comprising inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase and  3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase activity. Genetic complementation data  obtained using cDNA of the FRY1 paralog AHL (Arabidopsis HAL2-like) and the  similar phenotype of an xrn2/xrn3 double mutant suggest that FRY1 attenuates  light responses via its 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase activity rather than  its inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase activity. We discuss the relationship  between the FRY1-associated nucleotidase activity, a step in the pathway for  sulfur metabolism and utilization, and the Arabidopsis light response.", '2009 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03770.x', 'von']
