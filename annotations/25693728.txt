['25693728', 'In flowering plants, the male and female gametogenesis is a crucial step of  sexual reproduction. Although many genes have been identified as being involved  in the gametogenesis process, the genetic mechanisms underlying gametogenesis  remains poorly understood. We reported here characterization of the gene, ABORTED  GAMETOPHYTE 1 (AOG1) that is newly identified as essential for gametogenesis in  Arabidopsis thaliana. AOG1 is expressed predominantly in reproductive tissues  including the developing pollen grains and ovules. The AOG1 protein shares no  significant amino acid sequence similarity with other documented proteins and is  located mainly in nuclei of the cells. Mutation in AOG1 caused degeneration of  pollen at the uninucleate microspore stage and severe defect in embryo sacs,  leading to a significant reduction in male and female fertility. Furthermore, the  molecular analyses showed that the aog1 mutant significantly affected the  expression of several genes, which are required for gametogenesis. Our results  suggest that AOG1 plays important roles in gametogenesis at the stage prior to  pollen mitosis I (PMI) in Arabidopsis, possibly through collaboration with other  genes.', '2015 Dec', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12341', 'Zhang']
