Normal organ size is achieved by successful co-ordination of cell proliferation and cell expansion, which are modulated by multiple factors such as ethylene and auxin. In our work, SlMBP21-RNAi (RNA interference) tomato exhibited longer sepals and improved fruit set. Histological analysis indicated that longer sepals were attributed to cell expansion. To explore how SlMBP21 regulates sepal size, we compared the transcriptomes of sepals between SlMBP21-RNAi and the wild type by RNA sequencing and found that the differentially expressed genes were dominantly related to cell expansion, ethylene and auxin, and photosynthesis. Down-regulation of SlMBP21 affected ethylene production and the free IAA and IAA-Val intensity in sepals. Hormone treatment further indicated that SlMBP21 was involved in the ethylene and auxin pathways. As reported, ethylene and auxin were important factors for cell expansion. Hence, SlMBP21 negatively regulated cell expansion to control sepal size, and ethylene and auxin may mediate this process. Additionally, the contents of Chl and the activity of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, the key photosynthetic enzyme, were both increased in SlMBP21-RNAi sepals, which indicated that photosynthesis might be enhanced in transgenic longer sepals. Therefore, the longer sepal, with better protection and enhanced photosynthesis, may contribute to improve fruit set. Altogether, these results suggested that SlMBP21 was a novel factor involved in organ size control. Moreover, our study provided potential application value for improving fruit set.
