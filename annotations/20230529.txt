['20230529', 'Inositols are indispensable components of cellular signaling molecules, and  impaired cytoplasmic inositol concentrations affect cellular development.  Although most cells can synthesize inositol de novo, plasma membrane-localized  inositol uptake systems are indispensable for normal development. Here, we  present in-depth functional analyses of plasma membrane-localized H(+)-inositol  symporters from human and from the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence  comparisons, structural and phylogenetic analyses revealed that these  transporters possess conserved extracellular loop domains that represent homologs  of plexins/semaphorin/integrin (PSI) domains from animal type I receptors. In  these receptors, PSI domains modulate intracellular signaling via extracellular  protein-protein interactions. Comparisons of H(+)-inositol symporters with wild  type, mutated and truncated PSI domains in different expression systems showed  that removal of the entire loop domain increased the V(max) of inositol uptake.  Finally, we show that the PSI domains are targets for Ni(++) ions that cause a  complete loss of transport activity. A possible role of Ni(++)-binding to PSI  domains in Ni(++)-induced carcinogenicity is discussed.', '2010 Jun', 'Traffic', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01057.x', 'Sauer']
