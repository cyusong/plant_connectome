In this study, we applied an inductively coupled, radio frequency oxygen plasma to maize seeds and investigated its effects on seedling emergence, plant number at tasseling, and crop yield of maize in realistic field conditions. Maize seeds of seven different hybrids were treated over two harvest years. In addition to plasma-treated seeds, a control sample, fungicide-treated seeds, an eco-layer, and a plasma and eco-layer combination, were planted. Seedling emergence, plant number at tasseling (plants/m<sup>2</sup>), and yield (kg/ha), were recorded. In the first harvest year, results were negatively affected by the presence of an insect pest. In the second harvest year, plant number and yield results were more uniform. In both years, for two and three hybrids, respectively, the highest yield arose from plants from plasma-treated seeds, but the differences were only partially significant. Considering our results, plasma treatment of maize seeds appears to have a positive effect on the yield of the plant.
