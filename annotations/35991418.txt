The wild <i>Cicer</i> species is well-known for having climate-resilient and productivity-enhancing traits of interest. Therefore, wide hybridization could be used as a realistic strategy for introgressing prospective traits from wild species into the cultivated gene pool. The present study was, thus, undertaken to evaluate F<sub>7</sub> chickpea interspecific derivatives derived from <i>Cicer reticulatum</i> Ladiz. and <i>C. echinospermum</i> P. H. Davis wild annual <i>Cicer</i> species. As a result, a set of six interspecific crosses were advanced using the single seed descent (SSD) method of breeding. The F<sub>7</sub> generation of these crosses was assessed in two diverse agro-ecological regions of India. The data revealed a wide range of variation with respect to seed yield and its important component traits, which resulted in the identification of the most promising derivatives carrying desirable characters as indicated by range, mean, and coefficient of variation. Further, fruitful heterosis was also estimated as promising selection criteria for identifying superior lines for earliness and high seed yield, including resistance against prevailing stresses (ascochyta blight, botrytis gray mold, dry root rot, and fusarium wilt). The superior derivatives carrying putative characters could be recommended for further breeding and selection of genetic materials for developing suitable genotypes.
