Flower color is a main target for flower breeding. A transgenic approach for flower color modification requires a transgene and a flower-specific promoter. Here, we expressed the <i>B-peru</i> gene encoding a basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF) together with the <i>mPAP1</i> gene encoding an R2R3 MYB TF to enhance flower color in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.), using the tobacco <i>anthocyanidin synthase</i> (<i>ANS</i>) promoter (PANS) to drive flower-specific expression. The transgenic tobacco plants grew normally and produced either dark pink (PANSBP_DP) or dark red (PANSBP_DR) flowers. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that the expression of five structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway increased significantly in both PANSBP_DP and PANSBP_DR lines, compared with the non-transformed (NT) control. Interestingly, the expression of two regulatory genes constituting the active MYB-bHLH-WD40 repeat (WDR) (MBW) complex decreased significantly in the PANSBP_DR plants but not in the PANSBP_DP plants. Total flavonol and anthocyanin abundance correlated with flower color, with an increase of 1.6-43.2 fold in the PANSBP_DP plants and 2.0-124.2 fold in the PANSBP_DR plants. Our results indicate that combinatorial expression of <i>B-peru</i> and <i>mPAP1</i> genes under control of the <i>ANS</i> promoter can be a useful strategy for intensifying flower color without growth retardation<b>.</b>
