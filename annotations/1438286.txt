['1438286', 'Glutamyl-tRNA reductase, encoded by the hemA gene, is the first enzyme in  porphyrin biosynthesis in many organisms. Hemes, important porphyrin derivatives,  are essential components of redox enzymes, such as cytochromes. Thus a hemA  Escherichia coli strain (SASX41B) is deficient in cytochrome-mediated aerobic  respiration. Upon complementation of this strain with an Arabidopsis thaliana  cDNA library, we isolated a clone which permitted the SASX41B strain to grow  aerobically. The clone encodes the gene for Arabidopsis alternative oxidase,  whose deduced amino acid sequence was found to have 71% identity with that of the  enzyme from the voodoo lily, Sauromatum guttatum. The Arabidopsis protein is  expressed as a 31-kDa protein in E. coli and confers on this organism  cyanide-resistant growth, which in turn is sensitive to salicylhydroxamate. This  implies that a single polypeptide is sufficient for alternative oxidase activity.  Based on these observations we propose that a cyanide-insensitive respiratory  pathway operates in the transformed E. coli hemA strain. Introduction of this  pathway now opens the way to genetic/molecular biological investigations of  alternative oxidase and its cofactor.', '1992 Nov 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.89.22.10842', 'Soll']
