This review contains functional roles of MYB transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in horticultural plants. This review describes potential uses of MYB TFs as tools for metabolic engineering for anthocyanin production. Anthocyanins (ranging from red to blue) are controlled by specific branches of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and are mostly visible in ornamentals, fruits, and vegetables. In the present review, we describe which R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) control the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin structural genes involved in the specific branches of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in various horticultural plants (e.g., ornamentals, fruits, and vegetables). In addition, some MYBs responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in specific tissues are described. Moreover, we highlight the phylogenetic relationships of the MYBs that suppress or promote anthocyanin synthesis in horticultural crops. Enhancement of anthocyanin synthesis via metabolic genetic engineering of anthocyanin MYBs, which is described in the review, is indicative of the potential use of the mentioned anthocyanin-related MYBs as tools for anthocyanin production. Therefore, the MYBs would be suitable for metabolic genetic engineering for improvement of flower colors, fruit quality, and vegetable nutrients.
