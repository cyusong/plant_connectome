['16543243', 'Embryonic factor 1 (FAC1) is one of the earliest expressed plant genes and  encodes an AMP deaminase (AMPD), which is also an identified herbicide target.  This report identifies an N-terminal transmembrane domain in Arabidopsis FAC1,  explores subcellular fractionation, and presents a 3.3-A globular catalytic  domain x-ray crystal structure with a bound herbicide-based transition state  inhibitor that provides the first glimpse of a complete AMPD active site. FAC1  contains an (alpha/beta)(8)-barrel characterized by loops in place of strands 5  and 6 that places it in a small subset of the amidohydrolase superfamily with  imperfect folds. Unlike tetrameric animal orthologs, FAC1 is a dimer and each  subunit contains an exposed Walker A motif that may be involved in the dramatic  combined K(m) (25-80-fold lower) and V(max) (5-6-fold higher) activation by ATP.  Normal mode analysis predicts a hinge motion that flattens basic surfaces on each  monomer that flank the dimer interface, which suggests a reversible association  between the FAC1 globular catalytic domain and intracellular membranes, with  N-terminal transmembrane and disordered linker regions serving as the anchor and  attachment to the globular catalytic domain, respectively.', '2006 May 26', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M513009200', 'Phillips']
