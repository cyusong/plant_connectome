Glutaredoxins (GRXs) belong to the antioxidant and signalling network involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. In spite of the high number of GRX genes in plant genomes, the biological functions and physiological roles of most of them remain unknown. Here the functional characterization of the Arabidopsis GRXS13 gene (At1g03850), that codes for two CC-type GRX isoforms, is reported. The transcript variant coding for the GRXS13.2 isoform is predominantly expressed under basal conditions and is the isoform that is induced by photooxidative stress. Transgenic lines where the GRXS13 gene has been knocked down show increased basal levels of superoxide radicals and reduced plant growth. These lines also display reduced tolerance to methyl viologen (MeV) and high light (HL) treatments, both conditions of photooxidative stress characterized by increased production of superoxide ions. Consistently, lines overexpressing the GRXS13.2 variant show reduced MeV- and HL-induced damage. Alterations in GRXS13 expression also affect superoxide levels and the ascorbate/dehydroascorbate ratio after HL-induced stress. These results indicate that GRXS13 gene expression is critical for limiting basal and photooxidative stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Together, these results place GRXS13.2 as a member of the ROS-scavenging/antioxidant network that shows a particularly low functional redundancy in the Arabidopsis GRX family.
