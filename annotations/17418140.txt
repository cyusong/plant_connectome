Soluble aluminium (Al(3+)) is the major constraint to plant growth on acid soils. Plants have evolved mechanisms to tolerate Al(3+) and one type of mechanism relies on the efflux of organic anions that protect roots by chelating the Al(3+). Al(3+) resistance genes of several species have now been isolated and found to encode membrane proteins that facilitate organic anion efflux from roots. These proteins belong to the Al(3+)-activated malate transporter (ALMT) and multi-drug and toxin extrusion (MATE) families. We review the roles of these proteins in Al(3+) resistance as well as their roles in other aspects of mineral nutrition.
