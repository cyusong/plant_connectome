Plants can produce and emit nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, and several field-based studies have concluded that this gas is emitted at substantial amounts. However, the exact mechanisms of N<sub>2</sub>O production in plant cells are unknown. Several studies have hypothesised that plants might act as a medium to transport N<sub>2</sub>O produced by soil-inhabiting microorganisms. Contrarily, aseptically grown plants and axenic algal cells supplied with nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) are reported to emit N<sub>2</sub>O, indicating that it is produced inside plant cells by some unknown physiological phenomena. In this study, the possible sites, mechanisms, and enzymes involved in N<sub>2</sub>O production in plant cells are discussed. Based on the experimental evidence from various studies, we determined that N<sub>2</sub>O can be produced from nitric oxide (NO) in the mitochondria of plants. NO, a signaling molecule, is produced through oxidative and reductive pathways in eukaryotic cells. During hypoxia and anoxia, NO<sub>3</sub> in the cytosol is metabolised to produce nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>), which is reduced to form NO <i>via</i> the reductive pathway in the mitochondria. Under low oxygen condition, NO formed in the mitochondria is further reduced to N<sub>2</sub>O by the reduced form of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). This pathway is active only when cells experience hypoxia or anoxia, and it may be involved in N<sub>2</sub>O formation in plants and soil-dwelling animals, as reported previously by several studies. NO can be toxic at a high concentration. Therefore, the reduction of NO to N<sub>2</sub>O in the mitochondria might protect the integrity of the mitochondria, and thus, protect the cell from the toxicity of NO accumulation under hypoxia and anoxia. As NO<sub>3</sub> is a major source of nitrogen for plants and all plants may experience hypoxic and anoxic conditions owing to soil environmental factors, a significant global biogenic source of N<sub>2</sub>O may be its formation in plants <i>via</i> the proposed pathway.
