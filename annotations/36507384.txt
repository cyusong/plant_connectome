Bacterial blight (BB) induced by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> (Xoo) is a devastating bacterial disease in rice. The use of disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes is the most efficient method to control BB. Members of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing protein (NLR) family have significant roles in plant defense. In this study, <i>Xa47</i>, a new bacterial blight <i>R</i> gene encoding a typical NLR, was isolated from G252 rice material, and XA47 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Among 180 rice materials tested, <i>Xa47</i> was discovered in certain BB-resistant materials. Compared with the wild-type G252, the knockout mutants of <i>Xa47</i> was more susceptible to Xoo. By contrast, overexpression of <i>Xa47</i> in the susceptible rice material JG30 increased BB resistance. The findings indicate that <i>Xa47</i> positively regulates the Xoo stress response. Consequently, <i>Xa47</i> may have application potential in the genetic improvement of plant disease resistance. The molecular mechanism of <i>Xa47</i> regulation merits additional examination.
