Phytohormone ABA plays vital roles in stress tolerance, while long-term overactivation of ABA signaling suppresses plant growth and development. However, the braking mechanism of ABA responses is not clear. Protein tyrosine sulfation catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) is a critical post-translational modification. Through genetic screening, we identified a tpst mutant in Arabidopsis that was hypersensitive to ABA. In-depth analysis revealed that TPST could interact with and sulfate SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6, which accelerated their degradation and weakened the ABA signaling. Taken together, these findings uncovered a novel mechanism of desensitizing ABA responses via protein sulfation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
