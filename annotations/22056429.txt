['22056429', 'We identified a gene product of At5g19500 (At5g19500p) from Arabidopsis thaliana  that is homologous to EcTyrP, a tyrosine-specific transporter from Escherichia  coli. Computational analyses of the amino acid sequence of At5g19500p predicted  11 transmembrane domains (TMDs) and a potential plastid targeting signal at its  amino terminus. As a first step toward understanding the possible role of  At5g19500p in plant cells, we attempted to determine the localization of  At5g19500p by an in vitro chloroplastic import assay using At5g19500p translated  in a cell-free wheat germ system (Madin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97,  559-564 (2000)), followed by subfractionation of the chloroplasts. At5g19500p was  successfully imported into chloroplasts, and the newly transported mature form of  At5g19500p was recovered from the inner envelope membrane.', '2011', 'Biosci Biotechnol Biochem', '10.1271/bbb.110489', 'Akita']
