The soil-borne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum invades a broad range of plants through their roots, resulting in wilting of the plant, but no effective protection against this disease has been developed. Two bacterial wilt disease-inhibiting compounds were biochemically isolated from tobacco and identified as sclareol and cis-abienol, labdane-type diterpenes. When exogenously applied to their roots, sclareol and cis-abienol inhibited wilt disease in tobacco, tomato and Arabidopsis plants without exhibiting any antibacterial activity. Microarray analysis identified many sclareol-responsive genes in Arabidopsis roots, including genes encoding or with a role in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and biosynthesis and signaling of defense-related molecules and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade components. Inhibition of wilt disease by sclareol was attenuated in Arabidopsis mutants defective in the ABC transporter AtPDR12, the MAPK MPK3, and ethylene and abscisic acid signaling pathways, and also in transgenic tobacco plants with reduced expression of NtPDR1, a tobacco homolog of AtPDR12. These results suggest that multiple host factors are involved in the inhibition of bacterial wilt disease by sclareol-related compounds.
