['19309455', 'Discovery of the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) repressors defined the core jasmonate  (JA) signalling module as COI1-JAZ-MYC2, and allowed a full view of the JA  signalling pathway from hormone perception to transcriptional reprogramming. JAZ  proteins are repressors of MYC2 and targets of SCF(COI1), which is the likely  jasmonate receptor. Upon hormone perception, JAZ repressors are degraded by the  proteasome releasing MYC2 and allowing the activation of JA responses. All  members of the JAZ family share two conserved domains, the Jas motif, required  for JAZ interactions with MYC2 and COI1, and the ZIM domain, the function of  which is so far unknown. Here, we show that the ZIM domain acts as a  protein-protein interaction domain mediating homo- and heteromeric interactions  between JAZ proteins. These JAZ-JAZ interactions are independent of the presence  of the hormone. The observation that only a few members of the JAZ family form  homo- and heteromers may suggest the relevance of these proteins in the  regulation of JA signalling. Interestingly, the JAZ3DeltaJas protein interacts  with several JAZ proteins, providing new clues to understanding the dominant JA  insensitivity promoted by truncated JAZDeltaJas proteins. We also provide  evidence that the Jas motif mediates the hormone-dependent interaction between  Arabidopsis JAZ3 and COI1, and further confirm that the Jas motif is required and  sufficient for Arabidopsis JAZ3-MYC2 interaction. Finally, we show that  interaction with MYC2 is a common feature of the JAZ family, as most JAZ proteins  can bind MYC2 in pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays.', '2009 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03852.x', 'Solano']
