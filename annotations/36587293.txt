['36587293', "Folate (vitamin B9) is important for plant root development, but the mechanism is  largely unknown. Here we characterized a root defective mutant, folb2, in  Arabidopsis, which has severe developmental defects in the primary root. The root  apical meristem of the folb2 mutant is impaired, and adventitious roots are  frequently found at the root-hypocotyl junction. Positional cloning revealed that  a 61-bp deletion is present in the predicted junction region of the promoter and  the 5' untranslated region of AtFolB2, a gene encoding a dihydroneopterin  aldolase that functions in folate biosynthesis. This mutation leads to a  significant reduction in the transcript level of AtFolB2. Liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the contents of the  selected folate compounds were decreased in folb2. Arabidopsis AtFolB2 knockdown  lines phenocopy the folb2 mutant. On the other hand, the application of exogenous  5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid could rescue the root phenotype of folb2, indicating  that the root phenotype is indeed related to the folate level. Further analysis  revealed that folate could promote rootward auxin transport through auxin  transporters and that folate may affect particular auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  proteins and auxin response factors. Our findings provide new insights into the  important role of folic acid in shaping root structure.", '2023 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.16093', 'ORCID:']
