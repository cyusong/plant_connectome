['20631708', 'Multiple pathways prevent DNA replication from occurring more than once per cell  cycle. These pathways block re-replication by strictly controlling the activity  of pre-replication complexes, which assemble at specific sites in the genome  called origins. Here we show that mutations in the homologous histone 3 lysine 27  (H3K27) monomethyltransferases, ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN5 (ATXR5)  and ATXR6, lead to re-replication of specific genomic locations. Most of these  locations correspond to transposons and other repetitive and silent elements of  the Arabidopsis genome. These sites also correspond to high levels of H3K27  monomethylation, and mutation of the catalytic SET domain is sufficient to cause  the re-replication defect. Mutation of ATXR5 and ATXR6 also causes upregulation  of transposon expression and has pleiotropic effects on plant development. These  results uncover a novel pathway that prevents over-replication of heterochromatin  in Arabidopsis.', '2010 Aug 19', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature09290', 'Jacobsen']
