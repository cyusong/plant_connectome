Grain length (GL) directly affects the yield and quality of rice. Very few cloned GL-related genes are applied in production because their yield-increasing effects are not obvious, and the overall regulatory networks underlying the associated processes remain poorly understood. DNA samples from two bulk DNA pools (L-pool and S-pool) and their parents (KJ01 and Huaye 3) were subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Using bulked segregant analysis (BSA), <i>qGL3.5</i> was mapped to a 0.34-Mb "hotspot" region on chromosome 3 that contains 37 genes related to various traits. Then, <i>qGL3.5</i> was mapped to the genomic interval between the flanking markers M2 and M3 using 2786 BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>2</sub> individuals. Because the region from B5 to B6 was not the associated region under BSA-seq analysis, <i>qGL3.5</i> was narrowed down to the interval between B6 and M3, which spanned 24.0-kb. Of all 37 genes with non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between KJ01 and Huaye 3 based on BSA-seq analysis, only one complete annotated gene, <i>ORF18</i> (Gene ID: <i>LOC_Os03g42790.1</i>) was found. <i>ORF18</i> encodes an IBR-RING zinc-finger-related protein, with one really interesting new gene (RING) and two in between ring finger (IBR) domains. The knockout of <i>ORF18</i> derived from Huaye 3 using clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) editing technology increased the GL of the mutant by approximately 2.2 mm. The novel locus <i>qGL3.5</i> negatively regulated GL by promoting elongation of the longitudinal cell of the grain outer glume. These results provide a new genetic resource for rice grain shape breeding and a starting point for the functional characterization of the wild rice GL gene.
