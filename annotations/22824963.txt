In developing grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) berries, precursor volatile organic compounds (PVOCs) are largely stored as glycosides which may be hydrolyzed to release VOCs during fruit ripening, wine making, or aging. VOCs can be further transformed by yeast metabolism. Together, these processes contribute to complexity of wine aromas. Floral and citrus odors of many white wine varietals are attributed to monoterpenes and monoterpene alcohols, while phenolic compounds, norisoprenoids, and other volatiles also play important roles in determining aroma. We present an analysis of PVOCs stored as glycosides in developing Gewürztraminer berries during the growing season. We optimized a method for PVOC analysis suitable for small amounts of Muscat grapevine berries and showed that the amount of PVOCs dramatically increased during and after véraison. Transcript profiling of the same berry samples underscored the involvement of terpenoid pathway genes in the accumulation of PVOCs. The onset of monoterpenol PVOC accumulation in developing grapes was correlated with an increase of transcript abundances of early terpenoid pathway enzymes. Transcripts encoding the methylerythritol phosphate pathway gene 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase, as well as geraniol diphosphate synthase, were up-regulated preceding and during the increase in monoterpenol PVOCs. Transcripts for linalool/nerolidol synthase increased in later véraison stages.
