['26240315', 'Limited knowledge of how plants regulate their growth and metabolism in response  to drought and reduced soil water potential has impeded efforts to improve stress  tolerance. Increased expression of the membrane-associated protein At14a-like1  (AFL1) led to increased growth and accumulation of the osmoprotective solute  proline without negative effects on unstressed plants. Conversely, inducible  RNA-interference suppression of AFL1 decreased growth and proline accumulation  during low water potential while having no effect on unstressed plants. AFL1  overexpression lines had reduced expression of many stress-responsive genes,  suggesting AFL1 may promote growth in part by suppression of negative regulatory  genes. AFL1 interacted with the endomembrane proteins protein disulfide isomerase  5 (PDI5) and NAI2, with the PDI5 interaction being particularly increased by  stress. PDI5 and NAI2 are negative regulatory factors, as pdi5, nai2, and  pdi5-2nai2-3 mutants had increased growth and proline accumulation at low water  potential. AFL1 also interacted with Adaptor protein2-2A (AP2-2A), which is part  of a complex that recruits cargo proteins and promotes assembly of  clathrin-coated vesicles. AFL1 colocalization with clathrin light chain along the  plasma membrane, together with predictions of AFL1 structure, were consistent  with a role in vesicle formation or trafficking. Fractionation experiments  indicated that AFL1 is a peripheral membrane protein associated with both plasma  membrane and endomembranes. These data identify classes of proteins (AFL1, PDI5,  and NAI2) not previously known to be involved in drought signaling.  AFL1-predicted structure, protein interactions, and localization all indicate its  involvement in previously uncharacterized membrane-associated drought sensing or  signaling mechanisms.', '2015 Aug 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1510140112', 'Verslues']
