Microscopy has served as a fundamental tool for insight and discovery in plant-microbe interactions for centuries. From classical light and electron microscopy to corresponding specialized methods for sample preparation and cellular contrasting agents, these approaches have become routine components in the toolkit of plant and microbiology scientists alike to visualize, probe and understand the nature of host-microbe relationships. Over the last three decades, three-dimensional perspectives led by the development of electron tomography, and especially, confocal techniques continue to provide remarkable clarity and spatial detail of tissue and cellular phenomena. Confocal and electron microscopy provide novel revelations that are now commonplace in medium and large institutions. However, many other cutting-edge technologies and sample preparation workflows are relatively unexploited yet offer tremendous potential for unprecedented advancement in our understanding of the inner workings of pathogenic, beneficial, and symbiotic plant-microbe interactions. Here, we highlight key applications, benefits, and challenges of contemporary advanced imaging platforms for plant-microbe systems with special emphasis on several recently developed approaches, such as light-sheet, single molecule, super-resolution, and adaptive optics microscopy, as well as ambient and cryo-volume electron microscopy, X-ray microscopy, and cryo-electron tomography. Furthermore, the potential for complementary sample preparation methodologies, such as optical clearing, expansion microscopy, and multiplex imaging, will be reviewed. Our ultimate goal is to stimulate awareness of these powerful cutting-edge technologies and facilitate their appropriate application and adoption to solve important and unresolved biological questions in the field.
