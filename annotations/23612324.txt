Phosphorus, acquired in the form of phosphate (Pi), is one of the primary macronutrients for plants but is least available in the soil. Pi deficiency is a major factor limiting plant growth, development and reproduction. Plants have developed a complex signaling network to respond to Pi deficiency. The recent discovery of strigolactones, a new class of plant hormones, has led to an emerging signaling module illustrating the integrated control of Pi acquisition, plant-microbe symbiotic interactions and plant architecture. This review article focuses on the recent findings of plant responses and roles of strigolactones to Pi deficiency.
