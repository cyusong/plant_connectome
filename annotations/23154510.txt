Cell-division-cycle protein 48 (CDC48) is an essential, conserved ATP-driven chaperone in eukaryotic cells, which functions in diverse cellular processes including the targeting of misfolded and aggregated proteins for degradation via proteasomal and aggresomal-autophagic pathways. We recently demonstrated that plant CDC48 localizes to and interacts with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) movement protein (MP) in ER-associated viral protein inclusions. Our data suggest that CDC48 participates in the clearance of these viral protein inclusions in an ER-assisted protein degradation (ERAD)-like mechanism. As TMV MP-inclusions formed at late infection stages resemble aggresomes, we here propose that TMV MP enters both, ERAD-like and aggresomal pathways in its host cells and that CDC48 coordinates these processes. Moreover, as viruses often exploit host pathways for replication and spread, we propose a model in which CDC48 functions in the degradation pathway of overaccumulating viral protein and also actively participates in the regulation of TMV replication and cell-to-cell movement.
