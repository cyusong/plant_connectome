['9927639', 'Lesions in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic genes result in characteristic dwarf  phenotypes in plants. Understanding the regulation of BR biosynthesis demands  continued isolation and characterization of mutants corresponding to the genes  involved in BR biosynthesis. Here, we present analysis of a novel BR biosynthetic  locus, dwarf7 (dwf7). Feeding studies with BR biosynthetic intermediates and  analysis of endogenous levels of BR and sterol biosynthetic intermediates  indicate that the defective step in dwf7-1 resides before the production of  24-methylenecholesterol in the sterol biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, results  from feeding studies with 13C-labeled mevalonic acid and compactin show that the  defective step is specifically the Delta7 sterol C-5 desaturation, suggesting  that dwf7 is an allele of the previously cloned STEROL1 (STE1) gene. Sequencing  of the STE1 locus in two dwf7 mutants revealed premature stop codons in the first  (dwf7-2) and the third (dwf7-1) exons. Thus, the reduction of BRs in dwf7 is due  to a shortage of substrate sterols and is the direct cause of the dwarf phenotype  in dwf7.', '1999 Feb', 'Plant Cell', None, 'Feldmann']
