Ran is a multifunctional small GTPase that is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle assembly, and nuclear envelope reformation. Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) facilitates nuclear import of Ran. It binds FxFG repeat-containing domains of the nucleoporins Nup62 (vertebrate) and Nsp1p (yeast). Here, we have identified Arabidopsis Nup62 through its sequence similarity to mammalian Nup62 and yeast Nsp1p. A GFP¬AtNup62 fusion protein is associated with the nuclear envelope in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and interacts in planta with AtNTF2a, one of the two Arabidopsis NTF2 homologs. Overexpression-based co-suppression of AtNup62 leads to severely dwarfed, early-flowering plants, suggesting an important function for Nup62 in plants.
