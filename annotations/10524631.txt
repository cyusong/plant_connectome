['10524631', 'Because plants are sessile, they have developed intricate strategies to adapt to  changing environmental variables, including light. Their growth and development,  from germination to flowering, is critically influenced by light, particularly at  red (660 nm) and far-red (730 nm) wavelengths. Higher plants perceive red and  far-red light by means of specific light sensors called phytochromes(A-E).  However, very little is known about how light signals are transduced to elicit  responses in plants. Here we report that nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 (NDPK2)  is an upstream component in the phytochrome signalling pathway in the plant  Arabidopsis thaliana. In animal and human cells, NDPK acts as a tumour  suppressor. We show that recombinant NDPK2 in Arabidopsis preferentially binds to  the red-light-activated form of phytochrome in vitro and that this interaction  increases the activity of recombinant NDPK2. Furthermore, a mutant lacking NDPK2  showed a partial defect in responses to both red and farred light, including  cotyledon opening and greening. These results indicate that NDPK2 is a positive  signalling component of the phytochrome-mediated light-signal-transduction  pathway in Arabidopsis.', '1999 Oct 7', 'Nature', '10.1038/44176', 'Song']
