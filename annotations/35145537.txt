Plant biologists have debated the evolutionary origin of the apple tribe (Maleae; Rosaceae) for over a century. The "wide-hybridization hypothesis" posits that the pome-bearing members of Maleae (base chromosome number <i>x</i> = 17) resulted from a hybridization and/or allopolyploid event between progenitors of other tribes in the subfamily Amygdaloideae with <i>x</i> = 8 and <i>x</i> = 9, respectively. An alternative "spiraeoid hypothesis" proposed that the <i>x</i> = 17 of Maleae arose via the genome doubling of <i>x</i> = 9 ancestors to <i>x</i> = 18, and subsequent aneuploidy resulting in <i>x</i> = 17. We use publicly available genomic data-448 nuclear genes and complete plastomes-from 27 species representing all major tribes within the Amygdaloideae to investigate evolutionary relationships within the subfamily containing the apple tribe. Specifically, we use network analyses and multi-labeled trees to test the competing wide-hybridization and spiraeoid hypotheses. Hybridization occurred between an ancestor of the tribe Spiraeeae (<i>x</i> = 9) and an ancestor of the clade Sorbarieae (<i>x</i> = 9) + Exochordeae (<i>x</i> = 8) + Kerrieae (<i>x</i> = 9), giving rise to the clade Gillenieae (<i>x</i> = 9) + Maleae (<i>x</i> = 17). The ancestor of the Maleae + Gillenieae arose via hybridization between distantly related tribes in the Amygdaloideae (i.e., supporting the wide hybridization hypothesis). However, some evidence supports an aspect of the spiraeoid hypothesis-the ancestors involved in the hybridization event were likely both <i>x</i> = 9, so genome doubling was followed by aneuploidy to result in <i>x</i> = 17 observed in Maleae. By synthesizing existing genomic data with novel analyses, we resolve the nearly century-old mystery regarding the origin of the apple tribe. Our results also indicate that nuclear gene tree-species tree conflict and/or cytonuclear conflict are pervasive at several other nodes in subfamily Amygdaloideae of Rosaceae.
