['12815435', "The transition to flowering in plants is regulated by environmental factors such  as temperature and light. Plants grown under dense canopies or at high density  perceive a decrease in the ratio of red to far-red incoming light. This change in  light quality serves as a warning of competition, triggering a series of  responses known collectively as the 'shade-avoidance syndrome'. During shade  avoidance, stems elongate at the expense of leaf expansion, and flowering is  accelerated. Of the five phytochromes-a family of red/far-red light  photoreceptors-in Arabidopsis, phytochrome B (phyB) has the most significant role  in shade-avoidance responses, but the mechanisms by which phyB regulates  flowering in response to altered ratios of red to far-red light are largely  unknown. Here we identify PFT1 (PHYTOCHROME AND FLOWERING TIME 1), a nuclear  protein that acts in a phyB pathway and induces flowering in response to  suboptimal light conditions. PFT1 functions downstream of phyB to regulate the  expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), providing evidence for the existence of a  light-quality pathway that regulates flowering time in plants.", '2003 Jun 19', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature01636', 'Chory']
