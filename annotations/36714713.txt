Owing to iron chlorosis, pear trees are some of the most severely impacted by iron deficiency, and they suffer significant losses every year. While it is possible to determine the iron content of leaves using laboratory-standard analytical techniques, the sampling and analysis process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and it does not quickly and accurately identify the physiological state of iron-deficient leaves. Therefore, it is crucial to find a precise and quick visualization approach for metabolites linked to leaf iron to comprehend the mechanism of iron deficiency and create management strategies for pear-tree planting. In this paper, we propose a micro-Raman spectral imaging method for non-destructive, rapid, and precise visual characterization of iron-deficiency-related metabolites in pear leaves. According to our findings, iron deficiency significantly decreased the Raman peak intensities of chlorophylls and lipids in leaves. The spatial distributions of chlorophylls and lipids in the leaves changed significantly as the symptoms of iron insufficiency worsened. The technique offers a new, prospective tool for rapid recognition of iron deficiency in pear trees because it is capable of visual detection of plant physiological metabolites induced by iron deficiency.
