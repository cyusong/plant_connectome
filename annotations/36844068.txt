Mangrove forests inhabit tropical or subtropical intertidal zones and have remarkable abilities in coastline protection. <i>Kandelia obovata</i> is considered the most cold-tolerant mangrove species and has been widely transplanted to the north subtropical zone of China for ecological restoration. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms of <i>K. obovata</i> under colder climate was still unclear. Here, we manipulated the typical climate of cold waves in the north subtropical zone with cycles of cold/recovery and analyzed the physiological and transcriptomic responses of seedlings. We found that both physiological traits and gene expression profiles differed between the first and later cold waves, indicating <i>K. obovata</i> seedlings were acclimated by the first cold experience and prepared for latter cold waves. 1,135 cold acclimation-related genes (CARGs) were revealed, related to calcium signaling, cell wall modification, and post-translational modifications of ubiquitination pathways. We identified the roles of CBFs and CBF-independent transcription factors (ZATs and CZF1s) in regulating the expression of CARGs, suggesting both CBF-dependent and CBF- independent pathways functioned in the cold acclimation of <i>K. obovata</i>. Finally, we proposed a molecular mechanism of <i>K. obovata</i> cold acclimation with several key CARGs and transcriptional factors involved. Our experiments reveal strategies of <i>K. obovata</i> coping with cold environments and provide prospects for mangrove rehabilitation and management.
