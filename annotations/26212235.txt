['26212235', 'Plants use solar energy to produce lipids directly from inorganic elements and  are not thought to require molecular systems for lipid uptake from the  environment. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana Aminophospholipid ATPase10  (ALA10) is a P4-type ATPase flippase that internalizes exogenous phospholipids  across the plasma membrane, after which they are rapidly metabolized. ALA10  expression and phospholipid uptake are high in the epidermal cells of the root  tip and in guard cells, the latter of which regulate the size of stomatal  apertures to modulate gas exchange. ALA10-knockout mutants exhibit reduced  phospholipid uptake at the root tips and guard cells and are affected in growth  and transpiration. The presence of a phospholipid uptake system in plants is  surprising. Our results suggest that one possible physiological role of this  system is to internalize lysophosphatidylcholine, a signalling lipid involved in  root development and stomatal control.', '2015 Jul 27', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms8649', 'Palmgren']
