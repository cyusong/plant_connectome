Plant resistance (R) proteins mediate race-specific immunity and initiate host defenses that are often accompanied by a localized cell-death response. Most R proteins belong to the nucleotide binding-leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) protein family, as they carry a central NB-ARC domain fused to an LRR domain. The coiled-coil (CC) domain at the N terminus of some solanaceous NB-LRR proteins is extended with a solanaceae domain (SD). Tomato Mi-1.2, which confers resistance against nematodes, white flies, psyllids, and aphids, encodes a typical SD-CNL protein. Here, we analyzed the role of the extended N terminus for Mi-1.2 activation. Removal of the first part of the N terminus (Nt1) induced Mi-1.2-mediated cell death that could be suppressed by overexpression of the second half of the N-terminal region. Yet, autoactivating NB-ARC-LRR mutants require in trans coexpression of the N-terminal region to induce cell death, indicating that the N terminus functions both as a negative and as a positive regulator. Based on secondary structure predictions, we could link both activities to three distinct subdomains, a typical CC domain and two novel, structurally-conserved helical subdomains called SD1 and SD2. A negative regulatory function could be assigned to the SD1, whereas SD2 and the CC together function as positive regulators of Mi-1.2-mediated cell death.
