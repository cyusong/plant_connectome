['22241782', 'Valves on the plant epidermis called stomata develop according to positional  cues, which likely involve putative ligands (EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTORS [EPFs])  and putative receptors (ERECTA family receptor kinases and TOO MANY MOUTHS [TMM])  in Arabidopsis. Here we report the direct, robust, and saturable binding of  bioactive EPF peptides to the ERECTA family. In contrast, TMM exhibits negligible  binding to EPF1 but binding to EPF2. The ERECTA family forms receptor homomers in  vivo. On the other hand, TMM associates with the ERECTA family but not with  itself. While ERECTA family receptor kinases exhibit complex redundancy, blocking  ERECTA and ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1) signaling confers specific insensitivity to EPF2  and EPF1, respectively. Our results place the ERECTA family as the primary  receptors for EPFs with TMM as a signal modulator and establish EPF2-ERECTA and  EPF1-ERL1 as ligand-receptor pairs specifying two steps of stomatal development:  initiation and spacing divisions.', '2012 Jan 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.179895.111', 'Torii']
