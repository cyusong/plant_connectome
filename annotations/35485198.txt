Plant cell walls constitute physical barriers that restrict access of microbial pathogens to the contents of plant cells. The primary cell wall of multicellular plants predominantly consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, and its composition can change upon stress. BETA-XYLOSIDASE4 (BXL4) belongs to a seven-member gene family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), one of which encodes a protein (BXL1) involved in cell wall remodeling. We assayed the influence of BXL4 on plant immunity and investigated the subcellular localization and enzymatic activity of BXL4, making use of mutant and overexpression lines. BXL4 localized to the apoplast and was induced upon infection with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea in a jasmonoyl isoleucine-dependent manner. The bxl4 mutants showed a reduced resistance to B. cinerea, while resistance was increased in conditional overexpression lines. Ectopic expression of BXL4 in Arabidopsis seed coat epidermal cells rescued a bxl1 mutant phenotype, suggesting that, like BXL1, BXL4 has both xylosidase and arabinosidase activity. We conclude that BXL4 is a xylosidase/arabinosidase that is secreted to the apoplast and its expression is upregulated under pathogen attack, contributing to immunity against B. cinerea, possibly by removal of arabinose and xylose side-chains of polysaccharides in the primary cell wall.
