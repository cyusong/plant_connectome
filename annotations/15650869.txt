['15650869', 'Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) play an important role in the regulation of  translation and the control of mRNA stability in eukaryotes, and their functions  are known to be essential in many organisms. PABPs contain a highly conserved  C-terminal segment termed the PABC domain. The PABC domain from human PABP  interacts with the proteins PAIP1, PAIP2 and RF3 via its PAM2 motifs. These  interactions are important for modulating translation. Arabidopsis has eight  PABPs, an unexpectedly large number in comparison to other eukaryotes whose  genomes have been sequenced. Six of the Arabidopsis PABPs contain the conserved  PABC domain. In this work, we have identified PABC-interacting proteins in  Arabidopsis. Two proteins, which we named CID1 and CID7, were initially isolated  in a two-hybrid screen, and eleven more were predicted to be present in the  Arabidopsis proteome and eleven in the rice proteome. Among the 24  PAM2-containing proteins in this set, we observed a diversity of modules of  intriguing function, ranging from acidic regions similar to the PAM1 motif found  in human PAIP1 and PAIP2, to domains such as the small MutS-related domain, the  Lsm domains of Ataxin-2, and RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). We suggest that the  large number of PABPs and PAM2-containing proteins may have evolved to provide  plants with greater flexibility in modulating the metabolism of specific  transcripts. We also found that two PABP genes, PAB2 (ubiquitously expressed) and  PAB5 (expressed in reproductive tissues), are essential for viability, suggesting  that each has a vital and specific function.', '2005 Feb', 'Mol Genet Genomics', '10.1007/s00438-004-1090-9', 'Guzman']
