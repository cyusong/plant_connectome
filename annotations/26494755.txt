['26494755', 'Tissue patterns are dynamically maintained. Continuous formation of plant tissues  during postembryonic growth requires asymmetric divisions and the specification  of cell lineages. We show that the BIRDs and SCARECROW regulate lineage identity,  positional signals, patterning, and formative divisions throughout Arabidopsis  root growth. These transcription factors are postembryonic determinants of the  ground tissue stem cells and their lineage. Upon further activation by the  positional signal SHORT-ROOT (a mobile transcription factor), they direct  asymmetric cell divisions and patterning of cell types. The BIRDs and SCARECROW  with SHORT-ROOT organize tissue patterns at all formative steps during growth,  ensuring developmental plasticity.', '2015 Oct 23', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aad1171', 'Benfey']
