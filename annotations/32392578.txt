Abietane diterpenoids are tricyclic diterpenes whose biological functions in angiosperms are largely unknown. Here, we show that dehydroabietinal (DA) fosters transition from the vegetative phase to reproductive development in Arabidopsis thaliana by promoting flowering time. DA's promotion of flowering time was mediated through up-regulation of the autonomous pathway genes FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD), RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), and FVE, which repress expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a negative regulator of the key floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Our results further indicate that FLD, REF6, and FVE are also required for systemic acquired resistance (SAR), an inducible defense mechanism that is also activated by DA. However, unlike flowering time, FT was not required for DA-induced SAR. Conversely, salicylic acid, which is essential for the manifestation of SAR, was not required for the DA-promoted flowering time. Thus, although the autonomous pathway genes FLD, REF6, and FVE are involved in SAR and flowering time, these biological processes are not interdependent. We suggest that SAR and flowering time signaling pathways bifurcate at a step downstream of FLD, REF6, and FVE, with an FLC-dependent arm controlling flowering time, and an FLC-independent pathway controlling SAR.
