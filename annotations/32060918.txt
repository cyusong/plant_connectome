Plant growth and development are precisely regulated by transcription factors (TFs) such as the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs). PIFs regulate growth in response to various internal and external stimuli, and, accordingly, are regulated by a variety of different factors and mechanisms. Canonically, PIF activity is inhibited by light through the sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation of these TFs in a manner dependent on their interaction with active phytochrome photoreceptors. However, work in more recent years has revealed that phytochromes also antagonize PIF activity by inhibiting their ability to bind DNA and, at least in the case of PIF7, by causing it to be retained in the cytoplasm. Recent work has also revealed specific kinases, phosphatases and E3 ubiquitin ligases which alter PIFs at the post-translational level. In a few cases, these studies have gone as far as identifying potential kinases responsible for phosphorylating PIFs in response to light. Moreover, additional factors have been identified that positively or negatively affect PIF binding to DNA or bind directly to PIF-DNA complexes and affect the transcriptional activation of target genes by these TFs. This review summarizes the variety of different mechanisms involved in PIF regulation and discusses some of the major unanswered questions in this area of research.
