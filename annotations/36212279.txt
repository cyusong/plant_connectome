Nutritional correlations between plants and pathogens can crucially affect disease severity. As an essential macronutrient, the availability of nitrogen (N) and the types of N content play a fundamental part not only in energy metabolism and protein synthesis but also in pathogenesis. However, a direct connection has not yet been established between differences in the level of resistance and N metabolism. Pertinently, former studies hold ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) accountable for the development of diseases in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.) and in some post-harvest fruits. With a purpose of pinpointing the function of NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization on <i>Alternaria alternata</i> (Fries) Keissl pathogenesis and its correlation with both N metabolism and resistance differences to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> infection in tobacco, leaf tissue of two tobacco cultivars with susceptibility (Changbohuang; CBH), or resistance (Jingyehuang; JYH) were analyzed apropos of ammonia compensation point, apoplastic NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> concentration, pH value as well as activities of key enzymes and N status. At the leaf age of 40 to 60 d, the susceptible cultivar had a significantly higher foliar apoplastic ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>) concentration, pH value and NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization potential compared to the resistant one accompanied by a significant reduction in glutamine synthetase (GS), which in particular was a primary factor causing the NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization. The NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> concentration in CBH was 1.44 times higher than that in JYH, and CBH had NH<sub>3</sub> compensation points that were 7.09, 6.15 and 4.35-fold higher than those of JYH at 40, 50 and 60 d, respectively. Moreover, the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity had an upward tendency related to an increased NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> accumulation in both leaf tissues and apoplast but not with the NH<sub>3</sub> compensation point. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that the accumulation of NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization, rather than NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and total N, was the primary factor inducing the <i>Alternaria alternata</i> infection in tobacco. Meanwhile, the susceptible cultivar was characterized by a higher N re-transfer ability of NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization, in contrast to the disease-resistant cultivar, and had a stronger capability of N assimilation and reutilization. This study provides a deeper understanding of the pathogenicity mechanism induced by <i>Alternaria alternata,</i> which is useful for breeding <i>Alternaria alternata</i>-resistant varieties of tobacco, at the same time, our research is also conducive to control tobacco brown spot caused by <i>Alternaria alternata</i> in the field.
