['17075038', 'Programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role during the life cycle of  higher organisms. Although several regulatory mechanisms governing PCD are  thought to be conserved in animals and plants, light-dependent cell death  represents a form of PCD that is unique to plants. The light requirement of PCD  has often been associated with the production of reactive oxygen species during  photosynthesis. In support of this hypothesis, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide  have been shown to be involved in triggering a PCD response. In the present work,  we have used the conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis to analyze the impact of  another reactive oxygen species, singlet oxygen, on cell death. Unexpectedly, the  light-dependent release of singlet oxygen alone is not sufficient to induce PCD  of flu seedlings but has to act together with a second concurrent blue light  reaction. This blue-light-specific trigger of PCD could not be attributed to a  photosynthetic reaction or redox change within the chloroplast but to the  activation of the blue light/UVA-specific photoreceptor cryptochrome. The singlet  oxygen-mediated and cryptochrome-dependent cell death response differs in several  ways from PCD triggered by hydrogen peroxide/superoxide.', '2006 Nov 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0608139103', 'Apel']
