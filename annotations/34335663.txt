As an alternative to synthetic preservatives, the use of plant-based, environmentally sustainable preservatives for wood protection has tremendous potential. The current research analyzed the dimensional stability and longevity of <i>Lannea coromandelica</i> wood using weed extracts viz. <i>Lantana camara</i> L. and <i>Ageratum conyzoides</i> L., respectively. Petroleum ether (PE) and methanolic weed extracts were used to treat wood blocks (5 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) at varying concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.00%. The PE extract of <i>A. conyzoides</i> resulted in maximum swelling (tangential plane, 6.30%) at 2.00%, volumetric swelling coefficient (13.17%) at 1.50%, and volumetric shrinkage coefficient (7.71%) at 1.00% concentration, while maximum shrinkage (tangential plane, 4.10%) in methanol (M) extract was observed. In <i>L. camara</i> methanolic extract (1.00%), maximum anti-shrink efficiency (37.01%) was recorded. <i>In vitro</i> mycelial growth of the wood-rotting fungus was completely inhibited by PE extract from both weeds. However, the methanolic extract of <i>A. conyzoides</i> resulted in maximal inhibition (75.93%) at a concentration of 2.00%. Also, PE extract (2.00%) of <i>A. conyzoides</i> reduced the fungal colonization to 50%, as compared with control. The lowest weight loss (decay test, 12 weeks) was observed at a 2.00% concentration of <i>L. camara</i> PE extract. The present research highlighted that both <i>A. conyzoides</i> and <i>L. camara</i> could be used as an environmentally sustainable wood preservative substitute that will encourage the utilization of <i>L. coromandelica</i> in wood-based industries.
