Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has contributed to the evolution of organisms since the origins of life. Bryophytes also have evolutionary importance as the first clearly identified lineage of land plants (embryophytes) colonizing the terrestrial environment, thus facing high UV and water scarcity, among other new challenges. Here we review bryophyte UV-omics, the discipline relating bryophytes and UV, with an integrative perspective from genes to the environment. We consider species and habitats investigated, methodology, response variables, protection mechanisms, environmental interactions, UV biomonitoring, molecular and evolutionary aspects, and applications. Bryophyte UV-omics shows convergences and divergences with the UV-omics of other photosynthetic organisms, from algae to tracheophytes. All these organisms converge in that UV damage may be limited under realistic UV levels, due to structural protection and/or physiological acclimation capacity. Nevertheless, bryophytes diverge because they have a unique combination of vegetative and reproductive characteristics to cope with high UV and other concomitant adverse processes, such as desiccation. This interaction has both evolutionary and ecological implications. In addition, UV effects on bryophytes depend on the species and the evolutionary lineage considered, with mosses more UV-tolerant than liverworts. Thus, bryophytes do not constitute a homogeneous functional type with respect to their UV tolerance.
