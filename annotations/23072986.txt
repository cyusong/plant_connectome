Ethylene (ET) is a gaseous phytohormone that participates in various plant physiological processes and essentially contributes to plant immunity. ET conducts its functions by regulating the expression of ET-responsive genes or in crosstalk with other hormones. Several recent studies have shown the significance of ET in the establishment and development of plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, it is not surprising that pathogens and mutualistic symbionts target ET synthesis or signaling to colonize plants. This review introduces the significance of ET metabolism in plant-microbe interactions, with an emphasis on its role in mutualistic symbioses.
