Four semi-leafless pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars at the vegetative stage of growth were exposed to progressive soil drought, which lasted for 18 days until the plants began to wilt, after which a 7-day period of the recovery from stress followed, when plant watering was resumed. The soil drought negatively affected plant growth, slowing down the rate of shoot elongation, decreasing the accumulation of fresh and dry weight, inhibiting the development of new leaves, and delaying the flowering of plants. Changes in the levels of 41 polar metabolites (identified by GC-MS) were established by the GC-FID method in the shoot tip, stem, stipules and tendrils, separately. Drought caused re-arrangement in the metabolism in all parts of the pea shoot, leading to a significant increase in the content of total polar metabolites. Although changes in most metabolites in the same parts of shoot were not identical among the pea cultivars studied, some metabolites were uniformly accumulated until 18th day of drought and decreased after recovery. They were i) proline and malate in all, while myo-inositol in most parts of shoot (of all the pea cultivars), ii) sucrose and glycine in the shoot tip, iii) homoserine in the stem and iv) GABA in stipules. These findings signify that the pea adjustment to progressive soil drought includes both accumulation of osmolytes and osmoprotectants and translocation of some of them (proline, sucrose, myo-inositol) to the shoot tip, thereby protecting the youngest tissues from damage caused by water deficit.
