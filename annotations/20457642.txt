The past two decades revealed a plethora of Ca2+-responsive proteins and downstream targets in plants, of which several are unique to plants. More recent high-throughput 'omics' approaches and bioinformatics are exposing Ca2+-responsive cis-elements and the corresponding Ca2+-responsive genes. Here, we review the current knowledge on Ca2+-signaling pathways that regulate gene expression in plants, and we link these to mechanisms by which plants respond to biotic and abiotic stresses.

Ca2+: !regulates! gene expression 
Ca2+-responsive proteins: !respond to! Ca2+ 
Ca2+-responsive cis-elements: !correspond to! Ca2+-responsive genes 
Ca2+-signaling pathways: !regulate! gene expression 
plants: !respond to! biotic and abiotic stresses
