Legumes can establish a symbiosis with rhizobia and form root nodules that function as an apparatus for nitrogen fixation. Nodule development is regulated by several phytohormones including auxin. Although accumulation of auxin is necessary to initiate the nodulation of indeterminate nodules, the functions of auxin on the nodulation of determinate nodules have been less characterized. In this study, the functions of auxin in nodule development in Lotus japonicus have been demonstrated using an auxin responsive promoter and auxin inhibitors. We found that the lenticel formation on the nodule surface was sensitive to the auxin defect. Further analysis indicated that failure in the development of the vascular bundle of the determinate nodule, which was regulated by auxin, was the cause of the disappearance of lenticels.
