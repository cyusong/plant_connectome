Elevated greenhouse gases (GHGs) induce adverse conditions directly and indirectly, causing decreases in plant productivity. To deal with climate change effects, plants have developed various mechanisms including the fine-tuning of metabolism. Plant respiratory metabolism is highly flexible due to the presence of various alternative pathways. The mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) respiratory pathway is responsive to these changes, and several lines of evidence suggest it plays a role in reducing excesses of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) while providing metabolic flexibility under stress. Here we discuss the importance of the AOX pathway in dealing with elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), and the main abiotic stresses induced by climate change.

AOX: !provides! metabolic flexibility 
CO2: !induces! adverse conditions 
NOx: !induces! adverse conditions 
O3: !induces! adverse conditions 
abiotic stresses: !induced by! climate change
