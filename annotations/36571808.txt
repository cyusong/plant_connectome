Pathogen effectors can suppress various plant immune responses, suggesting that they have multiple targets in the host. To understand the mechanisms underlying plasma membrane-associated and effector-mediated immunity, we screened the Phytophthora capsici RxLR cell death-inducer suppressing immune system (CRISIS). We found that the cell death induced by the CRISIS2 effector in Nicotiana benthamiana was inhibited by the irreversible plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PMA) activator fusicoccin. Biochemical and gene-silencing analyses revealed that CRISIS2 physically and functionally associated with PMAs and induced host cell death independent of immune receptors. CRISIS2 induced apoplastic alkalization by suppressing PMA activity via its association with the C-terminal regulatory domain. In planta expression of CRISIS2 significantly enhanced the virulence of P. capsici, whereas host-induced gene-silencing of CRISIS2 compromised the disease symptoms and the biomass of the pathogen. Thus, our study has identified a novel RxLR effector that plays multiple roles in the suppression of plant defense and in the induction of cell death to support the pathogen hemibiotrophic life cycle in the host plant.
