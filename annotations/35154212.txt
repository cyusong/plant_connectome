Branched-chain volatiles (BCVs) constitute an important family of fruit volatile metabolites essential to the characteristic flavor and aroma profiles of many edible fruits. Yet in contrast to other groups of volatile organic compounds important to fruit flavor such as terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and oxylipins, the molecular biology underlying BCV biosynthesis remains poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is a barrier to efforts aimed at obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of fruit flavor and aroma and the biology underlying these complex phenomena. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge regarding fruit BCV biosynthesis from the perspective of molecular biology. We survey the diversity of BCV compounds identified in edible fruits as well as explore various hypotheses concerning their biosynthesis. Insights from branched-chain precursor compound metabolism obtained from non-plant organisms and how they may apply to fruit BCV production are also considered, along with potential avenues for future research that might clarify unresolved questions regarding BCV metabolism in fruits.
