The Antirrhinum DEFH125 MADS-box protein is expressed in maturing pollen and thus likely participates in the regulation of pollen development. Here, we describe the characterization of a 2.5 kbp promoter fragment conferring pollen-specific GUS expression in Antirrhinum, as well as in the distantly related species Arabidopsis. Taking advantage of the higher sensitivity of the diphtheria toxin A-chain (DTA) reporter gene assay, onset of DEFH125 promoter activity could be defined to start at the late unicellular microspore stage. Stamen development in Antirrhinum is governed by the class B MADS-box genes DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO). The respective proteins form a heterodimer and are expressed throughout stamens, except for microspores. Complementary expression patterns of DEFH125 and DEF/GLO during later stamen development tempted us to investigate whether the DEF/GLO heterodimer might bind the DEFH125 promoter and could thus be involved in repressing the DEFH125 expression. The ChIP technique was applied to investigate protein/DNA interactions occurring in vivo. We report the identification of a 200 bp DEFH125 promoter fragment that is in vivo bound by DEF and GLO proteins. This fragment contains a CArG-box motif, known to mediate DNA binding of MADS-box proteins. Implications for a likely function of DEF and GLO in the transcriptional control of DEFH125 are discussed.
