['31557830', 'The dimension of the plants largest organelle-the vacuole-plays a major role in  defining cellular elongation rates. The morphology of the vacuole is controlled  by the actin cytoskeleton, but molecular players remain largely unknown.  Recently, the Networked (NET) family of membrane-associated, actin-binding  proteins has been identified. Here, we show that NET4A localizes to highly  constricted regions of the vacuolar membrane and contributes to vacuolar  morphology. Using genetic interference, we found that deregulation of NET4  abundance increases vacuolar occupancy, and that overexpression of NET4 abundance  decreases vacuolar occupancy. Our data reveal that NET4A induces more compact  vacuoles, correlating with reduced cellular and organ growth in Arabidopsis  thaliana.', '2019 Sep 25', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms20194752', 'Scheuring']
