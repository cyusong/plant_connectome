The effect of salt stress was analyzed in chloroplasts of Amaranthus cruentus var. Amaranteca, a plant NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) type. Morphology of chloroplasts from bundle sheath (BSC) and mesophyll (MC) was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). BSC and MC from control plants showed similar morphology, however under stress, changes in BSC were observed. The presence of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining in both types of chloroplasts. Proteomic profiles of thylakoid protein complexes from BSC and MC, and their changes induced by salt stress were analyzed by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by SDS-PAGE (2-D BN/SDS-PAGE). Differentially accumulated protein spots were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Although A. cruentus photosynthetic tissue showed the Kranz anatomy, the thylakoid proteins showed some differences at photosystem structure level. Our results suggest that A. cruentus var. Amaranteca could be better classified as a C3-C4 photosynthetic plant.
