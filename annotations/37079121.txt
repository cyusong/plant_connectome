A large part of the production of tomato plants is grafted. Although it has recently been described that cell walls play an important role in tomato graft healing, the spatiotemporal dynamics of cell wall changes in this critical process remains largely unknown. The aim of this work was to immunolocalize changes in the major cell wall matrix components of autograft union tissues throughout the course of healing, from 1 to 20 days after grafting (DAG). Homogalacturonan was de novo synthetized and deposited in the cut edges, displaying the low methyl-esterified homogalacturonan a stronger labelling. Labelling of galactan side chains of rhamnogalacturonan increased until 8 DAG, although remarkably a set of cells at the graft union did not show labelling for this epitope. Changes in xylan immunolocalization were associated to the xylem vasculature development throughout, while those of xyloglucan revealed early synthesis at the cut edges. Arabinogalactan proteins increased up to 8 DAG and showed scion-rootstock asymmetry, with a higher extent in the scion. The combination of these changes appears to be related with the success of the autograft, specifically facilitating the adhesion phase between scion-rootstock tissues. This knowledge paves the way for improved grafting using methods that facilitate appropriate changes in the time and space dynamics of these cell wall compounds.
