Plant chloroplasts harbor ubiquitous lipid droplets called plastoglobules. While physically connected to the thylakoid membrane, they are characterized by a unique set of about 30 proteins specifically associated with the plastoglobule. How these proteins selectively target the plastoglobule remains unknown. Protease shaving assays with isolated <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> thylakoid and plastoglobule show that a ca. 25 kD portion of the abundant structural protein of plastoglobules, Fibrillin 1a, is protected from protease digestion. Mapping of protease cleavage sites and experimentally identified phosphorylation sites onto a homology model of Fibrillin 1a indicates that this protected sequence corresponds to the C-terminal lipocalin-like domain, implicated in specific lipid binding. In contrast, protease shaving and membrane washing assays with another plastoglobule-associated protein harboring a C-terminal PLAT domain, Lipoxygenase 2, is consistent with an exposed PLAT domain positioned parallel with, and upon, the surface of the plastoglobule. We propose a model where conserved lipid-binding domains associate with either the surface or neutral core of the lipid droplet. Our study provides insight into the topology and membrane interactions of two plastoglobule-localized proteins.
