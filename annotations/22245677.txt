['22245677', 'A previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase  (LCAT) family gene (At4g19860) was functionally expressed in yeast, where it was  demonstrated to encode a novel cytosolic and calcium-independent phospholipase A  with preferences for the sn-2 position. This enzyme shows optimal activity at pH  5.0, exhibits a headgroup specificity for phosphatidylcholine>phosphatidic  acid>phosphatidylethanolamine>phosphatidylglycerol>phosphatidylserine and has an  acyl chain specificity for oleoyl>linoleoyl>ricinoleoyl. The expression of  AtLCAT-PLA inhibited yeast cell growth and fatty acid accumulation. AtLCAT-PLA  transcript in Arabidopsis was detected at high levels in roots and siliques.', '2012 Feb 17', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2011.12.034', 'Weselake']
