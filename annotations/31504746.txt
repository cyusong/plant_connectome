Mediator is a multisubunit transcriptional co-regulator that is involved in the regulation of an array of processes including plant metabolism. The pathways regulated by Mediator-dependent processes include those for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids (MED5), cellulose (MED16), lipids (MED15 and CDK8), and the regulation of iron homeostasis (MED16 and MED25). Traditional genetic and biochemical approaches laid the foundation for our understanding of Mediator function, but recent transcriptomic and metabolomic studies have provided deeper insights into how specific subunits cooperate in the regulation of plant metabolism. In this review, we highlight recent developments in the investigation of Mediator and plant metabolism, with particular emphasis on the large-scale biology studies of med mutants.
