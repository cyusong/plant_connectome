The compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) is a well-known secondary metabolite produced by <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. that are used as biocontrol agents. DAPG displays a remarkably broad spectrum of toxic activity against pathogens of plants. Yet high concentrations of DAPG may also have negative effect on plants, but the phytotoxicity of DAPG is not clearly understood. Here, we used genome-wide activation, tagging <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants as the model plant to investigate the plant response to DAPG. A total of 15 lines were selected as DAPG-tolerant plants from among 62,000 lines investigated. The DAPG-responsible genes were then identified via thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR and quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and the gene ontology analysis showed the distribution of these genes having different biological processes, cellular regulations, and molecular functional properties. Collectively, these findings suggest that plants may rely on several pathways to prevent DAPG phytotoxicity.
