['24603461', 'The REIL1 and REIL2 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana are evolutionarily conserved  homologs of the cytosolic 60S ribosomal maturation factors Rei1 and its paralog  Reh1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We previously demonstrated that the REIL  proteins like the yeast homologs are required for the growth of both organisms at  suboptimal temperatures. In addition, the cold sensitivity of the yeast Deltarei1  mutant was almost fully rescued by heterologous expression of the REIL1 protein.  These phenomena and conservation of co-expressed genes linked the function of  REIL proteins to the maturation of the eukaryotic ribosome in A. thaliana. Here  we demonstrate that REIL proteins interact in yeast-2-hybrid assays with A.  thaliana homologs of the yeast proteins, Rlp24, Rpl24A, Rlp24B, Arx1, and Jjj1.  These proteins take part in the cytosolic 60S ribosomal maturation process within  yeast and physically interact with Rei1. Our study does not provide proof but is  consistent with a conserved role of the A. thaliana REIL proteins in ribosomal  maturation and demonstrates the potential of future investigations that aim to  unravel the protein interactions of REIL proteins in planta.', '2014', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.28224', 'Kopka']
