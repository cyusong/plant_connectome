['21893514', 'In plant cells, boron (B) occurs predominantly as a borate ester associated with  rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), but the function of this B-RG-II complex has yet  to be investigated. 3-Deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (KDO) is a specific  component monosaccharide of RG-II. Mutant plants defective in KDO biosynthesis  are expected to have altered RG-II structure, and would be useful for studying  the physiological function of the B-RG-II complex. Here, we characterized  Arabidopsis CTP:KDO cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase; CKS), the enzyme  activating KDO as a nucleotide sugar prior to its incorporation into RG-II. Our  analyses localized the Arabidopsis CKS protein to mitochondria. The Arabidopsis  CKS gene occurs as a single-copy gene in the genome, and we could not obtain cks  null mutants from T-DNA insertion lines. Analysis using +/cks heterozygotes in  the quartet1 background demonstrated that the cks mutation rendered pollen  infertile through the inhibition of pollen tube elongation. These results suggest  that KDO is an indispensable component of RG-II, and that the complete B-RG-II  complex is essential for the cell wall integrity of rapidly growing tissues.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcr120', 'Matoh']
