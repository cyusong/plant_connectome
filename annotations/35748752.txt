Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a mode of photosynthesis that evolved in response to decreasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere some 20 million years ago. An elevated ratio of O2 relative to CO2 caused many plants to face increasing stress from photorespiration, a process exacerbated for plants living under high temperatures or in water-limited environments. Today, our climate is again rapidly changing and plants' ability to cope with and adapt to these novel environments is critical for their success. This review focuses on CAM plant responses to abiotic stressors likely to dominate in our changing climate: increasing CO2 levels, increasing temperatures, and greater variability in drought. Empirical studies that have assessed CAM responses are reviewed, though notably these are concentrated in relatively few CAM lineages. Other aspects of CAM biology, including the effects of abiotic stress on the light reactions and the role of leaf succulence, are also considered in the context of climate change. Finally, more recent studies using genomic techniques are discussed to link physiological changes in CAM plants with the underlying molecular mechanism. Together, the body of work reviewed suggests that CAM plants will continue to thrive in certain environments under elevated CO2. However, how CO2 interacts with other environmental factors, how those interactions affect CAM plants, and whether all CAM plants will be equally affected remain outstanding questions regarding the evolution of CAM on a changing planet.
