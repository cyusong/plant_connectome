['29213277', 'Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are widespread in different  plant species and play important roles in growth and development. Germination  inhibition is vital for the completion of seed maturation and cell expansion is a  fundamental cellular process driving plant growth. Here, we report genetic and  structural characterizations of a functionally uncharacterized LRR-RLK, named  GRACE (Germination Repression and Cell Expansion receptor-like kinase).  Overexpression of GRACE in Arabidopsis exhibited delayed germination, enlarged  cotyledons, rosette leaves and stubbier petioles. Conversely, these phenotypes  were reversed in the T-DNA insertion knock-down mutant grace-1 plants. A crystal  structure of the extracellular domain of GRACE (GRACE-LRR) determined at the  resolution of 3.0 A revealed that GRACE-LRR assumed a right-handed super-helical  structure with an island domain (ID). Structural comparison showed that structure  of the ID in GRACE-LRR is strikingly different from those observed in other  LRR-RLKs. This structural observation implies that GRACE might perceive a new  ligand for signaling. Collectively, our data support roles of GRACE in repressing  seed germination and promoting cell expansion of Arabidopsis, presumably by  perception of unknown ligand(s).', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.01999', 'Chai']
