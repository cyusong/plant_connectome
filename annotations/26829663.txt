Low temperature (LT) severely affects rice growth and grain yield. Recently, we reported contrasting genotypes including ARR 09 and Takyer for seedling stage long duration low temperature response. Here we show that susceptible rice genotypes show an increase in lipid peroxide levels and decrease in relative water content (RWC) to a higher extent in comparison to tolerant genotypes in response to 3 h LT. Stress induced NAC family members (OsNAC1, OsNAC2, OsNAC3, and OsNAC5) showed a higher transcript accumulation in tolerant genotypes than in sensitive genotypes after LT treatment suggesting stress tolerance might be due to higher expression of stress-responsive transcription factors. Furthermore, ARR 09 can be used as an important genetic resource to better understand LT tolerance mechanism.
