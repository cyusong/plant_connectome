['35104663', 'Root hairs are cylindrical extensions of root epidermal cells that are important  for the acquisition of water and minerals, interactions between plant and  microbes. The deposition of cell wall materials in the tip enables root hairs to  maintain elongation constantly. To date, our knowledge of the regulators that  connect the architecture of cell wall and the root hair development remains very  limited. Here, we demonstrated that COBL9 and COBL7, two genes of COBRA-Like  family in Arabidopsis as well as their counterparts in rice, OsBC1L1 and OsBC1L8,  regulate root hair growth. Single mutant cobl9, double mutants cobl7 cobl9 and  double mutants osbc1l1 osbc1l8 all displayed prematurely terminated root hair  elongation, though at varying levels. COBL7-YFP and COBL9-YFP accumulate  prominently in the growing tips of newly emerged root hairs. Furthermore, cobl9,  cobl7 cobl9 and osbc1l1 osbc1l8 mutants were defective in the enrichment of  cellulose in the tips of the growing root hairs. We also discovered that  overexpression of COBL9 could promote root hair elongation and salinity  tolerance. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that the  polarized COBL7 and COBL9 in the tip of the emerging root hairs have conserved  roles in regulating root hair development and stress adaptation in dicots and  monocots.', '2022 Mar 12', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.01.096', 'Liang']
