The expression of SlNP24 encoding osmotin was studied in germinating tomato seeds Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Moneymaker. The results show that the accumulation of the transcripts of SlNP24 and its potential upstream regulator TERF1 encoding an ethylene response factor was induced by ethylene and methyl jasmonate in germinating tomato seeds. There was no effect of gibberellins on the expression of the genes studied. The expression of SlNP24 was localized in the micropylar region of the endosperm of tomato seeds. The promoter of tomato osmotin was active in the endosperm cells of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, which contain reporter genes under control of SlNP24 promoter. The activity of SlNP24 promoter in A. thaliana reporter line seeds was visible when the expression of its ortholog gene in A. thaliana (AtOMS34) was observed. The mechanism of induction and a possible role of NP24 in germinating tomato seeds are discussed.
