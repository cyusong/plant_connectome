['31123050', "ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) is a crucial regulator of abscisic acid (ABA)  signaling pathways involved in repressing seed germination and postgerminative  growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). ABI5 is precisely modulated at the  posttranslational level; however, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms  underlying ABI5 and its interacting transcription factors remain largely unknown.  Here, we found that INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1 (ICE1) physically associates with  ABI5. ICE1 negatively regulates ABA responses during seed germination and  directly suppresses ABA-responsive LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT6 (EM6) and EM1  expression. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the ABA-hypersensitive phenotype  of the ice1 mutant requires ABI5. ICE1 interferes with the transcriptional  activity of ABI5 to mediate downstream regulons. Importantly, ICE1 also interacts  with DELLA proteins, which stimulate ABI5 during ABA signaling. Disruption of  ICE1 partially restored the ABA-hyposensitive phenotype of the della mutant,  gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 rgl2-1, indicating that ICE1 functions antagonistically with  DELLA in ABA signaling. Consistently, DELLA proteins repress ICE1's  transcriptional function and the antagonistic effect of ICE1 on ABI5.  Collectively, our study demonstrates that ICE1 antagonizes ABI5 and DELLA  activity to maintain the appropriate level of ABA signaling during seed  germination, providing a mechanistic understanding of how ABA signaling is  fine-tuned by a transcriptional complex involving ABI5 and its interacting  partners.", '2019 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00825', 'ORCID:']
