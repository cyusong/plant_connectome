Genome-wide association studies can identify novel genomic regions and genes that affect quantitative traits. Fusarium head blight is a destructive disease caused by Fusarium graminearum that exhibits several quantitative traits, including aggressiveness, mycotoxin production, and fungicide resistance. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing was performed for 220 isolates of F. graminearum. A total of 119 isolates were phenotyped for aggressiveness and deoxynivalenol (DON) production under natural field conditions across four environments. The effective concentration of propiconazole that inhibits isolate growth in vitro by 50% was calculated for 220 strains. Approximately 29,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were associated to each trait, resulting in 50, 29, and 74 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) that were significantly associated to aggressiveness, DON production, and propiconazole sensitivity, respectively. Approximately 41% of these QTNs caused nonsynonymous substitutions in predicted exons, while the remainder were synonymous substitutions or located in intergenic regions. Three QTNs associated with propiconazole sensitivity were significant after Bonferroni correction. These QTNs were located in genes not previously associated with azole sensitivity. The majority of the detected QTNs were located in genes with predicted regulatory functions, suggesting that nucleotide variation in regulatory genes plays a major role in the corresponding quantitative trait variation.
