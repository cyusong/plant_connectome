The hypersensitive response (HR) is a form of programmed cell death (PCD) commonly associated with the immune response in plants. HR cell death is often characterized by DNA fragmentation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, protein degradation and typical morphological changes such as plasma membrane shrinkage and nuclear condensation. Initiation of HR cell death requires de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that HR cell death induction involves a transcriptional network regulated by a key factor. We recently identified the OsNAC4 gene, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor that exhibited rapid but transient transcriptional activation during the early stages of HR cell death. Overexpression of OsNAC4 in rice plants induced cell death accompanied by all characteristics of HR cell death: DNA fragmentation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and protein degradation. In OsNAC4 RNAi knock-down lines exposed to an avirulent bacterial strain, the cellular response was characterized by a marked decrease in HR cell death compared to wild-type rice cells. Gene expression profiling, which compared rice cells and OsNAC4 knock-down transformants using a rice cDNA microarray, demonstrated that OsNAC4 controls the transcription of at least 139 genes including OsHSP90, involved in loss of plasma membrane integrity, and IREN, which encodes novel plant nuclease involved in cleavage of nuclear DNA. Here we report that although OsNAC4 overexpression caused rapid protein degradation during HR cell death, neither IREN nor OsHSP90 were involved. Thus, three important processes that accompany HR cell death are regulated by independent signaling pathways that are collectively induced by OsNAC4.

OsNAC4: !induces! HR cell death 
OsNAC4: !controls transcription of! 139 genes 
OsHSP90: !involved in! loss of plasma membrane integrity 
IREN: !encodes! novel plant nuclease 
IREN/OsHSP90: !not involved in! protein degradation
