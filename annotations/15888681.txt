The development of complex eukaryotic organisms can be viewed as the selective expression of distinct fractions of the genome in different organs or tissue types in response to developmental and environmental cues. Here, we generated a genome expression atlas of 18 organ or tissue types representing the life cycle of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We showed that each organ or tissue type had a defining genome expression pattern and that the degree to which organs share expression profiles is highly correlated with the biological relationship of organ types. Further, distinct fractions of the genome exhibited expression changes in response to environmental light among the three seedling organs, despite the fact that they share the same photo-perception and transduction systems. A significant fraction of the genes in the Arabidopsis genome is organized into chromatin domains exhibiting coregulated expression patterns in response to developmental or environmental signals. The knowledge of organ-specific expression patterns and their response to the changing environment provides a foundation for dissecting the molecular processes underlying development.
