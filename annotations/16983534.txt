Plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are encoded by a multigene family and support physiological functions, which remain unclear. We adapted an efficient ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) procedure that enabled isolation of 22 novel Triticum aestivum nsLtp (TaLtp) genes encoding types 1 and 2 nsLTPs. A phylogenetic tree clustered the wheat nsLTPs into ten subfamilies comprising 1-7 members. We also studied the activity of four type 1 and two type 2 TaLtp gene promoters in transgenic rice using the 1-Glucuronidase reporter gene. The activities of the six promoters displayed both overlapping and distinct features in rice. In vegetative organs, these promoters were active in leaves and root vascular tissues while no beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected in stems. In flowers, the GUS activity driven by the TaLtp7.2a, TaLtp9.1a, TaLtp9.2d, and TaLtp9.3e gene promoters was associated with vascular tissues in glumes and in the extremities of anther filaments whereas only the TaLtp9.4a gene promoter was active in anther epidermal cells. In developing grains, GUS activity and GUS immunolocalization data evidenced complex patterns of activity of the TaLtp7.1a, TaLtp9.2d, and TaLtp9.4a gene promoters in embryo scutellum and in the grain epicarp cell layer. In contrast, GUS activity driven by TaLtp7.2a, TaLtp9.1a, and TaLtp9.3e promoters was restricted to the vascular bundle of the embryo scutellum. This diversity of TaLtp gene promoter activity supports the hypothesis that the encoded TaLTPs possess distinct functions in planta.
