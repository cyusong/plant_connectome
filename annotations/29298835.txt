Ethylene plays pleiotropic roles in plant growth, plant development, and stress responses. Although the effects of ethylene on plants are well documented, little is known about molecular-level events that result in transcriptional repression during the ethylene response. In this study, we found that two histone deacetylases, SRT1 and SRT2, interact with ENAP1, which associates with EIN2 in the nucleus. Genetic and transcriptome analyses revealed that SRT1 and SRT2 are required for negative regulation of certain ethylene-responsive genes. The acetylation of HISTONE3 at K9 (H3K9Ac) is specifically regulated by SRT1 and SRT2 in ethylene-repressed genes. In addition, the <i>srt1 srt2</i> double mutation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> suppresses both the <i>ENAP1ox</i> and the <i>EIN3ox</i> constitutive ethylene response phenotypes, and the ethylene-induced transcriptional repression observed in <i>EIN3ox</i> plants is derepressed in the <i>EIN3ox/srt1 srt2</i> mutant. SRT2 and ENAP1 both bind to promoter regions of genes negatively regulated by ethylene, reducing H3K9Ac levels and resulting in transcriptional repression. This work establishes a mechanism by which histone deacetylases SRT1 and SRT2 interact with ENAP1 to mediate transcriptional repression by regulating the levels of H3K9 acetylation in the ethylene signaling.
