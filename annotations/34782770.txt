In plant tissue culture, callus forms from detached explants in response to a high-auxin-to-low-cytokinin ratio on callus-inducing medium. Callus is a group of pluripotent cells because it can regenerate either roots or shoots in response to a low level of auxin on root-inducing medium or a high-cytokinin-to-low-auxin ratio on shoot-inducing medium, respectively<sup>1</sup>. However, our knowledge of the mechanism of pluripotency acquisition during callus formation is limited. On the basis of analyses at the single-cell level, we show that the tissue structure of Arabidopsis thaliana callus on callus-inducing medium is similar to that of the root primordium or root apical meristem, and the middle cell layer with quiescent centre-like transcriptional identity exhibits the ability to regenerate organs. In the middle cell layer, WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5 (WOX5) directly interacts with PLETHORA1 and 2 to promote TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS1 expression for endogenous auxin production. WOX5 also interacts with the B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR12 (ARR12) and represses A-type ARRs to break the negative feedback loop in cytokinin signalling. Overall, the promotion of auxin production and the enhancement of cytokinin sensitivity are both required for pluripotency acquisition in the middle cell layer of callus for organ regeneration.
