Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) phloem fibers elongate considerably during their development and intrude between existing cells. We questioned whether fiber elongation is caused by cell tip growth or intercalary growth. Cells with tip growth are characterized by having two specific zones of cytoplasm in the cell tip, one with vesicles and no large organelles at the very tip and one with various organelles amongst others longitudinally arranged cortical microtubules in the subapex. Such zones were not observed in elongating flax fibers. Instead, organelles moved into the very tip region, and cortical microtubules showed transversal and helical configurations as known for cells growing in intercalary way. In addition, pulse-chase experiments with Calcofluor White resulted in a spotted fluorescence in the cell wall all over the length of the fiber. Therefore, it is concluded that fiber elongation is not achieved by tip growth but by intercalary growth. The intrusively growing fiber is a coenocytic cell that has no plasmodesmata, making the fibers a symplastically isolated domain within the stem.
