['11069919', 'The maturation of c-type cytochromes requires the covalent attachment of the heme  cofactor to the apoprotein. For this process, plant mitochondria follow a pathway  distinct from that of animal or yeast mitochondria, closer to that found in  alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria. We report the first characterization of a  nuclear-encoded component, namely AtCCME, the Arabidopsis thaliana orthologue of  CcmE, a periplasmic heme chaperone in bacteria. AtCCME is targeted to  mitochondria, and its N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved upon import. AtCCME is  a peripheral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its major  hydrophilic domain is oriented toward the intermembrane space. Although a AtCCME  (Met(79)-Ser(256)) is not fully able to complement an Escherichia coli CcmE  mutant strain for bacterial holocytochrome c production, it is able to bind heme  covalently through a conserved histidine, a feature previously shown for E. coli  CcmE. Our results suggest that AtCCME is important for cytochrome c maturation in  A. thaliana mitochondria and that its heme-binding function has been conserved  evolutionary between land plant mitochondria and alpha-proteobacteria.', '2001 Feb 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M008853200', 'Bonnard']
