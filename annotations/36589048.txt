Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture due to their ability to facilitate plant uptake of important mineral elements, such as nitrogen (N). However, plant mycorrhiza-dependent N uptake and interplant transfer may be highly context-dependent, and whether it is affected by aboveground herbivory remains largely unknown. Here, we used <sup>15</sup>N labeling and tracking to examine the effect of aboveground insect herbivory by <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> on mycorrhiza-dependent N uptake in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.). To minimize consumption differences and <sup>15</sup>N loss due to insect chewing, insect herbivory was simulated by mechanical wounding and oral secretion of <i>S. frugiperda</i> larvae. Inoculation with <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> (<i>Rir</i>) significantly improved maize growth, and N/P uptake. The <sup>15</sup>N labeling experiment showed that maize plants absorbed N from soils <i>via</i> the extraradical mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi and from neighboring plants transferred by common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Simulated aboveground leaf herbivory did not affect mycorrhiza-mediated N acquisition from soil. However, CMN-mediated N transfer from neighboring plants was blocked by leaf simulated herbivory. Our findings suggest that aboveground herbivory inhibits CMN-mediated N transfer between plants but does not affect N acquisition from soil solutions <i>via</i> extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium.
