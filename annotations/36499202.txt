Many basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors precisely regulate the expression of Fe uptake and translocation genes to control iron (Fe) homeostasis, as both Fe deficiency and toxicity impair plant growth and development. In rice, three clade IVc bHLH transcription factors have been characterised as positively regulating Fe-deficiency response genes. However, the function of OsbHLH057, another clade IVc bHLH transcription factor, in regulating Fe homeostasis is unknown. Here, we report that OsbHLH057 is involved in regulating Fe homeostasis in rice. <i>OsbHLH057</i> was highly expressed in the leaf blades and lowly expressed in the roots; it was mainly expressed in the stele and highly expressed in the lateral roots. In addition, <i>OsbHLH057</i> was slightly induced by Fe deficiency in the shoots on the first day but was not affected by Fe availability in the roots. OsbHLH057 localised in the nucleus exhibited transcriptional activation activity. Under Fe-sufficient conditions, <i>OsbHLH057</i> knockout or overexpression lines increased or decreased the shoot Fe concentration and the expression of several Fe homeostasis-related genes, respectively. Under Fe-deficient conditions, plants with an <i>OsbHLH057</i> mutation showed susceptibility to Fe deficiency and accumulated lower Fe concentrations in the shoot compared with the wild type. Unexpectedly, the <i>OsbHLH057</i>-overexpressing lines had reduced tolerance to Fe deficiency. These results indicate that OsbHLH057 plays a positive role in regulating Fe homeostasis, at least under Fe-sufficient conditions.
