The wound-induced receptor-like protein kinase (WRK) gene, isolated as one of the genes whose transcripts accumulated during the early period of N gene-dependent synchronized cell death in tobacco mosaic virus-infected tobacco plants, encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase, and its transcript was transiently increased 15 min after wounding. In the present study, analysis of a green fluorescent protein fusion protein indicated that WRK is localized in the plasma membrane. In transgenic tobacco plant lines with elevated or suppressed levels of WRK transcript, the wound-induced accumulation of both basic PR-1 and PR-6 transcripts was slightly enhanced or significantly suppressed respectively. The decrease in wound-induced basic PR gene expression in WRK suppressed lines was restored by jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Furthermore, the levels of wound-induced enzymatic activation of both salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) and wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK) and wound-induced accumulation of JA were reduced in the WRK suppressed lines in comparison with a control line. These results suggest that WRK functions upstream of SIPK and WIPK and regulates wound signal transduction in tobacco plants.
