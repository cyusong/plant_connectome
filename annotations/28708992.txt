To study how genes, cells, or organisms operate in natural environments, researchers often need to leave the bench and venture into the field. Here are a few approaches that field biologists use in designing and conducting semi-wild experiments and the many challenges they face.

Gene: !affects! Process 
Gene: !localizes to! Cell 
Gene: !interacts with! Environment 
Gene: !enhances! Experiment 
Gene: !represses! Challenge 
Gene: !synthesizes! Data
