Jasmonates are signaling compounds that regulate plant responses to stress. Jasmonic acid (JA) is the direct precursor of the bioactive plant hormone JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the ligand of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1-jasmonate ZIM-domain (COI1-JAZ) co-receptor complex. JA, its methyl ester, and three furanonyl esters were recently isolated from the grapevine pathogen Lasiodiplodia mediterranea. The JA ester lasiojasmonate A (LasA) is the first reported naturally occurring JA-furanone, and its mode of action has not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that LasA activates many JA-regulated responses in planta, including protein degradation, gene expression, and physiological processes. These in vivo effects require LasA conversion into JA, formation of JA-Ile, and its recognition by the plant JA-Ile perception complex. These findings suggest a mode of action of the natural fungal LasA as an inactive JA pool that can be transformed into the bioactive JA-Ile form. We propose that fungal production of JA derivates such as LasA occurs at late infection stages to induce plant JA responses such as cell death, and can facilitate fungal infection.
