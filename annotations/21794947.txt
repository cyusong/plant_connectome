Calcium (Ca(2+)) is a critical ion for the growth and development of plants and plays an important role in signal transduction pathways in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We investigated the Ca(2+) stress responsive-genes in amaranth leaves by using the suppression subtractive hybridization technique. Screening of the libraries generated 420 up-regulated transcripts and 199 down-regulated transcripts. The differentially expressed transcripts were associated with general stress response, transcription factors, gene regulation, signal transduction, and some other with unknown function. Selected genes were used to study their differential regulation by sqRT-PCR. Among the up-regulated transcripts, a fragment containing the motif of C3HC4-type RING-Zinc family was further characterized. The ORF of amaranth zinc finger protein (AhZnf) has a closer relationship with its ortholog from Ricinus communis while is distantly related to the Arabidopsis thaliana C3HC4-type ortholog. We have identified a novel putative zinc finger protein along with other novel proteins such as the wall associated kinase, phosphoinositide binding protein, and rhomboid protease involved in response to Ca(2+) stress in amaranth leaves.
