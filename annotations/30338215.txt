['30338215', 'The nucleoplasm and nucleolus are the two main territories of the nucleus. While  specific functions are associated with each of these territories (such as mRNA  synthesis in the nucleoplasm and ribosomal rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus), some  proteins are known to be located in both. Here, we investigated the molecular  function of REBELOTE (RBL), an Arabidopsis thaliana protein previously  characterized as a regulator of floral meristem termination. We show that RBL  displays a dual localization, in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Moreover, we used  direct and global approaches to demonstrate that RBL interacts with nucleic  acid-binding proteins. It binds to the NOC proteins SWA2, AtNOC2 and AtNOC3 in  both the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, and also to OBE1 and VFP3/ENAP1. Taking into  account the identities of these RBL interactors, we hypothesize that RBL acts  both in ribosomal biogenesis and in the regulation of gene expression.', '2018 Oct', 'FEBS Open Bio', '10.1002/2211-5463.12504', 'Negrutiu']
