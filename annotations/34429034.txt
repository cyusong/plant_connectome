Plant growth is continuously modulated by endogenous and exogenous stimuli. By no means the only, but well described, signaling molecules produced in plants and distributed through the plant body to orchestrate efficient growth are photosynthates. Light is a potent exogenous stimulus that determines, first, the rate of photosynthesis, but also the rate of plant growth. Root meristem activity is reduced with direct illumination but enhanced with increased sugar levels. With reduced cotyledon illumination, the seedling increases hypocotyl elongation until adequate light exposure is again provided. If endogenous carbon sources are limited, this leads to a temporary inhibition of root growth. Experimental growth conditions include exogenous supplementation of sucrose or glucose in addition to culturing seedlings under light exposure in Petri dishes. We compared total root length and hypocotyl elongation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> wild type <i>Col-0</i> in response to illumination status and carbon source in the growth medium. Overall, sucrose supplementation promoted hypocotyl and root length to a greater extent than glucose supplementation. Glucose promoted root length compared to non-supplemented seedlings especially when cotyledon illumination was greatly reduced.
