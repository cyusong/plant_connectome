The AP2/ERFs belong to a large family of transcription factors in plants. The AP2/ERF gene family has been identified as a key player involved in both biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants, however, no comprehensive study has yet been carried out on the AP2/ERF gene family in rose (Rosa sp.), the most important ornamental crop worldwide. The present study comprises a genome-wide analysis of the AP2/ERF family genes (RcERFs) in the rose, involving their identification, gene structure, phylogenetic relationship, chromosome localization, collinearity analysis, as well as their expression patterns. Throughout the phylogenetic analysis, a total of 131 AP2/ERF genes in the rose genome were divided into 5 subgroups. The RcERFs are distributed over all the seven chromosomes of the rose, and genome duplication may have played a key role in their duplication. Furthermore, Ka/Ks analysis indicated that the duplicated RcERF genes often undergo purification selection with limited functional differentiation. Gene expression analysis revealed that 23 RcERFs were induced by infection of the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Presumably, these RcERFs are candidate genes which can react to the rose's resistance against Botrytis cinerea infection. By using virus-induced gene silencing, we confirmed that RcERF099 is an important regulator involved in the B.cinerea resistance in the rose petal. Overall, our results conclude the necessity for further study of the AP2/ERF gene family in rose, and promote their potential application in improving the rose when subjected to biological stress.
