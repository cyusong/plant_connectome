Rice is very sensitive to salt stress at the seedling level, with consequent poor crop establishment. A natural variability in susceptibility to moderate saline environments was found in a group of six Italian temperate japonica rice cultivars, and the physiological determinants for salt tolerance were investigated. Cation (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>++</sup>) levels were determined in shoots from individual rice plantlets grown in the absence or in the presence of inhibitory, yet sublethal salt levels, and at increasing time after salt treatments. Significant variations were found among genotypes, but these were unrelated to the relative tolerance, which seems to result from neither mechanism(s) for reduced Na<sup>+</sup> translocation to the aerial part, nor its increased retrieval from the xylem mediating Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion from leaves. Accordingly, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels raised in leaf tissues of salt-treated seedlings, and osmo-induced proline accumulation was found in all genotypes. Data suggest that the difference in salt tolerance most likely depends on mechanisms for osmotic adjustment and/or antioxidative defence.
