['12324593', 'T-DNA insertional mutagenesis represents a promising approach to the molecular  isolation of genes with essential functions during plant embryo development. We  describe in this report the isolation and characterization of 18 mutants of  Arabidopsis thaliana defective in embryo development following seed  transformation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Random T-DNA insertion was  expected to result in a high frequency of recessive embryonic lethals because  many target genes are required for embryogenesis. The cointegrate Ti plasmid used  in these experiments contained the nopaline synthase and neomycin  phosphotransferase gene markers. Nopaline assays and resistance to kanamycin were  used to estimate the number of functional inserts present in segregating  families. Nine families appeared to contain a T-DNA insert either within or  adjacent to the mutant gene. Eight families were clearly not tagged with a  functional insert and appeared instead to contain mutations induced during the  transformation process. DNA gel blot hybridization with internal and right border  probes revealed a variety of rearrangements associated with T-DNA insertion. A  general strategy is presented to simplify the identification of tagged embryonic  mutants and facilitate the molecular isolation of genes required for plant  embryogenesis.', '1991 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.3.2.149', 'Meinke']
