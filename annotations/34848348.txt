Seed size critically affects grain yield of crops and hence represents a key breeding target. The development of embryo-nourishing endosperm is a key driver of seed expansion. We here report unexpected dual roles of the transcription factor EIN3 in regulating seed size. These EIN3 functions have remained largely undiscovered because they oppose each other. Capitalizing on the analysis of multiple ethylene biosynthesis mutants, we demonstrate that EIN3 represses endosperm and seed development in a pathway regulated by ethylene. We, in addition, provide evidence that EIN3-mediated synergid nucleus disintegration promotes endosperm expansion. Interestingly, synergid nucleus disintegration is not affected in various ethylene biosynthesis mutants, suggesting that this promoting function of EIN3 is independent of ethylene. Whereas the growth-inhibitory ethylene-dependent EIN3 action appears to be encoded by sporophytic tissue, the growth-promoting role of EIN3 is induced by fertilization, revealing a generation conflict that converges toward the key signaling component EIN3.

EIN3: !represses! endosperm and seed development
EIN3: !promotes! synergid nucleus disintegration
ethylene: !regulates! EIN3 repressing action
fertilization: !induces! EIN3 promoting action
