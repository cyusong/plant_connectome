Abiotic environmental stresses have a negative impact on the yield and quality of crops. Understanding these stresses is an essential enabler for mitigating breeding strategies and it becomes more important as the frequency of extreme weather conditions increases due to climate change. This study analyses the response of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to a heat wave during grain filling in three distinct stages: the heat wave itself, the return to a normal temperature regime, and the process of maturation and desiccation. The properties and structure of the starch produced were followed throughout the maturational stages. Furthermore, the key enzymes involved in the carbohydrate supply to the grain were monitored. We observed differences in starch structure with well-separated effects because of heat stress and during senescence. Heat stress produced marked effects on sucrolytic enzymes in source and sink tissues. Early cessation of plant development as an indirect consequence of the heat wave was identified as the major contributor to final yield loss from the stress, highlighting the importance for functional stay-green traits for the development of heat-resistant cereals.
