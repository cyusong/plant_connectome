['36401805', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the photoreceptor protein phytochrome B (phyB)  play a key role in plant acclimation to stress. However, how phyB that primarily  functions in the nuclei impacts ROS signaling mediated by respiratory burst  oxidase homolog (RBOH) proteins that reside on the plasma membrane, during  stress, is unknown. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa mutants, RNA-Seq,  bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and whole-plant ROS imaging were  used to address this question. Here, we reveal that phyB and RBOHs function as  part of a key regulatory module that controls apoplastic ROS production,  stress-response transcript expression, and plant acclimation in response to  excess light stress. We further show that phyB can regulate ROS production during  stress even if it is restricted to the cytosol and that phyB, respiratory burst  oxidase protein D (RBOHD), and respiratory burst oxidase protein F (RBOHF)  coregulate thousands of transcripts in response to light stress. Surprisingly, we  found that phyB is also required for ROS accumulation in response to heat,  wounding, cold, and bacterial infection. Our findings reveal that phyB plays a  canonical role in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, regulating  apoplastic ROS production, possibly while at the cytosol, and that phyB and  RBOHD/RBOHF function in the same regulatory pathway.', '2023 Mar', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.18626', 'ORCID:']
