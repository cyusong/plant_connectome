Contemporary reviews of leaf responses to sunflecks indicate gymnosperms exhibit slower photosynthetic inductions times than angiosperms, but the gymnosperms were represented exclusively by conifers. I recently reported that the gymnosperm Cycas micronesica exhibited photosynthetic induction times in conformity with some of the most rapid angiosperms and opined that representatives from non-conifer gymnosperms must be added to the published conifer database before gymnosperm-wide conclusions can be formulated. Guiding principles for this urgently needed research will maximize relevance and improve accuracy of conclusions.
