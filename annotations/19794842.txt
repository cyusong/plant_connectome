Although plants lack the mobile sentry cells present in animal innate immune systems, plants have developed complex innate immune reactions triggering basal resistance and the hypersensitive response (HR). Cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation is considered to be an important early event in this pathogen response signal transduction cascade. Plasma membrane (PM)-localized cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs) contribute to the cytosolic Ca(2+) rise upon pathogen perception. Recent work suggests that some PM-localized leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) may be involved in the perception of pathogen associated molecular pattern molecules and triggering some pathogen responses in plants, some of these LRR-RLKs might have cyclic nucleotide cyclase activity. The recognition of pathogens may be connected to cyclic nucleotide generation and the activation of CNGCs, followed by cytosolic Ca(2+) increase and downstream signaling events (possibly involving nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species (ROS), calmodulin (CaM), CaM-like protein (CML) and protein kinases). Notably, CaM or CML could be the crucial sensor downstream from the early Ca(2+) signal leading to nitric oxide (NO) production during plant innate immune responses.
