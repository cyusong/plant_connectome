The active structural change of actin cytoskeleton is a general host response upon pathogen attack. This study characterized the function of the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) actin-binding protein VILLIN2 (GhVLN2) in host defense against the soilborne fungus Verticillium dahliae. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that GhVLN2 possessed actin-binding, -bundling, and -severing activities. A low concentration of GhVLN2 could shift its activity from actin bundling to actin severing in the presence of Ca2+. Knockdown of GhVLN2 expression by virus-induced gene silencing reduced the extent of actin filament bundling and interfered with the growth of cotton plants, resulting in the formation of twisted organs and brittle stems with a decreased cellulose content of the cell wall. Upon V. dahliae infection, the expression of GhVLN2 was downregulated in root cells, and silencing of GhVLN2 enhanced the disease tolerance of cotton plants. The actin bundles were less abundant in root cells of GhVLN2-silenced plants than in control plants. However, upon infection by V. dahliae, the number of actin filaments and bundles in the cells of GhVLN2-silenced plants was raised to a comparable level as those in control plants, with the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton appearing several hours in advance. GhVLN2-silenced plants exhibited a higher incidence of actin filament cleavage in the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that pathogen-responsive downregulation of GhVLN2 could activate its actin-severing activity. These data indicate that the regulated expression and functional shift of GhVLN2 contribute to modulating the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in host immune responses against V. dahliae.
