Drought is a major challenge for agricultural production since it causes substantial yield reduction and economic loss. Autophagy is a subcellular degradation and recycling pathway that functions in plant development and responses to many stresses, including drought. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the function of autophagy and how autophagy is upregulated during drought stress. Autophagy helps plants to survive drought stress, and the mechanistic basis for this is beginning to be elucidated. Autophagy can selectively degrade aquaporins to adjust water permeability, and also degrades excess heme and damaged proteins to reduce their toxicity. In addition, autophagy can degrade regulators or components of hormone signaling pathways to promote stress responses. During drought recovery, autophagy degrades drought-induced proteins to reset the cell status. Autophagy is activated by multiple mechanisms during drought stress. Several transcription factors are induced by drought to upregulate autophagy-related gene expression, and autophagy is also regulated post-translationally through protein modification and stability. Based on these observations, manipulation of autophagy activity may be a promising approach for conferring drought tolerance in plants.
