['27986916', 'The major developmental significance of leaf senescence is the massive recycling  of nutrients from senescing leaves to nascent organs, including seeds, to meet  the requirement of their rapid development, so-called nutrient remobilization.  The efficiency of nutrient remobilization is associated with the activity of  diverse transporters. A large number of transporters are up-regulated during leaf  senescence in Arabidopsis, many of which participate in regulating leaf  senescence via different signaling pathways. Here, we report that a member of the  cation/Ca(2+) exchanger family, CCX1, is highly induced during leaf senescence in  Arabidopsis. Although single mutation of CCX1 did not change the senescence  phenotype, double mutation of CCX1 and CCX4 resulted in a subtle but significant  stay-green phenotype during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence, suggesting  that some members of the cation/Ca(2+) exchanger family act redundantly in  mediating leaf senescence. Consistently, overexpression of CCX1 accelerated leaf  senescence. Moreover, the ccx1ccx4 double mutant was more tolerant to H(2)O(2),  whereas CCX1-overexpressing lines showed an elevated response to H(2)O(2)  treatment, presumably due to an overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species  (ROS), indicating that CCX1 may promote leaf senescence via modulating ROS  homeostasis. Notably, both ccx1-1 and ccx1ccx4 were sensitive to Ca(2+)  deprivation, implying that CCX1 may also be involved in modulating Ca(2+)  signaling and consequently affecting the initiation of leaf senescence.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcw175', 'Kuai']
