['18599653', "The central cell of the female gametophyte plays a role in pollen tube guidance  and in regulating the initiation of endosperm development. Following  fertilization, the central cell gives rise to the seed's endosperm, which  nourishes the developing embryo within the seed. The molecular mechanisms  controlling specification and differentiation of the central cell are poorly  understood. We identified AGL61 in a screen for transcription factor genes  expressed in the female gametophyte. AGL61 encodes a Type I MADS domain protein,  which likely functions as a transcription factor. Consistent with this, an  AGL61-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. In  the context of the ovule and seed, AGL61 is expressed exclusively in the central  cell and early endosperm. agl61 female gametophytes are affected in the central  cell specifically. The morphological defects include an overall reduction in size  of the central cell and a reduced or absent central cell vacuole. When fertilized  with wild-type pollen, agl61 central cells fail to give rise to endosperm. In  addition, synergid- and antipodal-expressed genes are ectopically expressed in  agl61 central cells. The expression pattern and mutant phenotype of AGL61 are  similar to those of AGL80, suggesting that AGL61 may function as a heterodimer  with AGL80 within the central cell; consistent with this, AGL61 and AGL80  interact in yeast two-hybrid assays. Together, these data suggest that AGL61  functions as a transcription factor and controls the expression of downstream  genes during central cell development.", '2008 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.119404', 'Drews']
