['33946819', 'Arabidopsis contains eight different h-type thioredoxins (Trx) being distributed  in different cell organelles. Although Trx h2 is deemed to be confined to  mitochondria, its subcellular localization and function are discussed  controversially. Here, cell fractionation studies were used to clarify this  question, showing Trx h2 protein to be exclusively localized in microsomes rather  than mitochondria. Furthermore, Arabidopsis trxo1, trxh2 and trxo1h2 mutants were  analyzed to compare the role of Trx h2 with mitochondrial Trx o1. Under medium  light, trxo1 and trxo1h2 showed impaired growth, while trxh2 was similar to wild  type. In line with this, trxo1 and trxo1h2 clustered differently from wild type  with respect to nocturnal metabolite profiles, revealing a decrease in ascorbate  and glutathione redox states. Under fluctuating light, these genotypic  differences were attenuated. Instead, the trxo1h2 double mutant showed an  improved NADPH redox balance, compared to wild type, accompanied by increased  photosynthetic efficiency, specifically in the high-light phases. Conclusively,  Trx h2 and Trx o1 are differentially localized in microsomes and mitochondria,  respectively, which is associated with different redox-active functions and  effects on plant growth in constant light, while there is a joint role of both  Trxs in regulating NADPH redox balance and photosynthetic performance in  fluctuating light.', '2021 Apr 29', 'Antioxidants (Basel)', '10.3390/antiox10050705', 'Geigenberger']
