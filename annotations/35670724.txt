In winter-annual plants, exposure to cold temperatures induces cold tolerance and accelerates flowering in the following spring. However, little is known about plant adaptations to dehydration stress after winter. Here, we found that dehydration tolerance is reduced in winter-annual Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) after vernalization. Winter-annual Arabidopsis plants with functional FRIGIDA (FRI) exhibited high dehydration tolerance, with small stomatal apertures and hypersensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid. Dehydration tolerance and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) transcript levels gradually decreased with prolonged cold exposure in FRI plants. FLC directly bound to the promoter of OPEN STOMATA1 (OST1) and activated OST1 expression. Loss of FLC function resulted in decreased dehydration tolerance and reduced OST1 transcript levels. FLC and OST1 act in the same dehydration stress pathway, with OST1 acting downstream of FLC. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms by which FRI modulates dehydration tolerance through the FLC-OST1 module. Our results suggest that winter-annual Arabidopsis integrates dehydration tolerance and flowering time to adapt to environmental changes from winter to spring.
