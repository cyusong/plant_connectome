['21535471', 'The molecular mechanism for sensing and transducing the stress signals initiated  by K(+) deprivation in plants remains unknown. Here, we found that the expression  of AtHELPS, an Arabidopsis DExD/H box RNA helicase gene, was induced by low-K(+),  zeatin and cold treatments, and downregulated by high-K(+) stress. To further  investigate the expression pattern of AtHELPS, pAtHELPS::GUS transgenic plants  were generated. Histochemical staining indicated that AtHELPS is mainly expressed  in the young seedlings and vascular tissues of leaves and roots. Using both helps  mutants and overexpression lines, we observed that, in the low-K(+) condition,  AtHELPS affected Arabidopsis seed germination and plant weight. Interestingly,  the mRNA levels of AKT1, CBL1/9 and CIPK23 in the helps mutants were much higher  than in the overexpression lines under low-K(+) stress. Moreover, under low-K(+)  stress, the helps mutants displayed increased K(+) influx, whereas the  overexpression line of AtHELPS had a lower flux rate in the roots by the  noninvasive micro-test technique. Taken together, these results provide  information for the functional analysis of plant DEVH box RNA helicases, and  suggest that AtHELPS, as an important negative regulator, plays a role in K(+)  deprivation stress.', '2011 Jul', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08147.x', 'Zheng']
