Sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes maintain a biotrophic relationship with their hosts over a period of several weeks and induce the differentiation of root cells into specialized feeding cells. Nematode effectors, which are synthesized in the esophageal glands and injected into the plant tissue through the syringe-like stylet, play a central role in these processes. Previous work on nematode effectors has shown that the apoplasm is targeted during invasion of the host while the cytoplasm is targeted during the induction and the maintenance of the feeding site. A large number of candidate effectors potentially secreted by the nematode into the plant tissues to promote infection have now been identified. This work has shown that the targeting and the role of effectors are more complex than previously thought. This review will not cover the prolific recent findings in nematode effector function but will instead focus on recent selected examples that illustrate the variety of plant cell compartments that effectors are addressed to in order reach their plant targets.
