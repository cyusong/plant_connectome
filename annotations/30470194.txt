Drought stress has a negative effect on both seed yield and seed quality in Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola). Here we show that while drought impairs the maternal plant performance, it also increases the vigour of progeny of stressed maternal plants. We investigated the transgenerational influence of abiotic stress by detailed analysis of yield, seed quality, and seedling performance on a growth-related and metabolic level. Seeds of eight diverse winter oilseed rape genotypes were generated under well-watered and drought stress conditions under controlled-environment conditions in large plant containers. We found a decrease in seed quality in seeds derived from mother plants that were exposed to drought stress. At the same time, the seeds that developed under stress conditions showed higher seedling vigour compared to non-stressed controls.This effect on seed quality and seedling vigour was found to be independent of maternal plant yield performance. Drought stress has a positive transgenerational effect on seedling vigour. Three potential causes for stress-induced improvement of seedling vigour are discussed: (1) Heterotic effects caused by a tendency towards a higher outcrossing rate in response to stress; (2) an altered reservoir of seed storage metabolites to which the seedling resorts during early growth, and (3) inter-generational stress memory, formed by stress-induced changes in the epigenome of the seedling.
