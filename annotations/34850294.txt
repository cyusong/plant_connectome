MLP-PG1, identified in Cucurbita pepo, plays a crucial role in resistance against fungal pathogens through the induction of pathogenesis-related genes. MLP-PG1, a major latex-like protein (MLP) from zucchini (Cucurbita pepo), was identified as a transporting factor for hydrophobic organic pollutants. MLPs are members of the Bet v 1 family, similar to pathogenesis-related class 10 proteins (PR-10s). However, the biological functions of MLPs remain unclear. Herein, we show that MLP-PG1 induces the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and indirectly promotes resistance against pathogens. The activity of the MLP-PG1 promoter in leaves of transgenic tobacco plants was significantly enhanced by inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. However, MLP-PG1 did not induce direct resistance through RNase activity. Therefore, we examined the possibility that MLP-PG1 is indirectly involved in resistance; indeed, we found that MLP-PG1 induced the expression of defense-related genes. Overexpression of MLP-PG1 highly upregulated PR-2 and PR-5 and decreased the area of lesions caused by Botrytis cinerea in the leaves of transgenic tobacco plants. Our results demonstrate that MLP-PG1 is involved in indirect resistance against plant diseases, especially caused by fungal pathogens, through the induction of PR genes. This study is the first report to show the induction of PR genes by the expression of MLP from the RNA sequencing analysis and the involvement of MLP-PG1 in the resistance.
