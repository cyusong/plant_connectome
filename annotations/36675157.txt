4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) is not only involved in the biosynthetic processes of flavonoids and lignin in plants but is also closely related to plant tolerance to abiotic stress. UV irradiation can activate the expression of <i>4CL</i> genes in plants, and the expression of <i>4CL</i> genes changed significantly in response to different phytohormone treatments. Although the <i>4CL</i> gene has been cloned in potatoes, there have been fewer related studies of the 4CL gene family on the potato genome-wide scale. In this study, a total of 10 potato <i>4CL</i> genes were identified in the potato whole genome. Through multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis as well as gene structure analysis indicated that the potato 4CL gene family could be divided into two subgroups. Combined with promoter cis-acting element analysis, transcriptome data, and RT-qPCR results indicated that potato 4CL gene family was involved in potato response to white light, UV irradiation, ABA treatment, MeJA treatment, and PEG simulated drought stress. Abiotic stresses such as UV, ABA, MeJA, and PEG could promote the up-regulated expression of <i>St4CL6</i> and <i>St4CL8</i> but inhibits the expression of <i>St4CL5</i>. The above results will increase our understanding of the evolution and expression regulation of the potato 4CL gene family and provide reference value for further research on the molecular biological mechanism of 4CL participating in response to diverse environmental signals in potatoes.
