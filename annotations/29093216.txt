<i>BROWN PLANTHOPPER RESISTANCE14</i> (<i>BPH14</i>), the first planthopper resistance gene isolated via map-based cloning in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide binding site, leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein. Several planthopper and aphid resistance genes encoding proteins with similar structures have recently been identified. Here, we analyzed the functions of the domains of BPH14 to identify molecular mechanisms underpinning BPH14-mediated planthopper resistance. The CC or NB domains alone or in combination (CC-NB [CN]) conferred a similar level of brown planthopper resistance to that of full-length (FL) BPH14. Both domains activated the salicylic acid signaling pathway and defense gene expression. In rice protoplasts and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, these domains increased reactive oxygen species levels without triggering cell death. Additionally, the resistance domains and FL BPH14 protein formed homocomplexes that interacted with transcription factors WRKY46 and WRKY72. In rice protoplasts, the expression of FL BPH14 or its CC, NB, and CN domains increased the accumulation of WRKY46 and WRKY72 as well as WRKY46- and WRKY72-dependent transactivation activity. WRKY46 and WRKY72 bind to the promoters of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene <i>RLCK281</i> and the callose synthase gene LOC_Os01g67364.1, whose transactivation activity is dependent on WRKY46 or WRKY72. These findings shed light on this important insect resistance mechanism.
