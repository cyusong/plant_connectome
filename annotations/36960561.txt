Phosphorus deposition can stimulate both plant carbon inputs and microbial carbon outputs. However, how P enrichment affects soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of 642 SOC observations from 213 field P addition experiments world-wide and explored the regulations of plant inputs, microbial outputs, plant characteristics, and environmental and experimental factors on SOC responses. We found that, globally, P addition stimulated SOC by 4.0% (95% CI: 2.0-6.0%), but the stimulation only occurred in forest and cropland rather than in grassland. Across sites, the response of SOC correlated with that of plant aboveground rather than belowground biomass, suggesting that the change in plant inputs from aboveground was more important than that from belowground in regulating SOC changes due to P addition. Among multiple factors, plant N fixation status and mean annual temperature were the best predictors for SOC responses to P addition, with SOC stimulation being higher in ecosystems dominated by symbiotic nitrogen fixers and ecosystems in high-temperature regions like tropical forests. Our findings highlight the differential and ecosystem-dependent responses of SOC to P enrichment and can contribute to accurate predictions of soil carbon dynamics in a P-enriched world.
