The curry leaf tree, <i>Bergera koenigii</i>, is highly attractive to the Asian citrus psyllid, <i>Diaphorina citri</i>, which vectors the bacterial causative agent of citrus greening or huanglongbing disease. This disease has decimated citrus production in Florida and in other citrus-producing countries. As <i>D. citri</i> exhibits high affinity for feeding on young leaves of <i>B. koenigii</i>, transgenic <i>B. koenigii</i> expressing bacteria-derived pesticidal proteins such as Cry1Ba1 have potential for <i>D. citri</i> management when planted in or adjacent to citrus groves. Importantly, the plant pathogenic bacterium that causes citrus greening does not replicate in <i>B. koenigii</i>. Transgenic plants of <i>B. koenigii</i> were produced by insertion of the gene encoding the active core of the pesticidal protein Cry1Ba1 derived from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>. The transformation success rate was low relative to that of other citrus, at 0.89%. T-DNA integration into the genome and <i>cry1ba1</i> transcription in transgenic plants were confirmed. Transgenic plants expressing Cry1Ba1 differed from wild-type plants, differed in photosynthesis parameters and hormone levels in some instances, and a marked delay in wilting of detached leaves. The gut epithelium of <i>D. citri</i> fed on transgenic plants was severely damaged, consistent with Cry1Ba1-mediated pore formation, confirming expression of the pesticidal protein by transgenic <i>B. koenigii</i>. These results demonstrate that transgenic <i>B. koenigii</i> expressing bacteria-derived pesticidal proteins can be produced for potential use as trap plants for suppression of <i>D. citri</i> populations toward protection of citrus groves from citrus greening.
