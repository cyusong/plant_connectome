['12928436', 'Eukaryotic proteins containing a CAAX (A is aliphatic amino acid) C-terminal  tetrapeptide sequence generally undergo a lipid modification, the addition of a  prenyl group. Proteins that are modified by prenylation, such as Ras GTPases, can  be subsequently modified by a proteolytic event that removes a C-terminal  tripeptide (AAX). Two distinct proteases have been identified that are involved  in the CAAX proteolytic step, FACE-1/Ste24 and FACE-2/Rce1. These proteases have  different enzymatic properties, substrate specificities, and biological  functions. However, a proposal has been made that plants lack a FACE-2/Rce1-type  protease. Here, we describe the isolation of a cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana  that encodes a 311-aa protein with characteristics that are similar to the  FACE-2/Rce1 group of enzymes. Northern blot analysis demonstrates widespread  expression of this gene in plant tissues. Heterologous expression of the A.  thaliana cDNA in yeast restores CAAX proteolytic activity to yeast lacking native  CAAX proteases. The recombinant protein produced in this system displays an in  vivo substrate specificity profile distinct from AtSte24 and cleaves a  farnesylated CAAX tetrapeptide in vitro. These results provide evidence for the  existence of a previously unsuspected plant FACE-2/Rce1 ortholog and support the  evolutionary conservation of dual CAAX proteolytic systems in eukaryotes.', '2003 Oct 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M306700200', 'Freije']
