The viral infection process is a battle between host defense response and pathogen antagonizing action. Several studies have established a tight link between the viral RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) and the repression of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense responses, nonetheless host factors directly linking an RSS and the SA pathway remains unidentified. From yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified an interaction between the potyviral RSS helper-component proteinase (HCPro) and SA-binding protein SABP3. Co-localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses validated the direct in vivo interaction between Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) HCPro and the Arabidopsis homologue of SABP3, AtCA1. Additionally, transient expression of TuMV HCPro demonstrated its ability to act as a negative regulator of AtCA1. When the plants of the AtCA1 knockout mutant line were inoculated with TuMV, our results indicated that AtCA1 is essential to restrict viral spreading and accumulation, induce SA accumulation, and trigger the SA pathway. Unexpectedly, the AtCA1 overexpression line also displayed a similar phenotype, suggesting that the constitutive expression of AtCA1 antagonizes the SA pathway. Taken together, our results depict AtCA1 as an essential regulator of SA defense responses. Moreover, the interaction of potyviral HCPro with this regulator compromises the SA pathway to weaken host defense responses and facilitate viral infection.
