Drought is a major abiotic stress to rice (Oryza sativa) during growth. Ideal Plant Architecture (IPA1), the first cloned gene controlling the ideal plant type in rice, has been reported to function in both ideal rice plant architecture and biotic resistance. Here, we report that the IPA1/OsSPL14, encoding a transcriptional factor, positively regulates drought tolerance in rice. The IPA1 is constitutively expressed and regulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, abscisic acid, NaCl and polyethylene glycol 6000 treatments in rice. Furthermore, the IPA1-knockout plants showed much greater accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as measured by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine staining in leaves compared with WT plants. Yeast one-hybrid, dual-luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the IPA1 directly activates the promoter of SNAC1. Expression of SNAC1 is significantly down-regulated in IPA1 knockout plants. Further investigation indicated that the IPA1 plays a positive role in drought-stress tolerance by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice. Together, these findings indicated that the IPA1 played important roles in drought tolerance by regulating SNAC1, thus activating the antioxidant system in rice.
