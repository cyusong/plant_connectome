Understanding the functional role of bacterial genes in the persistence of <i>Salmonella</i> in plant organs can facilitate the development of agricultural practices to mitigate food safety risks associated with the consumption of fresh produce contaminated with <i>Salmonella</i> spp. Our study showed that <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. <i>enterica</i> serotype Typhimurium (strain MDD14) persisted less in inoculated tomato plants than other <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium strains tested (JSG210, JSG626, JSG634, JSG637, JSG3444, and EV030415; <i>P</i> < 0.01). In-vitro assays performed in limited-nutrient conditions (growth rate, biofilm production, and motility) were inconclusive in explaining the in-planta phenotype observed with MDD14. Whole-genome sequencing combined with non-synonymous single nucleotide variations analysis was performed to identify genomic differences between MDD14 and the other <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium strains. The genome of MDD14 contained a truncated version (123 bp N-terminal) of <i>yicC</i> and a mutated version of <i>rpoS</i> (two non-synonymous substitutions, i.e., G66E and R82C), which are two stress-induced proteins involved in iron acquisition, environmental sensing, and cell envelope integrity. The <i>rpoS</i> and <i>yicC</i> genes were deleted in <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium JSG210 with the Lambda Red recombining system. Both mutants had limited persistence in tomato plant organs, similar to that of MDD14. In conclusion, we demonstrated that YicC and RpoS are involved in the persistence of <i>Salmonella</i> in tomato plants in greenhouse conditions and, thus, could represent potential targets to mitigate persistence of <i>Salmonella</i> spp. in planta.
