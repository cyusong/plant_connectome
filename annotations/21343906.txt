['21343906', 'The protein kinase TOR (target-of-rapamycin) upregulates translation initiation  in eukaryotes, but initiation restart after long ORF translation is restricted by  largely unknown pathways. The plant viral reinitiation factor  transactivator-viroplasmin (TAV) exceptionally promotes reinitiation through a  mechanism involving retention on 80S and reuse of eIF3 and the host factor  reinitiation-supporting protein (RISP) to regenerate reinitiation-competent  ribosomal complexes. Here, we show that TAV function in reinitiation depends on  physical association with TOR, with TAV-TOR binding being critical for both  translation reinitiation and viral fitness. Consistently, TOR-deficient plants  are resistant to viral infection. TAV triggers TOR hyperactivation and S6K1  phosphorylation in planta. When activated, TOR binds polyribosomes concomitantly  with polysomal accumulation of eIF3 and RISP--a novel and specific target of  TOR/S6K1--in a TAV-dependent manner, with RISP being phosphorylated. TAV mutants  defective in TOR binding fail to recruit TOR, thereby abolishing RISP  phosphorylation in polysomes and reinitiation. Thus, activation of reinitiation  after long ORF translation is more complex than previously appreciated, with  TOR/S6K1 upregulation being the key event in the formation of  reinitiation-competent ribosomal complexes.', '2011 Apr 6', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2011.39', 'Ryabova']
