Tomato Atypical Receptor Kinase 1 (TARK1) is a pseudokinase required for postinvasion immunity. TARK1 was originally identified as a target of the <i>Xanthomonas euvesicatoria</i> effector protein <i>Xanthomonas</i> outer protein N (XopN), a suppressor of early defense signaling. How TARK1 participates in immune signal transduction is not well understood. To gain insight into TARK1's role in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) immunity, we used a proteomics approach to isolate and identify TARK1-associated immune complexes formed during infection. We found that TARK1 interacts with proteins predicted to be associated with stomatal movement. TARK1 CRISPR mutants and overexpression (OE) lines did not display differences in light-induced stomatal opening or abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure; however, they did show altered stomatal movement responses to bacteria and biotic elicitors. Notably, we found that TARK1 CRISPR plants were resistant to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pathovar tomato strain DC3000-induced stomatal reopening, and TARK1 OE plants were insensitive to <i>P</i> <i>syringae</i> pathovar tomato strain DC3118 (coronatine deficit)-induced stomatal closure. We also found that TARK1 OE in leaves resulted in increased susceptibility to bacterial invasion. Collectively, our results indicate that TARK1 functions in stomatal movement only in response to biotic elicitors and support a model in which TARK1 regulates stomatal opening postelicitation.
