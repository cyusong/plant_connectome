Our study showed that increases in seasonal productivity drive earlier autumn senescence of temperate trees. Norby argues that this finding is contradicted by observations from free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE) experiments, where elevated CO<sub>2</sub> has been found to delay senescence in some cases. We provide a detailed answer showing that the results from FACE studies are in agreement with our conclusions.

seasonal productivity: !drives! autumn senescence
CO<sub>2</sub>: !delays! senescence
FACE studies: !agree with! conclusions
