Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) catalyze the oxidization of polyphenols, which in turn causes the browning of the eggplant berry flesh after cutting. This has a negative impact on fruit quality for both industrial transformation and fresh consumption. Ten <i>PPO</i> genes (named <i>SmelPPO1</i>-<i>10</i>) were identified in eggplant thanks to the recent availability of a high-quality genome sequence. A CRISPR/Cas9-based mutagenesis approach was applied to knock-out three target <i>PPO</i> genes (<i>SmelPPO4, SmelPPO5</i>, and <i>SmelPPO6)</i>, which showed high transcript levels in the fruit after cutting. An optimized transformation protocol for eggplant cotyledons was used to obtain plants in which Cas9 is directed to a conserved region shared by the three <i>PPO</i> genes. The successful editing of the <i>SmelPPO4, SmelPPO5</i>, and <i>SmelPPO6</i> loci of <i>in vitro</i> regenerated plantlets was confirmed by Illumina deep sequencing of amplicons of the target sites. Besides, deep sequencing of amplicons of the potential off-target loci identified <i>in silico</i> proved the absence of detectable non-specific mutations. The induced mutations were stably inherited in the T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> progeny and were associated with a reduced PPO activity and browning of the berry flesh after cutting. Our results provide the first example of the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in eggplant for biotechnological applications and open the way to the development of eggplant genotypes with low flesh browning which maintain a high polyphenol content in the berries.
