['19098009', 'In plants, high capacity tonoplast cation/H(+) antiport is mediated in part by a  family of CAX (cation exchanger) transporters. Functional association between  CAX1 and CAX3 has previously been inferred; however, the nature of this  interaction has not been established. Here we analyze the formation of  "hetero-CAX" complexes and their transport properties. Co-expressing both CAX1  and CAX3 mediated lithium and salt tolerance in yeast, and these phenotypes could  not be recapitulated by expression of deregulated versions of either transporter.  Coincident expression of Arabidopsis CAX1 and CAX3 occurs during particular  stress responses, flowering, and seedling growth. Analysis of cax1, cax3, and  cax1/3 seedlings demonstrated similar stress sensitivities. When plants expressed  high levels of both CAXs, alterations in transport properties were evident that  could not be recapitulated by high level expression of either transporter  individually. In planta coimmunoprecipitation suggested that a protein-protein  interaction occurred between CAX1 and CAX3. In vivo interaction between the CAX  proteins was shown using a split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system and gel shift  assays. These findings demonstrate cation exchange plasticity through hetero-CAX  interactions.', '2009 Feb 13', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M804462200', 'Hirschi']
