['22353561', 'Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an important mRNA quality surveillance  pathway in all eukaryotes that eliminates aberrant mRNAs derived from various  sources. Three NMD factor proteins, UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3 are required for the NMD  process and were found to be also involved in certain stress responses in  mammalian and yeast cells. Using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants of UPF1 and UPF3  and UPF2-silenced lines (irUPF2), we examined the involvement of UPF1, UPF2, and  UPF3 in development and in response to stresses, wounding and infection by  Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000. Under the long (16 h) photoperiod  condition, Arabidopsis having a defect in NMD factors exhibited altered  morphologies of various organs, disturbed homeostasis of wounding-induced  jasmonic acid and pathogen-elicited salicylic acid, and abnormal wounding- and  methyl jasmonate-induced changes in the transcript levels of two defense-related  genes, LOX2 and VSP2. Importantly, when plants were cultivated under the short  (10 h) photoperiod condition, mutants of UPF1 and UPF3 and irUPF2 showed smaller  differences from the wild-type plants in growth and stress-induced responses.  These data suggest a complex regulatory network, likely composed of light  signaling and NMD factor-mediated pathways, in influencing plant development and  adaption to environmental stresses.', '2012 Feb', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2012.01093.x', 'Wu']
