Seedlings of wild-type and etiolate mutant plants of Anthurium andraeanum cultivar 'Sonate' were treated for 15 d with different light intensities (20, 100, and 400 µmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup>) to analyze leaf plastid development and pigment content. Significant changes appeared in treated seedlings, including in leaf color, plastid ultrastructure, chloroplast development gene AaGLK expression, chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents, and protoplast shape. Wild-type and etiolated plants exhibited different plastid structures under the same light condition. The results suggest that light intensity is a crucial environmental factor influencing plastid development and leaf color formation in the A. andraeanum cultivar 'Sonate'.
