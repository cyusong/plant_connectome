['16965555', 'We have used reverse-genetic analysis to investigate the function of MAP3K  epsilon 1 and MAP3K epsilon 2, a pair of closely related Arabidopsis thaliana  genes that encode protein kinases. Plants homozygous for either map3k epsilon 1  or map3k epsilon 2 displayed no apparent mutant phenotype, whereas the  double-mutant combination caused pollen lethality. Transmission of the  double-mutant combination through the female gametophyte was normal. Tetrad  analysis performed using the Arabidopsis quartet mutation demonstrated that the  pollen-lethal phenotype segregated at meiosis with the map3k epsilon 1;map3k  epsilon 2 genotype. We used transmission electron microscopy to determine that  double-mutant pollen grains develop plasma membrane irregularities following  pollen mitosis I. Analysis of the subcellular localization of a yellow  fluorescent protein (YFP):MAP3Kepsilon1 fusion protein using confocal microscopy  and biochemical fractionation indicated that a substantial portion of the  MAP3Kepsilon1 present in Arabidopsis cells is localized to the plasma membrane.  Taken together, our results suggest that MAP3Kepsilon1 is required for the normal  functioning of the plasma membrane in developing Arabidopsis pollen.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02863.x', 'Krysan']
