['17194765', 'Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana RING-ANK (for Really Interesting New  Gene-Ankyrin) family, a subgroup of RING-type E3 ligases, identified KEEP ON  GOING (KEG) as essential for growth and development. In addition to the RING-HCa  and ankyrin repeats, KEG contains a kinase domain and 12 HERC2-like repeats. The  RING-HCa and kinase domains were functional in in vitro ubiquitylation and  phosphorylation assays, respectively. Seedlings homozygous for T-DNA insertions  in KEG undergo growth arrest immediately after germination, suggestive of  increased abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, a major phytohormone that plays a key  role in plant development and survival under unfavorable conditions. Here, we  show that KEG is a negative regulator of ABA signaling. keg roots are extremely  sensitive to the inhibitory effects of ABA and exhibit hypersensitivity to  exogenous glucose, consistent with the known interaction between glucose and ABA  signaling. The observations that KEG accumulates high levels of ABSCISIC  ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) without exogenous ABA, interacts with ABI5 in vitro, and  that loss of ABI5 rescues the growth-arrest phenotype of keg mutant seedlings  indicate that KEG is required for ABI5 degradation. In this capacity, KEG is  central to ABA signaling by maintaining low levels of ABI5 in the absence of  stress.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.046532', 'Callis']
