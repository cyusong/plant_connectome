RACK1 is a scaffold protein with the ability to interact in a regulated manner with a diverse number of ligands from distinct signal-transduction pathways. This assessment allowed us to infer that it may be involved in different processes such as nodulation. In a recent study we showed by silencing, that PvRACK1 has a pivotal role in cell expansion and in symbiosome and bacteroid integrity during nodule development in Phaseolus vulgaris. On the other hand, we have also observed that its over-expression provokes a dramatic phenotype in: (a) seedlings that have been exposed to heat, in which systemic necrosis is induced; and (b) in Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed roots, where nodulation is strongly inhibited and nodules show early senescent symptoms. These findings indicate that PvRACK1 may be an integrator of diverse signal-transduction pathways in processes as varied as nodulation, cell expansion, heat stress responses, and systemic activation of necrosis.
