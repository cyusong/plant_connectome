Flesh color (FC), skin color (SC), and anthocyanin content (AC) are three important traits being used for commodity evaluation in purple-fleshed sweet potato. However, to date, only a few reports are available on the inheritance of these traits. In this study, we used a biparental mapping population of 274 F1 progeny generated from a cross between a dark purple-fleshed (Xuzishu8) and white-fleshed (Meiguohong) sweet potato variety for genetic analyses. Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation among AC, SC, and FC. Medium-to-high heritability was observed for these traits. We detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) with the average sequencing depth of 51.72 and 25.76 for parents and progeny, respectively. Then we constructed an integrated genetic map consisting of 15 linkage groups (LGS) of sweet potato spanning on 2,233.66 cm with an average map distance of 0.71 cm between adjacent markers. Based on the linkage map, ten major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated to FC, SC, and AC were identified on LG12 between 0 and 64.97 cm distance, such as one QTL for SC and FC, respectively, which explained 36.3 and 45.9% of phenotypic variation; eight QTLs for AC, which explained 10.5-28.5% of the variation. These major QTLs were highly consistent and co-localized on LG12. Positive correlation, high heritability, and co-localization of QTLs on the same LG group confirm the significance of this study to establish a marker-assisted breeding program for sweet potato improvement.
