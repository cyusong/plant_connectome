Plants have the potency to regenerate adventitious roots from aerial organs after detachment. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana, de novo</i> root regeneration (DNRR) from leaf explants is triggered by wounding signaling that rapidly induces the expression of the ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) transcription factors ERF109 and ABR1 (ERF111). In turn, the ERFs promote the expression of ASA1, an essential enzyme of auxin biosynthesis, which contributes to rooting by providing high levels of auxin near the wounding side of the leaf. Here, we show that the loss of the epigenetic regulator ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1), which interacts with Polycomb and Trithorax Group proteins, accelerates and reinforces adventitious root formation. Expression of <i>ERF109</i> and <i>ASA1</i> was increased in <i>ult1</i> mutants, whereas <i>ABR1</i> was not significantly changed. Cultivation of explants on media with exogenous auxin equates adventitious root formation in wild-type with <i>ult1</i> mutants, suggesting that ULT1 negatively regulates DNRR by suppressing auxin biosynthesis. Based on these findings, we propose that ULT1 is involved in a novel mechanism that prevents overproliferation of adventitious roots during DNRR.
