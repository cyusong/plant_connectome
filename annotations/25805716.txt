Towards the aim of examining the potential function of KORRIGAN (KOR), a highly conserved membrane-bound endoglucanase, in reproductive development, here transgenic evidence is provided that a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) endoglucanase, GhKOR1, plays significant roles in endosperm and embryo development. RNA interference (RNAi)- and co-suppression-mediated down-regulation of GhKOR1 resulted in smaller filial tissue and reduced seed weight, which were characterized by disrupted endosperm cellularization and delayed embryo development, leading to a delayed germination and a weak growth of seedlings early in development. The transgenic seeds exhibited fewer and smaller endosperm cells with irregular and brittle cell walls, and their embryos developed only to the globular stage at 10 days post-anthesis (DPA) when the wild-type endosperm has become highly cellularized and the embryo has progressed to the heart stage. The transgenic seed also displayed a significant reduction of callose in the seed coat transfer cells and reduced cellulose content both in the seed coat and in mature fibres. These findings demonstrate that GhKOR1 is required for the developmental of both seed filial and maternal tissues and the establishment of seedling vigour.
