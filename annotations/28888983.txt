['28888983', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana lysophospholipid acyltransferase At1g78690 acylates a  variety of lysophospholipids such as lyso phosphatidylglycerol, lyso  phosphatidylethanolamine and lyso phosphatidylserine. Despite di-acylate  phosphatidylglycerol being a substrate, overexpression of At1g78690 in  Escherichia coli leads to the accumulation of acyl-PG. Here we show that  cardiolipin also accumulates in cells overexpressing At1g78690. To help try and  explain this observation, we show, using a liquid chromatography mass  spectrometry (LC-MS) based assay, that At1g78690 utilizes both mono- and di-lyso  cardiolipin as an acyl acceptor. Because At1g78690 shares high homology ( approximately 40%)  with the cardiolipin remodeling enzyme tafazzin, we also tested whether At1g78690  was able to catalyze a tafazzin-like transacylation reaction. Di-linoleoyl  phosphatidylcholine was used as the acyl donor and mono-lyso cardiolipin was used  as the acyl acceptor in a reaction and the reaction was monitored by LC-MS. No  transfer of the linoleoyl chains was detected in an At1g78690 dependent manner  suggesting that, despite the strong homology, these enzymes catalyze unique  reactions.', '2017 Nov 4', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.09.021', 'Garrett']
