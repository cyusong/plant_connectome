Myo-inositol and its metabolic derivatives such as pinitol, galactinol, and raffinose affect growth and development and are also involved in stress adaptation. Previous studies have identified myo-inositol transporters (INTs) as transporters of Na<sup>+</sup> from root to shoot in the halophyte ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum). We found that the supply of myo-inositol could alleviate the dehydration effects of salt-stressed ice plant seedlings by decreasing the Na/K ratio in roots and increasing the Na/K ratio in shoots. Analyses of the uptake of exogenous myo-inositol revealed that ice plant seedlings contained intrinsic high-affinity transporters and inducible low-affinity uptake systems. The presence of Na<sup>+</sup> facilitated both high- and low-affinity myo-inositol uptake. Six INT genes were identified from the ice plant transcriptome and named McINT1a, 1b, 2, 4a, 4b, and 4c, according to the classification of the Arabidopsis INT family. In seedlings treated with myo-inositol, salt, or myo-inositol plus salt, the expression patterns of all McINT members differed in shoot and root, which indicates organ-specific regulation of McINTs by salt and myo-inositol. The expression of McINT2, 4a, 4b, and 4c was induced by salt stress in shoot and root, but that of McINT1a and 1b was salt-induced only in shoot. The expression of pinitol biosynthesis gene IMT1 was induced by salt and myo-inositol, and their combination had a synergistic effect on the accumulation of pinitol. Supply of myo-inositol to salt-treated seedlings alleviated the detrimental effects by maintaining a low root Na/K ratio and providing precursors for the synthesis of compatible solute to maintain the osmotic balance.
