Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) have been shown to play key regulatory roles in calcium signaling in plants. However, few bona-fide CMLs binding proteins have been characterized in rice, a monocot model plant. Here, through large-scale screening of a yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library with OsCML16 as a bait, six new putative interacting partners of OsCML16 were discovered and confirmed by both pairwise Y2H and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Interestingly, the in vitro peptide-binding assays manifested that OsERD2 could bind both OsCaM1 and OsCML16 whereas other five target proteins could specifically bind OsCML16 but not OsCaM1. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and TFP, a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist, were involved in the ABA-induced transcription of OsCML16 and its target genes, and they were also obviously induced by cold, drought, and salt stresses. Taken together, our new findings have provided the basis for the novel signaling pathways of OsCML16 in the abiotic stress response in rice.
