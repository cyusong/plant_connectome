Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that guide chemical modifications of structural RNAs, which are essential for ribosome assembly and function in eukaryotes. Although numerous snoRNAs have been identified in plants by high-throughput sequencing, the biological functions of most of these snoRNAs remain unclear. Here, we identified box C/D SnoR28.1s as important regulators of plant growth and development by screening a CRISPR/Cas9-generated ncRNA deletion mutant library in Arabidopsis thaliana. Deletion of the SnoR28.1 locus, which contains a cluster of three genes producing SnoR28.1s, resulted in defects in root and shoot growth. SnoR28.1s guide 2'-O-ribose methylation of 25S rRNA at G2396. SnoR28.1s facilitate proper and efficient pre-rRNA processing, as the SnoR28.1 deletion mutants also showed impaired ribosome assembly and function, which may account for the growth defects. SnoR28 contains a 7-bp antisense box, which is required for 2'-O-ribose methylation of 25S rRNA at G2396, and an 8-bp extra box that is complementary to a nearby rRNA methylation site and is partially responsible for methylation of G2396. Both of these motifs are required for proper and efficient pre-rRNA processing. Finally, we show that SnoR28.1s genetically interact with HIDDEN TREASURE2 and NUCLEOLIN1. Our results advance our understanding of the roles of snoRNAs in Arabidopsis.
