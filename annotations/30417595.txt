Recombination during meiosis plays an important role in genome evolution by reshuffling existing genetic variations into fresh combinations with the possibility of recovery of lost ancestral genotypes. While crossover (CO) events have been well studied, gene conversion events (GCs), which represent non-reciprocal information transfer between chromosomes, are poorly documented and difficult to detect due to their relatively small converted tract size. Here, we document these GC events and their phenotypic effects at an important locus in rice containing the SD1 gene, where multiple defective alleles contributed to the semi-dwarf phenotype of rice in the 'Green Revolution' of the 1960s. Here, physical separation of two defects allows recombination to generate the wild-type SD1 gene, for which plant height can then be used as a reporter. By screening 18 000 F<sub>2</sub> progeny from a cross between two semi-dwarf cultivars that carry these different defective alleles, we detected 24 GC events, indicating a conversion rate of ~3.3 × 10<sup>-4</sup> per marker per generation in a single meiotic cycle in rice. Furthermore, our data show that indels and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not differ significantly in GC rates, at least at the SD1 locus. Our results provide strong evidence that GC by itself can regain an ancestral phenotype that was lost through mutation. This GC detection approach is likely to be broadly applicable to natural or artificial alleles of other phenotype-related functional genes, which are abundant in other plant genomes.
