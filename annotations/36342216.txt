Integuments form important protective cell layers surrounding the developing ovules in gymno- and angiosperms. Although several genes have been shown to influence the development of integuments, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. In this work, we report that the Class II KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX II) transcription factors KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEBOX GENE 3 (KNAT3) and KNAT4 regulate integument development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). KNAT3 and KNAT4 were co-expressed in inflorescences and especially in young developing ovules. The loss-of-function double mutant knat3 knat4 showed an infertility phenotype, in which both inner and outer integuments of the ovule are arrested at an early stage and form an amorphous structure as in the bell1 (bel1) mutant. The expression of chimeric KNAT3- and KNAT4-EAR motif repression domain (SRDX repressors) resulted in severe seed abortion. Protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that KNAT3 and KNAT4 interact with each other and also with INNER NO OUTER (INO), a key transcription factor required for the outer integument formation. Transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of genes related with integument development is influenced in the knat3 knat4 mutant. The knat3 knat4 mutant also had a lower indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content, and some auxin signaling pathway genes were downregulated. Moreover, transactivation analysis indicated that KNAT3/4 and INO activate the auxin signaling gene IAA INDUCIBLE 14 (IAA14). Taken together, our study identified KNAT3 and KNAT4 as key factors in integument development in Arabidopsis.
