['15120068', 'Plastids are vital plant organelles involved in many essential biological  processes. Plastids are not created de novo but divide by binary fission mediated  by nuclear-encoded proteins of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. Although  several plastid division proteins have been identified in plants, limited  information exists regarding possible division control mechanisms. Here, we  describe the identification of GIANT CHLOROPLAST 1 (GC1), a new nuclear-encoded  protein essential for correct plastid division in Arabidopsis. GC1 is  plastid-localized and is anchored to the stromal surface of the chloroplast inner  envelope by a C-terminal amphipathic helix. In Arabidopsis, GC1 deficiency  results in mesophyll cells harbouring one to two giant chloroplasts, whilst GC1  overexpression has no effect on division. GC1 can form homodimers but does not  show any interaction with the Arabidopsis plastid division proteins AtFtsZ1-1,  AtFtsZ2-1, AtMinD1, or AtMinE1. Analysis reveals that GC1-deficient giant  chloroplasts contain densely packed wild-type-like thylakoid membranes and that  GC1-deficient leaves exhibit lower rates of CO(2) assimilation compared to  wild-type. Although GC1 shows similarity to a putative cyanobacterial SulA cell  division inhibitor, our findings suggest that GC1 does not act as a plastid  division inhibitor but, rather, as a positive factor at an early stage of the  division process.', '2004 May 4', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.031', 'Moller']
