Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent signalling processes enable plants to perceive and respond to diverse environmental stressors, such as osmotic stress. A clear understanding of the role of spatiotemporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in green algal lineages is necessary in order to understand how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling machinery has evolved in land plants. We used single-cell imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -responsive fluorescent dyes in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to examine the specificity of spatial and temporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the cytosol and flagella in response to salinity and osmotic stress. We found that salt stress induced a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation that was modulated by the strength of the stimulus and originated in the apex of the cell, spreading as a fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave. By contrast, hypo-osmotic stress induced a series of repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the cytosol that were spatially uniform. Hypo-osmotic stimuli also induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the flagella that occurred independently from those in the cytosol. Our results indicate that the requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in response to osmotic stress is conserved between land plants and green algae, but the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of osmotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in C. reinhardtii suggest important mechanistic differences between the two lineages.
