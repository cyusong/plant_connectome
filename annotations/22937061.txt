['22937061', 'The mitochondrial phosphate transporter (MPT) plays crucial roles in ATP  production in plant cells. Three MPT genes have been identified in Arabidopsis  thaliana. Here we report that the mRNA accumulations of AtMPTs were up-regulated  by high salinity stress in A. thaliana seedlings. And the transgenic lines  overexpressing AtMPTs displayed increased sensitivity to salt stress compared  with the wild-type plants during seed germination and seedling establishment  stages. ATP content and energy charge was higher in overexpressing plants than  those in wild-type A. thaliana under salt stress. Accordingly, the salt-sensitive  phenotype of overexpressing plants was recovered after the exogenous application  of atractyloside due to the change of ATP content. Interestingly, Genevestigator  survey and qRT-PCR analysis indicated a large number of genes, including those  related to gibberellin synthesis could be regulated by the energy availability  change under stress conditions in A. thaliana. Moreover, the exogenous  application of uniconazole to overexpressing lines showed that gibberellin  homeostasis was disturbed in the overexpressors. Our studies reveal a possible  link between the ATP content mediated by AtMPTs and gibberellin metabolism in  responses to high salinity stress in A. thaliana.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0043530', 'Zheng']
