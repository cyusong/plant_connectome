Arabidopsis prolyl 4 hydroxylases (P4Hs) catalyze an important post-translational modification in plants, though the only information on their patterns of expression is solely based on Arabidopsis microarray analysis data. In addition, the expression patterns of plants P4Hs in response to hypoxia, anoxia and other abiotic stresses such as mechanical wounding have never been studied extensively, despite their central role in hypoxic response of several other organisms through the regulation of stability of the HIF-1alpha transcription factor, the global regulator of hypoxic response. The 13 putative Arabidopsis P4Hs are low abundance transcripts with differential patterns of expression in response to two hypoxic, 1.5% and 5% O(2), anoxic conditions and mechanical wounding. Hypoxia of 1.5% O(2) induced the expression of six At-P4Hs while hypoxia of 5% O(2) and anoxia induced the expression of three and two At-P4Hs, respectively. Moreover, 308 Arabidopsis genes including 25 transcription factors were identified in silico among the differentially expressed genes under hypoxia that contain proline hydroxylation motifs. These results suggest involvement of this post-translational modification in the processing of hypoxia induced proteins providing an alternative level of regulation for responses to oxygen deficiency conditions.
