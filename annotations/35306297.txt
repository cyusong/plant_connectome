MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) transcription factors make up one of the largest protein families in plants. The TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling network plays a pivotal role in sugar metabolism and plant growth. In this article, we utilized grape (Vitis vinifera) calli to explore the relationship between VvMYB1 and VvTOR. By using yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter system, we speculated that there may be other proteins that help VvMYB1 and VvTOR promoter bond in grape calli, and the interaction action sites were located between the VvTOR 400-bp promoter fragment and the 1200-bp promoter fragment. The subcellular localization results suggest that VvMYB1 is found in the nucleus. Moreover, the expression level of VvTOR increased in the transgenic calli with overexpression of VvMYB1. These findings provide further evidence that VvMYB1 regulates VvTOR expression. We also found that overexpression of VvMYB1 increased glucose accumulation and affected expression of sugar-related genes. Our results suggest that there is a crosstalk between VvMYB1, VvTOR, and glucose accumulation.
