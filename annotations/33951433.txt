['33951433', 'The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING  FACTOR 7 (PIF7) is a central regulator that promotes stem growth by activating  growth-related gene expression during shade-avoidance responses. Studying the  co-factors of PIF7 can facilitate understanding of the mechanism of PIFs and  light signal transduction. Here, we describe the identification of two bHLH  transcription factors, bHLH48 and bHLH60 (bHLH48/bHLH60), as essential partners  for PIF7-dependent modulation of hypocotyl elongation and function downstream of  phytochrome B. These two bHLH factors display DNA binding activity and interact  with PIF7. Genetic analysis indicated that bHLH48/bHLH60 and PIF7 are  interdependent in promoting hypocotyl elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation  sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified the substantially overlapping  downstream targets of bHLH60 and PIF7. Biochemical analysis revealed that  bHLH48/bHLH60 enhance the DNA binding ability of PIF7. These results provide  evidence that bHLH48/bHLH60 act as positive partners of PIF7 for mutual benefit  in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation.', '2021 May 4', 'Cell Rep', '10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109054', 'Li']
