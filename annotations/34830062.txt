Many plant proteins with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domains play an important role in plant immunity. However, the role of one class of eLRR plant proteins-the simple eLRR proteins-in plant defenses against herbivores remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a simple eLRR protein OsI-BAK1 in rice localizes to the plasma membrane. Its expression was induced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of gravid females of brown planthopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> or white-backed planthopper <i>Sogatella furcifera</i> and treatment with methyl jasmonate or abscisic acid. Silencing <i>OsI-BAK1</i> (ir-<i>ibak1</i>) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (<i>OsWRKY24</i>, <i>OsWRKY53</i> and <i>OsWRKY70</i>) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene. Bioassays revealed that the hatching rate was significantly lower in BPH eggs laid on ir-<i>ibak1</i> plants than wild-type (WT) plants; moreover, gravid BPH females preferred to oviposit on WT plants over ir-<i>ibak1</i> plants. The exogenous application of ethephon on ir-<i>ibak1</i> plants eliminated the BPH oviposition preference between WT and ir-<i>ibak1</i> plants but had no effect on the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 acts as a negative modulator of defense responses in rice to BPH and that BPH might exploit this modulator for its own benefit.
