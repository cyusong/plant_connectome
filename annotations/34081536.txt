<i>Erwinia amylovora</i> is a plant pathogen causing necrotrophic fire blight disease of apple, pear, and other rosaceous plants. This bacterium colonizes host vascular tissues via the production of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) including amylovoran. It is well-established that the nearly ubiquitous plasmid pEA29 of <i>E. amylovora</i> is an essential virulence factor, but the underlying mechanism remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrated that pEA29 was required for <i>E. amylovora</i> to produce amylovoran and to form a biofilm, and this regulation was dependent on the thiamine biosynthesis operon <i>thiOSGF</i>. We then conducted carbohydrate and genetic analyses demonstrating that the thiamine-mediated effect on amylovoran production was indirect, as cells lacking <i>thiOSGF</i> produced an EPS that did not contain glucuronic acid, one of the key components of amylovoran, whereas the transcriptional activity and RNA levels of the amylovoran biosynthesis genes were not altered. Alternatively, addition of exogenous thiamine restored amylovoran production in the pEA29-cured strain of <i>E. amylovora</i> and positively impacted amylovoran production in a dose-dependent manner. Individual deletion of several chromosomal thiamine biosynthesis genes also affected amylovoran production, implying that a complete thiamine biosynthesis pathway is required for the thiamine-mediated effect on amylovoran production in <i>E. amylovora</i>. Finally, we determined that an imbalanced tricarboxylic acid cycle negatively affected amylovoran production, which was restored by addition of exogenous thiamine or overexpression of the <i>thiOSGF</i> operon. In summary, our report revealed a novel signaling pathway that impacts <i>E. amylovora</i> virulence in which thiamine biosynthesis enhances bacterial respiration that provides energetic requirements for the biosynthesis of EPS amylovoran.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
