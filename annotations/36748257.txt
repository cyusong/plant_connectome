In most flowering plants, the female germline is initiated in the subepidermal L2 layer of ovule primordia forming a single megaspore mother cell (MMC). How signaling from the L1 (epidermal) layer could contribute to the gene regulatory network restricting MMC formation to a single cell is unclear. We show that EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-like (EPFL) peptide ligands are expressed in the L1 layer, together with their ERECTA family (ERf) receptor kinases, to control female germline specification in Arabidopsis thaliana. EPFL-ERf dependent signaling restricts multiple subepidermal cells from acquiring MMC-like cell identity by activating the expression of the major brassinosteroid (BR) receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and the BR-responsive transcription factor BRASSINOZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1). Additionally, BZR1 coordinates female germline specification by directly activating the expression of a nucleolar GTP-binding protein, NUCLEOSTEMIN-LIKE 1 (NSN1), which is expressed in early-stage ovules excluding the MMC. Mutants defective in this gene regulatory network form multiple MMCs resulting in a strong reduction of seed set. In conclusion, we uncovered a ligand/receptor-like kinase-mediated signaling pathway acting upstream and coordinating BR signaling via NSN1 to restrict MMC differentiation to a single subepidermal cell.
