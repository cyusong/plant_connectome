['21658606', 'PYR1/PYL/RCAR proteins (PYLs) are confirmed abscisic acid (ABA) receptors, which  inhibit protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) upon binding to ABA. Arabidopsis thaliana  has 14 PYLs, yet their functional distinction remains unclear. Here, we report  systematic biochemical characterization of PYLs. A subclass of PYLs, represented  by PYL10, inhibited PP2C in the absence of any ligand. Crystal structures of  PYL10, both in the free form and in the HAB1 (PP2C)-bound state, revealed the  structural basis for its constitutive activity. Structural-guided biochemical  analyses revealed that ABA-independent inhibition of PP2C requires the PYLs to  exist in a monomeric state. In addition, the residues guarding the entrance to  the ligand-binding pocket of these PYLs should be bulky and hydrophobic. Based on  these principles, we were able to generate monomeric PYL2 variants that gained  constitutive inhibitory effect on PP2Cs. These findings provide an important  framework for understanding the complex regulation of ABA signaling by PYL  proteins.', '2011 Jun 10', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2011.05.011', 'Yan']
