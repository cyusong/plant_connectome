Potato, a cool-weather crop, emits volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which attract the specialist herbivore, Phthorimaea operculella, but also this herbivore's parasitic wasp, Trichogramma chilonis, an important biocontrol agent. What happens to this trophic system when heat stress challenges this agro-ecosystem? We studied how high temperature (HT) pre-treatments influence potato's VOC emissions and their subsequent effects on the preferences of insects, as evaluated in oviposition assays and Y-tube olfactometers. HT pre-stressed plants were less attractive to P. operculella adult moths, which were repelled by HT VOCs, but increased the recruitment of the parasitoid, T. chilonis, which were attracted. VOC emissions, including the most abundant constituent, ß-caryophyllene, were enhanced by HT treatments; some constituents elicited stronger behavioural responses than others. Transcripts of many genes in the biosynthetic pathways of these VOCs were significantly enhanced by HT treatment, suggesting increases in de novo biosynthesis. HT increased the plant's stomatal apertures, and exogenous applications of the hormone, ABA, known to suppress stomatal apertures, reduced leaf volatile emissions and affected the HT-altered plant attractions to both insects. From these results, we infer that HT stress affects this plant-insect interaction through its influence on VOC emissions, potentially decreasing herbivore ovipositions while increasing ovipositions of the parasitoid.
