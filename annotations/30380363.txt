In non-cyanogenic plants, cyanide is produced during ethylene biosynthesis and is mainly detoxified by the ß-cyanoalanine synthase CAS-C1. Arabidopsis plants lacking CAS-C1 show abnormal root hairs, which stop growing at early stages. Root hair elongates by polarized cell expansion at the tip, and we have observed that CAS-C1-driven GFP fluorescence locates in mitochondria and accumulates in root hair tips during root hair elongation. Genetic crosses have been performed between <i>cas-c1</i> plants and <i>scn1-1</i> mutants, defective in the <i>SCN1</i> protein that regulates the NADPH oxidase RHD2/AtrbohC, and between <i>cas-c1</i> and <i>rhd2-1</i>, defective in the NADPH oxidase necessary for the generation of ROS and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient necessary for root hair elongation. The phenotypic and molecular analysis of these crosses indicates that <i>cas-c1</i> is hypostatic to <i>scn1-1</i> and epistatic to <i>rhd2-1</i>. Furthermore, the action of cyanide in root hair development is independent of ROS and of direct NADPH oxidase inhibition by cyanide.
