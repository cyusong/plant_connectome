Lateral root (LR) development is a post-embryonic organogenesis event that gives rise to most of the underground parts of higher plants. Auxin promotes LR formation, but the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still not well understood. We analyzed LR formation induced by FUSCA3 (FUS3), a B3 domain transcription factor, which may function by promoting auxin biosynthesis during this process. We identified FUS3-interacting proteins that function in LR formation. In addition, we searched for the common targets of both FUS3 and its interacting protein. The role of their interactions in regulating auxin accumulation and LR initiation was examined. We identified LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) as an interacting factor of FUS3, and demonstrated that these two homologous B3 transcription factors interact to bind to the auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA4 (YUC4) and synergistically activate its transcription during LR formation. Furthermore, FUS3 expression is activated by LEC2 in LR initiation. The observations indicate that the FUS3-LEC2 complex functions as a key regulator in auxin-regulated LR formation. The results of this study provide new information for understanding the mechanisms of LR regulation.
