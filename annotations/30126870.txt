In plants, bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factors regulate diverse processes such as development and stress responses. However, few of these transcription factors have been functionally characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). In this study, we characterized the bZIP transcription factor gene <i>ZmbZIP4</i> from maize. <i>ZmbZIP4</i> was differentially expressed in various organs of maize and was induced by high salinity, drought, heat, cold, and abscisic acid treatment in seedlings. A transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that ZmbZIP4 functioned as a transcriptional activator. A genome-wide screen for ZmbZIP4 targets by immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that ZmbZIP4 could positively regulate a number of stress response genes, such as <i>ZmLEA2</i>, <i>ZmRD20</i>, <i>ZmRD21</i>, <i>ZmRab18</i>, <i>ZmNHX3</i>, <i>ZmGEA6</i>, and <i>ZmERD</i>, and some abscisic acid synthesis-related genes, including <i>NCED</i>, <i>ABA1</i>, <i>AAO3</i>, and <i>LOS5</i> In addition, <i>ZmbZIP4</i> targets some root development-related genes, including <i>ZmLRP1</i>, <i>ZmSCR</i>, <i>ZmIAA8</i>, <i>ZmIAA14</i>, <i>ZmARF2</i>, and <i>ZmARF3</i>, and overexpression of <i>ZmbZIP4</i> resulted in an increased number of lateral roots, longer primary roots, and an improved root system. Increased abscisic acid synthesis by overexpression of <i>ZmbZIP4</i> also can increase the plant's ability to resist abiotic stress. Thus, ZmbZIP4 is a positive regulator of plant abiotic stress responses and is involved in root development in maize.
