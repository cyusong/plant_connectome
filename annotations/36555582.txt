The loss of seed shattering is an important event in crop domestication, and elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying seed shattering can help reduce yield loss during crop production. This study is the first to systematically identify and analyse the BELL family of transcription factor-encoding genes in Chinese wild rice (<i>Zizania latifolia</i>). <i>ZlqSH1a</i> (Zla04G033720) and <i>ZlqSH1b</i> (Zla02G027130) were identified as key candidate genes involved in seed shattering in <i>Z. latifolia</i>. These genes were involved in regulating the development of the abscission layer (AL) and were located in the nucleus of the cell. Over-expression of <i>ZlqSH1a</i> and <i>ZlqSH1b</i> resulted in a complete AL between the grain and pedicel and significantly enhanced seed shattering after grain maturation in rice. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that 172 genes were differentially expressed between the wild type (WT) and the two transgenic (<i>ZlqSH1a</i> and <i>ZlqSH1b</i> over-expressing) plants. Three of the differentially expressed genes related to seed shattering were validated using qRT-PCR analysis. These results indicate that <i>ZlqSH1a</i> and <i>ZlqSH1b</i> are involved in AL development in rice grains, thereby regulating seed shattering. Our results could facilitate the genetic improvement of seed-shattering behaviour in <i>Z. latifolia</i> and other cereal crops.
