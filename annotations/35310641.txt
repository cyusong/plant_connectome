<i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, is one of the most traditional medicinal plants in the Lamiaceae family, and has been widely used to treat liver and lung complaints and as a complementary cancer treatment in traditional Chinese medicine. The preparation from its roots, called "Huang Qin," is rich in specialized flavones such as baicalein, wogonin, and their glycosides which lack a 4'-hydroxyl group on the B ring (4'-deoxyflavones), with anti-tumor, antioxidant, and antiviral activities. Baicalein has recently been reported to inhibit the replication of the COVID-19 virus. These 4'-deoxyflavones are found only in the order Lamiales and were discovered in the genus <i>Scutellaria</i>, suggesting that a new metabolic pathway synthesizing 4'-deoxyflavones evolved recently in this genus. In this review, we focus on the class of 4'-deoxyflavones in <i>S. baicalensis</i> and their pharmacological properties. We also describe the apparent evolutionary route taken by the genes encoding enzymes involved in the novel, root-specific, biosynthetic pathway for baicalein and wogonin, which provides insights into the evolution of specific flavone biosynthetic pathways in the mint family.
