['21276203', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, the serine/threonine protein kinase oxidative  signal-inducible 1 (OXI1), mediates oxidative stress signalling. Its activity is  required for full activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),  MPK3 and MPK6, in response to oxidative stress. In addition, the serine/threonine  protein kinase Pto-interacting 1-2 (PTI1-2) has been positioned downstream from  OXI1, but whether PTI1-2 signals through MAPK cascades is unclear. Using a yeast  two-hybrid screen we show that OXI1 also interacts with PTI1-4. OXI1 and PTI1-4  are stress-responsive genes and are expressed in the same tissues. Therefore,  studies were undertaken to determine whether PTI1-4 is positioned in the  OXI1/MAPK signalling pathway. The interaction between OXI1 and PTI1-4 was  confirmed by using in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments. OXI1 and PTI1-4  were substrates of MPK3 and MPK6 in vitro. Although no direct interaction was  detected between OXI1 and MPK3 or MPK6, in vitro binding studies showed  interactions between MPK3 or MPK6 with PTI1-4. In addition, PTI1-4 and MPK6 were  found in vivo in the same protein complex. These results demonstrate that PTI1-4  signals via OXI1 and MPK6 signalling cascades.', '2011 Apr', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08033.x', 'Hirt']
