['8771791', 'Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) proteins are putative transcription factors  encoded by a class of recently discovered homeobox genes as yet found only in  plants. This paper reports on the characterization of one of these genes, ATHB-7,  in Arabidopsis thaliana. ATHB-7 transcripts were present in all organs of the  plant at low levels, but expression was induced several-fold by water deficit,  osmotic stress as well as by exogenous treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), a  response being detectable at 10(-8) M and reaching a maximum at 10(-6) M ABA. The  ATHB-7 transcript was detected within 30 min after treatment with ABA and the  transcript level was rapidly reduced after removal of the hormone. The induction  of ATHB-7 was shown to be mediated strictly via ABA, since no induction of ATHB-7  was detectable in the ABA-deficient mutant aba-3 subjected to drought treatment.  Induction levels in two ABA-insensitive mutants abi2 and abi3 were similar to the  wild-type response. In the abi1 mutant, however, induction was impaired as  100-fold higher concentrations of ABA were required for a maximum induction as  compared with wild-type. In this mutant the ATHB-7 response was reduced also  after drought and osmotic stress treatments. These results indicate that ATHB-7  is transcriptionally regulated in an ABA-dependent manner and may act in a signal  transduction pathway which mediates a drought response and also includes ABI1.', '1996 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1996.10020375.x', 'Engstrom']
