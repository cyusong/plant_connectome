['11041878', 'Fumonisin B1 (FB1), a programmed cell death-eliciting toxin produced by the  necrotrophic fungal plant pathogen Fusarium moniliforme, was used to simulate  pathogen infection in Arabidopsis. Plants infiltrated with 10 microM FB1 and  seedlings transferred to agar media containing 1 microM FB1 develop lesions  reminiscent of the hypersensitive response, including generation of reactive  oxygen intermediates, deposition of phenolic compounds and callose, accumulation  of phytoalexin, and expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Arabidopsis  FB1-resistant (fbr) mutants were selected directly by sowing seeds on agar  containing 1 microM FB1, on which wild-type seedlings fail to develop. Two  mutants chosen for further analyses, fbr1 and fbr2, had altered PR gene  expression in response to FB1. fbr1 and fbr2 do not exhibit differential  resistance to the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola  (ES4326) expressing the avirulence gene avrRpt2 but do display enhanced  resistance to a virulent isogenic strain that lacks the avirulence gene. Our  results demonstrate the utility of FB1 for high-throughput isolation of  Arabidopsis defense-related mutants and suggest that pathogen-elicited programmed  cell death of host cells may be an important feature of compatible plant-pathogen  interactions.', '2000 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.10.1811', 'Ausubel']
