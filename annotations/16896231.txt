A plant-based system for continuous production of monoclonal antibodies based on the secretion of immunoglobulin complexes from plant roots into a hydroponic medium (rhizosecretion) was engineered to produce high levels of single-chain and full-size immunoglobulins. Replacing the original signal peptides of monoclonal antibodies with a plant-derived calreticulin signal increased the levels of antibody yield 2-fold. Cosecretion of Bowman-Birk Ser protease inhibitor reduced degradation of the immunoglobulin complexes in the default secretion pathway and further increased antibody production to 36.4 microg/g root dry weight per day for single-chain IgG1 and 21.8 microg/g root dry weight per day for full-size IgG4 antibodies. These results suggest that constitutive cosecretion of a protease inhibitor combined with the use of the plant signal peptide and the antibiotic marker-free transformation system offers a novel strategy to achieve high yields of complex therapeutic proteins secreted from plant roots.
