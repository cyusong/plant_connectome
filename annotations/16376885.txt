['16376885', 'Arabidopsis contains seven Kip-related protein (KRP) genes encoding CDK  (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitors (CKIs), which shares a restricted similarity  with mammalian p27Kip1. Here, we analyze the characteristics of the KRPs.  Although KRP1-KRP7 interact with active cyclin D2 (CYCD2)/CDKA and CYCD2/CDKB  complexes to a similar extent, they inhibit kinase activity to a different  extent. Our results suggest that inhibitory activity is related to the binding  ability between KRP proteins and cyclin/CDK complexes, but secondary and tertiary  structure may be also involved. These data provide the first evidence that KRPs  inhibit kinase activity associated with plant-specific CDKB.', '2006 Jan 9', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.12.018', 'Sekine']
