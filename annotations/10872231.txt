['10872231', "In addition to OPR1 and OPR2, two isoenzymes of 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, a  third isoform (OPR3) has recently been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)  Heynh. The expression of the OPR3 gene is induced not only by a variety of  stimuli, such as touch, wind, wounding, UV-light and application of detergent,  but also by brassinosteroids. The three enzymes were expressed in a functional  form in Escherichia coli, and OPR2 was additionally expressed in insect cell  cultures and overexpressed in A. thaliana. Substrate conversion was analyzed  using a stereospecific assay. The results show that OPR3 effectively converts the  natural (9S,13S)-12-oxophytodienoic acid [Km = 35 microM, Vmax 53.7 nkat (mg  protein)-1] to the corresponding 3-2(2'(Z)-pentenyl) cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid  (OPC-8:0) stereoisomer while OPR1 and OPR2 convert (9S,13S)-12-oxophytodienoic  acid with greatly reduced efficiency compared to OPR3. Thus, OPR3 is the  isoenzyme relevant for jasmonate biosynthesis.", '2000 May', 'Planta', '10.1007/s004250050706', 'Weiler']
