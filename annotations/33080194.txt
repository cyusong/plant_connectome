Oomycetes are notorious plant pathogens. It is known that genetically distinct oomycete strains can mate to increase their genetic diversity and virulence. A new paper finally reveals the genomic locus that may govern sexual compatibility in one oomycete species.

Genomic locus: !governs! Sexual compatibility 
Oomycete strains: !mate to! Increase genetic diversity and virulence
