['25653657', 'Proteins with glycine-rich signatures have been reported in a wide variety of  organisms including plants, mammalians, fungi, and bacteria. Plant glycine-rich  protein genes exhibit developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns.  Herein, we present the characterization of the AtGRDP2 gene using Arabidopsis  null and knockdown mutants and, Arabidopsis and lettuce over-expression lines.  AtGRDP2 encodes a short glycine-rich domain protein, containing a DUF1399 domain  and a putative RNA recognition motif (RRM). AtGRDP2 transcript is mainly  expressed in Arabidopsis floral organs, and its deregulation in Arabidopsis  Atgrdp2 mutants and 35S::AtGRDP2 over-expression lines produces alterations in  development. The 35S::AtGRDP2 over-expression lines grow faster than the WT,  while the Atgrdp2 mutants have a delay in growth and development. The  over-expression lines accumulate higher levels of indole-3-acetic acid and, have  alterations in the expression pattern of ARF6, ARF8, and miR167 regulators of  floral development and auxin signaling. Under salt stress conditions,  35S::AtGRDP2 over-expression lines displayed higher tolerance and increased  expression of stress marker genes. Likewise, transgenic lettuce plants  over-expressing the AtGRDP2 gene manifest increased growth rate and early  flowering time. Our data reveal an important role for AtGRDP2 in Arabidopsis  development and stress response, and suggest a connection between AtGRDP2 and  auxin signaling.', '2014', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2014.00782', 'Jimenez-Bremont']
