Hevea brasiliensis is a key commercial source of natural rubber (cis 1,4-polyisoprene). In H. brasiliensis, rubber transferase is responsible for cis-1,4-polymerization of isoprene units from isopentenyl diphosphate and thus affects the yield of rubber. Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of the rubber transferase gene at a molecular level. In this study we show that the 5'UTR intron of the promoter of the rubber transferase gene (HRT2) suppresses the expression of HRT2. A H. brasiliensis RING zinc finger protein (designated as HbRZFP1) was able to interact specifically with the HRT2 promoter to down-regulate its transcription in vivo. A 14-3-3 protein (named as HbGF14a) was identified as interacting with HbRZFP1, both in yeast and in planta. Transient co-expression of HbGF14a and HbRZFP1-encoding cDNAs resulted in HbRZFP1-mediated HRT2 transcription inhibition being relieved. HbGF14a repressed the protein-DNA binding of HbRZFP1 with the HRT2 promoter in yeast. We propose a regulatory mechanism by which the binding of HbGF14a to HbRZFP1 interferes with the interaction of HbRZFP1 with the HRT2 promoter, thereby repressing the protein-DNA binding between them. This study provides new insights into the role of HbGF14a in mediating expression of the rubber transferase gene in Hevea brasiliensis.
