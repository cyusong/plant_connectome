Localization of mRNAs at the subcellular level is an essential mechanism for specific protein targeting and local control of protein synthesis in both eukaryotes and bacteria. While mRNA localization is well documented in metazoans, somatic cells, and microorganisms, only a handful of well-defined mRNA localization examples have been reported in vascular plants and algae. This review summarizes the function and mechanism of mRNA localization and highlights recent studies of mRNA localization in vascular plants. While the emphasis focuses on storage protein mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells, information on targeting of RNAs to organelles (chloroplasts and mitochondria) and plasmodesmata is also discussed.
