The microbiome plays an important role in shaping plant growth and immunity, but few plant genes and pathways impacting plant microbiome composition have been reported. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the phosphate starvation response (PSR) was recently found to modulate the root microbiome upon phosphate (Pi) starvation through the transcriptional regulator PHR1. Here, we report that A. thaliana PHR1 directly binds to the promoters of rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) genes, and activates their expression under phosphate-starvation conditions. RALFs in turn suppress complex formation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) receptor through FERONIA, a previously-identified PTI modulator that increases resistance to certain detrimental microorganisms. Suppression of immunity via the PHR1-RALF-FERONIA axis allows colonization by specialized root microbiota that help to alleviate phosphate starvation by upregulating the expression of PSR genes. These findings provide a new paradigm for coordination of host-microbe homeostasis through modulating plant innate immunity after environmental perturbations.
