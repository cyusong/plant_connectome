['22039472', 'In photosynthesis in chloroplasts, two related regulatory processes balance the  actions of photosystems I and II. These processes are short-term,  post-translational redistribution of light-harvesting capacity, and long-term  adjustment of photosystem stoichiometry initiated by control of chloroplast DNA  transcription. Both responses are initiated by changes in the redox state of the  electron carrier, plastoquinone, which connects the two photosystems. Chloroplast  Sensor Kinase (CSK) is a regulator of transcription of chloroplast genes for  reaction centres of the two photosystems, and a sensor of plastoquinone redox  state. We asked whether CSK is also involved in regulation of absorbed light  energy distribution by phosphorylation of light-harvesting complex II (LHC II).  Chloroplast thylakoid membranes isolated from a CSK T-DNA insertion mutant and  from wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit similar light- and redox-induced  (32)P-labelling of LHC II and changes in 77 K chlorophyll fluorescence emission  spectra, while room-temperature chlorophyll fluorescence emission transients from  Arabidopsis leaves are perturbed by inactivation of CSK. The results indicate  indirect, pleiotropic effects of reaction centre gene transcription on regulation  of photosynthetic light-harvesting in vivo. A single, direct redox signal is  transmitted separately to discrete transcriptional and post-translational  branches of an integrated cytoplasmic regulatory system.', '2011', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0026372', 'Puthiyaveetil']
