<i>Kandelia obovata</i> is an important mangrove species extensively distributed in Eastern Asia that is susceptible to low-temperature stress. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) domain proteins are transcription factors (TFs) that play various roles in plant growth and development and in the plant response to environmental stresses. Nevertheless, genome-wide analyses of <i>K. obovata NAC</i> genes (<i>KoNACs</i>) and their responses to chilling stress have rarely been studied. The <i>KoNAC</i> gene family was identified and characterized using bioinformatic analysis, the subcellular location of some NAC proteins was confirmed using confocal microscopy analysis, and the <i>KoNACs</i> that responded to chilling stress were screened using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis. A total of 79 <i>KoNACs</i> were identified, and they were unequally distributed across all 18 chromosomes of <i>K. obovata</i>. The KoNAC proteins could be divided into 16 subgroups according to the phylogenetic tree based on NAC family members of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The <i>KoNACs</i> exhibited greater synteny with <i>A. thaliana</i> sequences than with <i>Oryza sativa</i> sequences, indicating that <i>KoNACs</i> underwent extensive evolution after the divergence of dicotyledons and monocotyledons. Segmental duplication was the main driving force of the expansions of <i>KoNAC</i> genes. Confocal microscopy analysis verified that the four randomly selected KoNACs localized to the nucleus, indicating the accuracy of the bioinformatic predictions. Tissue expression pattern analysis demonstrated that some <i>KoNAC</i> genes showed tissue-specific expression, suggesting that these <i>KoNACs</i> might be important for plant development and growth. Additionally, the expression levels of 19 <i>KoNACs</i> were significantly (15 positively and 4 negatively) induced by cold treatment, demonstrating that these <i>KoNACs</i> might play important roles during cold stress responses and might be candidate genes for the genetic engineering of <i>K. obovata</i> with enhanced chilling stress tolerance. Coexpression network analysis revealed that 381 coexpressed pairs (between 13 <i>KoNACs</i> and 284 other genes) were significantly correlated. Seventy-nine <i>KoNACs</i> were identified in <i>K. obovata</i>, nineteen of which displayed chilling-induced expression patterns. These genes may serve as candidates for functional analyses of <i>KoNACs</i> engaged in chilling stress. Our results lay the foundation for evolutionary analyses of <i>KoNACs</i> and their molecular mechanisms in response to environmental stress.
