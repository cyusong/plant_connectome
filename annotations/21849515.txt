['21849515', 'Exine, the outer plant pollen wall, has elaborate species-specific patterns,  provides a protective barrier for male gametophytes, and serves as a mediator of  strong and species-specific pollen-stigma adhesion. Exine is made of  sporopollenin, a material remarkable for its strength, elasticity, and chemical  durability. The chemical nature of sporopollenin, as well as the developmental  mechanisms that govern its assembly into diverse patterns in different species,  are poorly understood. Here, we describe a simple yet effective genetic screen in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that was undertaken to advance our  understanding of sporopollenin synthesis and exine assembly. This screen led to  the recovery of mutants with a variety of defects in exine structure, including  multiple mutants with novel phenotypes. Fifty-six mutants were selected for  further characterization and are reported here. In 14 cases, we have mapped  defects to specific genes, including four with previously demonstrated or  suggested roles in exine development (MALE STERILITY2, CYP703A2, ANTHER-SPECIFIC  PROTEIN6, TETRAKETIDE alpha-PYRONE REDUCTASE/DIHYDROFLAVONOL-4-REDUCTASE-LIKE1), and  a number of genes that have not been implicated in exine production prior to this  screen (among them, fatty acid omega-hydroxylase CYP704B1, putative glycosyl  transferases At1g27600 and At1g33430, 4-coumarate-coenzyme A ligase 4CL3,  polygalacturonase QUARTET3, novel gene At5g58100, and nucleotide-sugar  transporter At5g65000). Our study illustrates that morphological screens of  pollen can be extremely fruitful in identifying previously unknown exine genes  and lays the foundation for biochemical, developmental, and evolutionary studies  of exine production.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.179523', 'Preuss']
