['28923956', 'N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is an internal, reversible nucleotide modification  that constitutes an important regulatory mechanism in RNA biology. Unlike mammals  and yeast, no component of the m(6)A cellular machinery has been described in  plants at present. m(6)A has been identified in the genomic RNAs of diverse  mammalian viruses and, additionally, viral infection was found to be modulated by  the abundance of m(6)A in viral RNAs. Here we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana  protein atALKBH9B (At2g17970) is a demethylase that removes m(6)A from  single-stranded RNA molecules in vitro. atALKBH9B accumulates in cytoplasmic  granules, which colocalize with siRNA bodies and associate with P bodies,  suggesting that atALKBH9B m(6)A demethylase activity could be linked to mRNA  silencing and/or mRNA decay processes. Moreover, we identified the presence of  m(6)A in the genomes of two members of the Bromoviridae family, alfalfa mosaic  virus (AMV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). The demethylation activity of  atALKBH9B affected the infectivity of AMV but not of CMV, correlating with the  ability of atALKBH9B to interact (or not) with their coat proteins. Suppression  of atALKBH9B increased the relative abundance of m(6)A in the AMV genome,  impairing the systemic invasion of the plant, while not having any effect on CMV  infection. Our findings suggest that, as recently found in animal viruses, m(6)A  modification may represent a plant regulatory strategy to control  cytoplasmic-replicating RNA viruses.', '2017 Oct 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1703139114', 'ORCID:']
