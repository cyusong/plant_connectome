In our recent paper in Plant Physiology, we have reported the identification and functional characterization of a unique regulator, SHW1, a serine-arginine-aspartate rich protein in Arabidopsis seedling development.1 Genetic and molecular analyses have revealed that SHW1 functions in an independent and interdependent manner with COP1, and differentially regulates photomorphogenic growth and light regulated gene expression. Here, we show the involvement of photoreceptors in the function of SHW1. Our results have further revealed that SHW1 is a common regulator of light and ABA signaling pathways. These results along with some data described in Plant Physiology paper have been discussed here in a broader perspective.
