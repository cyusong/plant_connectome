Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae poses a major threat to rice production worldwide. The utilization of host resistance (R) genes is considered to be the most effective and economic means to control rice blast. Here, we show that the japonica landrace Yangmaogu (YMG) displays a broader spectrum of resistance to blast isolates than other previously reported broad-spectrum resistant (BSR) cultivars. Genetic analysis suggested that YMG contains at least three major R genes. One gene, Pi64, which exhibits resistance to indica-sourced isolate CH43 and several other isolates, was mapped to a 43-kb interval on chromosome 1 of YMG. Two open reading frames (NBS-1 and NBS-2) encoding nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins were short-listed as candidate genes for Pi64. Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into three susceptible japonica cultivars. Only transformants with NBS-2 conferred resistance to leaf and neck blast, validating the idea that NBS-2 represents the functional Pi64 gene. Pi64 is constitutively expressed at all development stages and in all tissues examined. Pi64 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars.
