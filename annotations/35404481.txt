Autophagy is a conserved degradation pathway that delivers dysfunctional cellular organelles or other cytosol components to degradative vesicular structures (vacuoles in plants and yeasts, lysosomes in mammals) for degradation and recycling. Viruses are intracellular parasites that hijack their host to live. Research on regulation of the trade-off between plant cells and viruses has indicated that autophagy is an integral part of the host response to virus infection. Meanwhile, plants have evolved a diverse array of defense responses to counter pathogenic viruses. In this review, we focus on the roles of autophagy in plant virus infection and offer a glimpse of recent advances about how plant viruses evade autophagy or manipulate host autophagy pathways to complete their replication cycle.

Autophagy: !delivers! dysfunctional cellular organelles
Viruses: !hijack! host
Plants: !evolve! defense responses
Viruses: !evade! autophagy
Viruses: !manipulate! host autophagy pathways
