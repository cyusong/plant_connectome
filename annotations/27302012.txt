Cell fate determination is a critical step of plant morphogenesis. Root hair and trichome formation is a good model for studying cell fate determination. The gene CAPRICE (CPC) encodes an R3 type MYB transcription factor, promotes root hair formation, and inhibits trichome formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The CPC homologous gene CPC LIKE MYB3 (CPL3) encoded 66% similar amino acid sequence to CPC, and it also possessed a cell-to-cell movement WxM motif. CPC protein moves from non-hair cells to neighboring root hair forming cells and induces root hair formation in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells. In this study, to investigate the function and cell-to-cell movement ability of CPL3, we generated CPC:CPL3:GFP transgenic plants to compare against CPL3:CPL3:GFP transgenic plants. CPC:CPL3:GFP transgenic plants showed no-trichome and many root-hair phenotypes, confirming similar function of CPL3 to CPC in root hair and trichome cell fate determination. However, CPL3:GFP fusion protein localized exclusively in non-hair cells in CPC:CPL3:GFP transgenic plants. Collectively, our results suggest that the CPL3 protein does not have cell-to-cell movement ability. Our findings indicate that the CPC family includes a movement protein and a protein that does not move. We believe our results provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism that mediates epidermal cell fate determination.
