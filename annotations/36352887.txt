Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are primarily recognized as non-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with low coding potential and are present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Recent findings reveal that lncRNAs can code for micropeptides in various species. Micropeptides are generated from small open reading frames (smORFs) and have been discovered frequently in short mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, such as lncRNAs, circular RNAs, and pri-miRNAs. The most accepted definition of a smORF is an ORF containing fewer than 100 codons, and ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry are the most prevalent experimental techniques used to identify them. Although the majority of micropeptides perform critical roles throughout plant developmental processes and stress conditions, only a handful of their functions have been verified to date. Even though more research is being directed toward identifying micropeptides, there is still a dearth of information regarding these peptides in plants. This review outlines the lncRNA-encoded peptides, the evolutionary roles of such peptides in plants, and the techniques used to identify them. It also describes the functions of the pri-miRNA and circRNA-encoded peptides that have been identified in plants.
