The ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) plays a central role in light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis. However, the upstream regulatory factors of COP1 remain poorly understood, particularly in horticultural plants. Here, we identified an MdCOP1-interacting protein, BROAD-COMPLEX, TRAMTRACK AND BRIC A BRAC2 (MdBT2), in apple (Malus domestica). MdBT2 is a BTB protein that directly interacts with and stabilizes MdCOP1 by inhibiting self-ubiquitination. Fluorescence observation and cell fractionation assays showed that MdBT2 increased the abundance of MdCOP1 in the nucleus. Moreover, a series of phenotypic analyses indicated that MdBT2 promoted MdCOP1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the MdMYB1 transcription factor, inhibiting the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and anthocyanin accumulation. Overall, our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which MdBT2 positively regulates MdCOP1, providing insight into MdCOP1-mediated anthocyanin biosynthesis.
