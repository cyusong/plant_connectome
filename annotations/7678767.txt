['7678767', 'Two cDNA clones, ATCKA1 and ATCKA2, encoding casein kinase II (CKII) catalytic  subunits, were cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana and their nucleotide sequences  were determined. Both cDNAs contain 999 bp open reading frames and are 94%  identical on the amino acid sequence level. The deduced amino acid sequences of  ATCKA1 and ATCKA2 are very similar to that of the human CKII catalytic alpha  subunit (72% homology). Northern blot analysis indicates that the ATCKA1 and  ATCKA2 mRNAs are present in all plant organs, but that ATCKA1 transcript levels  are quite low compared to those of ATCKA2. Genomic Southern blot analysis  suggests that there are at least three CKII genes in the A. thaliana genome. We  expressed the ATCKA1 and ATCKA2 cDNAs in Escherichia coli using a pET vector  derivative and analyzed the expressed protein in vitro. The expressed ATCKA1  protein phosphorylated casein using either ATP or GTP. This activity was  inhibited by heparin, indicating that the expressed protein has activity similar  to those reported for animal and yeast CKII.', '1993 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00019944', 'Shinozaki']
