Branch position in the moss Physcomitrella patens is regulated by blue light. In this study, fluence rate dependency of branch position determination was investigated by partial cell irradiation with a microbeam. With a 30 Wm(-2) or lower fluence rate, branches formed at the microbeam area, but formed outside the microbeam when the fluence rate was raised to > or = 200 Wm(-2). Thus, both weak and strong light responses influence the determination of branch position. Further, light sensitivity of both responses was reduced in phototropin knock-out lines, revealing an involvement of phototropin as the blue light receptor.

Blue light: !regulates! Branch position
Fluence rate: !influences! Branch position
Weak light response: !influences! Branch position
Strong light response: !influences! Branch position
Phototropin: !involves! Light sensitivity
Phototropin knock-out lines: !reduces! Light sensitivity
