Gene expression regulation plays an important role in controlling plant phenotypes and adaptation. Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of gene expression variation through the transcriptome analyses of a large maize-teosinte experimental population. Genome-wide mapping identified 25 660 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 17 311 genes, capturing an unprecedented range of expression variation. We found that local eQTL were more frequently mapped to adjacent genes, displaying a mode of expression piggybacking, which consequently created co-regulated gene clusters. Genes within the co-regulated gene clusters tend to have relevant functions and shared chromatin modifications. Distant eQTL formed 125 significant distant eQTL hotspots with their targets significantly enriched in specific functional categories. By integrating different sources of information, we identified putative trans- regulators for a variety of metabolic pathways. We demonstrated that the bHLH transcription factor R1 and hexokinase HEX9 might act as crucial regulators for flavonoid biosynthesis and glycolysis, respectively. Moreover, we showed that domestication or improvement has significantly affected global gene expression, with many genes targeted by selection. Of particular interest, the Bx genes for benzoxazinoid biosynthesis may have undergone coordinated cis-regulatory divergence between maize and teosinte, and a transposon insertion that inactivates Bx12 was under strong selection as maize spread into temperate environments with a distinct herbivore community.
