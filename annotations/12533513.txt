['12533513', 'Plants possess several photoreceptors to sense the light environment. In  Arabidopsis cryptochromes and phytochromes play roles in photomorphogenesis and  in the light input pathways that synchronize the circadian clock with the  external world. We have identified SRR1 (sensitivity to red light reduced), a  gene that plays an important role in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated light  signaling. The recessive srr1 null allele and phyB mutants display a number of  similar phenotypes indicating that SRR1 is required for normal phyB signaling.  Genetic analysis suggests that SRR1 works both in the phyB pathway but also  independently of phyB. srr1 mutants are affected in multiple outputs of the  circadian clock in continuous light conditions, including leaf movement and  expression of the clock components, CCA1 and TOC1. Clock-regulated gene  expression is also impaired during day-night cycles and in constant darkness. The  circadian phenotypes of srr1 mutants in all three conditions suggest that SRR1  activity is required for normal oscillator function. The SRR1 gene was identified  and shown to code for a protein conserved in numerous eukaryotes including  mammals and flies, implicating a conserved role for this protein in both the  animal and plant kingdoms.', '2003 Jan 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.244103', 'Fankhauser']
