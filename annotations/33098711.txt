Rapid and widespread evolution of multiple herbicide resistance in global weed species endowed by increased capacity to metabolize (degrade) herbicides (metabolic resistance) is a great threat to herbicide sustainability and global food production. Metabolic resistance in the economically damaging crop weed species Lolium rigidum is well known but a molecular understanding has been lacking. We purified a metabolic resistant (R) subset from a field evolved R L. rigidum population. The R, the herbicide susceptible (S) and derived F<sub>2</sub> populations were used for candidate herbicide resistance gene discovery by RNA sequencing. A P450 gene CYP81A10v7 was identified with higher expression in R vs. S plants. Transgenic rice overexpressing this Lolium CYP81A10v7 gene became highly resistant to acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase- and acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides (diclofop-methyl, tralkoxydim, chlorsulfuron) and moderately resistant to hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-inhibiting herbicide (mesotrione), photosystem II-inhibiting herbicides (atrazine and chlorotoluron) and the tubulin-inhibiting herbicide trifluralin. This wide cross-resistance profile to many dissimilar herbicides in CYP81A10v7 transgenic rice generally reflects what is evident in the R L. rigidum. This report clearly showed that a single P450 gene in a cross-pollinated weed species L. rigidum confers resistance to herbicides of at least five modes of action across seven herbicide chemistries.
