['16648216', 'The chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex is involved in photosystem I  cyclic electron transport and chlororespiration in higher plants. An Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) chlororespiratory reduction 6 (crr6) mutant lacking NDH  activity was identified by means of chlorophyll fluorescence imaging.  Accumulation of the NDH complex was impaired in crr6. Physiological  characterization of photosynthetic electron transport indicated the specific  defect of the NDH complex in crr6. In contrast to the CRR7 protein that was  recently identified as a potential novel subunit of the NDH complex by means of  the same screening, the CRR6 protein was stable under the crr2 mutant background  in which the NDH complex does not accumulate. The CRR6 gene (At2g47910) encodes a  novel protein without any known motif. Although CRR6 does not have any  transmembrane domains, it is localized in the thylakoid membrane fraction of the  chloroplast. CRR6 is conserved in phototrophs, including cyanobacteria, from  which the chloroplast NDH complex has evolutionally originated, but not in  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which the NDH complex is absent. We believe that  CRR6 is a novel specific factor for the assembly or stabilization of the NDH  complex.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.080267', 'Shikanai']
