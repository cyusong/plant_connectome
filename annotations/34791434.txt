['34791434', 'In eukaryotes, general mRNA decay requires the decapping complex. The activity of  this complex depends on its catalytic subunit, DECAPPING2 (DCP2), and its  interaction with decapping enhancers, including its main partner DECAPPING1  (DCP1). Here, we report that in Arabidopsis thaliana, DCP1 also interacts with a  NYN domain endoribonuclease, hence named DCP1-ASSOCIATED NYN ENDORIBONUCLEASE 1  (DNE1). Interestingly, we found DNE1 predominantly associated with DCP1, but not  with DCP2, and reciprocally, suggesting the existence of two distinct protein  complexes. We also showed that the catalytic residues of DNE1 are required to  repress the expression of mRNAs in planta upon transient expression. The  overexpression of DNE1 in transgenic lines led to growth defects and a similar  gene deregulation signature than inactivation of the decapping complex. Finally,  the combination of dne1 and dcp2 mutations revealed a functional redundancy  between DNE1 and DCP2 in controlling phyllotactic pattern formation. Our work  identifies DNE1, a hitherto unknown DCP1 protein partner highly conserved in the  plant kingdom and identifies its importance for developmental robustness.', '2022 Feb 4', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiab529', 'ORCID:']
