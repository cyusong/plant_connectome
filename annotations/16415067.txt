The Arabidopsis FAD7 gene encodes a plastid omega-3 fatty acid desaturase that catalyzes the desaturation of dienoic fatty acids to trienoic fatty acids in chloroplast membrane lipids. The expression of FAD7 was rapidly and locally induced by ozone exposure, which causes oxidative responses equivalent to pathogen-induced hypersensitive responses and subsequently activates various defense-related genes. This induction was reduced in salicylic acid (SA)-deficient NahG plants expressing SA hydroxylase, but was unaffected in etr1 and jar1 mutants, which are insensitive to ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA), respectively. The SA dependence of the FAD7 induction was confirmed by the exogenous application of SA. SA-induced expression of FAD7 in the npr1 mutant which is defective in an SA signaling pathway occurred to the same extent as in the wild type. Furthermore, in the sid2 mutant which lacks an enzyme required for SA biosynthesis, the expression of FAD7 was induced by ozone exposure. These results suggest that the ozone-induced expression of FAD7 gene requires SA, but not ethylene, JA, NPR1 and SID2.
