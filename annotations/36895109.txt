Imaging has long supported our ability to understand the inner life of plants, their development, and response to a dynamic environment. While optical microscopy remains the core tool for imaging, a suite of novel technologies is now beginning to make a significant contribution to visualize plant metabolism. The purpose of this review was to provide the scientific community with an overview of current imaging methods, which rely variously on either nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) or infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and to present some examples of their application in order to illustrate their utility. In addition to providing a description of the basic principles underlying these technologies, the review discusses their various advantages and limitations, reveals the current state of the art, and suggests their potential application to experimental practice. Finally, a view is presented as to how the technologies will likely develop, how these developments may encourage the formulation of novel experimental strategies, and how the enormous potential of these technologies can contribute to progress in plant science.
