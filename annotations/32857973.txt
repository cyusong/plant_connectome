['32857973', 'The formation of the chromosome axis is key to meiotic recombination and hence  the correct distribution of chromosomes to meiotic products. A key component of  the axis in Arabidopsis is the HORMA domain protein (HORMAD) ASY1, the homolog of  Hop1 in yeast and HORMAD1/2 in mammals. The chromosomal association of ASY1 is  dynamic, i.e., ASY1 is recruited to the axis at early prophase and later largely  removed when homologous chromosomes synapse. PCH2/TRIP13 proteins are well-known  regulators of meiotic HORMADs and required for their depletion from synapsed  chromosomes. However, no direct interaction has been found between PCH2/TRIP13  and the presumptive HORMAD substrates in any organism other than in budding  yeast. Thus, it remains largely elusive how the dynamics of ASY1 and other  meiotic HORMADs are controlled. Here, we have identified COMET, the Arabidopsis  homolog of human p31(comet), which is known for its function in the spindle  assembly checkpoint (SAC), as a central regulator of ASY1 dynamics in meiosis. We  provide evidence that COMET controls ASY1 localization by serving as an adaptor  for PCH2. Because ASY1 accumulates in the cytoplasm in early prophase and is  persistently present on chromosomes in comet, we conclude that COMET is required  for both the recruitment of ASY1 to the nucleus and the subsequent removal from  the axis. The here-revealed function of COMET as an adaptor for PCH2 remarkably  resembles the regulation of another HORMAD, Mad2, in the SAC in yeast and  animals, revealing a conserved regulatory module of HORMA-domain-containing  protein complexes.', '2020 Nov 2', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2020.07.089', 'Schnittger']
