Previously, the complexity of folate accumulation in the early stages of maize kernel development has been reported, but the mechanisms of folate accumulation are unclear. Two maize inbred lines, DAN3130 and JI63, with different patterns of folate accumulation and different total folate contents in mature kernels were used to investigate the transcriptional regulation of folate metabolism during late stages of kernel formation by comparative transcriptome analysis. The folate accumulation during DAP 24 to mature kernels could be controlled by circumjacent pathways of folate biosynthesis, such as pyruvate metabolism, glutamate metabolism, and serine/glycine metabolism. In addition, the folate variation between these two inbred lines was related to those genes among folate metabolism, such as genes in the pteridine branch, para-aminobenzoate branch, serine/tetrahydrofolate (THF)/5-methyltetrahydrofolate cycle, and the conversion of THF monoglutamate to THF polyglutamate. The findings provided insight into folate accumulation mechanisms during maize kernel formation to promote folate biofortification.
