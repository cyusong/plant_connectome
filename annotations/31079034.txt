Stem cell homeostasis is maintained by the WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS-CLV) negative feedback loop in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2</i> (<i>FON2</i>) functions in the negative regulation of stem cell proliferation, similar to Arabidopsis <i>CLV3</i> In this study, through genetic enhancer analysis, we found that loss of function of <i>ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1</i> (<i>ASP1</i>), encoding an Arabidopsis TOPLESS (TPL)-like transcriptional corepressor, enhances the <i>fon2</i> flower phenotype, which displayed an increase in floral organ number. In the <i>fon2 asp1</i> double mutant, the inflorescence was severely affected, resulting in bifurcation of the main axis (rachis), a phenotype that has not previously been reported. The stem cells showed marked overproliferation in <i>fon2 asp1</i>, resulting in extreme enlargement and splitting of the inflorescence meristem. These results suggest that <i>ASP1</i> and <i>FON2</i> synergistically regulate stem cell maintenance in rice. Unexpectedly, genetic analysis indicated that <i>TILLERS ABSENT1</i>, the rice ortholog of <i>WUS</i>, is not involved in promoting stem cell proliferation in this meristem. Transcriptome analysis suggested that ASP1 and FON signaling negatively regulate a set of genes with similar functions, and they act on these genes in concert. Taken together, our results suggest that TPL-like corepressor activity plays a crucial role in meristem maintenance, and that stem cell proliferation is properly maintained via the cooperation of <i>ASP1</i> and <i>FON2</i>.
