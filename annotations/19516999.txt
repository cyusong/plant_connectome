Glutathione S-tranferases (GSTs) are a heterogeneous family of proteins, which perform diverse pivotal catalytic and non-enzymatic functions during plant development and in plant stress responses. Previous studies have shown that a GST activity (EC 2.5.1.18) is closely linked with the precocious phases of somatic embryogenesis in leaf tissues of an interspecific chicory hybrid (Cichorium intybus L. var. sativa x C. endivia L. var. latifolia). In order to learn more about the involvement of this enzyme in this process, in situ-hybridization as well as immunolocalization were performed in parallel. GST-mRNAs and proteins were colocalized in small veins, particularly in young protoxylem cell walls. During cell reactivation, the in situ and protein signals became less intense and were associated with chloroplasts. The GST-mRNAs and corresponding proteins were not always colocalized in the same tissues. While high amounts of transcripts could be detected in multicellular embryos, the proteins were not well labeled. Our results indicated that GSTs belong to a complex anti-oxidant mechanism within the cell, and also at the cell wall level. GSTs presence in reactivated cell and multicellular embryos is discussed in relation to redox cell status.
