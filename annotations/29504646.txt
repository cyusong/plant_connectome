Within these communities, every individual cell perceives its unique environment and responds accordingly. In this insight article, the perspective of the bacterial individual is assumed in an attempt to describe how the spatially heterogeneous leaf surface determines the fate of bacteria. To investigate behaviour at scales relevant to bacteria, single-cell approaches are essential. Single-cell studies provide important lessons about how current 'omics' approaches fail to give an accurate picture of the behaviour of bacterial populations in heterogeneous environments. Upcoming techniques will soon allow us to combine the power of single-cell and omics approaches.
