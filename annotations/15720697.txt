* Here we investigated photosynthetic traits of evergreen species under a deciduous canopy in a temperate forest and revealed the importance of CO2 assimilation during winter for annual CO2 assimilation. * Saplings were shaded by the canopy trees from spring through to autumn, but were less shaded during the winter months. Photosynthetic rates at light saturation (Aarea) were lower during winter than during the growing season. Aarea was higher in Camellia, Ilex and Photinia than in Castanopsis, Cleyera and Quercus during the winter, but differed little during summer and autumn. * Estimated daily CO2 assimilation (Aday) was higher during the winter than during the growing season in Camellia, Ilex and Photinia but was higher than that during the growing season only at the beginning and end of winter in Castanopsis, Cleyera and Quercus. Aday was higher in Camellia, Ilex and Photinia than in Castanopsis, Cleyera and Quercus but differed little among them during the growing season. * These results reveal the importance of winter CO2 assimilation for the growth of Camellia, Ilex and Photinia. Furthermore, differences in annual CO2 assimilation among species are strongly modified by species-specific photosynthetic traits during the winter under deciduous canopy trees.
