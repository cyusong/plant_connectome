Panicle photosynthesis is crucial for grain yield in cereal crops; however, the limiting factors for panicle photosynthesis are poorly understood, greatly impeding improvement in this trait. In the present study, pot experiments were conducted to investigate the limiting factors for panicle photosynthesis at the anthesis stage in seven rice genotypes and to examine the temporal variations in photosynthesis during the grain filling stage in the Liangyou 287 genotype. At the anthesis stage, leaf and panicle photosynthesis was positively correlated with stomatal conductance and maximum carboxylation rate, which were in turn associated with hydraulic conductance and nitrogen content, respectively. Panicle hydraulic conductance was positively correlated with the area of bundle sheaths in the panicle neck. During grain filling, leaf and panicle photosynthesis remained constant at the early stage but dramatically decreased from 8 to 9 days after anthesis. The trends of variations in panicle photosynthesis were consistent with those in stomatal conductance but not with those in maximum carboxylation rate. At first, the maximum carboxylation rate and respiration rate in the panicle increased, through elevated panicle nitrogen content, but then drastically decreased, as a result of dehydration. The present study systematically investigated the limiting factors for panicle photosynthesis, which are vital for improving photosynthesis and crop yield.
