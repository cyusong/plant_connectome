['30186745', 'Ribosome biogenesis is essential for cellular function and involves rRNA  synthesis, rRNA processing and modification, and ribosomal protein assembly.  Ribosome biogenesis factors and small nucleolar RNA assist these events.  Ribosomal maturation takes place in the nucleolus, the nucleoplasm, and the  cytosol in a coordinated and controlled manner. For example, some ribosomal  proteins are thought to be assembled in the cytoplasm based on the observations  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we used cellular fractionation to demonstrate  that cleavage of the 20S intermediate, the precursor to mature 18S rRNA, does not  occur in the nucleoplasm of Arabidopsis thaliana. It most likely occurs in the  cytoplasm. Further, we verified the proposed localization of RPS10e, RPS26e, and  RPL24a/b in the nucleus and RPP1 in the nucleolus of A. thaliana by ribosome  profiling, immunofluorescence, and analysis of the localization of GFP fusion  proteins. Our results suggest that the order of events during ribosomal protein  assembly in the ribosome biogenesis pathway differs between plants and yeast.', '2018 Sep', 'FEBS Open Bio', '10.1002/2211-5463.12487', 'Schleiff']
