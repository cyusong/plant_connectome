['35084440', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to cellular damage in several different  contexts, but their role during chilling damage is poorly defined. Chilling  sensitivity both limits the distribution of plant species and causes devastating  crop losses worldwide. Our screen of chilling-tolerant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) for mutants that suffer chilling damage identified a gene (At4g03410)  encoding a chloroplast Mpv17_PMP22 protein, MPD1, with no previous connection to  chilling. The chilling-sensitive mpd1-1 mutant is an overexpression allele that  we successfully phenocopied by creating transgenic lines with a similar level of  MPD1 overexpression. In mammals and yeast, MPD1 homologs are associated with ROS  management. In chilling conditions, Arabidopsis overexpressing MPD1 accumulated  H2O2 to higher levels than wild-type controls and exhibited stronger induction of  ROS response genes. Paraquat application exacerbated chilling damage, confirming  that the phenotype occurs due to ROS dysregulation. We conclude that at low  temperature increased MPD1 expression results in increased ROS production,  causing chilling damage. Our discovery of the effect of MPD1 overexpression on  ROS production under chilling stress implies that investigation of the nine other  members of the Mpv17_PMP22 family in Arabidopsis may lead to new discoveries  regarding ROS signaling and management in plants.', '2022 Apr 18', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erac029', 'ORCID:']
