MYB proteins are a superfamily of transcription factors that play regulatory roles in developmental processes and defense responses in plants. We identified 198 genes in the MYB superfamily from an analysis of the complete Arabidopsis genome sequence, among them, 126 are R2R3-MYB, 5 are R1R2R3-MYB, 64 are MYB-related, and 3 atypical MYB genes. Here we report the expression profiles of 163 genes in the Arabidopsis MYB superfamily whose full-length open reading frames have been isolated. This analysis indicated that the expression for most of the Arabidopsis MYB genes were responsive to one or multiple types of hormone and stress treatments. A phylogenetic comparison of the members of this superfamily in Arabidopsis and rice suggested that the Arabidopsis MYB superfamily underwent a rapid expansion after its divergence from monocots but before its divergence from other dicots. It is likely that the MYB-related family was more ancient than the R2R3-MYB gene family, or had evolved more rapidly. Therefore, the MYB gene superfamily represents an excellent system for investigating the evolution of large and complex gene families in higher plants. Our comprehensive analysis of this largest transcription factor superfamily of Arabidopsis and rice may help elucidate the possible biological roles of the MYB genes in various aspects of flowering plants.
