Integrative transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed many candidate members that may involve in salt secretion from salt glands in Limonium bicolor. Limonium bicolor, a typical recretohalophyte, protects itself from salt damage by excreting excess salt out of its cells through salt glands. Here, to provide an overview of the salt-tolerance mechanism of L. bicolor, we conducted integrative transcriptome and proteome analyses of this species under salt treatment. We identified numerous differentially expressed transcripts and proteins that may be related to the salt-tolerance mechanism of L. bicolor. By measuring the Na<sup>+</sup> secretion rate, were found that this cation secretion rate of a single salt gland was significantly increased after high salinity treatment compared with that in control and then reached the maximum in a short time. Interestingly, transcripts and proteins involved in transmembrane transport of ions were differentially expressed in response to high salinity treatment, suggesting a number of genes and proteins they may play important roles in the salt-stress response. Correlation between differentially expressed transcript and protein profiles revealed several transcripts and proteins that may be responsible for salt tolerance, such as cellulose synthases and annexins. Our findings uncovered many candidate transcripts and proteins in response to the salt tolerance of L. bicolor, providing deep insights into the molecular mechanisms of this important process in recretohalophytes.
