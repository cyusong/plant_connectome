['17215364', 'Plant peroxisomes perform multiple vital metabolic processes including lipid  mobilization in oil-storing seeds, photorespiration, and hormone biosynthesis.  Peroxisome biogenesis requires the function of peroxin (PEX) proteins, including  PEX10, a C(3)HC(4) Zn RING finger peroxisomal membrane protein. Loss of function  of PEX10 causes embryo lethality at the heart stage. We investigated the function  of PEX10 with conditional sublethal mutants. Four T-DNA insertion lines  expressing pex10 with a dysfunctional RING finger were created in an Arabidopsis  WT background (DeltaZn plants). They could be normalized by growth in an  atmosphere of high CO(2) partial pressure, indicating a defect in  photorespiration. beta-Oxidation in mutant glyoxysomes was not affected. However,  an abnormal accumulation of the photorespiratory metabolite glyoxylate, a lowered  content of carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b, and a decreased quantum yield of  photosystem II were detected under normal atmosphere, suggesting impaired leaf  peroxisomes. Light and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated leaf  peroxisomes of the DeltaZn plants to be more numerous, multilobed, clustered, and  not appressed to the chloroplast envelope as in WT. We suggest that inactivation  of the RING finger domain in PEX10 has eliminated protein interaction required  for attachment of peroxisomes to chloroplasts and movement of metabolites between  peroxisomes and chloroplasts.', '2007 Jan 16', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0610402104', 'Gietl']
