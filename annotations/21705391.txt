['21705391', 'The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a major outer mitochondrial membrane  protein, is thought to play an important role in energy production and apoptotic  cell death in mammalian systems. However, the function of VDACs in plants is  largely unknown. In order to determine the individual function of plant VDACs,  molecular and genetic analysis was performed on four VDAC genes, VDAC1-VDAC4,  found in Arabidopsis thaliana. VDAC1 and VDAC3 possess the eukaryotic  mitochondrial porin signature (MPS) in their C-termini, while VDAC2 and VDAC4 do  not. Localization analysis of VDAC-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and  their chimeric or mutated derivatives revealed that the MPS sequence is important  for mitochondrial localization. Through the functional analysis of vdac knockout  mutants due to T-DNA insertion, VDAC2 and VDAC4 which are expressed in the whole  plant body are important for various physiological functions such as leaf  development, the steady state of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and pollen  development. Moreover, it was demonstrated that VDAC1 is not only necessary for  normal growth but also important for disease resistance through regulation of  hydrogen peroxide generation.', '2011 Oct', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/err113', 'Takahashi']
