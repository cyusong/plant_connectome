Pinewood nematode (PWN), the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD), causes massive global losses of Pinus species each year. Bacteria and fungi existing in symbiosis with PWN are closely linked with the pathogenesis of PWD, but the relationship between PWN pathogenicity and the associated microbiota is still ambiguous. This study explored the relationship between microbes and the pathogenicity of PWN by establishing a PWN-associated microbe library, and used this library to generate five artificial PWN-microbe symbiont (APMS) assemblies with gnotobiotic PWNs. The fungal and bacterial communities of different APMSs (the microbiome) were explored by next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, different APMSs were used to inoculate the same Masson pine (<i>Pinus massoniana</i>) cultivar, and multi-omics (metabolome, phenomics, and transcriptome) data were obtained to represent the pathogenicity of different APMSs at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi). Significant positive correlations were observed between microbiome and transcriptome or metabolome data, but microbiome data were negatively correlated with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the host. Five response genes, four fungal genera, four bacterial genera, and nineteen induced metabolites were positively correlated with the ROS level, while seven induced metabolites were negatively correlated. To further explore the function of PWN-associated microbes, single genera of functional microbes (Mb1-Mb8) were reloaded onto gnotobiotic PWNs and used to inoculate pine tree seedlings. Three of the genera (<i>Cladophialophora</i>, <i>Ochroconis</i>, and <i>Flavobacterium</i>) decreased the ROS level of the host pine trees, while only one genus (<i>Penicillium</i>) significantly increased the ROS level of the host pine tree seedlings. These results demonstrate a clear relationship between associated microbes and the pathogenicity of PWN, and expand the knowledge on the interaction between PWD-induced forest decline and the PWN-associated microbiome.
