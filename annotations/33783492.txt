Improving drought tolerance in wheat is crucial for maintaining productivity and food security. Roots are responsible for the uptake of water from soil, and a number of root traits are associated with drought tolerance. Studies have revealed many quantitative trait loci and genes controlling root development in plants. However, the genetic dissection of root traits in response to drought in wheat is still unclear. Here, we review crop root traits associated with drought, key genes governing root development in plants, and quantitative trait loci and genes regulating root system architecture under water-limited conditions in wheat. Deep roots, optimal root length density and xylem diameter, and increased root surface area are traits contributing to drought tolerance. In view of the diverse environments in which wheat is grown, the balance among root and shoot traits, as well as individual and population performance, are discussed. The known functions of key genes provide information for the genetic dissection of root development of wheat in a wide range of conditions, and will be beneficial for molecular marker development, marker-assisted selection, and genetic improvement in breeding for drought tolerance.
