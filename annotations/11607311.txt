['11607311', 'Jasmonic acid and its methyl ester, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), are plant signaling  molecules that affect plant growth and gene expression. Primary root growth of  wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings was inhibited 50% when seedlings were  grown on agar medium containing 0.1 M MeJA. An ethyl methanesulfonate mutant  (jar1) with decreased sensitivity to MeJA inhibition of root elongation was  isolated and characterized. Genetic data indicated the trait was recessive and  controlled by a single Mendelian factor. MeJA-induced polypeptides were detected  in Arabidopsis leaves by antiserum to a MeJA-inducible vegetative storage protein  from soybean. The induction of these proteins by MeJA in the mutant was at least  4-fold less in jar1 compared to wild type. In contrast, seeds of jar1 plants were  more sensitive than wild type to inhibition of germination by abscisic acid.  These results suggest that the defect in jar1 affects a general jasmonate  response pathway, which may regulate multiple genes in different plant organs.', '1992 Aug 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.89.15.6837', 'Howell']
