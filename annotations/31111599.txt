Root development and its response to environmental changes is crucial for whole plant adaptation. These responses include changes in transcript levels. Here, we show that the alternative polyadenylation (APA) of mRNA is important for root development and responses. Mutations in FIP1, a component of polyadenylation machinery, affects plant development, cell division and elongation, and response to different abiotic stresses. Salt treatment increases the amount of poly(A) site usage within the coding region and 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs), and the lack of FIP1 activity reduces the poly(A) site usage within these non-canonical sites. Gene ontology analyses of transcripts displaying APA in response to salt show an enrichment in ABA signaling, and in the response to stresses such as salt or cadmium (Cd), among others. Root growth assays show that fip1-2 is more tolerant to salt but is hypersensitive to ABA or Cd. Our data indicate that FIP1-mediated alternative polyadenylation is important for plant development and stress responses.
