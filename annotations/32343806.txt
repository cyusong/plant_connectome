Gibberellin (GA) hormones regulate the development of plants and their responses to environmental signals. The final part of GA biosynthesis is catalyzed by multifunctional 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, which are encoded by multigene families. According to their enzymatic properties and physiological functions, GA-oxidases are classified as anabolic or catabolic enzymes. Together they allow complex regulation of the GA biosynthetic pathway, which adapts the specific hormonal needs of a plant during development and interaction with its environment. In this review, we combine recent advances in enzymatic characterization of the multifunctional GA-oxidases, in particular, from cucumber and Arabidopsis that have been most comprehensively investigated.
