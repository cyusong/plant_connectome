In poplar (Populus spp.), the major defense phenolics produced in leaves are the flavonoid-derived proanthocyanidins (PAs) and the salicin-based phenolic glycosides. Transcriptional activation of PA biosynthetic genes leading to PA accumulation in leaves occurs following herbivore damage and mechanical wounding as well as infection by the fungal biotroph Melampsora medusae. In this study, we have identified a poplar R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene, MYB134, that exhibits close sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PA regulator TRANSPARENT TESTA2 and that is coinduced with PA biosynthetic genes following mechanical wounding, M. medusae infection, and exposure to elevated ultraviolet B light. Overexpression of MYB134 in poplar resulted in transcriptional activation of the full PA biosynthetic pathway and a significant plant-wide increase in PA levels, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that recombinant MYB134 protein is able to bind to promoter regions of PA pathway genes. MYB134-overexpressing plants exhibited a concomitant reduction in phenolic glycoside concentrations and other minor alterations to levels of small phenylpropanoid metabolites. Our data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling stress-induced PA metabolism in poplar, and the identification of a regulator of stress-responsive PA biosynthesis constitutes a valuable tool for manipulating PA metabolism in poplar and investigating the biological functions of PAs in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.
