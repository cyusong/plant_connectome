['23877244', 'DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic marker in plants and animals. In  Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be established through an RNA-directed DNA  methylation (RdDM) pathway. By screening for suppressors of ros1, we identified  STA1, a PRP6-like splicing factor, as a new RdDM regulator. Whole-genome  bisulfite sequencing suggested that STA1 and the RdDM pathway share a large  number of common targets in the Arabidopsis genome. Small RNA deep sequencing  demonstrated that STA1 is predominantly involved in the accumulation of the  siRNAs that depend on both Pol IV and Pol V. Moreover, the sta1 mutation  partially reduces the levels of Pol V-dependent RNA transcripts.  Immunolocalization assay indicated that STA1 signals are exclusively present in  the Cajal body and overlap with AGO4 in most nuclei. STA1 signals are also  partially overlap with NRPE1. Localization of STA1 to AGO4 and NRPE1 signals is  probably related to the function of STA1 in the RdDM pathway. Based on these  results, we propose that STA1 acts downstream of siRNA biogenesis and facilitates  the production of Pol V-dependent RNA transcripts in the RdDM pathway.', '2013 Oct', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkt639', 'He']
