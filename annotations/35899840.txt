The HD-Zip family of transcription factors is unique to the plant kingdom, and play roles in modulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses. <i>R. glutinosa</i> is an important Chinese medicinal material. Its yield and quality are susceptible to various stresses. The HD-Zip transcription factors is unique to the plant, and roles in modulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses. However, there is no relevant research on the HD-ZIP of <i>R. glutinosa</i>. In this study, 92 HD-Zip transcription factors were identified in <i>R. glutinosa</i>, and denominated as RgHDZ1-RgHDZ92. Members of RgHDZ were classified into four groups (HD-ZipI-IV) based on the phylogenetic relationship of <i>Arabidopsis</i> HD-Zip proteins, and each group contains 38, 18, 17, and 19 members, respectively. Expression analyses of <i>RgHDZ</i> genes based on transcriptome data showed that the expression of these genes could be induced by the endophytic fungus of <i>R. glutinosa</i>. Additionally, we showed that <i>RgHDZ</i> genes were differentially expressed in response to drought, waterlogging, temperature, and salinity treatments. This study provides important information for different expression patterns of stress-responsive HD-Zip and may contribute to the better understanding of the different responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses, and provide a molecular basis for the cultivation of resistant varieties of <i>R. glutinosa</i>.
