Plants use RNA silencing as a strong defensive barrier against virus challenges, and viruses counteract this defence by using RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs). With the objective of identifying host factors helping either the plant or the virus in this interaction, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using P1b, the RSS protein of the ipomovirus Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV, family Potyviridae), as a bait. The C-8 sterol isomerase HYDRA1 (HYD1), an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis and cell membrane biology, and required for RNA silencing, was isolated in this screen. The interaction between CVYV P1b and HYD1 was confirmed in planta by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assays. We demonstrated that HYD1 negatively impacts the accumulation of CVYV P1b in an agroinfiltration assay. Moreover, expression of HYD1 inhibited the infection of the potyvirus Plum pox virus, especially when antiviral RNA silencing was boosted by high temperature or by coexpression of homologous sequences. Our results reinforce previous evidence highlighting the relevance of particular composition and structure of cellular membranes for RNA silencing and viral infection. We report a new interaction of an RSS protein from the Potyviridae family with a member of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway.
