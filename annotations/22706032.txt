Callus-forming capacity is enhanced with hypocotyl maturity in Arabidopsis. However, the genetic regulation of age-related gain in capacity for callus formation is unclear. We used a gene expression microarray assay to characterize the underlying mechanisms during callus formation in young and mature hypocotyl explants of Arabidopsis. As expected, genes involved in photosynthesis and cell wall thickening showed altered expression during hypocotyl maturation. In addition, genes involved in cytokinin perception were enriched in mature hypocotyl tissues. Phytohormone-induced callus formation in hypocotyl explants was accompanied by increased expression of genes mainly related to the cell cycle, histones and epigenetics. The induction level of these genes was higher in mature hypocotyl explants than young explants during callus formation. We identified a number of genes, including those with unknown function, potentially involved in age-related gain in callus formation. Our results provide insight into the effect of hypocotyl age on callus formation. Altered cytokinin signaling components, cell cycle regulation and epigenetics may work in concert to lead to gain of callus-forming capacity in hypocotyls with age.
