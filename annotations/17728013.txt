Aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase (AMADH, EC 1.2.1.19) is an enzyme that, in association with amine oxidase, participates in polyamine catabolism. In plants, the enzyme is well characterized in pea seedlings. In this study, we used etiolated and light-grown pea seedlings as model plants to evaluate the possible AMADH role in response to stress caused by mechanical damage. In the beginning, the activity distribution of AMADH, amine oxidase and peroxidase in organs of 7-day-old intact pea seedlings was analyzed. To perform mechanical damage, stems of 10-day-old seedlings were each divided into four segments of equal length. The top (=fourth) segments were then longitudinally cut with a lancet. During healing, the injured segments and their control counterparts were harvested in 1-day intervals and analyzed for activity of the above enzymes, polyamine and 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) concentrations. The injury elicited increases in AMADH, amine oxidase and peroxidase activities in both etiolated and green seedlings, accompanied by parallel increases in putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and GABA content. Histochemical experiments allowed visualization of increased AMADH activity in cross sections obtained from the injured stem segments. The activity was localized in cortical parenchyma and epidermal cells adjacent to the wound site in spatial correlation with an intensive lignification. In the control seedlings, AMADH activity or lignification in these tissues could not be visualized. Thus, we conclude that, in plants, AMADH may participate in processes of adaptation to stress events caused by mechanical injury, which involve polyamine catabolism, GABA production and lignification.
