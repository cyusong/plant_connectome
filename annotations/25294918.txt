The hydroxyl radical (OH(•)) is the most potent yet short-lived of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) radicals. Just as hydrogen peroxide was once considered to be simply a deleterious by-product of oxidative metabolism but is now acknowledged to have signalling roles in plant cells, so evidence is mounting for the hydroxyl radical as being more than merely an agent of destruction. Its oxidative power is harnessed to facilitate germination, growth, stomatal closure, reproduction, the immune response, and adaptation to stress. It features in plant cell death and is a key tool in microbial degradation of plant matter for recycling. Production of the hydroxyl radical in the wall, at the plasma membrane, and intracellularly is facilitated by a range of peroxidases, superoxide dismutases, NADPH oxidases, and transition metal catalysts. The spatio-temporal activity of these must be tightly regulated to target substrates precisely to the site of radical production, both to prevent damage and to accommodate the short half life and diffusive capacity of the hydroxyl radical. Whilst research has focussed mainly on the hydroxyl radical's mode of action in wall loosening, studies now extend to elucidating which proteins are targets in signalling systems. Despite the difficulties in detecting and manipulating this ROS, there is sufficient evidence now to acknowledge the hydroxyl radical as a potent regulator in plant cell biology.
