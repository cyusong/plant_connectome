The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates ion channel activity and stomatal movement in response to drought stress. Cellular ABA levels change depending on cellular and environmental conditions via modulation of its biosynthesis, catabolism and transport. Although factors involved in ABA biosynthesis and degradation have been studied extensively, how ABA transporters are modulated to fine-tune ABA levels, especially under drought stress, remains elusive. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana SORTING NEXIN 2 (SNX2) proteins play a critical role in endosomal trafficking of the ABA exporter ATP BINDING CASETTE G25 (ABCG25) via direct interaction at endosomes, leading to its degradation in the vacuole. In agreement, snx2a and snx2b mutant plants showed enhanced recycling of GFP-ABCG25 from early endosomes to the plasma membrane and higher accumulation of GFP-ABCG25. Phenotypically, snx2a and snx2b plants were highly sensitive to exogenous ABA and displayed enhanced ABA-mediated inhibition of inward K<sup>+</sup> currents and ABA-mediated activation of slow anion currents in guard cells, resulting in an increased tolerance to drought stress. Based on these results, we propose that SNX2 proteins play a crucial role in stomatal movement and tolerance to drought stress by modulating the endosomal trafficking of ABCG25 and thus cellular ABA levels.
