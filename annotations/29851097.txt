Xyloglucan (XyG) is the major noncellulosic nonpectic matrix polysaccharide in cell walls of most land plants. Initially thought to be restricted to land plants, the last decade has seen the detection of XyG and the discovery of synthesis and modification/degradation genes in charophycean green algae (CGA). Recently, a totally new function of XyG was discovered as a potent soil aggregator released by roots and rhizoids of all major groups of land plants. In this Viewpoint, I show the presence of a complex XyG genetic machinery in most CGA groups. I discuss the context of XyG evolution in light of the terrestrialization of early CGA that gave rise to embryophytes and its possible role in early soil formation.

CGA: !evolved from! embryophytes
XyG: !functions as! soil aggregator
XyG: !synthesized by! roots/rhizoids
