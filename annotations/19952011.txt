['19952011', 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The root meristem of the Arabidopsis thaliana mature embryo  is a highly organized structure in which individual cell shape and size must be  regulated in co-ordination with the surrounding cells. The objective of this  study was to determine the role of the AUX1 LAX family of auxin import carriers  during the establishment of the embryonic root cell pattern. METHODS: The radicle  apex of single and multiple aux1 lax mutant mature embryos was used to evaluate  the effect of this gene family upon embryonic root organization and root cap  size, cell number and cell size. KEY RESULTS: It was demonstrated here that  mutations within the AUX1 LAX family are associated with changes in cell pattern  establishment in the embryonic quiescent centre and columella. aux1 lax mutants  have a larger radicle root cap than the wild type and this is associated with a  significant increase in the root-cap cell number, average cell size, or both.  Extreme disorganization of the radicle apex was observed among quadruple aux1  lax1 lax2 lax3 mutant embryos, but not in single aux1 null or in lax1, lax2 and  lax3 single mutants, indicating redundancy within the AUX1 LAX family.  CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that the AUX1 LAX family of auxin influx  facilitators participates in the establishment of cell pattern within the apex of  the embryonic root in a gene-redundant fashion. It was demonstrated that aux1 lax  mutants are affected in cell proliferation and cell growth within the radicle  tip. Thus AUX1 LAX auxin importers emerge as new players in morphogenetic  processes involved in patterning during embryonic root formation.', '2010 Feb', 'Ann Bot', '10.1093/aob/mcp287', 'Bougourd']
