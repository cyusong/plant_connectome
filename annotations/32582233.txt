Chinese endemic wheat, comprising Tibetan semi-wild wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> ssp. <i>tibetanum</i>), Yunnan hulled wheat (<i>T. aestivum</i> ssp. <i>yunnanense</i>), and Xinjiang rice wheat (<i>T. petropavlovskyi</i>), are genetically and morphologically unique. To examine the adult plant resistance to stripe rust among Chinese endemic wheat germplasms, a panel of 213 accessions was inoculated with mixed virulent races of wheat stripe rust (<i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i>) in four different field environments. Four traits associated with stripe rust resistance, infection type, final disease severity, disease index, and area under the disease progress curve, were used to evaluate the accessions. The phenotypic datasets were used for 55K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-based genome-wide association studies to identify effective resistance loci. Eighty-nine accessions with stable resistance were identified in at least three of the four environments by phenotypic evaluation. Eleven markers located on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 5A, 5D, 7B, and 7D by the genome-wide association studies analysis showed significant associations with at least two resistance-associated traits in two of the environments. These loci, corresponding to seven genomic regions based on linkage disequilibrium decay distance, explained 9.3 to 26.0% of the total phenotypic variation. Five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 7B, and 7D overlapped or were in close proximity to previously reported QTLs based on the consensus and physical maps using the reference sequence of bread wheat (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0). The other two QTLs were potential novel QTLs given their physical positions. Haplotype variants of QTL <i>QYr.sicau-2BS</i> showed subspecies-specific inheritance of the stripe rust resistance locus. Resistant loci among Chinese endemic wheat germplasms could be introduced into common wheat cultivars, and the high-confidence SNP markers will aid in marker-assisted selection in breeding for stripe rust disease resistance.
