Over the last two decades, the use of high-density SNP arrays and DNA sequencing have allowed scientists to uncover the majority of the genotypic space for various crops, including cotton. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) links the dots between a phenotype and its underlying genetics across the genomes of populations. It was first developed and applied in the field of human disease genetics. Many areas of crop research have incorporated GWAS in plants and considerable literature has been published in the recent decade. Here we will provide a comprehensive review of GWAS studies in cotton crop, which includes case studies on biotic resistance, abiotic tolerance, fiber yield and quality traits, current status, prospects, bottlenecks of GWAS and finally, thought-provoking question. This review will serve as a catalog of GWAS in cotton and suggest new frontiers of the cotton crop to be studied with this important tool.
