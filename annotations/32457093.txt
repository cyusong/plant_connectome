Stress signaling in plants is carefully regulated to ensure proper development and reproductive fitness. Overactive defense signaling can result in dwarfism as well as developmental defects. In addition to requiring a substantial amount of energy, plant stress responses place a burden upon the cellular machinery, which can result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Negative regulators of stress signaling, such as <i>ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1</i> (<i>EDR1</i>), ensure that stress responses are properly suspended when they are not needed, thereby conserving energy for growth and development. Here, we describe the role of an uncharacterized N-terminal acetyltransferase, NAA50, in the regulation of plant development and stress responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results demonstrate that NAA50, an interactor of EDR1, plays an important role in regulating the tradeoff between plant growth and defense. Plants lacking <i>NAA50</i> display severe developmental defects as well as induced stress responses. Reduction of <i>NAA50</i> expression results in arrested stem and root growth as well as senescence. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the loss of <i>NAA50</i> results in constitutive ER stress signaling, indicating that <i>NAA50</i> may be required for the suppression of ER stress. This work establishes <i>NAA50</i> as essential for plant development and the suppression of stress responses, potentially through the regulation of ER stress.
