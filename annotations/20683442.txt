['20683442', 'The 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is a conserved component of signalling  pathways controlling growth in eukaryotes. To study S6K function in plants, we  isolated single- and double-knockout mutations and RNA-interference  (RNAi)-silencing lines in the linked Arabidopsis S6K1 and S6K2 genes. Hemizygous  s6k1s6k2/++ mutant and S6K1 RNAi lines show high phenotypic instability with  variation in size, increased trichome branching, produce non-viable pollen and  high levels of aborted seeds. Analysis of their DNA content by flow cytometry, as  well as chromosome counting using DAPI staining and fluorescence in situ  hybridization, revealed an increase in ploidy and aneuploidy. In agreement with  this data, we found that S6K1 associates with the Retinoblastoma-related 1  (RBR1)-E2FB complex and this is partly mediated by its N-terminal LVxCxE motif.  Moreover, the S6K1-RBR1 association regulates RBR1 nuclear localization, as well  as E2F-dependent expression of cell cycle genes. Arabidopsis cells grown under  nutrient-limiting conditions require S6K for repression of cell proliferation.  The data suggest a new function for plant S6K as a repressor of cell  proliferation and required for maintenance of chromosome stability and ploidy  levels.', '2010 Sep 1', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2010.164', 'Bogre']
