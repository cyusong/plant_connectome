The spatial morphological structure of plant leaves is an important index to evaluate crop ideotype. In this study, we characterized the three-dimensional (3D) data of the ear leaf midrib of maize at the grain-filling stage using the 3D digitization technology and obtained the phenotypic values of 15 traits covering four different dimensions of the ear leaf midrib, of which 13 phenotypic traits were firstly proposed for featuring plant leaf spatial structure. Cluster analysis results showed that the 13 traits could be divided into four groups, Group I, -II, -III and -IV. Group I contains HorizontalLength, OutwardGrowthMeasure, LeafAngle and DeviationTip; Group II contains DeviationAngle, MaxCurvature and CurvaturePos; Group III contains LeafLength and ProjectionArea; Group IV contains TipTop, VerticalHeight, UpwardGrowthMeasure, and CurvatureRatio. To investigate the genetic basis of the ear leaf midrib curve, 13 traits with high repeatability were subjected to genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. A total of 828 significantly related SNPs were identified and 1365 candidate genes were annotated. Among these, 29 candidate genes with the highest significant and multi-method validation were regarded as the key findings. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the candidate genes of traits to explore the potential genetic mechanism of leaf midrib curve phenotype formation. These results not only contribute to further understanding of maize leaf spatial structure traits but also provide new genetic loci for maize leaf spatial structure to improve the plant type of maize varieties.
