Centromeres consist of highly repetitive sequences that are challenging to map, clone, and sequence. Active genes exist in centromeric regions, but their biological functions are difficult to explore owing to extreme suppression of recombination in these regions. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out the transcribed gene Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L15 (OsMRPL15), located in the centromeric region of rice (Oryza sativa) chromosome 8, resulting in gametophyte sterility. Osmrpl15 pollen was completely sterile, with abnormalities appearing at the tricellular stage including the absence of starch granules and disrupted mitochondrial structure. Loss of OsMRPL15 caused abnormal accumulation of mitoribosomal proteins and large subunit rRNA in pollen mitochondria. Moreover, the biosynthesis of several proteins in mitochondria was defective, and expression of mitochondrial genes was upregulated at the mRNA level. Osmrpl15 pollen contained smaller amounts of intermediates related to starch metabolism than wild-type pollen, while biosynthesis of several amino acids was upregulated, possibly to compensate for defective mitochondrial protein biosynthesis and initiate consumption of carbohydrates necessary for starch biosynthesis. These results provide further insight into how defects in mitoribosome development cause gametophyte male sterility.
