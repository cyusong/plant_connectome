Ascorbate (AsA) is very important in scavenging reactive oxygen species in plants. AsA can reduce photoinhibition by xanthophyll cycle to dissipate excess excitation energy. GGP is an important enzyme in AsA biosynthesis pathway in higher plants. In this study, we cloned a gene, SlGGP-LIKE, that has the same function but different sequence compared with SlGGP. The function of SlGGP-LIKE gene in response to oxidative stress was investigated using transgenic tobacco plants overexpressed SlGGP-LIKE under methyl viologen treatment. After oxidative stress treatment, transgenic tobacco lines exhibited higher levels of reduced AsA content and APX activity than WT plants. Under oxidative stress, transgenic tobacco plants accumulated less ROS and exhibited lower degrees of REC and MDA. Consequently, relatively higher levels of Pn, Fv/Fm, de-epoxidation status of xanthophyll cycle and D1 protein were maintained in transgenic tobacco plants. Hence, overexpression of SlGGP-LIKE gene enhances AsA biosynthesis and can alleviate the photoinhibition of PSII under oxidative stress.
