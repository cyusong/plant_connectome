Soybean is an important crop providing edible oil and protein source. Soybean oil and protein contents are quantitatively inherited and significantly affected by environmental factors. In this study, meta-analysis was conducted based on soybean physical maps to integrate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from multiple experiments in different environments. Meta-QTLs for seed oil, fatty acid composition, and protein were identified. Of them, 11 meta-QTLs were located on hot regions for both seed oil and protein. Next, we selected 4 chromosome segment substitution lines with different seed oil and protein contents to characterize their 3 years of phenotype selection in the field. Using strand-specific RNA-sequencing analysis, we profile the time-course transcriptome patterns of soybean seeds at early maturity, middle maturity, and dry seed stages. Pairwise comparison and K-means clustering analysis revealed 7,482 differentially expressed genes and 45 expression patterns clusters. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis uncovered 46 modules of gene expression patterns. The 2 most significant coexpression networks were visualized, and 7 hub genes were identified that were involved in soybean oil and seed storage protein accumulation processes. Our results provided a transcriptome dataset for soybean seed development, and the candidate hub genes represent a foundation for further research.
