Sporangia of the potato late blight agent <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> are often used in studies of pathogen biology and plant responses to infection. Investigations of spore biology can be challenging in oomycetes because their sporangia are physiologically active and change in response to environmental factors and aging. Whether sporangia from artificial media and plant lesions are functionally equivalent has been a topic of debate. To address these issues, we compared the transcriptomes and infection ability of sporangia from rye-sucrose media, potato and tomato leaflets, and potato tubers. Small differences were observed between the mRNA profiles of sporangia from all sources, including variation in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, cell-wall-degrading enzymes, and ABC transporters. Small differences in sporangia age also resulted in variation in the transcriptome. Taking care to use sporangia of similar maturity, we observed that those sourced from media or plant lesions had similar rates of zoospore release and cyst germination. There were also no differences in infection rates or aggressiveness on leaflets, based on single-spore inoculation assays. Such results are discordant with those of a recent publication in this journal. Nevertheless, we conclude that sporangia from plant and media cultures are functionally similar and emphasize the importance of using "best practices" in experiments with sporangia to obtain reliable results.
