High temperatures interfere with meiotic recombination and the subsequent progression of meiosis in plants, but few genes involved in meiotic thermotolerance have been characterized. Here, we characterize a maize (Zea mays) classic dominant male-sterile mutant Ms42, which has defects in pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Ms42 encodes a member of the heat shock protein family, HSP101, which accumulates in pollen mother cells. Analysis of the dominant Ms42 mutant and hsp101 null mutants reveals that HSP101 functions in RADIATION SENSITIVE 51 loading, DSB repair, and subsequent meiosis. Consistent with these functions, overexpression of Hsp101 in anthers results in robust microspores with enhanced heat tolerance. These results demonstrate that HSP101 mediates thermotolerance during microsporogenesis, shedding light on the genetic basis underlying the adaptation of male meiocytes to high temperatures.
