Abscisic acid is a key phytohormone produced in response to abiotic stress conditions and is an activator of abiotic stress resistance mechanisms and a regulator during diverse developmental stages in plants. This SnapShot explores how ABA signaling operates and coordinates resistance during stress responses and modulates plant development.
