Cotton is an important cash crop. The fiber length has always been a hot spot, but multi-factor control of fiber quality makes it complex to understand its genetic basis. Previous reports suggested that OsGASR9 promotes germination, width, and thickness by GAs in rice, while the overexpression of AtGASA10 leads to reduced silique length, which is likely to reduce cell wall expansion. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the function of GhGASA10 in cotton fibers development. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber elongation regulation concerning GhGASA10-1, we revealed an evolutionary basis, gene structure, and expression. Our results emphasized the conservative nature of GASA family with its origin in lower fern plants S. moellendorffii. GhGASA10-1 was localized in the cell membrane, which may synthesize and transport secreted proteins to the cell wall. Besides, GhGASA10-1 promoted seedling germination and root extension in transgenic Arabidopsis, indicating that GhGASA10-1 promotes cell elongation. Interestingly, GhGASA10-1 was upregulated by IAA at fiber elongation stages. We propose that GhGASA10-1 may promote fiber elongation by regulating the synthesis of cellulose induced by IAA, to lay the foundation for future research on the regulation networks of GASA10-1 in cotton fiber development.
