['34690060', 'Polygalacturonases (PGs) hydrolyze alpha-1,4-linked d-galacturonic acid (GalUA) in  polygalacturonic acid. Previously, PG activity in pea seedlings was found in the  Golgi apparatus, where pectin biosynthesis occurs. However, the corresponding  genes encoding Golgi-localized PG proteins have never been identified in the  higher plants. In this study, we cloned the 5 Arabidopsis genes encoding putative  membrane-bound PGs from clade F PGs (AtPGFs) as the first step for the discovery  of the Golgi-localized PGs. Five AtPGF proteins (AtPGF3, AtPGF6, AtPGF10, AtPGF14  and AtPGF16) were heterologously produced in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Among  these, only the AtPGF10 protein showed in vitro exo-type PG activity toward  fluorogenic pyridylaminated-oligogalacturonic acids (PA-OGAs) as a substrate. The  optimum PG activity was observed at pH 5.5 and 60 degrees C. The recombinant AtPGF10  protein showed the maximum PG activities toward PA-OGA with 10 degrees of  polymerization. The apparent K(m) values for the PA-OGAs with 7, 11 and 14  degrees of polymerization were 8.0, 22, and 5.9 muM, respectively. This is the  first report of the identification and enzymatic characterization of AtPGF10 as  PG carrying putative membrane-bound domain.', '2022 Jan', 'J Biosci Bioeng', '10.1016/j.jbiosc.2021.08.007', 'Fujiyama']
