Green leaf C6-volatiles are among the most important herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). They play important roles in mediating the behavior of herbivores and their natural enemies, and in triggering the plant-plant communication to prevent further attacks. Recently, wound-induced ubiquitous (Z)-3-hexenol, a C6-alcohol synthesized in the lipoxygenase/HPL pathway, was proved to be the most important infochemical for the herbivore repellence/attraction and natural enemy attraction in tritrophic interactions, as well as for the induction of gene expression in neighboring unattacked plants. In spite of the conflict functions of (Z)-3-hexenol in direct and indirect plant defenses, its positive roles in the indirect defense and the priming effect are consistent. Therefore, this compound can be used to develop novel insect pest control strategies.
