['17921315', 'The timing of the developmental transition to flowering is critical to  reproductive success in plants. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana homologs  of human Lysine-Specific Demethylase1 (LSD1; a histone H3-Lys 4 demethylase)  reduce the levels of histone H3-Lys 4 methylation in chromatin of the floral  repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and the sporophytically silenced floral  repressor FWA. Two of the homologs, LSD1-LIKE1 (LDL1) and LSD1-LIKE2 (LDL2), act  in partial redundancy with FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD; an additional homolog of LSD1)  to repress FLC expression. However, LDL1 and LDL2 appear to act independently of  FLD in the silencing of FWA, indicating that there is target gene specialization  within this histone demethylase family. Loss of function of LDL1 and LDL2 affects  DNA methylation on FWA, whereas FLC repression does not appear to involve DNA  methylation; thus, members of the LDL family can participate in a range of  silencing mechanisms.', '2007 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.052373', 'Amasino']
