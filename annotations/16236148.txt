We have identified a low-copy-number retrotransposon family present in nine to 10 copies in the Lotus japonicus model legume genome, and characterized its activity. LORE1 (Lotus retrotransposon 1) belongs to the Ty3-gypsy group of elements, and is a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon. Genetic mapping located LORE1 elements in gene-rich regions of Lotus chromosomes, and analysis of native as well as new insertion sites revealed integration outside the highly repetitive sequences of centromeres and telomeres. Sequencing of individual LORE1 family members identified several intact elements, and analysis of new insertions showed that at least one member is active and reinserts into functional genes, creating gene-disruption mutations. Southern blot analysis and SSAP on a selection of symbiotic mutants revealed up to 12 new insertion sites in individual mutant lines and a Mendelian segregation of new inserts. Expression analysis showed that LORE1 elements are transcribed in all organs analysed and, in contrast to other active retrotransposons, LORE1 appears not to be transcriptionally upregulated during in vitro tissue culture. Activity of LORE1 in callus and whole plants suggests that a simple insertion mutagenesis based on endogenous LORE1 elements can be established for Lotus.
