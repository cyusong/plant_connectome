Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) provides an evolutionary shortcut for recipient organisms to gain novel functions. Although reports of HGT in higher eukaryotes are rapidly accumulating, in most cases the evolutionary trajectory, metabolic integration, and ecological relevance of acquired genes remain unclear. Plant cell wall degradation by HGT-derived enzymes is widespread in herbivorous insect lineages. Pectin is an abundant polysaccharide in the walls of growing parts of plants. We investigated the significance of horizontally acquired pectin-digesting polygalacturonases (PGs) of the leaf beetle <i>Phaedon cochleariae</i>. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-guided gene knockout approach, we generated a triple knockout and a quadruple PG-null mutant in order to investigate the enzymatic, biological, and ecological effects. We found that pectin-digestion 1) is exclusively linked to the horizontally acquired PGs from fungi, 2) became fixed in the host genome by gene duplication leading to functional redundancy, 3) compensates for nutrient-poor diet by making the nutritious cell contents more accessible, and 4) facilitates the beetles development and survival. Our analysis highlights the selective advantage PGs provide to herbivorous insects and demonstrate the impact of HGT on the evolutionary success of leaf-feeding beetles, major contributors to species diversity.
