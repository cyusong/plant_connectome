How diversity in growth thermo-responsiveness is generated for local adaptation is a long-standing biological question. We investigated molecular genetic basis of natural variations in thermo-responsiveness of plant architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana. We measured the extent of rosette architecture at 22°C and 28°C in a set of 69 natural accessions and determined their thermo-responsiveness of plant architecture. A genome-wide association study was performed to identify major loci for variations in thermo-responsiveness. The SAUR26 subfamily, a new subfamily of SAUR genes, was identified as a major locus for the thermo-responsive architecture variations. The expression of SAUR26/27/28 is modulated by temperature and PIF4. Extensive natural polymorphisms in these genes affect their RNA expression levels and protein activities and influence the thermo-responsiveness of plant architecture. In addition, the SAUR26 subfamily genes exhibit a high variation frequency and their variations are associated with the local temperature climate. This study reveals that the SAUR26 subfamily is a key variation for thermo-responsive architecture and suggests a preference for generating diversity for local adaptation through signaling connectors.
