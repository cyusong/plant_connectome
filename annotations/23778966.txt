['23778966', 'Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form essential epigenetic memory systems for  controlling gene expression during development in plants and animals. However,  the mechanism of plant PcG protein functions remains poorly understood. Here, we  probed the composition and function of plant Polycomb repressive complex 2  (PRC2). This work established the fact that all known plant PRC2 complexes  contain MSI1, a homologue of Drosophila p55. While p55 is not essential for the  in vitro enzymatic activity of PRC2, plant MSI1 was required for the functions of  the EMBRYONIC FLOWER and the VERNALIZATION PRC2 complexes including  trimethylation of histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) at the target chromatin, as well as  gene repression and establishment of competence to flower. We found that MSI1  serves to link PRC2 to LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1), a protein that  binds H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo and is required for a functional plant PcG  system. The LHP1-MSI1 interaction forms a positive feedback loop to recruit PRC2  to chromatin that carries H3K27me3. Consequently, this can provide a mechanism  for the faithful inheritance of local epigenetic information through replication.', '2013 Jul 17', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2013.145', 'ORCID:']
