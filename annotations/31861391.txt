The endothelium is an additional cell layer, differentiating from the inner epidermis of the ovule integument. In tomato (<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i> L.), after fertilization, the endothelium separates from integument and becomes an independent tissue developing next to the growing embryo sac. In the absence of fertilization, the endothelium may proliferate and form pseudo-embryo. However, the course of the reorganization of endothelium into pseudo-embryo in tomato ovules is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate specific features of endothelium differentiation and the role of the endothelium in the development of fertilized and unfertilized tomato ovules. The ovules of tomato plants ("YaLF" line), produced by vegetative growth plants of transgenic tomato line expressing the <i>ac</i> gene, encoding chitin-binding protein from <i>Amaranthus</i> <i>caudatus</i> L., were investigated using light and transmission electron microscopy. We showed that in the fertilized ovule of normally developing fruit and in the unfertilized ovule of parthenocarpic fruit, separation of the endothelium from integument occurs via programmed death of cells of the integumental parenchyma, adjacent to the endothelium. Endothelial cells in normally developing ovules change their structural and functional specialization from meristematic to secretory and back to meristematic, and proliferate until seeds fully mature. The secretory activity of the endothelium is necessary for the lysis of dying cells of the integument and provides the space for the growth of the new sporophyte. However, in ovules of parthenocarpic fruits, pseudo-embryo cells do not change their structural and functional organization and remain meristematic, no zone of lysis is formed, and pseudo-embryo cells undergo programmed cell death. Our data shows the key role of the endothelium as a protective and secretory tissue, needed for the normal development of ovules.
