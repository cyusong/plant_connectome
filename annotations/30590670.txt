Leaves are beautifully specialized organs designed to maximize the use of light and CO2 for photosynthesis. Engineering leaf anatomy therefore holds great potential to enhance photosynthetic capacity. Here we review the effect of the dominant leaf anatomical traits on leaf photosynthesis and confirm that a high chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular airspace per unit leaf area (Sc) is critical for efficient photosynthesis. The possibility of improving Sc through appropriately increasing mesophyll cell density is further analyzed. The potential influences of modifying mesophyll cell morphology on CO2 diffusion, light distribution within the leaf, and other physiological processes are also discussed. Some potential target genes regulating leaf mesophyll cell proliferation and expansion are explored. Indeed, more comprehensive research is needed to understand how manipulating mesophyll cell morphology through editing the potential target genes impacts leaf photosynthetic capacity and related physiological processes. This will pinpoint the targets for engineering leaf anatomy to maximize photosynthetic capacity.
