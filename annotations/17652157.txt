['17652157', 'The mitotic spindle of vascular plants is assembled and maintained by processes  that remain poorly explored at a molecular level. Here, we report that AtKRP125c,  one of four kinesin-5 motor proteins in arabidopsis, decorates microtubules  throughout the cell cycle and appears to function in both interphase and mitosis.  In a temperature-sensitive mutant, interphase cortical microtubules are  disorganized at the restrictive temperature and mitotic spindles are massively  disrupted, consistent with a defect in the stabilization of anti-parallel  microtubules in the spindle midzone, as previously described in kinesin-5 mutants  from animals and yeast. AtKRP125c introduced into mammalian epithelial cells by  transfection decorates microtubules throughout the cell cycle but is unable to  complement the loss of the endogenous kinesin-5 motor (Eg5). These results are  among the first reports of any motor with a major role in anastral spindle  structure in plants and demonstrate that the conservation of kinesin-5 motor  function throughout eukaryotes extends to vascular plants.', '2007 Aug 15', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.009506', 'Baskin']
