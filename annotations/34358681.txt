The effects of brassinosteroid signaling on shoot and root development have been characterized in great detail but a simple consistent positive or negative impact on a basic cellular parameter was not identified. In this study, we combined digital 3D single-cell shape analysis and single-cell mRNA sequencing to characterize root meristems and mature root segments of brassinosteroid-blind mutants and wild type. The resultant datasets demonstrate that brassinosteroid signaling affects neither cell volume nor cell proliferation capacity. Instead, brassinosteroid signaling is essential for the precise orientation of cell division planes and the extent and timing of anisotropic cell expansion. Moreover, we found that the cell-aligning effects of brassinosteroid signaling can propagate to normalize the anatomy of both adjacent and distant brassinosteroid-blind cells through non-cell-autonomous functions, which are sufficient to restore growth vigor. Finally, single-cell transcriptome data discern directly brassinosteroid-responsive genes from genes that can react non-cell-autonomously and highlight arabinogalactans as sentinels of brassinosteroid-dependent anisotropic cell expansion.
