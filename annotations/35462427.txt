Heat stress has a significant impact on the climatic adaptation of flax, a cool-season economic crop. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns are crucial for understanding how flax cultivars respond to heat adversities. It is worth noting that the DNA methylome in flax has yet to be investigated at the nucleotide level. Although heat stress above 40°C caused oxidative damage in flax leaves, 5-azacytidine, a hypomethylating agent, reduced this effect by 15%-24%. Differences in the expression of the LuMET1 (DNA methyltransferase) gene suggested that DNA methylation/demethylation may play a major role in the flax heat stress response. Thus, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing-derived DNA methylation profiles in flax, with or without heat stress and 5-azaC, were developed and analyzed here. In response to heat stress, a high percentage of significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs), particularly hypomethylated DMRs, were identified in the CHH nucleotide sequence context (H = A/T/C). Some of these DMRs overlapped with transposable element insertions. The majority of DMRs were discovered in intergenic regions, but several DMR loci were also found near genes relevant to heat stress response and epigenetic processes. These DMRs, in particular, are linked to CpG islands, implying a possible role in promoter methylation and gene silencing. The DMRs discovered in this study are crucial for understanding and identifying the key players in heat stress response in flax, which will help in developing climate-smart flax varieties.
