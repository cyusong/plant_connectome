Analysis of wood transects in a manner that preserves the spatial distribution of the metabolites present is highly desirable to among other things: (1) facilitate ecophysiology studies that reveal the association between chemical make-up and environmental factors or climatic events over time; and (2) investigate the mechanisms of the synthesis and trafficking of small molecules within specialised tissues. While a variety of techniques could be applied to achieve these goals, most remain challenging and impractical. Laser ablation direct analysis in real time imaging-mass spectrometry (LADI-MS) was successfully used to survey the chemical profile of wood, while also preserving the small-molecule spatial distributions. The tree species Entandrophragma candollei Harms, Millettia laurentii DeWild., Pericopsis elata (Harms) Meeuwen, Dalbergia nigra (Vell.) Benth. and Dalbergia normandii Bosser & R.Rabev were analysed. Several compounds were associated with anatomical features. A greater diversity was detected in the vessels and parenchyma compared with the fibres. Analysis of single vessels revealed that the chemical fingerprint used for timber identification is mainly determined by vessel content. Laser ablation direct analysis in real time imaging-mass spectrometry offers unprecedented opportunities to investigate the distribution of metabolites within wood samples, while circumventing the issues associated with previous methods. This technique opens up new vistas for the discovery of small-molecule biomarkers that are linked to environmental events.
