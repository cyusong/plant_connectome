Selenium-binding proteins (SBPs) represent a ubiquitous protein family implicated in various environmental stress responses, although the exact molecular and physiological role of the SBP family remains elusive. In this work, we report the identification and characterization of CrSBD1, an SBP homolog from the model microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Growth analysis of the C. reinhardtii sbd1 mutant strain revealed that the absence of a functional CrSBD1 resulted in increased growth under mild oxidative stress conditions, although cell viability rapidly declined at higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations. Furthermore, a combined global transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis indicated that the sbd1 mutant exhibited a dramatic quenching of the molecular and biochemical responses upon H2O2-induced oxidative stress when compared to the wild-type. Our results indicate that CrSBD1 represents a cell regulator, which is involved in the modulation of C. reinhardtii early responses to oxidative stress. We assert that CrSBD1 acts as a member of an extensive and conserved protein-protein interaction network including Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3, Cysteine endopeptidase 2, and Glutaredoxin 6 proteins, as indicated by yeast two-hybrid assays.
