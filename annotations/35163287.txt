Cold stress can significantly affect the development, yield, and quality of crops and restrict the geographical distribution and growing seasons of plants. Aquaporins are the main channels for water transport in plant cells. Abiotic stresses such as cold and drought dehydrate cells by changing the water potential. In this study, we cloned a gene <i>GhTIP1;1-like</i> encodes tonoplast aquaporin from the transcriptome database of cotton seedlings after cold stress. Expression analysis showed that <i>GhTIP1;1-like</i> not only responds to cold stress but was also induced by heat, drought and salt stress. Subcellular localization showed that the protein was anchored to the vacuole membrane. Promoter deletion analysis revealed that a MYC motif within the promoter region of <i>GhTIP1;1-like</i> were the core <i>cis</i>-elements in response to low temperature. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and histochemical staining indicate that <i>GhTIP1;1-like</i> plays a positive role in plant cold tolerance. Overexpression of <i>GhTIP1;1-like</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> delayed the senescence process and enhanced the cold tolerance of transgenic plants. Compared with the wild type, the soluble protein concentration and peroxidase activity of the transgenic lines under cold stress were higher, while the malondialdehyde content was lower. In addition, the expression levels of cold-responsive genes were significantly increased in transgenic plants under cold stress. Our results indicate that <i>GhTIP1;1-like</i> could respond to different abiotic stresses and be positively involved in regulating the cold tolerance of cotton.
