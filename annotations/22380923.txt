['22380923', 'The shoot apical meristem, a small dome-shaped structure at the shoot apex, is  responsible for the initiation of all post-embryonic shoot organs. Pluripotent  stem cells within the meristem replenish themselves and provide daughter cells  that become incorporated into lateral organ primordia around the meristem  periphery. We have identified three novel regulators of shoot apical meristem  activity in Arabidopsis thaliana that encode related AIL/PLT transcription  factors: AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE6 (AIL6)/PLETHORA3 (PLT3) and  AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE7 (AIL7)/PLETHORA7 (PLT7). Loss of these genes results in plants  that initiate only a few leaves prior to termination of shoot apical meristem  activity. In 7-day-old ant ail6 ail7 seedlings, we observed reduced cell division  in the meristem region, differentiation of meristematic cells and altered  expression of the meristem regulators WUSCHEL (WUS), CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and SHOOT  MERISTEMLESS (STM). Genetic experiments suggest that these three AIL genes do not  act specifically in either the WUS/CLV or STM pathway regulating meristem  function. Furthermore, these studies indicate that ANT, AIL6 and AIL7 have  distinct functions within the meristem rather than acting in a strictly redundant  manner. Our study thus identifies three new genes whose distinct functions are  together required for continuous shoot apical meristem function.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04975.x', 'Krizek']
