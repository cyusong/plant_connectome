Low phosphorus (P) availability limits soybean growth and yield. A set of potential strategies for plant responses to P deficiency have been elucidated in the past decades, especially in model plants such as <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Recently, substantial efforts focus on the mechanisms underlying P deficiency improvement in legume crops, especially in soybeans (<i>Glycine max</i>). This review summarizes recent advances in the morphological, metabolic, and molecular responses of soybean to phosphate (Pi) starvation through the combined analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Furthermore, we highlight the functions of the key factors controlling root growth and P homeostasis, base on which, a P signaling network in soybean was subsequently presumed. This review also discusses current barriers and depicts perspectives in engineering soybean cultivars with high P efficiency.
