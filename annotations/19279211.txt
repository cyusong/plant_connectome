['19279211', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have important functions in plant stress responses  and development. In plants, ozone and pathogen infection induce an extracellular  oxidative burst that is involved in the regulation of cell death. However, very  little is known about how plants can perceive ROS and regulate the initiation and  the containment of cell death. We have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana  protein, GRIM REAPER (GRI), that is involved in the regulation of cell death  induced by extracellular ROS. Plants with an insertion in GRI display an  ozone-sensitive phenotype. GRI is an Arabidopsis ortholog of the tobacco  flower-specific Stig1 gene. The GRI protein appears to be processed in leaves  with a release of an N-terminal fragment of the protein. Infiltration of the  N-terminal fragment of the GRI protein into leaves caused cell death in a  superoxide- and salicylic acid-dependent manner. Analysis of the extracellular  GRI protein yields information on how plants can initiate ROS-induced cell death  during stress response and development.', '2009 Mar 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0808980106', 'Kangasjarvi']
