Similarly to other plant genomes of similar size, more than half of the genome of <i>P. patens</i> is covered by Transposable Elements (TEs). However, the composition and distribution of <i>P. patens</i> TEs is quite peculiar, with Long Terminal Repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, which form patches of TE-rich regions interleaved with gene-rich regions, accounting for the vast majority of the TE space. We have already shown that RLG1, the most abundant TE in <i>P. patens</i>, is expressed in non-stressed protonema tissue. Here we present a non-targeted analysis of the TE expression based on RNA-Seq data and confirmed by qRT-PCR analyses that shows that, at least four LTR-RTs (RLG1, RLG2, RLC4 and tRLC5) and one DNA transposon (<i>PpTc2</i>) are expressed in <i>P. patens</i>. These TEs are expressed during development or under stresses that <i>P. patens</i> frequently faces, such as dehydratation/rehydratation stresses, suggesting that TEs have ample possibilities to transpose during <i>P. patens</i> life cycle. Indeed, an analysis of the TE polymorphisms among four different <i>P. patens</i> accessions shows that different TE families have recently transposed in this species and have generated genetic variability that may have phenotypic consequences, as a fraction of the TE polymorphisms are within or close to genes. Among the transcribed and mobile TEs, tRLC5 is particularly interesting as it concentrates in a single position per chromosome that could coincide with the centromere, and its expression is specifically induced in young sporophyte, where meiosis takes place.
