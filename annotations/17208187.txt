['17208187', 'The Arabidopsis DNA glycosylase/lyase ROS1 participates in active DNA  demethylation by a base-excision pathway. ROS1 has been shown to be required for  demethylating a transgene promoter. To determine the function of ROS1 in  demethylating endogenous loci, we carried out bisulfite-sequencing analysis of  several transposons and other genes in the ros1 mutant. In the wild-type,  although CpG sites at the majority of these loci are heavily methylated, many of  the CpXpG and CpXpX sites have low levels of methylation or are not at all  methylated. However, these CpXpG and CpXpX sites become heavily methylated in the  ros1 mutant. Associated with this increased DNA methylation, these loci show  decreased expression in the ros1 mutant. Our results suggest that active DNA  demethylation is important in pruning the methylation patterns of the genome, and  even the normally "silent" transposons are under dynamic control by both  methylation and demethylation. This dynamic control may be important in keeping  the plant epigenome plastic so that it can efficiently respond to developmental  and environmental cues.', '2007 Jan 9', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.10.059', 'Zhu']
