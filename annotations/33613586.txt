LONELY GUY has been previously characterized in flowering plants to be involved in the direct activation of cytokinins. In this study, the function of the only <i>LONELY GUY gene</i> (<i>CvarLOG1</i>) from unicellular green microalga <i>Chlorella variabilis</i> NC64A has been investigated. <i>CvarLOG1</i> expressed mainly in the lag and log phases of growth and was confirmed to be a cytokinin-activating enzyme. Overexpression of <i>CvarLOG1</i> in <i>Chlorella</i> led to extended life in culture by almost 10-20 days, creating a "stay-green" phenotype. In the transformed alga, the cell cycle was lengthened due to delayed entry into the G2/M phase contrary to the known role of cytokinins in stimulating G2/M transition possibly due to excessive levels of this hormone. However, due to the sustained growth and delayed senescence, there was an increase in cell number by 11% and in biomass by 46% at the stationary phase, indicating a potential application for the biofuel industry. The total carbohydrate and lipid yield increased by approximately 30 and 20%, respectively. RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis revealed that the genes associated with light and dark reactions of photosynthesis were upregulated, which may be the reason for the increased biomass. These data show that <i>LOG</i> plays an essential role during the cell cycle and in the functioning of the chloroplast and that the pathway leading to direct activation of cytokinins <i>via</i> LOG is functional in algae.
