Climate change has devastating effects on plant growth and yield. During ontogenesis, plants are subjected to a variety of abiotic stresses, including drought and salinity, affecting the crop loss (20-50%) and making them vulnerable in terms of survival. These stresses lead to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage nucleic acid, proteins, and lipids. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) have remarkable capabilities in combating drought and salinity stress and improving plant growth, which enhances the crop productivity and contributes to food security. PGPB inoculation under abiotic stresses promotes plant growth through several modes of actions, such as the production of phytohormones, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, exopolysaccharide, siderophore, hydrogen cyanide, extracellular polymeric substances, volatile organic compounds, modulate antioxidants defense machinery, and abscisic acid, thereby preventing oxidative stress. These bacteria also provide osmotic balance; maintain ion homeostasis; and induce drought and salt-responsive genes, metabolic reprogramming, provide transcriptional changes in ion transporter genes, etc. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the effects of PGPB on drought and salinity stress to mitigate its detrimental effects. Furthermore, we also discuss the mechanistic insights of PGPB towards drought and salinity stress tolerance for sustainable agriculture.
