['15310842', 'The transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development in Arabidopsis  is regulated by multiple floral induction pathways, including the photoperiodic,  the autonomous, the vernalization, and the hormonal pathways. These pathways  converge to regulate the expression of a small set of genes critical for floral  initiation and different signal transduction pathways can interact to govern the  time to flower. One important regulator of floral initiation is the MADS-box  transcription factor FLC, which acts as a negative regulator of flowering in  response to both endogenous and environmental signals. In this report, we  describe a study of the flowering-time gene, FLK [flowering locus K homology (KH)  domain] that encodes a putative RNA-binding protein with three KH domains. The  flk mutations cause delayed flowering without a significant effect on the  photoperiodic or vernalization responses. FLK functions primarily as a repressor  of FLC expression, although it also modestly affects expression of genes  associated with the photoperiodic pathway. In addition to FLK, the expression of  two other KH domain genes are modestly affected by the flk mutation, suggesting a  possible involvement of more than one KH domain protein in the regulation of  flowering time in Arabidopsis.', '2004 Aug 24', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0404552101', 'Lin']
