The conventional approach to categorizing transporters has been to class them according to their sequence homology, defining a 'family' (or a 'superfamily' if they are numerous), and according to their substrate specificity or selectivity. This general view is still relevant for some transporters, but it is being increasingly challenged. Here, we take the NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) as one such example. NPF members do indeed display sequence and structural homologies with peptide transporter (PTR) proteins involved in the uptake of di- and tri-peptides in most other organisms. And in plants they were initially characterized as nitrate or peptide transporters. However, in recent years several other substrates have been identified, namely nitrite, chloride, glucosinolates, auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonates (JAs), and gibberellins (GAs). Some of these transporters are even capable of transporting more than one different substrate (e.g. nitrate/auxin, nitrate/ABA, nitrate/glucosinolates, or GA/JA). In this review, we give an overview of the substrate-specificity of the Arabidopsis NPF.
