['25856240', 'Growing agricultural demands in the face of impending inorganic phosphate (Pi)  shortages underscore a need for a better understanding of plant development under  conditions of Pi deprivation. Pi is an essential nutrient that is a major  component of fertilizer. Plants have evolved strategies to improve the  acquisition of this nutrient by altering root development under shortage  conditions. We show that signaling peptides thought to act redundantly in  Arabidopsis thaliana development have distinct functions in response to Pi  deprivation. Using microscopy and confocal imaging, roots were analyzed for  growth rate and cellular composition. Using expression microarrays, genes  influencing development in response to phosphate deprivation were identified.  ROOT GROWTH FACTOR1 (RGF1) and RGF2 influenced different aspects of root  development under conditions of Pi deprivation. We found that RGF2 influenced the  longitudinal growth rate in the primary root in response to Pi deprivation,  whereas RGF1 affected circumferential cell number in the root meristem. These  data suggest that the mechanisms controlling adaptive development can depend on  disparate functions of genes thought to act redundantly, thus elucidating new  functions for important developmental regulators.', '2015 Aug', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13405', 'Benfey']
