Ecologically relevant low UV-B is reported to alter reactive oxygen species metabolism and anti-oxidative systems through an up-regulation of enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. However, little is known about low UV-B-induced changes in carotenoid profile and their impacts on light harvesting and photoprotection of photosystem II (PSII) in plants. We investigated carotenoids profile, chlorophyll pigments, phenolics, photosynthetic efficiency and growth in Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants grown under photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), PAR+ ultraviolet (UV)-A and PAR+UV-A+B regimes for 10 days in order to assess plant acclimation to low UV-B radiation. A chlorophyll fluorescence assay was used to examine UV-B tolerance in plants further exposed to acute high UV-B for 4 and 6 h following a 10-day growth under different PAR and UV regimes. We found that both PAR+ UV-A and PAR+UV-A+B regimes had no negative effect on quantum efficiency, electron transport rate, rosette diameter, relative growth rate and shoot dry weight of plants. Chronic PAR+ UV-A regime considerably (P < 0.05) increased violaxanthin (26 %) and neoxanthin (92 %) content in plants. Plant exposure to chronic PAR+UV-A+B significantly (P < 0.05) increased violaxanthin (48 %), neoxanthin (63 %), lutein (33 %), 9-cis ß-carotene (28 %), total ß-carotene (29 %) and total phenolics (108 %). The maximum photochemical efficiency (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) in leaves was found to be positively correlated with total phenolics (rho = 0.81 and rho = 0.91, P < 0.05 for 4 and 6 h, respectively) and non-photochemical quenching (q<sub>N</sub>) (rho = 0.81 and rho = 0.84, P < 0.05 for 4 and 6 h, respectively) in plants exposed to acute high UV-B for 4 and 6 h following a 10-day growth under chronic PAR+UV-A+B. There was also a significant positive correlation (rho = 0.93, P < 0.01) between q<sub>N</sub> and lutein content in the plants exposed to acute high UV-B stress for 4 h following plant exposure to chronic PAR+UV-A+B. The findings from our study indicate that plants grown under chronic PAR+UV-A+B displayed higher photoprotection of PSII against acute high UV-B stress than those grown under PAR and PAR+ UV-A regimes. An induction of phenolics and lutein-mediated development of q<sub>N</sub> were involved in the photoprotection of PSII against UV-B-induced oxidative stress.
