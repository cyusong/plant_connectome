Metabolic profiles in xylem sap are considered a fundamental mechanism for Cd detoxification in plants. However, the metabolic mechanism of Brassica juncea xylem sap in response to Cd is still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects on the metabolomics of B. juncea xylem sap treated with Cd at different times by utilizing a non-targeted LC-MS-based metabolomics method for further elucidating the response mechanism of Cd exposure. The findings indicated that 48 h and 7 d Cd exposure caused significant differences in metabolic profiles of the B. juncea xylem sap. Those differential metabolites are primarily involved in amino acids, organic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, and most of them were downregulated, which played essential roles in response to Cd stress. Furthermore, B. juncea xylem sap resisted 48 h Cd exposure via regulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism, carbon metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, ABC transporters, biosynthesis of amino acids, and pyrimidine metabolism; whereas alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, photosynthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation were regulated for resisting 7 d Cd exposure.
