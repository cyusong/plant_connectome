<i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</i> subsp. <i>aureofaciens</i> SPS-41 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium with biocontrol potential that was isolated from the rhizosphere of sweet potato in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. Our previous study demonstrated that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by SPS-41 inhibited black spot disease fungi <i>Ceratocystis fimbriata</i> in postharvest sweet potatoes and a variety of other plant pathogens, and the VOCs also displayed strong nematocidal activity. In order to further explore the application potential of this strain, we here report the complete genome sequence of strain SPS-41. The genome consists of one chromosome (6,757,898 bp) with a G+C content 63.10%, which contains 5,951 coding genes, 67 transfer RNA genes, 16 ribosome RNA genes, and 85 other non-coding RNA genes. No plasmid was detected. The information of the genome will provide resources for studying the biocontrol mechanism of this strain.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
