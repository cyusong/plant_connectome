Flowering time is one of the most important agronomic traits in wheat production. A proper flowering time might contribute to the reduction or avoidance of biotic and abiotic stresses, adjust plant architecture, and affect the yield and quality of grain. In this study, <i>TaTOE1-B1</i> in wheat produced three transcripts (<i>TaTOE1-B1-1</i>, <i>TaTOE1-B1-2</i>, and <i>TaTOE1-B1-3</i>) by alternative splicing. Compared to the longest transcript, <i>TaTOE1-B1-1</i>, <i>TaTOE1-B1-3</i> has a deletion in the sixth exon (1219-1264 bp). Under long-day conditions, the heterologous overexpression of the <i>TaTOE1-B1-3</i> gene delayed flowering, prolonged the vegetative growth time, and enlarged the vegetative body of <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but that of <i>TaTOE1-B1-1</i> did not. As typical AP2 family members, TaTOE1-B1-1 and TaTOE1-B1-3 are mainly located in the nucleus and have transcriptional activation activities; the transcriptional activation region of TaTOE1-B1-3 is located in the C-terminal. In <i>TaTOE1-B1-3</i> overexpression lines, the expression of flowering-related <i>AtFT</i> and <i>AtSOC1</i> genes is significantly downregulated. In addition, this study confirms the protein-protein interaction between TaTOE1-B1-3 and TaPIFI, which may play an important role in flowering inhibition. These results provide a theoretical basis for the precise regulation of wheat flowering time.
