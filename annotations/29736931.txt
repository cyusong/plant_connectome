The objective of this work was to characterize photosynthetic ferredoxin from the Antarctic green alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241, a key enzyme involved in distributing photosynthetic reducing power. We hypothesize that ferredoxin possesses characteristics typical of cold-adapted enzymes, namely increased structural flexibility and high activity at low temperatures, accompanied by low stability at moderate temperatures. To address this objective, we purified ferredoxin from UWO241 and characterized the temperature dependence of its enzymatic activity and protein conformation. The UWO241 ferredoxin protein, RNA, and DNA sequences were compared with homologous sequences from related organisms. We provide evidence for the duplication of the main ferredoxin gene in the UWO241 nuclear genome and the presence of two highly similar proteins. Ferredoxin from UWO241 has both high activity at low temperatures and high stability at moderate temperatures, representing a novel class of cold-adapted enzymes. Our study reveals novel insights into how photosynthesis functions in the cold. The presence of two distinct ferredoxin proteins in UWO241 could provide an adaptive advantage for survival at cold temperatures. The primary amino acid sequence of ferredoxin is highly conserved among photosynthetic species, and we suggest that subtle differences in sequence can lead to significant changes in activity at low temperatures.
