By regulating the levels of nitric oxide (NO) in a cell and tissue specific fashion, Phytoglobins (Pgbs), plant hemoglobin-like proteins, interfere with many NO-mediated pathways participating in developmental and stress-related responses. Recent evidence reveals that one of the functions of Pgbs is to protect the root apical meristem (RAM) from stress conditions by retaining the viability and function of the quiescent center (QC), required to maintain the stem cells in an undifferentiated state and ensure proper tissue patterning and root viability. Based on this and other evidence, it is suggested that Pgbs regulate cell fate by modulating NO homeostasis.
