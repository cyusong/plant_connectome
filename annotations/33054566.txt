<i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>conglutinans</i> is the causal agent of Fusarium wilt of cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i> var. <i>capitata</i> L.), which results in severe yield loss. Here, we report a high-quality genome sequence of a race 1 strain (IVC-1) of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>conglutinans</i>, which was assembled using a combination of PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequences. The assembled IVC-1 genome has a total size of 71.18 Mb, with a contig N50 length of 4.59 Mb, and encodes 23,374 predicted protein-coding genes. The high-quality genome of IVC-1 provides a valuable resource for facilitating our understanding of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>conglutinans</i>-cabbage interaction.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
