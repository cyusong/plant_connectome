['22805005', 'The balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation is essential for  leaf patterning. However, identification of the factors coordinating leaf  patterning and cell growth behavior is challenging. Here, we characterized a  temperature-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant with leaf blade and venation defects. We  mapped the mutation to the sub-2 allele of the SCRAMBLED/STRUBBELIG (SCM/SUB)  receptor-like kinase gene whose functions in leaf development have not been  demonstrated. The sub-2 mutant displayed impaired blade development, asymmetric  leaf shape and altered venation patterning under high ambient temperature (30 degrees C),  but these defects were less pronounced at normal growth temperature (22 degrees C). Loss  of SCM/SUB function results in reduced cell proliferation and abnormal cell  expansion, as well as altered auxin patterning. SCM/SUB is initially expressed  throughout leaf primordia and becomes restricted to the vascular cells,  coinciding with its roles in early leaf patterning and venation formation.  Furthermore, constitutive expression of the SCM/SUB gene also restricts organ  growth by inhibiting the transition from cell proliferation to expansion. We  propose the existence of a SCM/SUB-mediated developmental stage-specific signal  for leaf patterning, and highlight the importance of the balance between cell  proliferation and differentiation for leaf morphogenesis.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05109.x', 'He']
