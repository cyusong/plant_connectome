Plant tolerance to freezing temperatures is governed by endogenous components and environmental factors. Exposure to low non-freezing temperatures is a key factor in the induction of freezing tolerance in the process called cold acclimation. The role of nitric oxide (NO) in cold acclimation was explored in Arabidopsis using triple nia1nia2noa1-2 mutants that are impaired in the nitrate-dependent and nitrate-independent pathways of NO production, and are thus NO deficient. Here, we demonstrate that cold-induced NO accumulation is required to promote the full cold acclimation response through C-repeat Binding Factor (CBF)-dependent gene expression, as well as the CBF-independent expression of other cold-responsive genes such as Oxidation-Related Zinc Finger 2 (ZF/OZF2). NO deficiency also altered abscisic acid perception and signaling and the cold-induced production of anthocyanins, which are additional factors involved in cold acclimation.

NO: !promotes! CBF-dependent gene expression
NO: !promotes! CBF-independent gene expression
NO: !alters! ABA perception and signaling
NO: !induces! anthocyanin production
CBF: !regulates! cold-responsive genes
ABA: !regulates! cold acclimation
