['17322399', 'Plants must perceive and rapidly respond to changes in ambient temperature for  their successful reproduction. Here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis SHORT  VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) plays an important role in the response of plants to  ambient temperature changes. The loss of SVP function elicited insensitivity to  ambient temperature changes. SVP mediates the temperature-dependent functions of  FCA and FVE within the thermosensory pathway. SVP controls flowering time by  negatively regulating the expression of a floral integrator, FLOWERING LOCUS T  (FT), via direct binding to the CArG motifs in the FT sequence. We propose that  this is one of the molecular mechanisms that modulate flowering time under  fluctuating temperature conditions.', '2007 Feb 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1518407', 'Ahn']
