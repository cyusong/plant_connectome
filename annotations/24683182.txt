Senescence processes are part of the plant developmental programme. They involve reprogramming of gene expression and are under the control of a complex regulatory network closely linked to other developmental and stress-responsive pathways. Recent evidence indicates that leaf senescence is regulated via epigenetic mechanisms. In the present review, the epigenetic control of plant senescence is discussed in the broader context of environment-sensitive plant development. The review outlines the concept of epigenetic control of interconnected regulatory pathways steering stress responses and plant development. Besides giving an overview of techniques used in the field, it summarizes recent findings on global alterations in chromatin structure, histone and DNA modifications, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling during plant senescence and linked processes.
