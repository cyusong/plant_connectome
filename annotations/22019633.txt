Glutathione is an important antioxidant and redox buffer in plants. Despite its crucial roles in plant metabolism and defense in the sporophyte, its roles in the gametophyte are largely unexplored. Recently, we demonstrated that glutathione synthesis is essential for pollen germination in vitro. In this study, we extend these results and focus on the subcellular distribution of glutathione in pollen grains and compare it to the situation in the sporophyte. Glutathione was equally distributed within mitochondria, plastids, nuclei and the cytosol in the gametophyte -- in contrast to youngest fully developed leaves and root tips of the sporophyte, where glutathione was highest in the mitochondria, followed by nuclei, cytosol, peroxisomes and plastids in decreasing concentration. Glutathione was not detected in vacuoles. We can conclude that glutathione synthesis is essential for pollen germination in vitro and that the subcellular distribution of glutathione in the gametophyte differs significantly from the sporophyte.
