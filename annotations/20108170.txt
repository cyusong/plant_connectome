['20108170', 'BRI1-Associated kinase 1 (BAK1), a five leucine-rich-repeat containing  receptor-like serine/threonine kinase, has been shown to have dual functions:  mediating brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and acting in the BR-independent plant  defense response. Sequence analysis has revealed that BAK1 has two homologs, BAK7  and BAK8. Because BAK8 deviates from the canonical RD kinase motif, we focused on  the functional analysis of BAK7. The expression pattern and tissues in which BAK7  appeared partially overlapped with those observed for BAK1. Expression levels of  BAK7 increased in the bak1 mutant. Overexpression of BAK7 rescued the bri1 mutant  phenotype, indicating that BAK7 can compensate for BAK1 in BR-mediated processes,  especially in the absence of BAK1. However, root and hypocotyl elongation  patterns of transgenic plants overexpressing BAK1 or BAK7 appeared to be  different from the patterns observed in a BRI1 overexpressor. Furthermore, the  sensitivity of transgenic plants overexpressing BAK7 to brassinazole, a  biosynthetic inhibitor of brassinolide (BL), did not change compared to that of  wild-type plants. In addition, we generated transgenic plants expressing BAK7 RNA  interference constructs and found severe growth retardation and early senescence  in these lines. Taken together, these results suggest that BAK7 is a component of  the BR signaling pathway, with varying degrees of genetic redundancy with BAK1,  and that it affects plant growth via BL-independent pathways in vivo.', '2010 Mar', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-010-0024-0', 'Nam']
