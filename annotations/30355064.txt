The plant immune system comprises a complex network of signaling processes, regulated not only by classically defined immune components (e.g., resistance genes) but also by a suite of developmental, environmental, abiotic, and biotic-associated factors. In total, it is the sum of these interactions-the connectivity to a seemingly endless array of environments-that ensures proper activation, and control, of a system that is responsible for cell surveillance and response to threats presented by invading pests and pathogens. Over the past decade, the field of plant pathology has witnessed the discovery of numerous points of convergence between immunity, growth, and development, as well as overlap with seemingly disparate processes such as those that underpin plant response to changes in the environment. Toward defining how immune signaling is regulated, recent studies have focused on dissecting the mechanisms that underpin receptor-ligand interactions, phospho-regulation of signaling cascades, and the modulation of host gene expression during infection. As one of the major regulators of these immune signaling cascades, the plant cytoskeleton is the stage from which immune-associated processes are mobilized and oriented and, in this role, it controls the movement of the organelles, proteins, and chemical signals that support plant defense signaling. In short, the cytoskeleton is the battlefield from which pathogens and plants volley virulence and resistance, transforming resistance to susceptibility. Herein, we discuss the role of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton as a platform for the function of the plant immune system.
