LEA proteins are widely distributed in the plant and animal kingdoms, as well as in micro-organisms. LEA genes make up a large family and function in plant protection against a variety of adverse conditions. Bioinformatics approaches were adopted to identify LEA genes in the flax genome. In total, we found 50 LEA genes in the genome. We also conducted analyses of the physicochemical parameters and subcellular location of the genes and generated a phylogenetic tree. LuLEA genes were unevenly mapped among 15 flax chromosomes and 90% of the genes had less than two introns. Expression profiles of LuLEA showed that most LuLEA genes were expressed at a late stage of seed development. Functionally, the LuLEA1 gene reduced seed size and fatty acid contents in LuLEA1-overexpressed transgenic Arabidopsis lines. Our study adds valuable knowledge about LEA genes in flax which can be used to improve related genes of seed development.
