ATP is secreted to the extracellular matrix, where it activates plasma membrane receptors for controlling plant growth and stress-adaptive processes. DOES NOT RESPOND TO NUCLEOTIDES 1 (DORN1), was the first plant ATP receptor to be identified but key downstream proteins remain sought after. Here, we identified 120 proteins secreted by Arabidopsis cell cultures and screened them for putative stress-responsive proteins using ATP-affinity purification. We report three Arabidopsis proteins isolated by ATP-affinity: PEROXIDASE 52, SUBTILASE-LIKE SERINE PROTEASE 1.7 and PHOSPHOLIPASE C-LIKE 1. In wild-type Arabidopsis, the expression of genes encoding all three proteins responded to fumonisin B1, a cell death-activating mycotoxin. The expression of PEROXIDASE 52 and PHOSPHOLIPASE C-LIKE 1 was altered in fumonisin B1-resistant salicylic acid induction-deficient (sid2) mutants. Exposure to fumonisin B1 suppressed PHOSPHOLIPASE C-LIKE 1 expression in sid2 mutants, suggesting that the inactivation of this gene might provide mycotoxin tolerance. Accordingly, gene knockout mutants of PHOSPHOLIPASE C-LIKE 1 were resistant to fumonisin B1-induced death. The activation of PHOSPHOLIPASE C-LIKE 1 gene expression by exogenous ATP was not blocked in dorn1 loss-of-function mutants, indicating that DORN1 is not required. Furthermore, exogenous ATP rescued both the wild type and the dorn1 mutants from fumonisin-B1 toxicity, suggesting that different ATP receptor(s) are operational in this process. Our results point to the existence of additional plant ATP receptor(s) and provide crucial downstream targets for use in designing screens to identify these receptors. Finally, PHOSPHOLIPASE C-LIKE 1 serves as a convergence point for fumonisin B1 and extracellular ATP signalling, and functions in the Arabidopsis stress response to fumonisin B1.
