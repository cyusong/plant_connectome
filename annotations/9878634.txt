['9878634', 'A recessive mutation in Arabidopsis, named chaos (for chlorophyll a/b binding  protein harvesting-organelle specific; designated gene symbol CAO), was isolated  by using transposon tagging. Characterization of the phenotype of the chaos  mutant revealed a specific reduction of pigment binding antenna proteins in the  thylakoid membrane. These nuclear-encoded proteins utilize a chloroplast signal  recognition particle (cpSRP) system to reach the thylakoid membrane. Both  prokaryotes and eukaryotes possess a cytoplasmic SRP containing a 54-kD protein  (SRP54) and an RNA. In chloroplasts, the homolog of SRP54 was found to bind a  43-kD protein (cpSRP43) rather than to an RNA. We cloned the CAO gene, which  encodes a protein identified as Arabidopsis cpSRP43. The product of the CAO gene  does not resemble any protein in the databases, although it contains motifs that  are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. These motifs include ankyrin  repeats and chromodomains. Therefore, CAO encodes an SRP component that is unique  to plants. Surprisingly, the phenotype of the cpSRP43 mutant (i.e., chaos)  differs from that of the Arabidopsis cpSRP54 mutant, suggesting that the  functions of the two proteins do not strictly overlap. This difference also  suggests that the function of cpSRP43 is most likely restricted to protein  targeting into the thylakoid membrane, whereas cpSRP54 may be involved in an  additional process(es), such as chloroplast biogenesis, perhaps through  chloroplast-ribosomal association with chloroplast ribosomes.', '1999 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.1.87', 'Nussaume']
