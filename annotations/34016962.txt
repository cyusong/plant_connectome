Studies along elevational gradients worldwide usually find the highest plant taxa richness in mid-elevation forest belts. Hence, an increase in upper elevation diversity is expected in the course of warming-related treeline rise. Here, we use a time-series approach to infer past taxa richness from sedimentary ancient DNA from the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau over the last ~18,000 years. We find the highest total plant taxa richness during the cool phase after glacier retreat when the area contained extensive and diverse alpine habitats (14-10 ka); followed by a decline when forests expanded during the warm early- to mid-Holocene (10-3.6 ka). Livestock grazing since 3.6 ka promoted plant taxa richness only weakly. Based on these inferred dependencies, our simulation yields a substantive decrease in plant taxa richness in response to warming-related alpine habitat loss over the next centuries. Accordingly, efforts of Tibetan biodiversity conservation should include conclusions from palaeoecological evidence.

Warming: !causes! Loss of alpine habitats
Livestock grazing: !promotes! Plant taxa richness
Taxa richness: !highest in! Cool phase after glacier retreat
Taxa richness: !lowest in! Warm early- to mid-Holocene
Simulation: !yields! Substantial decrease in plant taxa richness
