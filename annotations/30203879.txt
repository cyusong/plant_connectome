['30203879', 'Boron is a micronutrient that is required for the normal growth and development  of vascular plants, but its precise functions remain a subject of debate. One  established role for boron is in the cell wall where it forms a diester  cross-link between two monomers of the low-abundance pectic polysaccharide  rhamnogalacturonan-II (RG-II). The inability of RG-II to properly assemble into a  dimer results in the formation of cell walls with abnormal biochemical and  biomechanical properties and has a severe impact on plant productivity. Here we  describe the effects on RG-II structure and cross-linking and on the growth of  plants in which the expression of a GDP-sugar transporter (GONST3/GGLT1) has been  reduced. In the GGLT1-silenced plants the amount of L-galactose in side-chain A  of RG-II is reduced by up to 50%. This leads to a reduction in the extent of  RG-II cross-linking in the cell walls as well as a reduction in the stability of  the dimer in the presence of calcium chelators. The silenced plants have a dwarf  phenotype, which is rescued by growth in the presence of increased amounts of  boric acid. Similar to the mur1 mutant, which also disrupts RG-II cross-linking,  GGLT1-silenced plants display a loss of cell wall integrity under salt stress. We  conclude that GGLT1 is probably the primary Golgi GDP-L-galactose transporter,  and provides GDP-L-galactose for RG-II biosynthesis. We propose that the  L-galactose residue is critical for RG-II dimerization and for the stability of  the borate cross-link.', '2018 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14088', 'ORCID:']
