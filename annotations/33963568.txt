Salt stress disturbs the cellular osmotic and ionic balance, which then creates a negative impact on plant growth and development. The Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions can enter into plant cells through various membrane transporters, including specific and non-specific Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> , and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters. Therefore, it is important to understand Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transport mechanisms in plants along with the isolation of genes, their characterization, the structural features, and their post-translation regulation under salt stress. This review summarizes the molecular insights of plant ion transporters, including non-selective cation transporters, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation transporters, glutamate-like receptors, membrane intrinsic proteins, cation proton antiporters, and sodium proton antiporter families. Further, we discussed the K<sup>+</sup> transporter families such as high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporters, HAK/KUP/KT transporters, shaker type K<sup>+</sup> transporters, and K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporters. Besides the ion transport process, we have shed light on available literature on epigenetic regulation of transport processes under salt stress. Recent advancements of salt stress sensing mechanisms and various salt sensors within signaling transduction pathways are discussed. Further, we have compiled salt-stress signaling pathways, and their crosstalk with phytohormones.
