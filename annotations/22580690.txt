Progeny from diseased Arabidopsis shows enhanced resistance, which is associated with priming of defense genes. This transgenerational systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is effective against biotrophic pathogens, such as the downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. In this study, we have examined mutants in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) for transgenerational SAR. Our analysis suggests that transgenerational SAR is regulated by the RdDM pathway and transmitted by hypomethylation at CpNpG sites.

RdDM: !regulates! transgenerational SAR
CpNpG sites: !transmit! hypomethylation
defense genes: !primed by! progeny from diseased Arabidopsis
Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis: !resisted by! transgenerational SAR
