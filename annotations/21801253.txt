['21801253', 'The NIMA-related kinases (NEKs) are a family of serine/threonine kinases involved  largely in cell cycle control in fungi, mammals and other eukaryotes. In  Arabidopsis, NEK6 is involved in the regulation of epidermal cell morphogenesis.  However, other roles of NEK6 in plants are less well understood. Here we report  functions of NEK6 in plant growth, development and stress responses in  Arabidopsis. NEK6 transcripts and proteins are induced by ethylene precursor ACC  and salt stress. Expression of other NEK genes except NEK5 is also responsive to  the two treatments. Overexpression and mutant analysis disclose that the NEK6  gene increases rosette growth, seed yield and lateral root formation. However,  NEK6 appears to play a negative role in the control of seed size. The gene also  promotes plant tolerance to salt stress and osmotic stress in its overexpressing  plants. The NEK6 gene may achieve its function through suppression of ethylene  biosynthesis and activation of CYCB1;1 and CYCA3;1 expression. Our present study  reveals new functions of the NEK6 gene in plant growth and stress tolerance, and  manipulation of NEK6 may improve important agronomic traits in crop plants.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04733.x', 'Zhang']
