Genetic analyses and utilization of wild genetic variation for crop improvement in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.) have been hampered by yield evaluation difficulties, identification of advantageous variation, and linkage drag. The lack of adaptation to cultivation conditions and the existence of highly structured populations make association mapping of diversity panels not optimal. Joint linkage mapping of nested populations avoids the later constraint, while populations crossed with a common domesticated parent allow the evaluation of wild variation within a more adapted background. Three domesticated by wild backcrossed-inbred-line populations (BC<sub>1</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) were developed using three wild accessions representing the full range of rainfall of the Mesoamerican wild bean distribution crossed to the elite drought tolerant domesticated parent SEA 5. These populations were evaluated under field conditions in three environments, two fully irrigated trials in two seasons and a simulated terminal drought in the second season. The goal was to test if these populations responded differently to drought stress and contained progenies with higher yield than SEA 5, not only under drought but also under water-watered conditions. Results revealed that the two populations derived from wild parents of the lower rainfall regions produced lines with higher yield compared to the domesticated parent in the three environments, i.e., both in the drought-stressed environment and in the well-watered treatments. Several progeny lines produced yields, which on average over the three environments were 20% higher than the SEA 5 yield. Twenty QTLs for yield were identified in 13 unique regions on eight of the 11 chromosomes of common bean. Five of these regions showed at least one wild allele that increased yield over the domesticated parent. The variation explained by these QTLs ranged from 0.6 to 5.4% of the total variation and the additive effects ranged from -164 to 277 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, with evidence suggesting allelic series for some QTLs. Our results underscore the potential of wild variation, especially from drought-stressed regions, for bean crop improvement as well the identification of regions for efficient marker-assisted introgression.
