Investigation into plant-fungal pathogen interactions is one of the most interesting fields in plant sciences. However, the roles of plant volatile organic compounds in the arms race are still largely unknown. Based on precise quantification of plant volatiles, we discovered that the plant volatile organic compound (E)-2-hexenal, at concentrations that were similar to or lower than those in tissues of strawberry and tomato fruits, upregulates sulfate assimilation in spores and hyphae of the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. This upregulation is independent of the types of sulfur sources in the plant and can be achieved in the presence of inorganic sulfate and organic sulfur sources. Using the fungal deletion mutants, we further found that sulfate assimilation is involved in the infection of tomato and strawberry fruits by B. cinerea, and that the severity of the disease is proportional to the sulfate content in the fruits. Both before and during the infection, (E)-2-hexenal induced utilisation of plant sulfate by B. cinerea facilitates its pathogenesis through enhancing its tolerance to oxidative stress. This work provides novel insights into the role of plant volatiles in plant-fungal pathogen interaction and highlights the importance of sulfur levels in the host in the prevention of grey mould disease.
