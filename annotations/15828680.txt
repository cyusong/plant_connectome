In the last five years, we have gained significant insight into the role of the Potexvirus proteins in virus movement and RNA silencing. Potexviruses require three movement proteins, named triple gene block (TGB)p1, TGBp2, and TGBp3, and the viral coat protein (CP) to facilitate viral cell-to-cell and vascular transport. TGBp1 is a multifunctional protein that has RNA helicase activity, promotes translation of viral RNAs, increases plasmodesmal size exclusion limits, and suppresses RNA silencing. TGBp2 and TGBp3 are membrane-binding proteins. CP is required for genome encapsidation and forms ribonucleoprotein complexes along with TGBp1 and viral RNA. This review considers the functions of the TGB proteins, how they interact with each other and CP, and how silencing suppression might be linked to viral transport. A new model of the mechanism for Potexvirus transport is proposed.
