Rice is a salt-sensitive crop. Complex gene regulatory cascades are likely involved in salinity stress in rice roots. microRNA168 (miR168) is a conserved miRNA among different plant species. It in-directly regulates the expression of all miRNAs by targeting gene ARGONAUTE1(AGO1). Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) technology is an ideal approach to study miRNA functions by in-activating mature miRNA in plants. In this study, rice miR168 was inactivated by STTM. The T3 generation seedlings of STTM168 exhibited significantly enhanced salt resistance. Direct target genes of rice miR168 were obtained by in silico prediction and further confirmed by degradome-sequencing. PINHEAD (OsAGO1), which was previously suggested to be a plant abiotic stress response regulator. RNA-Seq was performed in root samples of 150mM salt-treated STTM168 and control seedlings. Among these screened 481 differentially expressed genes within STTM168 and the control, 44 abiotic stress response related genes showed significant difference, including four known salt-responsive genes. Based on sequencing and qRT-PCR, a "miR168-AGO1-downstream" gene regulation model was proposed to be responsible for rice salt stress response. The present study proved miR168-AGO1 cascade to play important role in rice salinity stress responding, as well as to be applied in agronomic improvement in further.
