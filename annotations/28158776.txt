['28158776', 'The development of functional chloroplasts, which is assisted by a series of  nuclear-encoded auxiliary protein factors, is essential for plant autotrophic  growth and development. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying  chloroplast development, we isolated and characterized a pigment-defective  mutant, pdm2, and its corresponding variegated RNA interference (RNAi) lines in  Arabidopsis. Sequence analysis revealed that PDM2 encodes a pentatricopeptide  repeat protein that belongs to the P subgroup. Confocal microscopic analysis and  immunoblotting of the chloroplast protein fraction showed that PDM2 was located  in the stroma. In RNAi plants, protein-related photosynthesis was severely  compromised. Furthermore, analysis of the transcript profile of chloroplast genes  revealed that plastid-encoded polymerase-dependent transcript levels were  markedly reduced, while nuclear-encoded polymerase-dependent transcript levels  were increased, in RNAi plants. In addition, PDM2 affects plastid RNA editing  efficiency in most editing sites, apparently by directly interacting with  multiple organellar RNA editing factor 2 (MORF2) and MORF9. Thus, our results  demonstrate that PDM2 is probably involved in the regulation of plastid gene  expression required for normal chloroplast development.', '2017 Apr 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcx004', 'Xiao']
