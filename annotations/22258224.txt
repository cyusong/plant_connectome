['22258224', 'In plant mitochondria and plastids, RNA editing alters about 400 and about 35 C  nucleotides into Us, respectively. Four of these RNA editing events in plant  mitochondria specifically require the PPR protein MEF7, characterized by E and  DYW extension domains. The gene for MEF7 was identified by genomic mapping of the  locus mutated in plants from EMS treated seeds. The SNaPshot screen of the mutant  plant population identified two independent EMS mutants with the same editing  defects as a corresponding T-DNA insertion line of the MEF7 gene. Although the  amino acid codons introduced by the editing events are conserved throughout  flowering plants, even the combined failure of four editing events does not  impair the growth efficiency of the mutant plants. Five nucleotides are conserved  between the four affected editing sites, but are not sufficient for specific  recognition by MEF7 since they are also present at three other sites which are  unaffected in the mutants.', '2012 Feb', 'RNA Biol', '10.4161/rna.18644', 'Takenaka']
