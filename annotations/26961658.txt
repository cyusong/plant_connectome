['26961658', 'Two-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a subfamily (TPC1-3) of eukaryotic voltage- and  ligand-gated cation channels with two non-equivalent tandem pore-forming subunits  that dimerize to form quasi-tetramers. Found in vacuolar or endolysosomal  membranes, they regulate the conductance of sodium and calcium ions,  intravesicular pH, trafficking and excitability. TPCs are activated by a decrease  in transmembrane potential and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations,  are inhibited by low luminal pH and calcium, and are regulated by  phosphorylation. Here we report the crystal structure of TPC1 from Arabidopsis  thaliana at 2.87 A resolution as a basis for understanding ion permeation,  channel activation, the location of voltage-sensing domains and regulatory  ion-binding sites. We determined sites of phosphorylation in the amino-terminal  and carboxy-terminal domains that are positioned to allosterically modulate  cytoplasmic Ca(2+) activation. One of the two voltage-sensing domains (VSD2)  encodes voltage sensitivity and inhibition by luminal Ca(2+) and adopts a  conformation distinct from the activated state observed in structures of other  voltage-gated ion channels. The structure shows that potent pharmacophore  trans-Ned-19 (ref. 17) acts allosterically by clamping the pore domains to VSD2.  In animals, Ned-19 prevents infection by Ebola virus and other filoviruses,  presumably by altering their fusion with the endolysosome and delivery of their  contents into the cytoplasm.', '2016 Mar 10', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature17194', 'Stroud']
