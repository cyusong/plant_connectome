Flower and fruit colors are important agronomic traits. To date, there is no forward genetic evidence that the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene is responsible for the white flower color in peach (Prunus persica). In this study, genetic analysis indicated that the white-flower trait is monogenetic, is recessive to the non-white allele, and shows pleiotropic effects with non-white-flowered types. The genetic locus underpinning this trait was mapped onto chromosome 3 between 0.421951 and 3.227115 Mb by using bulked segregant analysis in conjunction with whole-genome sequencing, and was further mapped between 0 and 1.178149 Mb by using the backcross 1 (BC<sub>1</sub> ) population. Finally, the locus was fine-mapped within 535.974- and 552.027-kb intervals by using 151 F<sub>2</sub> individuals and 75 individuals from a BC<sub>1</sub> self-pollinated (BC<sub>1</sub> S<sub>1</sub> ) population, respectively. Pp3G013600, encoding a GST that is known to transport anthocyanin, was identified within the mapping interval. The analysis of genome sequence data showed Pp3G013600 in white flowers has a 2-bp insertion or a 5-bp deletion in the third exon. These variants likely render the GST non-functional because of early stop codons that reduce the protein length from 215 amino acids to 167 and 175 amino acids, respectively. Genetic markers based on these variants validated a complete correlation between the GST loss-of-function alleles and white flower in 128 peach accessions. This correlation was further confirmed by silencing of Pp3G013600 using virus-induced gene silencing technology, which reduced anthocyanin accumulation in peach fruit. The new knowledge from this study is useful for designing peach breeding programs to generate cultivars with white flower and fruit skin.
