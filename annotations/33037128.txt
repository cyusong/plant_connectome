Seed dormancy is an adaptive trait that is crucial to plant survival. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the primary phytohormone that induces seed dormancy. However, little is known about how the level of ABA in seeds is determined. Here we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) H3K27me3 demethylase RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING6 (REF6) suppresses seed dormancy by inducing ABA catabolism in seeds. Seeds of the <i>ref6</i> loss-of-function mutants displayed enhanced dormancy that was associated with increased endogenous ABA content. We further show that the transcripts of two genes key to ABA catabolism, <i>CYP707A1</i> and <i>CYP707A3</i>, but not genes involved in ABA biosynthesis, were significantly reduced in <i>ref6</i> mutants during seed development and germination. In developing siliques, REF6 bound directly to <i>CYP707A1</i> and <i>CYP707A3</i>, and was responsible for reducing their H3K27me3 levels. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the enhanced seed dormancy and ABA concentration in <i>ref6</i> depended mainly on the reduced expression of <i>CYP707A1</i> and <i>CYP707A3</i> Conversely, overexpression of <i>CYP707A1</i> could offset the enhanced seed dormancy of <i>ref6</i> Taken together, our results revealed an epigenetic regulation mechanism that is involved in the regulation of ABA content in seeds.
