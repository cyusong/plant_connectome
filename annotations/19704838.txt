Morphogenesis in fucoid algae begins with adhesive secretion and rhizoid germination, developmental events that secure the alga within the intertidal zone. The importance of the actin cytoskeleton during these processes has been well established; but in general, little is known about actin regulation within the stramenopile lineage. Based on conserved strategies for regulation of actin in other lineages, co-localization of the Arp2/3 complex with actin structures that are essential for rhizoid formation may implicate members of the Rho family of small GTPases in the signaling pathway(s) regulating actin polymerization during fucoid development. Our lab recently demonstrated Rac1 dependent regulation of endomembrane polarization, polarization of adhesive secretion, germination and tip growth in the fucoid brown alga Silvetia compressa. We also present new evidence revealing Rac1 localization during germination in S. compressa, and show that membrane localization is essential for proper Rac1 function.
