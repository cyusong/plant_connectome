['18364466', 'Rapid activation of phospholipase D (PLD), which hydrolyzes membrane lipids to  generate phosphatidic acid (PA), occurs under various hyperosmotic conditions,  including salinity and water deficiency. The Arabidopsis thaliana PLD family has  12 members, and the function of PLD activation in hyperosmotic stress responses  has remained elusive. Here, we show that knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) of  previously uncharacterized PLDalpha3 alter plant response to salinity and water  deficit. PLDalpha3 uses multiple phospholipids as substrates with distinguishable  preferences, and alterations of PLDalpha3 result in changes in PA level and  membrane lipid composition. PLDalpha3-KO plants display increased sensitivities  to salinity and water deficiency and also tend to induce abscisic acid-responsive  genes more readily than wild-type plants, whereas PLDalpha3-OE plants have  decreased sensitivities. In addition, PLDalpha3-KO plants flower later than  wild-type plants in slightly dry conditions, whereas PLDalpha3-OE plants flower  earlier. These data suggest that PLDalpha3 positively mediates plant responses to  hyperosmotic stresses and that increased PLDalpha3 expression and associated  lipid changes promote root growth, flowering, and stress avoidance.', '2008 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056390', 'Wang']
