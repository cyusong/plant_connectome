['10898978', 'The phragmoplast executes cytokinesis in higher plants. The major components of  the phragmoplast are microtubules, which are arranged in two mirror-image arrays  perpendicular to the division plane [1]. The plus ends of these microtubules are  located near the site of the future cell plate. Golgi-derived vesicles are  transported along microtubules towards the plus ends to deliver materials bound  for the cell plate [2] [3]. During cell division, rapid microtubule  reorganization in the phragmoplast requires the orchestrated activities of  microtubule motor proteins such as kinesins. We isolated an Arabidopsis cDNA  clone of a gene encoding an amino-terminal motor kinesin, AtPAKRP1, and have  determined the partial sequence of its rice homolog. Immunofluorescence  experiments with two sets of specific antibodies revealed consistent localization  of AtPAKRP1 and its homolog in Arabidopsis and rice cells undergoing anaphase,  telophase and cytokinesis. AtPAKRP1 started to accumulate along microtubules  towards the spindle midzone during late anaphase. Once the phragmoplast  microtubule array was established, AtPAKRP1 conspicuously localized to  microtubules near the future cell plate. Our results provide evidence that  AtPAKRP1 is a hitherto unknown motor that may take part in the establishment  and/or maintenance of the phragmoplast microtubule array.', '2000 Jun 29', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00564-9', 'Liu']
