<i>Hopea hainanensis</i> (Dipterocarpaceae) is an endangered tree species restricted to Hainan Island, China, and a small part of Northern Vietnam. On Hainan Island, it is an important indicator species for tropical forests. The wood of <i>Hopea hainanensis</i> has a very high utilization value in nature since it is compact in structure, hard in texture, not easily deformed after drying, durable, and resistant to sunlight and water. As a result of its high quality, it has been felled and mined by humans without restraint, resulting in a reduction of its population size, severe habitat fragmentation, and a sharp decline in its population. Therefore, its conservation biology needs to be researched urgently. Researchers are currently focusing on the ecological factors and seed germination in the habitat of <i>Hopea hainanensis</i> to determine its endangered status. In the literature, there are no systematic analyses of the endangered mechanism of <i>Hopea hainanensis</i> in terms of genetic diversity. It focuses especially on the systematic genetic diversity of <i>Hopea hainanensis</i> in fragmented habitats. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology, 42 samples from seven different cohabitation groups were genotyped. The results showed that the average heterozygosity of the six populations of <i>Hopea hainanensis</i> was 19.77%, which indicated that the genetic diversity of <i>Hopea hainanensis</i> was low. Genetic diversity research is essential for rare and endangered plant protection research. We can find a scientific basis for protecting endangered plants on slope bases by analyzing genetic differences and relationships among populations.
