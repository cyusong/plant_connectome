Iron (Fe) is an indispensable trace mineral element for the normal growth of plants, and it is involved in different biological processes; Fe shortage in plants can induce chlorosis and yield loss. The objective of this research is to identify novel genes that participated in the regulation of Fe-deficiency stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (MYC1) was identified to be interacting with the FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) using a yeast-two-hybrid assay. Transcript-level analysis showed that there was a decrease in MYC1 expression in Arabidopsis to cope with Fe-deficiency stress. Functional deficiency of MYC1 in Arabidopsis leads to an increase in Fe-deficiency tolerance and Fe-accumulation, whereas MYC1-overexpressing plants have an enhanced sensitivity to Fe-deficiency stress. Additionally, MYC1 inhibited the formation of FIT and bHLH38/39 heterodimers, which suppressed the expressed level for Fe acquisition genes FRO2 and IRT1 during Fe-deficiency stress. These results showed that MYC1 functions as a negative modulator of the Fe-deficiency stress response by inhibiting the formation of FIT and bHLH38/39 heterodimers, thereby suppressing the binding of FIT and bHLH38/39 heterodimers to the promoters of FRO2 and IRT1 to modulate Fe intake during Fe-deficiency stress. Overall, the findings of this study elucidated the role of MYC1 in coping with Fe-deficiency stress, and provided potential targets for the developing of crop varieties resistant to Fe-deficiency stress.
