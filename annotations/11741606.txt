['11741606', 'Two Arabidopsis thaliana genes were shown to encode phosphatidylglycerophosphate  synthases (PGPS) of 25.4 and 32.2 kDa, respectively. Apart from their N-terminal  regions, the two proteins exhibit high sequence similarity. Functional expression  studies in yeast provided evidence that the 25.4 kDa protein is a microsomal PGPS  while the 32.2 kDa protein represents a preprotein which can be imported into  yeast mitochondria and processed to a mature PGPS. The two isozymes were  solubilized and purified as fusion proteins carrying a His tag at their  C-terminus. Enzyme assays with both membrane fractions and purified enzyme  fractions revealed that the two A. thaliana isozymes have similar properties but  differ in their CDP-diacylglycerol species specificity.', '2001 Dec 7', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03163-5', 'Frentzen']
