Cupin_1 domain-containing proteins (CDPs) are ubiquitously present in higher plants, which are known to play essential roles in various biological processes. In this study, we carried out genome-wide characterization and systematic investigation of the <i>CDP</i> genes in <i>Brassica napus.</i> A total of 96 BnCDPs, including 71 germin-like proteins (GLPs; proteins with a single cupin_1 domain) and 25 CDP bicupins (proteins with two cupin_1 domains), were identified and clustered into six distinct subfamilies (I-VI) based on the phylogenic analysis, gene structure and motif distribution. Further analysis indicated that whole-genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication are main contributors to the species-specific expansion of the <i>BnCDP</i> gene family, and all the duplicated genes subsequently underwent strong purification selection. The promoter region of <i>BnCDPs</i> showed enrichment of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements associated with development, hormone and stress, as well as transcription factor binding sites, which validates the prediction that <i>BnCDPs</i> are widely involved in plant growth and biotic and abiotic stress responses. The <i>BnCDPs</i> in different subfamilies exhibited obvious differences in expression among 30 developmental tissues/stages of <i>B. napus</i>, implying that <i>BnCDP</i>s may be involved in tissue- and stage-specific developmental processes. Similar trends in expression of most <i>BnCDPs</i> were observed under <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> inoculation and four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA and salinity), particularly the <i>BnGLPs</i> in subfamily I and III with single cupin_1 domain, revealing that <i>BnCDPs</i> are of great importance in the environmental adaption of <i>B. napus</i>. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 274 <i>B. napus</i> core germplasms on <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> resistance and identified four significantly associated loci harboring five <i>BnGLPs</i>. The expression levels of two candidate genes, <i>BnGLP1.A08</i> and <i>BnGLP1.C08</i>, were significantly correlated with <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> resistance. Their functional responses to multiple stages of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> inoculation and four abiotic stresses were further examined through qPCR. Overall, this study provides rich resources for research on the function and evolutionary playground of <i>CDP</i> genes.
