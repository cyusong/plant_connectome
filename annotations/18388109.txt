['18388109', 'The chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex functions in PSI cyclic and  chlororespiratory electron transport in higher plants. Eleven plastid-encoded and  three nuclear-encoded subunits have been identified so far, but the entire  subunit composition, especially of the putative electron donor-binding module, is  unclear. We isolated Arabidopsis thaliana crr23 (chlororespiratory reduction)  mutants lacking NDH activity according to the absence of a transient increase in  Chl fluorescence after actinic light illumination. Although CRR23 shows  similarity to the NdhL subunit of cyanobacterial NDH-1, it has three  transmembrane domains rather than the two in cyanobacterial NdhL. Unlike  cyanobacterial NdhL, CRR23 is essential for stabilizing the NDH complex, which in  turn is required for the accumulation of CRR23. Furthermore, CRR23 and NdhH, a  subunit of chloroplast NDH, co-localized in blue-native gel. All the results  indicate that CRR23 is an ortholog of cyanobacterial ndhL in Arabidopsis, despite  its diversity of structure and function.', '2008 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcn058', 'Shikanai']
