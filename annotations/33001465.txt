['33001465', 'The initial greening of angiosperms involves light activation of photoreceptors  that trigger photomorphogenesis, followed by the development of chloroplasts. In  these semi-autonomous organelles, construction of the photosynthetic apparatus  depends on the coordination of nuclear and plastid gene expression. Here, we show  that the expression of PAP8, an essential subunit of the plastid-encoded RNA  polymerase (PEP) in Arabidopsis thaliana, is under the control of a regulatory  element recognized by the photomorphogenic factor HY5. PAP8 protein is localized  and active in both plastids and the nucleus, and particularly required for the  formation of late photobodies. In the pap8 albino mutant, phytochrome-mediated  signalling is altered, degradation of the chloroplast development repressors  PIF1/PIF3 is disrupted, HY5 is not stabilized, and the expression of the  photomorphogenesis regulator GLK1 is impaired. PAP8 translocates into plastids  via its targeting pre-sequence, interacts with the PEP and eventually reaches the  nucleus, where it can interact with another PEP subunit pTAC12/HMR/PAP5. Since  PAP8 is required for the phytochrome B-mediated signalling cascade and the  reshaping of the PEP activity, it may coordinate nuclear gene expression with  PEP-driven chloroplastic gene expression during chloroplast biogenesis.', '2020 Nov 16', 'EMBO J', '10.15252/embj.2020104941', 'ORCID:']
