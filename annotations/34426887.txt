Arabidopsis AtPRP17, a homolog of yeast splicing factor gene PRP17, is expressed in siliques and embryos and functions in embryo development via regulating embryonic patterning. Yeast splicing factor PRP17/CDC40 is essential for cell growth through involvement in cell cycle regulation. Arabidopsis genome encodes a homolog of PRP17, AtPRP17; however, its function in Arabidopsis development is unknown. This study showed that AtPRP17 was highly expressed in siliques and embryos, and the protein was localized in the nucleus. The loss-of-function mutation of AtPRP17 led to shrunken seeds in Arabidopsis mature siliques. Further analysis revealed that the defective mature seeds of the mutant resulted from abnormal embryos with shriveled cotyledons, unequal cotyledons, swollen and shortened hypocotyls, or shortened radicles. During embryogenesis, mutant embryos showed delayed development and defective patterning of the apical and base domains, such as inhibited cotyledons and disorganized quiescent center cells and columella. Our results suggested that AtPRP17 functions in Arabidopsis embryo development via regulating embryonic patterning.
