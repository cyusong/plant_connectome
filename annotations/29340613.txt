Plants generally produce more biomass when all nutrients are available in sufficient amounts. In addition to environmental constraints, genetic and developmental factors, such as the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, restrict maximal biomass yield. Here, we report the peculiar observation that a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions produced larger shoot rosette diameters when grown in zinc (Zn)-deficient conditions, compared with Zn-sufficient conditions. This was associated with early flowering that restricted the leaf length under Zn sufficiency. Zinc deficiency repressed the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which encodes a major regulator of flowering. Repression or loss of FT increased the rosette diameter via a delay of the transition to flowering, a longer phase of leaf growth, and an increased leaf number. The transition to flowering reduced, but did not terminate, the proliferation of established leaves. The size of individual leaf mesophyll cells was not affected by Zn deficiency or by loss of FT, indicating that the larger rosette diameter was caused by maintained proliferation of vegetative tissue. As a consequence, early-flowering accessions under Zn deficiency grew to have larger rosette diameters due to a delay of flowering, which explains the unusual increase of vegetative biomass under nutrient deficiency.
