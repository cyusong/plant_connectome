Our agricultural systems are now in urgent need to secure food for a growing world population. To meet this challenge, we need a better characterization of plant genetic and phenotypic diversity. The combination of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics enables a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the complex architecture of many phenotypic traits of agricultural relevance. We review the recent advances in plant genomics to see how these can be integrated with broad molecular profiling approaches to improve our understanding of plant phenotypic variation and inform crop breeding strategies.
