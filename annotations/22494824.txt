A high-flux region, 5mm from the root tips of seedlings of coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), soybean (Glycine max), zucchini (Cucurbita pepo) and pea (Pisum sativum), was monitored using a microelectrode ion flux measurement system, for changes in the net fluxes of H(+), NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) in response to shoot removal. In all species, careful excision of the seedling shoot had no significant effect on the net fluxes of H(+), NH(4)(+) or NO(3)(-) measured 5mm from the root tip. Experiments were carried out for up to 80min after shoot removal, and no temporal interactions were noted.

Gene: !affects! Net fluxes of H(+), NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) 
Shoot removal: !has no effect on! Net fluxes of H(+), NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-)
