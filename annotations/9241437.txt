['9241437', 'Mutagenesis and subsequent selection of Arabidopsis thaliana plantlets on a  growth inhibitory concentration of lysine has led to the isolation of  lysine-resistant mutants. The ability to grown on 2 mM lysine has been used to  isolate mutants that may contain an aspartate kinase with altered  regulatory-feedback properties. One of these mutants (RL 4) was characterized by  a relative enhancement of soluble lysine. The recessive monogenic nuclear  transmission of the resistance trait was established. It was associated with an  aspartate kinase less sensitive to feedback inhibition by threonine. Two mutants  (RLT 40 and RL 4) in Arabidopsis, characterized by an altered regulation of  aspartate kinase, were crossed to assess the effects of the simultaneous presence  of these different aspartate kinase forms. A double mutant (RLT40 x RL4) was  isolated and characterized by two feedback-desensitized isozymes of aspartate  kinase to, respectively, lysine and threonine but no threonine and/or lysine  overproduction was observed. Genetical analysis of this unique double aspartate  kinase mutant indicated that both mutations were located on chromosome 2, but  their loci (ak1 and ak2) were found to be unlinked.', '1997 Apr', 'Biochem Genet', '10.1023/a:1022265825402', 'Jacobs']
