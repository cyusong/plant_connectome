Evidence indicates that the mechanisms controlling photosynthesis efficiency also regulate plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. Light-induced cell death is genetically maintained for the control of innate immunity. In a recent study we showed that the expression of AtWDR26 was induced by light, multiple plant hormones, and abiotic stress; increased AtWDR26 strongly upregulated gene groups related to chloroplast metabolism, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses in transgenic plants demonstrated the involvement of AtWDR26 in signaling pathways; these controls were osmotic as well as salt stress tolerance. More detailed transcriptome evidence suggested that AtWDR26 was a powerful inducer of gene expression associated with chloroplast metabolism. This included the electron transport chain of the photosystem, carbohydrate synthesis, and enzymatic activity involved in photorespiration. Moreover, genes in auxin synthesis (and perception) constituted a significant portion of those that were upregulated. Gene expression involved in disease resistance, control of cell wall flexibility, Zn uptake, and AP2/ERF transcription factors was also be upregulated. We concluded that AtWDR26 is one component in the regulatory network between light-regulated plant growth and the adaptation response to disease resistance and abiotic stress. Auxin signal acts downstream for AtWDR26 regulation and the adaptation response to biotic and abiotic stress: this occurs through modulating cell wall flexibility, Zn homeostasis, and controlling stress-related transcription factors.
