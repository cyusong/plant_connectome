In vitro culture plants of Typhonium flagelliforme were found to decolorize a variety of dyes, including Malachite Green, Red HE 8B, Methyl Orange, Reactive Red 2, Direct Red 5B (DR5B), Red HE 7B, Golden Yellow HER, Patent Blue, and Brilliant Blue R (BBR), to varying extents within 4 days. The enzymatic analysis of plant roots of aseptically raised plantlets performed before and after degradation of the dye BBR by these plantlets showed a significant induction in the activities of peroxidase, laccase, tyrosinase, and 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol reductase, which indicated the involvement of these enzymes in the metabolism of the dye. Comparative study of the enzyme status of the plants Typhonium flagelliforme and Blumea malcolmii during the degradation of DR5B and BBR showed marked variations in the enzyme profile with respect to the use of different sources of the enzyme. Phytoremediation of BBR using Typhonium flagelliforme was confirmed with high performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis performed before and after the degradation of the dye. One of the products of the metabolism of the dye was identified as 4-(4-ethylimino-cyclohexa-2,5-dienylidinemethyl)-phenylamine with the aid of gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis. Significant decrease in the American Dye Manufacturer's Institute, biological oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand values of synthetic mixture of textile dyes and industrial effluent confirmed the decolorization and detoxification. Phytotoxicity studies also revealed the nontoxic nature of the metabolites of BBR.
