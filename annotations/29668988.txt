The plant hormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. A chemical genetic approach has greatly contributed to the identification of important genes in auxin biosynthesis, transport and signaling. Molecular genetic technologies and structural information for auxin regulatory components have accelerated the identification and characterization of many novel small molecule modulators in auxin biology. These modulators have been widely utilized to dissect auxin responses. Here we provide an overview of the structure, primary target, in planta activity and application of small molecule modulators in auxin biology.
