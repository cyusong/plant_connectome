In Artemisia annua plants, glandular trichomes (GTs) are responsible for the biosynthesis and secretion of sesquiterpene lactones including artemisinin/arteannuin B. Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) in plants bind and carry lipid molecules across the cell membrane and are also known as secretary proteins. Interestingly, the transcripts of LTP genes are exceptionally abundant in the GTs of A. annua. In the present study, we isolated two trichome-specific LTP genes (AaLTP3 and AaLTP4) from a Korean ecotype of A. annua. AaLTP3 was expressed abundantly in shoots, whereas AaLTP4 was expressed in flowers. The GUS signal driven by the AaLTP3 or AaLTP4 promoter in transgenic A. annua plants revealed that the AaLTP3 promoter was active on hair-like non-GTs and that the AaLTP4 promoter was active on GTs. Analysis of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) fluorescence fused with the AaLTP3 or AaLTP4 protein in transgenic tobacco revealed that ECFP florescence was very bright on secreted lipids of long GTs. Moreover, the florescence was also bright on the head cells of short trichomes and their secreted granules. Immunoblotting analysis of GT exudates in petioles of A. annua revealed a strong positive signal against the AaLTP4 antibody. Overexpression of AaLTP3 or AaLTP4 in transgenic A. annua plants resulted in enhanced production of sesquiterpene lactones (arteannuin B, artemisinin, dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid) compared with those of wild type. The present study shows that LTP genes (AaLTP3 or AaLTP4) play important roles in the sequestration and secretion of lipids in GTs of A. annua, which is useful for the enhanced production of sesquiterpene lactones by genetic engineering.
