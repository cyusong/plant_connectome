The v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) family of transcription factors is extensively distributed across the plant kingdom. However, the functional significance of red maple (Acer rubrum) MYB transcription factors remains unclear. Our research identified 393 MYB transcription factors in the Acer rubrum genome, and these ArMYB members were unevenly distributed across 34 chromosomes. Among them, R2R3 was the primary MYB sub-class, which was further divided into 21 sub-groups with their Arabidopsis homologs. The evolution of the ArMYB family was also investigated, with the results revealing several R2R3-MYB sub-groups with expanded membership in woody species. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of ArMYB89 in red maple. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that ArMYB89 expression was significantly up-regulated in red leaves in contrast to green leaves. Sub-cellular localization experiments indicated that ArMYB89 was localized in the nucleus. Further experiments revealed that ArMYB89 could interact with ArSGT1 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of ArMYB89 in tobacco enhances the anthocyanin content of transgenic plants. In conclusion, our results contribute to the elucidation of a theoretical basis for the ArMYB gene family, and provide a foundation for further characterization of the biological roles of MYB genes in the regulation of Acer rubrum leaf color.
