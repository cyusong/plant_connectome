The main mechanism of plant tolerance is the avoidance of metal uptake, whereas the main mechanism of hyperaccumulation is the uptake and neutralization of metals through specific plant processes. These include the formation of symbioses with rhizosphere microorganisms, the secretion of substances into the soil and metal immobilization, cell wall modification, changes in the expression of genes encoding heavy metal transporters, heavy metal ion chelation, and sequestration, and regenerative heat-shock protein production. The aim of this work was to review the natural plant mechanisms that contribute towards increased heavy metal accumulation and tolerance, as well as a review of the hyperaccumulator phytoremediation capacity. Phytoremediation is a strategy for purifying heavy-metal-contaminated soils using higher plants species as hyperaccumulators.
