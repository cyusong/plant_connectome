Jasmonic acid (JA) is a critical hormonal regulator of plant growth and defense. To advance our understanding of the architecture and dynamic regulation of the JA gene regulatory network, we performed a high-resolution RNA-seq time series of methyl JA-treated <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> at 15 time points over a 16-h period. Computational analysis showed that methyl JA (MeJA) induces a burst of transcriptional activity, generating diverse expression patterns over time that partition into distinct sectors of the JA response targeting specific biological processes. The presence of transcription factor (TF) DNA binding motifs correlated with specific TF activity during temporal MeJA-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Insight into the underlying dynamic transcriptional regulation mechanisms was captured in a chronological model of the JA gene regulatory network. Several TFs, including MYB59 and bHLH27, were uncovered as early network components with a role in pathogen and insect resistance. Analysis of subnetworks surrounding the TFs ORA47, RAP2.6L, MYB59, and ANAC055, using transcriptome profiling of overexpressors and mutants, provided insights into their regulatory role in defined modules of the JA network. Collectively, our work illuminates the complexity of the JA gene regulatory network, pinpoints and validates previously unknown regulators, and provides a valuable resource for functional studies on JA signaling components in plant defense and development.
