Auxin is essential for regulating plant growth and development as well as the response of plants to abiotic stresses. AUX/LAX proteins are auxin influx transporters belonging to the amino acid permease family of proton-driven transporters, and are involved in the transport of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). However, how <i>AUX/LAX</i> genes respond to abiotic stresses in Chinese hickory is less studied. For the first time identification, structural characteristics as well as gene expression analysis of the <i>AUX/LAX</i> gene family in Chinese hickory were conducted by using techniques of gene cloning and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Eight <i>CcAUX/LAXs</i> were identified in Chinese hickory, all of which had the conserved structural characteristics of <i>AUX/LAXs</i>. CcAUX/LAXs were most closely related to their homologous proteins in <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> , which was in consistence with their common taxonomic character of woody trees. <i>CcAUX/LAXs</i> exhibited different expression profiles in different tissues, indicating their varying roles during growth and development. A number of light-, hormone-, and abiotic stress responsive <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory elements were detected on the promoters of <i>CcAUX/LAX</i> genes. <i>CcAUX/LAX</i> genes responded differently to drought and salt stress treatments to varying degrees. Furthermore, <i>CcAUX/LAX</i> genes exhibited complex expression changes during Chinese hickory grafting. These findings not only provide a valuable resource for further functional validation of <i>CcAUX/LAXs</i>, but also contribute to a better understanding of their potential regulatory functions during grafting and abiotic stress treatments in Chinese hickory.
