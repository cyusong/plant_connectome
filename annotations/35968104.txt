To predict and mitigate the effects of climate change on communities and ecosystems, the joint effects of extreme climatic events on species interactions need to be understood. Using the common ragweed (<i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i> L.)-leaf beetle (<i>Ophraella communa</i>) system, we investigated the effects of heat wave and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on common ragweed growth, secondary metabolism, and the consequent impacts on the beetle. The results showed that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and heat wave facilitated <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> growth; further, <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> accumulated large amounts of defensive secondary metabolites. Being fed on <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of <i>O. communa</i> (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Overall, under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, heat wave improved the defensive ability of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> against herbivores. On the other hand, enhanced adaptability to climatic changes may aggravate invasive plant distribution, posing a challenge to the control of invasive plants in the future.
