The involvement of SMALL AUXIN-UP RNA (SAUR) proteins in leaf senescence has been more and more acknowledged, but the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays and identified SAUR49 as an interactor of SENESCENCE SUPPRESSED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE (SSPP), which is a PP2C protein phosphatase that negatively regulates Arabidopsis leaf senescence by suppressing the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SARK), as reported previously by our group. The interaction between SAUR49 and SSPP was further confirmed in planta. Functional characterization revealed that SAUR49 is a positive regulator of leaf senescence. The accumulation level of SAUR49 protein increased during natural leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. The transcript level of SAUR49 was upregulated during SARK-induced premature leaf senescence but downregulated during SSPP-mediated delayed leaf senescence. Overexpression of SAUR49 significantly accelerated both natural and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. More importantly, SAUR49 overexpression completely reversed SSPP-induced delayed leaf senescence. In addition, overexpression of SAUR49 reversed the decreased plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity mediated by SSPP. Taken together, the results showed that SAUR49 functions in accelerating the leaf senescence process via the activation of SARK-mediated leaf senescence signaling by suppressing SSPP. We further identified four other SSPP-interacting SAURs, SAUR30, SAUR39, SAUR41 and SAUR72, that may act redundantly with SAUR49 in regulating leaf senescence. All these observations indicated that certain members of the SAUR family may serve as an important hub that integrates various hormonal and environmental signals with senescence signals in Arabidopsis.
