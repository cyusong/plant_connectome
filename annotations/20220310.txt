The initiation of stomatal development in the developing Arabidopsis epidermis is characterized by an asymmetric 'entry' division in which a small cell, known as a meristemoid, and a larger daughter cell is formed. The meristemoid may undergo further asymmetric divisions, regenerating a meristemoid each time, before differentiating into a guard mother cell which divides symmetrically to form a pair of guard cells surrounding a stomatal pore. Recently EPF2 and BASL have emerged as regulators of these asymmetric divisions and here we present results indicating that these two factors operate independently to control stomatal development.

EPF2: !regulates! stomatal development
BASL: !regulates! stomatal development
EPF2: !operates independently of! BASL
