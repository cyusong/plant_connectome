Uptake and translocation of metal nutrients are essential processes for plant growth. Graminaceous species release phytosiderophores that bind to Fe(3+); these complexes are then transported across the plasma membrane. We have characterized OsYSL15, one of the rice (Oryza sativa) YS1-like (YSL) genes that are strongly induced by iron (Fe) deficiency. The OsYSL15 promoter fusion to beta-glucuronidase showed that it was expressed in all root tissues when Fe was limited. In low-Fe leaves, the promoter became active in all tissues except epidermal cells. This activity was also detected in flowers and seeds. The OsYSL15:green fluorescent protein fusion was localized to the plasma membrane. OsYSL15 functionally complemented yeast strains defective in Fe uptake on media containing Fe(3+)-deoxymugineic acid and Fe(2+)-nicotianamine. Two insertional osysl15 mutants exhibited chlorotic phenotypes under Fe deficiency and had reduced Fe concentrations in their shoots, roots, and seeds. Nitric oxide treatment reversed this chlorosis under Fe-limiting conditions. Overexpression of OsYSL15 increased the Fe concentration in leaves and seeds from transgenic plants. Altogether, these results demonstrate roles for OsYSL15 in Fe uptake and distribution in rice plants.
