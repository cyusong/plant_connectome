Enzymatic activities of Oryza sativa expansins, which were heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli , were analyzed. Results suggested that expansins promote degradation of cellulose by cellulase in a synergistic manner. Sustainable production of future biofuels is dependent on efficient saccharification of lignocelluloses. Expansins have received a lot of attention as proteins promoting biological degradation of cellulose using cellulase. The expansins are a class of plant cell wall proteins that induce cell wall loosening without hydrolysis. In this study, the expansins from Oryza sativa were classified using phylogenetic analysis and five proteins were selected for functional evaluation. At low cellulose loading, the cellulase in expansin mixtures was up to 2.4 times more active than in mixtures containing only cellulase, but at high cellulose loading the activity of cellulase in expansin mixtures and cellulase only mixtures did not differ. Furthermore, expansin activity was greater in cellulase mixtures compared with cellulase-deficient mixtures. Therefore, the expansins showed significant synergistic activity with cellulase. Expansin may play an important role in efficient saccharification of cellulose.
