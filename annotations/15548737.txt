['15548737', 'The B3 DNA binding domain is shared amongst various plant-specific transcription  factors, including factors involved in auxin-regulated and abscisic  acid-regulated transcription. Herein, we report the NMR solution structure of the  B3 domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana cold-responsive transcription factor RAV1.  The structure consists of a seven-stranded open beta-barrel and two alpha-helices  located at the ends of the barrel and is significantly similar to the structure  of the noncatalytic DNA binding domain of the restriction enzyme EcoRII. An NMR  titration experiment revealed a DNA recognition interface that enabled us to  propose a structural model of the protein-DNA complex. The locations of the  DNA-contacting residues are also likely to be similar to those of the EcoRII DNA  binding domain.', '2004 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.026112', 'Yokoyama']
