Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC is a perennial twining herb distributed in the semi-arid and saline-alkali areas of coastal regions and has evolved halotolerance. In this study, we present the first comprehensive survey of the metallothionein (MT) gene family in C. rosea. MT proteins belong to a family of low-molecular-weight polypeptides with a high content of cysteine residues, which have an affinity to bind with heavy metal ions. MTs also play important roles in stress responses as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers. A total of six CrMTs were identified in the C. rosea genome and classified into four subgroups by phylogenetic analysis. An analysis of the cis-acting elements revealed that a series of hormone-, stress-, and development-related cis-acting elements were present in the promoter regions of CrMTs. The expression of CrMTs also showed habitat- and environmental stress-regulated patterns in C. rosea. CrMT overexpression in yeast enhanced tolerance to heavy metals and ROS, as well as high osmotic and alkalinity stress, which is consistent with their predicted roles as metal-chelating proteins and ROS scavengers. Our results indicate that the CrMT genes might contribute to the detoxification of plants to metals and provide marked tolerance against abiotic stress. The expression patterns of CrMTs in C. rosea also indicate that CrMTs play important roles in this species' response to extreme environments on tropical islands and reefs, probably by improving the thermotolerance of C. rosea plants.
