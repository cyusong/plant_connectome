The root-knot nematode, <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>, is a major pest in tomato production. <i>Paenibacillus polymyxa</i>, which is primarily found in soil and colonizing roots, is considered a successful biocontrol organism against many pathogens. To evaluate the biocontrol capacity of <i>P. polymyxa</i> LMG27872 against <i>M. incognita</i> in tomato, experiments were conducted both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. A dose-response effect [30, 50, and 100% (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL)] of bacterial suspensions (BSs) on growth and tomato susceptibility to <i>M. incognita</i> with soil drenching as a mode of application was first evaluated. The results show that the biological efficacy of <i>P. polymyxa</i> LMG27872 against <i>M. incognita</i> parasitism in tomato was dose-dependent. A significantly reduced number of galls, egg-laying females (ELF), and second-stage juveniles (J2) were observed in BS-treated plants, in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of <i>P. polymyxa</i> on tomato growth was also dose-dependent. A high dose of BSs had a negative effect on growth; however, this negative effect was not observed when the BS-treated plants were challenged with <i>M. incognita</i>, indicating tolerance or a defense priming mechanism. In subsequent <i>in vivo</i> experiments, the direct effect of BSs was evaluated on J2 mortality and egg hatching of <i>M. incognita</i>. The effect of BS on J2 mortality was observed from 12 to 24 h, whereby <i>M. incognita</i> J2 was significantly inhibited by the BS treatment. The effect of <i>P. polymyxa</i> on <i>M. incognita</i> egg hatching was also dependent on the BS dose. The results show a potential of <i>P. polymyxa</i> LMG27872 to protect plants from nematode parasitism and its implementation in integrated nematode management suitable for organic productions.
