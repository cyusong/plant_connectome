The phytohormone auxin regulates virtually every developmental process in land plants. This regulation is mediated via de-repression of DNA-binding auxin response factors (ARFs). ARFs bind TGTC-containing auxin response cis-elements (AuxREs), but there is growing evidence that additional cis-elements occur in auxin-responsive regulatory regions. The repertoire of auxin-related cis-elements and their involvement in different modes of auxin response are not yet known. Here we analyze the enrichment of nucleotide hexamers in upstream regions of auxin-responsive genes associated with auxin up- or down-regulation, with early or late response, ARF-binding domains, and with different chromatin states. Intriguingly, hexamers potentially bound by basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factors as well as a family of A/T-rich hexamers are more highly enriched in auxin-responsive regions than canonical TGTC-containing AuxREs. We classify and annotate the whole spectrum of enriched hexamers and discuss their patterns of enrichment related to different modes of auxin response.

ARFs: !bind! TGTC-containing auxin response cis-elements 
bHLH/bZIP factors: !potentially bind! A/T-rich hexamers 
AuxREs: !enriched in! auxin-responsive regions 
auxin: !regulates! developmental process 
ARFs: !de-repress! DNA-binding
