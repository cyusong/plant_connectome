Rice, a staple crop for nearly half the planet's population, tends to absorb and accumulate excessive cadmium (Cd) when grown in Cd-contaminated fields. Low levels of Cd can degrade the quality of rice grains, while high levels can inhibit the growth of rice plants. There is genotypic diversity in Cd distribution and Cd tolerance in different rice varieties, but their underlying genetic mechanisms are far from elucidated, which hinders genetic improvements. In this study, a joint study of phenotypic investigation with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analyses of genetic patterns of Cd distribution and Cd tolerance was performed using a biparent population derived from <i>japonica</i> and <i>indica</i> rice varieties. We identified multiple QTLs for each trait and revealed that additive effects from various loci drive the inheritance of Cd distribution, while epistatic effects between various loci contribute to differences in Cd tolerance. One pleiotropic locus, <i>qCddis8</i>, was found to affect the Cd distribution from both roots to shoots and from leaf sheaths to leaf blades. The results expand our understanding of the diversity of genetic control over Cd distribution and Cd tolerance in rice. The findings provide information on potential QTLs for genetic improvement of Cd distribution in rice varieties.
