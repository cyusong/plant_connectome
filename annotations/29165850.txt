Trichomes are the first cell type to be differentiated during the morphogenesis of leaf epidermis and serve as an ideal model to study cellular differentiation. Many genes involved in the patterning and differentiation of trichome cells have been studied over the past decades, and the majority of these genes encode transcription factors that specifically regulate epidermal cell development. However, the upstream regulators of these genes that link early leaf morphogenesis with cell type differentiation are less studied. The TCP proteins are the plant-specific transcription factors involved in regulating diverse aspects of plant development including lateral organ morphogenesis by modulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show that the miR319-regulated class II TCP proteins, notably TCP4, suppress trichome branching in Arabidopsis leaves and inflorescence stem by direct transcriptional activation of GLABROUS INFLORESCENCE STEMS (GIS), a known negative regulator of trichome branching. The trichome branch number is increased in plants with reduced TCP activity and decreased in the gain-of-function lines of TCP4. Biochemical analyses show that TCP4 binds to the upstream regulatory region of GIS and activates its expression. Detailed genetic analyses show that GIS and TCP4 work in same pathway and GIS function is required for TCP4-mediated regulation of trichome differentiation. Taken together, these results identify a role for the class II TCP genes in trichome differentiation, thus providing a connection between organ morphogenesis and cellular differentiation.
