Bacterial spot of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) caused by several Xanthomonas species is one of the most destructive diseases. Genes regulating the hypersensitive resistance and field resistance to X. perforans race T3 have been intensively investigated over the last decade. However, a comparative analysis of cellular responses to the pathogen in susceptible and resistant hosts has not been completed, which prevents the detailed understanding of the interactions between the pathogen and tomato plants. In this study, the characteristics of lesions, stomata, and pathogen colonization in hypersensitive response (HR) PI 128216, field-resistant PI 114490, and susceptible OH 88119 tomato plants after inoculation with green fluorescent protein-labeled X. perforans race T3 bacteria were investigated. Significant differences in developmental processes and the micromorphology of spot lesions among three tomato lines were observed. Our results suggested that the faster lesion development in OH 88119 plants compared with that of the other two lines was associated with a greater increase in the stomatal apertures over a longer period following bacterial inoculation. The depth of bacterial colonization and pathogen density inside infected leaves in OH 88119 were also significantly different from that of resistant tomato plants. Determination of the ultrastructural responses to X. perforans among three tomato lines revealed that cell wall defense response was the main difference between resistant and susceptible tomato lines. These results may provide fundamental information for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating tomato responses to X. perforans race T3.
