Key message In Verticillium wilt, gene silencing indicates that tomato Ve2-gene expression can have a dramatic effect on many defense/stress protein levels while Ve1-gene induction modulates these effects in a negative fashion. In tomato, Verticillium resistance is dependent on the Ve R-gene locus, which encodes two leucine-rich repeat receptor-like proteins, Ve1 and Ve2. During fungal wilt, Ve1 protein is sharply induced while Ve2 appears expressed constitutively throughout disease development; the disease resistance function usually is attributed to the Ve1 receptor alone. To study Ve2 function, levels of Ve2 mRNA were suppressed using RNAi in both susceptible and resistant Craigella tomato near-isolines and protein changes were evaluated at both the mRNA and protein levels. The results indicate that Ve2-gene expression can have dramatic effects on many defense/stress protein levels while the presence of intact Ve1 protein minimizes these effects in a negative fashion. The data suggest an antagonistic relationship between the Ve proteins in which Ve1 modulates the induction of defense/stress proteins by Ve2.

Ve2: !affects! defense/stress protein levels
Ve1: !modulates! Ve2 effects
Ve2: !represses! Ve1 induction
