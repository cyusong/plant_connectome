Accumulation of stilbene phytoalexins stimulates resistance mechanisms against the grapevine fungus Uncinula necator. However, the defensive mechanisms triggered by stilbene synthase (STS) genes, remain largely unknown. Here, we report the function and molecular mechanism of the stilbene synthase gene VpSTS29/STS2 from Vitis pseudoreticulata in the regulation of plant responses to powdery mildew. Stilbene synthesis occurred mainly in root tips and mesophyll cells of transgenic grapevines via transport through the vascular bundles. Overexpression of VpSTS29/STS2 in Vitis vinifera increased the abundance of STSs in mesophyll tissue and resulted in the accumulation of biologically active resveratrol derivatives at the invasion site. Similarly, expression of VpSTS29/STS2 in Arabidopsis increased resistance to Golovinomyces cichoracearum. The VpSTS29/STS2-expressing Arabidopsis lines showed increased piceid accumulation together with more local hypersensitive reactions, inhibition of mycelial growth, and a reduced incidence of pathogens. Transcriptome profiling analyses demonstrated that VpSTS29/STS2-induced defences led to reprograming of global gene expression and activation of salicylic acid (SA) signalling, thus increasing expression of WRKY-MYB transcription factors and other defence response genes. We propose a model for resveratrol-mediated coordination of defence responses in which SA participates in a positive feedback loop.
