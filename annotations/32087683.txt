Elevated temperature as a result of global climate warming, either in form of sudden heatwave (heat shock) or prolonged warming, has profound effects on the growth and development of plants. However, how plants differentially respond to these two forms of elevated temperatures is largely unknown. Here we have therefore performed a comprehensive comparison of multi-level responses of Arabidopsis leaves to heat shock and prolonged warming. The plant responded to prolonged warming through decreased stomatal conductance, and to heat shock by increased transpiration. In carbon metabolism, the glycolysis pathway was enhanced while the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was inhibited under prolonged warming, and heat shock significantly limited the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A. The cellular concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased under both conditions but exhibited a higher induction under heat shock. Interestingly, the transcription factors, class A1 heat shock factors (HSFA1s) and dehydration responsive element-binding proteins (DREBs), were up-regulated under heat shock, whereas with prolonged warming, other abiotic stress response pathways, especially basic leucine zipper factors (bZIPs) were up-regulated instead. Our findings reveal that Arabidopsis exhibits different response patterns under heat shock versus prolonged warming, and plants employ distinctly different response strategies to combat these two types of thermal stress.

Heat shock: !induces! HSFA1s, DREBs 
Prolonged warming: !induces! bZIPs 
Heat shock/Prolonged warming: !increases! H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, antioxidant enzymes 
Heat shock/Prolonged warming: !decreases! stomatal conductance, TCA cycle 
Heat shock/Prolonged warming: !limits! pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A conversion
