['16141450', 'Actin-related proteins (ARPs) are found in the nuclei of all eukaryotic cells,  but their functions are generally understood only in the context of their  presence in various yeast and animal chromatin-modifying complexes. Arabidopsis  thaliana ARP6 is a clear homolog of other eukaryotic ARP6s, including  Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARP6, which was identified as a component of the SWR1  chromatin remodeling complex. We examined the subcellular localization,  expression patterns, and loss-of-function phenotypes for this protein and found  that Arabidopsis ARP6 is localized to the nucleus during interphase but dispersed  away from the chromosomes during cell division. ARP6 expression was observed in  all vegetative tissues as well as in a subset of reproductive tissues. Null  mutations in ARP6 caused numerous defects, including altered development of the  leaf, inflorescence, and flower as well as reduced female fertility and early  flowering in both long- and short-day photoperiods. The early flowering of arp6  mutants was associated with reduced expression of the central floral repressor  gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) as well as MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 4 (MAF4) and  MAF5. In addition, arp6 mutations suppress the FLC-mediated late flowering of a  FRIGIDA-expressing line, indicating that ARP6 is required for the activation of  FLC expression to levels that inhibit flowering. These results indicate that ARP6  acts in the nucleus to regulate plant development, and we propose that it does so  through modulation of chromatin structure and the control of gene expression.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.035196', 'Meagher']
