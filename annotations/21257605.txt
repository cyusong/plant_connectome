['21257605', 'Plant architecture is a predictable but flexible trait. The timing and position  of organ initiation from the shoot apical meristem (SAM) contribute to the final  plant form. While much progress has been made recently in understanding how the  site of leaf initiation is determined, the mechanism underlying the temporal  interval between leaf primordia is still largely unknown. The Arabidopsis ZRIZI  (ZRZ) gene belongs to a large gene family encoding multidrug and toxic compound  extrusion (MATE) transporters. Unique among plant MATE transporters identified so  far, ZRZ is localized to the membrane of a small organelle, possibly the  mitochondria. Plants overexpressing ZRZ in initiating leaves are short, produce  leaves much faster than wild-type plants and show enhanced growth of axillary  buds. These results suggest that ZRZ is involved in communicating a leaf-borne  signal that determines the rate of organ initiation.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcr007', 'Ori']
