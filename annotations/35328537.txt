Flowering is an important link in the life process of angiosperms, and it is also an important sign of the transformation of plants from vegetative to reproductive growth. Although the flowering regulation network of Arabidopsis is well-understood, there has been little research on the molecular mechanisms of perennial woody plant flower development regulation. <i>Populus tomentosa</i> is a unique Chinese poplar species with fast growth, strong ecological adaptability, and a long lifecycle. However, it has a long juvenile phase, which seriously affects its breeding process. Nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) is an important type of transcription factor involved in the regulation of plant flowering. However, there are few reports on <i>PtoNF-Y</i> gene flowering regulation, and the members of the PtNF-YC subfamily are unknown. In this study, four key genes were cloned and analyzed for sequence characteristics, gene structure, genetic evolution, expression patterns, and subcellular localization. The plant expression vector was further constructed, and transgenic Arabidopsis and <i>P. tomentosa</i> plants were obtained through genetic transformation and a series of molecular tests. The flowering time and other growth characteristics were analyzed. Finally, the expression level of flowering genes was detected by quantitative PCR, the interaction between PtoNF-YC and PtoCOL proteins was measured using the yeast two-hybrid system to further explain the flowering regulation mechanism, and the molecular mechanisms by which <i>PtNF-YC6</i> and <i>PtNF-YC8</i> regulate poplar flowering were discussed. These results lay the foundation for elucidating the molecular regulation mechanism of <i>PtoNF-YC</i> in flowering and furthering the molecular design and breeding of poplar, while providing a reference for other flowering woody plants.
