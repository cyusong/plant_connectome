Pitch canker, caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium circinatum</i>, is a global disease affecting many <i>Pinus</i> spp. Often fatal, this disease causes significant mortality in both commercially grown and natural pine forests and is an issue of current and growing concern. <i>F. circinatum</i> isolates collected from three locations in the U.S. state of Florida were shown to be virulent on both slash and loblolly pine, with two of the isolates causing equivalent and significantly larger lesions than those caused by the third isolate during pathogenicity trials. In addition, significant genetic variation in lesion length in the pedigreed slash pine population was evident and rankings of parents for lesion length were similar across isolates. Experimental data demonstrate that both host and pathogen genetics contribute to disease severity. High-quality genomic assemblies of all three isolates were created and compared for structural differences and gene content. No major structural differences were observed among the isolates; however, missing or altered genes do contribute to genomic variation in the pathogen population. This work evaluates in planta virulence among three isolates of <i>F. circinatum</i>, provides genomic resources to facilitate study of this organism, and details comparative genomic methods that may be used to explore the pathogen's contribution to disease development.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
