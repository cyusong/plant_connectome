['19915014', 'Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), which causes disease in  tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), produces  coronatine (COR), a non-host-specific phytotoxin. COR, which functions as a  jasmonate mimic, is required for full virulence of Pst DC3000 and for the  induction of chlorosis in host plants. Previous genetic screens based on  insensitivity to COR and/or methyl jasmonate identified several potential targets  for COR and methyl jasmonate. In this study, we utilized Nicotiana benthamiana  and virus-induced gene silencing to individually reduce the expression of over  4,000 genes. The silenced lines of N. benthamiana were then screened for altered  responses to purified COR. Using this forward genetics approach, several genes  were identified with altered responses to COR. These were designated as ALC (for  altered COR response) genes. When silenced, one of the identified genes, ALC1,  produced a hypersensitive/necrosis-like phenotype upon COR application in a  Coronatine-Insensitive1 (COI1)-dependent manner. To understand the involvement of  ALC1 during the Pst DC3000-host interaction, we used the nucleotide sequence of  ALC1 and identified its ortholog in Arabidopsis (Thylakoid Formation1 [THF1]) and  tomato (SlALC1). In pathogenicity assays performed on Arabidopsis thf1 mutant and  SlALC1-silenced tomato plants, Pst DC3000 induced accelerated coalescing necrotic  lesions. Furthermore, we showed that COR affects ALC1 localization in  chloroplasts in a COI1-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results show that the  virus-induced gene silencing-based forward genetic screen has the potential to  identify new players in COR signaling and disease-associated necrotic cell death.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.148106', 'Mysore']
