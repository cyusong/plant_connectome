In rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings, continuous white-light irradiation inhibited the growth of seminal roots but promoted the growth of crown roots. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of photoinhibition of seminal root growth. Photoinhibition occurred in the absence of nitrogen but increased with increasing nitrogen concentrations. In the presence of nitrogen, photoinhibition was correlated with coiling of the root tips. The seminal roots were most photosensitive 48-72 h after germination during the 7-day period after germination. White-light irradiation for at least 6 h was required for photoinhibition, and the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity was not observed. Experiments with phytochrome mutants showed that far-red light was perceived exclusively by phyA, red light was perceived by both phyA and phyB, and phyC had little or no role in growth inhibition or coiling of the seminal roots. These results also suggest that other blue-light photoreceptors are involved in growth inhibition of the seminal roots. Fluence-response curve analyses showed that phyA and phyB control very low-fluence response and low-fluence response, respectively, in the seminal roots. This was essentially the same as the growth inhibition previously observed at the late stage of coleoptile development (80 h after germination). The photoperceptive site for the root growth inhibition appeared to be the roots themselves. All three phytochrome species of rice were detected immunochemically in roots.
