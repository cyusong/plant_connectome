It is generally accepted that in order to establish a systemic infection in a plant, viruses move from the initially infected cell to the vascular tissues by cell-to-cell movement through plasmodesmata (PD), and load into the vascular conducting tubes (i.e. phloem sieve elements and xylem vessel elements) for long-distance movement. The viral unit in these movements can be a virion or a yet-to-be-defined ribonucleic protein (RNP) complex. Using live-cell imaging, our laboratory has previously demonstrated that membrane-bound replication complexes move cell-to-cell during turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection. Our recent study shows that these membrane-bound replication complexes end up in the vascular conducting tubes, which is likely the case for potato virus X (PVX) also. The presence of TuMV-induced membrane complexes in xylem vessels suggests that viral components could also be found in other apoplastic regions of the plant, such as the intercellular space. This possibility may have implications regarding how we approach the study of plant innate immune responses against viruses.
