The health benefits of anthocyanins impel researchers and food producers to explorer new methods to increase anthocyanin contents in plant foods. Our previous studies revealed a positive role of nitric oxide (NO) in anthocyanin accumulation in radish (Raphanus sativus L.) sprouts. The application of hemin, an inducer of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), can effectively elevate NO production in vivo. Hemin treatment also improves plant growth and stress tolerance. This study is aimed to assess the effects of hemin treatment on anthocyanin production in radish sprouts, and to investigate whether NO signalling is involved in this process. The application of hemin significantly up regulated the expressions of many anthocyanins biosynthesis related structure and regulatory genes, leading to increased anthocyanins accumulation in radish hypocotyls. Hemin treatment also raised NO contents in radish sprouts, probably through enhancing nitrate reductase (NR) activity and Nitric Oxide-Associated 1 (NOA1) expression. Comparing the effects of Zinc Protoporphyrin (ZnPP, HO-1 activity inhibitor), Sodium Nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor) and carboxy-PTIO (cPTIO, NO-scavenger) on anthocyanin and NO production, a positive role of NO signalling has been revealed in hemin-derived anthocyanin accumulation. A positive feedback loop between HO-1 and NO may be involved in regulating this process. Hemin induced anthocyanin accumulation in radish sprouts through HO-1 and NO signalling network.
