Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i> BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple immune receptors.
