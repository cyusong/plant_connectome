The state of etiolation is generally defined by the presence of non-green plastids (etioplasts) in plant tissues that would normally contain chloroplasts. In the commonly used dark-grown seedling system, etiolation is coupled with a type of growth called skotomorphogenesis. Upon illumination, de-etiolation occurs, marked by the transition from etioplast to chloroplast, and, at the seedling level, a switch to photomorphogenic growth. Etiolation and de-etiolation systems are therefore important for understanding both the acquisition of photosynthetic capacity during chloroplast biogenesis and plant responses to light-the most relevant signal in the life and growth of the organism. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries (within the past 2-3 years) in the field of etiolation and de-etiolation, with a particular focus on post-transcriptional processes and ultrastructural changes. We further discuss ambiguities in definitions of the term 'etiolation', and benefits and biases of common etiolation/de-etiolation systems. Finally, we raise several open questions and future research possibilities.

Light: !triggers! De-etiolation 
Etioplast: !transforms to! Chloroplast 
Skotomorphogenesis: !switches to! Photomorphogenic growth 
Post-transcriptional processes: !regulate! Etiolation/De-etiolation 
Ultrastructural changes: !accompany! Etiolation/De-etiolation
