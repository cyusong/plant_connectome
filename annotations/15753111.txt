As a consequence of variation in environmental factors, light being the most important one, a number of photosystem II polypeptides may be reversibly phosphorylated by thylakoid-bound kinase(s). Among them, the reaction centre D1 and D2 polypeptides, the PsbH subunit, and the inner antenna CP43. Here, the separation of two forms of CP43 by high-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is reported. By means of immunoblotting with antibody to phosphothreonine-containing proteins and authentic CP43 and limited proteolysis, these two bands could be identified as the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of CP43. Using non-denaturing isoelectrofocusing, a chromatographically derived CP43-enriched fraction could be resolved into three different native forms of CP43. Among them, one was found to be a phosphorylated form, whereas the other two were dephosphorylated forms of the protein. With respect to other methods, the procedure described here allows the isolation, for the first time, of a fully homogeneous population of this chlorophyll-protein complex, opening the way to the study of the role of phopshorylation on functional properties of this core antenna protein.
