During the last 25 years, the technology to produce recombinant vaccines in plant cells has evolved from modest proofs of the concept to viable technologies adopted by some companies due to significant improvements in the field. Viral-based expression strategies have importantly contributed to this success owing to high yields, short production time (which is in most cases free of tissue culture steps), and the implementation of confined processes for production under GMPs. Herein the distinct expression systems based on viral elements are analyzed. This review also presents the outlook on how these technologies have been successfully applied to the development of plant-based vaccines, some of them being in advanced stages of development. Perspectives on how viral expression systems could allow for the development of innovative oral vaccines constituted by minimally-processed plant biomass are discussed.
