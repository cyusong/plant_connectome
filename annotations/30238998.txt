Drought and heat stress are two major abiotic stresses that tend to co-occur in nature. Recent climate change models predict that the frequency and duration of periods of high temperatures and moisture-deficits are on the rise and can be detrimental to crop production and hence a serious threat for global food security. In this study we examined the impact of short-term heat, drought and combined heat and drought stress on four barley varieties. These stresses were applied during vegetative stage or during heading stages. The impact on root and shoot biomass as well as seed yields were analyzed. This study demonstrated that sensitivity to combined stress was generally greater than heat or drought individually, and greater when imposed at heading than at the vegetative stages. Micromalted seeds collected from plants stressed during heading showed differences in malt extract, beta-glucan content and percent soluble protein. Screening barley germplasm during heading stage is recommended to identify novel sources of tolerance to combined stress. Apart from seed yield, assessing the seed quality traits of concern for the stakeholders and/or consumers should be an integral part of breeding programs for developing new barley varieties with improved heat and drought stress tolerance.
