Heterosis is a commonly observed phenomenon in nature and refers to the superior performance of hybrids relative to both parents. The molecular mechanisms of heterosis are mostly unknown. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to explain the genetic basis of heterosis, and large amounts of QTLs have been mapped for various agronomic traits, but the nature of QTL contributing to heterosis is still enigmatic. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are master regulators in the processes of plant development and trait performance, and many miRNAs are predicted to reside in QTL intervals. We analyzed the expression modes of miRNAs, which were picked up from miRNA databases and chosen from those predicted from QTL intervals by bioinformatic approaches, in different organs at developmental stages of an elite rice hybrid and its parents. All possible modes of action for miRNA expression were detected, but most miRNAs showed nonadditive mode, and different stages and distinct organs displayed different patterns of miRNA expression. A large proportion of miRNAs were not detected for expression in leaves but expressed in the culms and roots of the hybrid at tillering stage. MiRNAs from grain-weight QTL intervals have multiple effects on grain development. Together, our results reveal that miRNAs, especially those from QTL intervals, play roles in heterotic performance in this elite rice hybrid, our results also shade new light on understanding the molecular mechanisms of heterosis.
