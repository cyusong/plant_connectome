There have been few studies on quantifying carotenoid accumulation in carrots, and none have taken the comparative approach. The abundance and distribution of carotenes in carrot roots of three varieties, white, orange, and high carotene mass (HCM) were compared using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Light microscopy has indicated that, in all three varieties, carotenes were most abundant in the secondary phloem and this area was selected for further TEM analysis. While carotenes were extracted during the fixation process for TEM, the high-pressure freezing technique we employed preserved the spaces (CS) left behind by the extracted carotene crystals. Chromoplasts from the HCM variety contained significantly (P < 0.05) more CS than chromoplasts from the orange variety. Chromoplasts from the white variety had few or no CS. There was no significant difference between the HCM and orange varieties in the number of chromoplasts per unit area, but the white variety had significantly (P < 0.05) fewer chromoplasts than the other two varieties. A large number of starch-filled amyloplasts was observed in secondary phloem of the white variety but these were not found in the other two varieties. The results from this comparative approach clearly define the subcellular localization of carotenoids in carrot roots and suggest that while the HCM genotype was selectively bred for increased carotene content, this selection did not lead to increased numbers of carotene-containing chromoplasts but rather greater accumulation of carotene per chromoplast. Furthermore, the results confirm that roots of the white carrot variety retain residual amounts of carotene.
