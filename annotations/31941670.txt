The aerial surfaces of land plants have a protective layer of cuticular wax. Alkanes are common components of these waxes, and their abundance is affected by a range of stresses. The CER16 protein has been implicated in alkane biosynthesis in the cuticular wax of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we identified two new mutant alleles of <i>CER16</i> in Arabidopsis resulting in production of less wax with dramatically fewer alkanes than the wild type. Map-based cloning with genetic analysis revealed that the <i>cer16</i> phenotype was caused by complete loss of <i>AT5G44150</i>, encoding a protein with no known domains or motifs. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that transcripts of <i>CER3</i>, previously shown to play a principal role in alkane production, were markedly reduced in the <i>cer16</i> mutants. To define the relationship between CER3 and CER16, we transformed the full <i>CER3</i> gene into a <i>cer16</i> mutant. Transgenic <i>CER3</i> expression was silenced, and levels of small interfering RNAs targeting <i>CER3</i> were significantly increased. Mutating two major components of the RNA-silencing machinery in a <i>cer16</i> genetic background restored <i>CER3</i> transcript levels to wild-type levels, with the stems restored to wild-type glaucousness. We suggest that <i>CER16</i> deficiency induces post-transcriptional gene silencing of both endogenous and exogenous expression of <i>CER3</i>.
