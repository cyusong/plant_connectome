Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are major virulence factors secreted by the type III secretion systems of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), causing bacterial leaf streak and bacterial blight, respectively, in rice. However, the knowledge of Xoc TAL effector function in promoting bacterial virulence remains limited. Here, we isolated the highly virulent Xoc strain HGA4 from the outbreak region of Huanggang (Hubei, China), which contains four TAL effectors not found in the Chinese model strain RS105. Among these, Tal2b was selected for introduction into RS105, which resulted in a longer lesion length than that in the control. Tal2b directly binds to the promoter region of the gene and activates the expression of OsF3H<sub>03g</sub> , which encodes 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase in rice. OsF3H<sub>03g</sub> negatively regulates salicylic acid (SA)-related defense by directly reducing SA, and it plays a positive role in susceptibility to both Xoc and Xoo in rice. OsF3H<sub>03g</sub> interacts with a uridine diphosphate-glycosyltransferase protein (OsUGT74H4), which positively regulates bacterial leaf streak susceptibility and may inactivate SA via glycosylation modification.
