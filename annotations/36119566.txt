Tobacco is one of the important economic crops all over the world. <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) seriously affects the yield and quality of tobacco leaves. The expression of TMV in tobacco leaves can be analyzed by detecting green fluorescence-related traits after inoculation with the infectious clone of TMV-GFP (Tobacco mosaic virus - green fluorescent protein). However, traditional methods for detecting TMV-GFP are time-consuming and laborious, and mostly require a lot of manual procedures. In this study, we develop a low-cost machine-vision-based phenotyping platform for the automatic evaluation of fluorescence-related traits in tobacco leaf based on digital camera and image processing. A dynamic monitoring experiment lasting 7 days was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of this platform using <i>Nicotiana tabacum L.</i> with a total of 14 samples, including the wild-type strain SR1 and 4 mutant lines generated by RNA interference technology. As a result, we found that green fluorescence area and brightness generally showed an increasing trend over time, and the trends were different among these SR1 and 4 mutant lines samples, where the maximum and minimum of green fluorescence area and brightness were mutant-4 and mutant-1 respectively. In conclusion, the platform can full-automatically extract fluorescence-related traits with the advantage of low-cost and high accuracy, which could be used in detecting dynamic changes of TMV-GFP in tobacco leaves.
