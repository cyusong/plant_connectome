Chloroplasts are indispensable for higher plants. The growth and development of plants are very sensitive to environmental temperature changes, and chloroplast development is also regulated by adverse environmental temperatures. However, the molecular mechanism of how plants coordinate chloroplast development and environmental temperature changes remains largely unknown. Here, a temperature-conditioned chloroplast development defective mutant <i>thermo-sensitive mutant in leaf color 2</i> (<i>tsl2</i>) of <i>Arabidopsis</i> was obtained through a forward genetic screening. The <i>tsl2</i> mutant showed a weak yellowish phenotype at normal growth temperature (22°C), and the phenotype was more pronounced at low growth temperature (16°C) and largely rescued at high growth temperature (29°C). Bulk Segregant Analysis (BSA) revealed that <i>TSL2</i> encodes FtsH-Inactive Protein 5 (FtsHi5). Genetic complementation analysis confirmed that complemented expression of <i>FtsHi5</i> rescued the chlorophyll content and thylakoid development defects observed in <i>tsl2</i> mutants at 16°C. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis with Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) isobaric labeling revealed broad changes in the chloroplast proteome of <i>tsl2</i> mutant plants at low temperature, which is agreed with the impaired chloroplast biogenesis and function in <i>tsl2</i> plants. Together, our data demonstrates that FtsHi5/TSL2 plays an important role in chloroplast development and protein accumulation in chloroplasts, especially at low environmental temperatures in Arabidopsis.
