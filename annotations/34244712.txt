Seed aging is the gradual decline in seed vigor, during which programmed cell death (PCD) occurs. The functions of nitric oxide (NO) are exerted through protein S-nitrosylation, a reversible post-translational modification. During seed aging, more than 80 proteins are S-nitrosylated, but the particular role of individual proteins is unknown. Here, we showed that the S-nitrosylation level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (UpGAPDH) in elm (Ulmus pumila L.) seeds increased after controlled deterioration treatment. UpGAPDH was S-nitrosylated at Cys154 during S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) treatment, and its oligomerization was triggered both in vitro and in elm seeds. Interestingly, UpGAPDH interacted with the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel in an S-nitrosylation-dependent way. Some UpGAPDH-green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts co-localized with mitochondria during the GSNO treatment, while the S-nitrosylation-defective UpGAPDH C154S-GFP protein did not. Seeds of oxUpGAPDH lines showed cell death and lost seed vigor rapidly during controlled deterioration treatment-triggered seed aging, while those overexpressing S-nitrosylation-defective UpGAPDH-Cys154 did not. Our results suggest that S-nitrosylation of UpGAPDH may accelerate cell death and seed deterioration during controlled deterioration treatment. These results provide new insights into the effects of UpGAPDH S-nitrosylation on protein interactions and seed aging.
