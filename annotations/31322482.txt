Effector-dependent manipulation of host transcription is a key virulence mechanism used by <i>Xanthomonas</i> species causing bacterial spot disease in tomato and pepper. Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors employ novel DNA-binding domains to directly activate host transcription, whereas the non-TAL effector XopD uses a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease activity to represses host transcription. The targets of TAL and non-TAL effectors provide insight to the genes governing susceptibility and resistance during <i>Xanthomonas</i> infection. In this study, we investigated the extent to which the <i>X. euvesicatoria</i> non-TAL effector strain Xe85-10 activates tomato transcription to gain new insight to the transcriptional circuits and virulence mechanisms associated with <i>Xanthomonas euvesicatoria</i> pathogenesis. Using transcriptional profiling, we identified a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, bHLH132, as a pathogen-responsive gene that is moderately induced by microbe-associated molecular patterns and defense hormones and is highly induced by XopD during <i>X. euvesicatoria</i> infection. We also found that activation of <i>bHLH132</i> transcription requires the XopD SUMO protease activity. Silencing <i>bHLH132</i> mRNA expression results in stunted tomato plants with enhanced susceptibility to <i>X. euvesicatoria</i> infection. Our work suggests that bHLH132 is required for normal vegetative growth and development as well as resistance to <i>X. euvesicatoria.</i> It also suggests new transcription-based models describing XopD virulence and recognition in tomato.
