Decreased N2 fixation in soybean (Glycine max) L. Merr. during water deficits has been associated with increases in ureides and free amino acids in plant tissues, indicating a potential feedback inhibition by these compounds in response to drought. We evaluated concentrations of ureides and amino acids in leaf and nodule tissue and the concurrent change in N2 fixation in response to exogenous ureides and soil-water treatments for the cultivars Jackson and KS4895. Exogenous ureides applied to the soil and water-deficit treatments inhibited N2 fixation by 85% to 90%. Mn fertilization increased the apparent catabolism of ureides in leaves and hastened the recovery of N2 fixation following exogenous ureide application for both cultivars. Ureides and total free amino acids in leaves and nodules increased during water deficits and coincided with a decline in N2 fixation for both cultivars. N2 fixation recovered to 74% to 90% of control levels 2 d after rewatering drought-stressed plants, but leaf ureides and total nodule amino acids remained elevated in KS4895. Asparagine accounted for 82% of the increase in nodule amino acids relative to well-watered plants at 2 d after rewatering. These results indicate that leaf ureides and nodule asparagine do not feedback inhibit N2 fixation. Compounds whose increase and decrease in concentration mirrored the decline and recovery of N2 fixation included nodule ureides, nodule aspartate, and several amino acids in leaves, indicating that these are potential candidate molecules for feedback inhibition of N2 fixation.
