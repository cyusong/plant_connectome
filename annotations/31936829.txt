Expansins are key regulators of cell-wall extension and are also involved in the abiotic stress response. In this study, we evaluated the function of <i>OsEXPA7</i> involved in salt stress tolerance. Phenotypic analysis showed that <i>OsEXPA7</i> overexpression remarkably enhanced tolerance to salt stress. <i>OsEXPA7</i> was highly expressed in the shoot apical meristem, root, and the leaf sheath. Promoter activity of OsEXPA7:<i>GUS</i> was mainly observed in vascular tissues of roots and leaves. Morphological analysis revealed structural alterations in the root and leaf vasculature of <i>OsEXPA7</i> overexpressing (OX) lines. <i>OsEXPA7</i> overexpression resulted in decreased sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) and accumulated potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) in the leaves and roots. Under salt stress, higher antioxidant activity was also observed in the <i>OsEXPA7</i>-OX lines, as indicated by lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and increased antioxidant activity, when compared with the wild-type (WT) plants. In addition, transcriptional analysis using RNA-seq and RT-PCR revealed that genes involved in cation exchange, auxin signaling, cell-wall modification, and transcription were differentially expressed between the OX and WT lines. Notably, salt overly sensitive 1, which is a sodium transporter, was highly upregulated in the OX lines. These results suggest that <i>OsEXPA7</i> plays an important role in increasing salt stress tolerance by coordinating sodium transport, ROS scavenging, and cell-wall loosening.
