The biochemical function of the Laforin-like dual-specific phosphatase AtSEX4 (EC 3.1.3.48) has been studied. Crystalline maltodextrins representing the A- or the B-type allomorph were prephosphorylated using recombinant glucan, water dikinase (StGWD) or the successive action of both plastidial dikinases (StGWD and AtPWD). AtSEX4 hydrolyzed carbon 6-phosphate esters from both the prephosphorylated A- and B-type allomorphs and the kinetic constants are similar. The phosphatase also acted on prelabeled carbon-3 esters from both crystalline maltodextrins. Similarly, native starch granules prelabeled in either the carbon-6 or carbon-3 position were also dephosphorylated by AtSEX4. The phosphatase did also hydrolyze phosphate esters of both prephosphorylated maltodextrins when the (phospho)glucans had been solubilized by heat treatment. Submillimolar concentrations of nonphosphorylated maltodextrins inhibited AtSEX4 provided they possessed a minimum of length and had been solubilized. As opposed to the soluble phosphomaltodextrins, the AtSEX4-mediated dephosphorylation of the insoluble substrates was incomplete and at least 50% of the phosphate esters were retained in the pelletable (phospho)glucans. The partial dephosphorylation of the insoluble glucans also strongly reduced the release of nonphosphorylated chains into solution. Presumably, this effect reflects fast structural changes that following dephosphorylation occur near the surface of the maltodextrin particles. A model is proposed defining distinct stages within the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation-dependent transition of alpha-glucans from the insoluble to the soluble state.

AtSEX4: !hydrolyzes! Carbon 6-phosphate esters 
AtSEX4: !hydrolyzes! Carbon-3 esters 
AtSEX4: !hydrolyzes! Phosphate esters 
Nonphosphorylated maltodextrins: !inhibit! AtSEX4 
AtSEX4: !partially dephosphorylates! Insoluble glucans 
Partial dephosphorylation: !reduces! Release of nonphosphorylated chains
