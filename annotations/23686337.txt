Juvenile-to-adult phase change is an indispensable event which guarantees a successful life cycle. Phase change has been studied in maize, Arabidopsis and rice, but is mostly unknown in other species. Soybean/Fabaceae plants undergo drastic changes of shoot architecture at the early vegetative stage including phyllotactic change and leaf type alteration from simple to compound. These characteristics make soybean/Fabaceae plants an interesting taxon for investigating vegetative phase change. Following the expansion of two cotyledons, two simple leaves simultaneously emerge in opposite phyllotaxy. The phyllotaxy of the third and fourth leaves is not fixed; both opposite and distichous phyllotaxis are observed within the same population. Leaves were compound from the third leaf. But the third leaf was rarely simple. Morphological and quantitative changes in early vegetative phase were recognized in leaf size, leaf shape, number of trichomes, stipule size and shape, and shoot meristem shape. Two microRNA genes, miR156 and miR172, are known to be associated with vegetative phase change. Examination of the expression level revealed that miR156 expression was high in the first two leaves and subsequently down-regulated, and that of miR172 showed the inverse expression pattern. These expression patterns coincided with the case of other species. Taken all data together, the first and second leaves represent juvenile phase, the fifth and upper leaves adult phase, and the third and fourth leaves intermediate stage. Further investigation of soybean phase change would give fruitful understandings on plant development.
