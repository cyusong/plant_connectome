The generation of oxygen radicals and their derivatives, known as reactive oxygen species, (ROS) is a part of the signaling process in higher plants at lower concentrations, but at higher concentrations, those ROS cause oxidative stress. Salinity-induced osmotic stress and ionic stress trigger the overproduction of ROS and, ultimately, result in oxidative damage to cell organelles and membrane components, and at severe levels, they cause cell and plant death. The antioxidant defense system protects the plant from salt-induced oxidative damage by detoxifying the ROS and also by maintaining the balance of ROS generation under salt stress. Different plant hormones and genes are also associated with the signaling and antioxidant defense system to protect plants when they are exposed to salt stress. Salt-induced ROS overgeneration is one of the major reasons for hampering the morpho-physiological and biochemical activities of plants which can be largely restored through enhancing the antioxidant defense system that detoxifies ROS. In this review, we discuss the salt-induced generation of ROS, oxidative stress and antioxidant defense of plants under salinity.
