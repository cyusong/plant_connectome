Fifty years ago, the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway was first characterized. In the subsequent five decades, much has been learned about C<sub>4</sub> plants, such that it is now possible to place nearly all C<sub>4</sub> species into their respective evolutionary lineages. Sixty-one independent lineages of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis are identified, with additional, ancillary C<sub>4</sub> origins possible in 12 of these principal lineages. The lineages produced ~8100 C<sub>4</sub> species (5044 grasses, 1322 sedges, and 1777 eudicots). Using midpoints of stem and crown node dates in their respective phylogenies, the oldest and most speciose C<sub>4</sub> lineage is the grass lineage Chloridoideae, estimated to be near 30 million years old. Most C<sub>4</sub> lineages are estimated to be younger than 15 million years. Older C<sub>4</sub> lineages tend to be more speciose, while those younger than 7 million years have <43 species each. To further highlight C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis for a 50th anniversary snapshot, a Hall of Fame comprised of the 40 most significant C<sub>4</sub> species is presented. Over the next 50 years, preservation of the Earth's C<sub>4</sub> diversity is a concern, largely because of habitat loss due to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> effects, invasive species, and expanded agricultural activities. Ironically, some members of the C<sub>4</sub> Hall of Fame are leading threats to the natural C<sub>4</sub> flora due to their association with human activities on landscapes where most C<sub>4</sub> plants occur.
