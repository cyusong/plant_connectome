Whereas the role of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ) in plant signaling is well studied, the physiological significance of pH-changes remains largely undefined. Here we developed CapHensor, an optimized dual-reporter for simultaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH ratio-imaging and studied signaling events in pollen tubes (PTs), guard cells (GCs), and mesophyll cells (MCs). Monitoring spatio-temporal relationships between membrane voltage, Ca<sup>2+</sup> - and pH-dynamics revealed interconnections previously not described. In tobacco PTs, we demonstrated Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dynamics lag behind pH-dynamics during oscillatory growth, and pH correlates more with growth than Ca<sup>2+</sup> . In GCs, we demonstrated abscisic acid (ABA) to initiate stomatal closure via rapid cytosolic alkalization followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. Preventing the alkalization blocked GC ABA-responses and even opened stomata in the presence of ABA, disclosing an important pH-dependent GC signaling node. In MCs, a flg22-induced membrane depolarization preceded Ca<sup>2+</sup> -increases and cytosolic acidification by c. 2 min, suggesting a Ca<sup>2+</sup> /pH-independent early pathogen signaling step. Imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH resolved similar cytosol and nuclear signals and demonstrated flg22, but not ABA and hydrogen peroxide to initiate rapid membrane voltage-, Ca<sup>2+</sup> - and pH-responses. We propose close interrelation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> - and pH-signaling that is cell type- and stimulus-specific and the pH having crucial roles in regulating PT growth and stomata movement.
