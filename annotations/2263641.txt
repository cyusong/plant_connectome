['2263641', 'The inability of superoxide dismutase (SOD; superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase,  EC 1.15.1.1)-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli to grow aerobically on minimal  medium can be restored by functional complementation with a heterologous  SOD-encoding sequence. Based upon this property, a phenotypic selection system  has been developed for the isolation of clones containing eukaryotic SOD cDNAs.  cDNA expression libraries from both Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and Arabidopsis  thaliana were transformed into a SOD-deficient E. coli strain by electroporation,  and clones containing functional SODs were selected by growth on minimal medium.  Analysis of these clones revealed the identity of cDNAs encoding the iron form of  superoxide dismutase (FeSOD)--the first SODs of this type to be cloned from  eukaryotes. The presence of this enzyme in these two divergent plant species  challenges previous ideas that FeSOD is found in only a few plant families. In  addition, these results show the potential for shotgun cloning of eukaryotic  genes by complementation of bacterial mutants, particularly when it is combined  with a highly efficient transformation method, such as electroporation.', '1990 Dec', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.87.24.9903', 'Inze']
