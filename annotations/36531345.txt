Transposable elements (TEs) were initially considered redundant and dubbed 'junk DNA'. However, more recently they were recognized as an essential element of genome plasticity. In nature, they frequently become active upon exposition of the host to stress conditions. Even though most transposition events are neutral or even deleterious, occasionally they may happen to be beneficial, resulting in genetic novelty providing better fitness to the host. Hence, TE mobilization may promote adaptability and, in the long run, act as a significant evolutionary force. There are many examples of TE insertions resulting in increased tolerance to stresses or in novel features of crops which are appealing to the consumer. Possibly, TE-driven <i>de novo</i> variability could be utilized for crop improvement. However, in order to systematically study the mechanisms of TE/host interactions, it is necessary to have suitable tools to globally monitor any ongoing TE mobilization. With the development of novel potent technologies, new high-throughput strategies for studying TE dynamics are emerging. Here, we present currently available methods applied to monitor the activity of TEs in plants. We divide them on the basis of their operational principles, the position of target molecules in the process of transposition and their ability to capture real cases of actively transposing elements. Their possible theoretical and practical drawbacks are also discussed. Finally, conceivable strategies and combinations of methods resulting in an improved performance are proposed.
