['24019426', 'The Reduced Wall Acetylation (RWA) proteins are involved in cell wall acetylation  in plants. Previously, we described a single mutant, rwa2, which has about 20%  lower level of O-acetylation in leaf cell walls and no obvious growth or  developmental phenotype. In this study, we generated double, triple, and  quadruple loss-of-function mutants of all four members of the RWA family in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In contrast to rwa2, the triple and quadruple  rwa mutants display severe growth phenotypes revealing the importance of wall  acetylation for plant growth and development. The quadruple rwa mutant can be  completely complemented with the RWA2 protein expressed under 35S promoter,  indicating the functional redundancy of the RWA proteins. Nevertheless, the  degree of acetylation of xylan, (gluco)mannan, and xyloglucan as well as overall  cell wall acetylation is affected differently in different combinations of triple  mutants, suggesting their diversity in substrate preference. The overall degree  of wall acetylation in the rwa quadruple mutant was reduced by 63% compared with  the wild type, and histochemical analysis of the rwa quadruple mutant stem  indicates defects in cell differentiation of cell types with secondary cell  walls.', '2013 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.225193', 'Scheller']
