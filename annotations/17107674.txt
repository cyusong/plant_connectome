['17107674', 'In the outer antenna (LHCI) of higher plant photosystem I (PSI) four abundantly  expressed light-harvesting protein of photosystem I (Lhca)-type proteins are  organized in two heterodimeric domains (Lhca1/Lhca4 and Lhca2/Lhca3). Our  cross-linking studies on PSI-LHCI preparations from wildtype Arabidopsis and pea  plants indicate an exclusive interaction of the rarely expressed Lhca5  light-harvesting protein with LHCI in the Lhca2/Lhca3-site. In PSI particles with  an altered LHCI composition Lhca5 assembles in the Lhca1/Lhca4 site, partly as a  homodimer. This flexibility indicates a binding-competitive model for the LHCI  assembly in plants regulated by molecular interactions of the Lhca proteins with  the PSI core.', '2006 Nov 27', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.10.063', 'Klimmek']
