Nitrate assimilation diminishes under water stress. This can augment the photorespiratory rate as a protection mechanism, increasing the ammonium concentration, which must be rapidly assimilated. We therefore examined the effect of moderate water stress in photorespiration and N assimilation, as possible tolerance mechanisms in cherry tomato. Five cherry tomato cultivars with different degrees of water stress tolerance were submitted to two water treatments: well-watered (100% FC) and water stress (50% FC). In the susceptible cultivars, nitrate assimilation declined but without stimulating photorespiration. Zarina, a stress-tolerant cultivar, showed increased activity of the main enzymes involved in photorespiration, together with greater assimilation of nitrates and of the resulting ammonium. This translates as higher concentrations of N as well as amino acids and proteins. We characterize these mechanisms in the cv. Zarina (tolerant) as essential to water stress tolerance, acting on N metabolism as well as helping to maintain or augment biomass.
