Phosphorus is one of the macro-elements required by plants, but phosphate (Pi), the only form that can be absorbed by plants, is always limited for plant growth and development. To adapt to Pi deficiency, plants have evolved a complex regulatory system to improve Pi acquisition and utilization efficiency. In this study, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to exam the global metabolites and gene expressions profiles responding to Pi deficiency in rice. A total of 23 metabolites were co-changed in leaves and roots after Pi deficiency, with sucrose, trehalose and melibiose significant accumulated. A total of 779 genes were co-changed in these leaves and roots. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes and differentially accumulated metabolites were co-enriched in galactose metabolism. Further exogenous sugars supply with rice roots could induce Pi starvation responsiveness and the expression of OsPHR2, which codes the central regulator for Pi starvation responsiveness in rice. This work revealed the interaction between sugars and phosphate in rice, and the importance of OsPHR2 in this interaction.
