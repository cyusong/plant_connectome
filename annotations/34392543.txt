Ammonium is a preferential nitrogen form for rice (Oryza sativa) grown in paddy field, but the molecular mechanisms for ammonium uptake have not been well understood. We functionally characterized three members belonging to ammonium transporter 1 (AMT1) and investigated their contributions to ammonium uptake. Spatial expression analysis showed that the upregulated expression of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 and downregulated expression of OsAMT1;3 by ammonium were higher in the root mature region than in the root tips. All OsAMT1 members were polarly localized at the distal side of exodermis in the mature region of crown roots and lateral roots. Upon exposure to ammonium, localization of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 was also observed in the endoplasmic reticulum, but their abundance in the plasma membrane was not changed. Single knockout of either gene did not affect ammonium uptake, but knockout of all three genes resulted in 95% reduction of ammonium uptake. However, the nitrogen uptake did not differ between the wild-type rice and triple mutants at high ammonium and nitrate supply. Our results indicate that three OsAMT1 members are cooperatively required for uptake of low ammonium in rice roots and that they undergo a distinct regulatory mechanism in response to ammonium.
