The hexaploid species Echinochloa crus-galli is one of the most detrimental weeds in crop fields, especially in rice paddies. Its evolutionary history is similar to that of bread wheat, arising through polyploidization after hybridization between a tetraploid and a diploid species. In this study, we generated and analyzed high-quality genome sequences of diploid (E. haploclada), tetraploid (E. oryzicola), and hexaploid (E. crus-galli) Echinochloa species. Gene family analysis showed a significant loss of disease-resistance genes such as those encoding NB-ARC domain-containing proteins during Echinochloa polyploidization, contrary to their significant expansionduring wheat polyploidization, suggesting that natural selection might favor reduced investment in resistance in this weed to maximize its growth and reproduction. In contrast to the asymmetric patterns of genome evolution observed in wheat and other crops, no significant differences in selection pressure were detected between the subgenomes in E. oryzicola and E. crus-galli. In addition, distinctive differences in subgenome transcriptome dynamics during hexaploidization were observed between E. crus-galli and bread wheat. Collectively, our study documents genomic mechanisms underlying the adaptation of a major agricultural weed during polyploidization. The genomic and transcriptomic resources of three Echinochloa species and new insights into the polyploidization-driven adaptive evolution would be useful for future breeding cereal crops.
