['16236155', 'GRIP domain proteins are a class of golgins that have been described in yeast and  animals. They locate to the trans-Golgi network and are thought to play a role in  endosome-to-Golgi trafficking. The Arabidopsis GRIP domain protein, AtGRIP, fused  to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), locates to Golgi stacks but does not  exactly co-locate with the Golgi marker sialyl transferase (ST)-mRFP, nor with  the t-SNAREs Memb11, SYP31 and BS14a. We conclude that the location of AtGRIP is  further to the trans side of the stack than STtmd-mRFP. The 185-aa C-terminus of  AtGRIP containing the GRIP domain targeted GFP to the Golgi, although a  proportion of the fusion protein was still found in the cytosol. Mutation of a  conserved tyrosine (Y717) to alanine in the GRIP domain disrupted Golgi  localization. ARL1 is a small GTPase required for Golgi targeting of GRIP domain  proteins in other systems. An Arabidopsis ARL1 homologue was isolated and shown  to target to Golgi stacks. The GDP-restricted mutant of ARL1, AtARL1-T31N, was  observed to locate partially to the cytosol, whereas the GTP-restricted mutant  AtARL1-Q71L labelled the Golgi and a population of small structures. Increasing  the levels of AtARL1 in epidermal cells increased the proportion of GRIP-GFP  fusion protein on Golgi stacks. We show, moreover, that AtARL1 interacted with  the GRIP domain in a GTP-dependent manner in vitro in affinity chromatography and  in the yeast two-hybrid system. This indicates that AtGRIP and AtARL1 interact  directly. We conclude that the pathway involving ARL1 and GRIP domain golgins is  conserved in plants.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02542.x', 'Boevink']
