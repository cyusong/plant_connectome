High-throughput resistance assays in plants have a limited selection of suitable pathogens. In this study, we developed a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> strain chromosomally tagged with the Nanoluc luciferase (NL) from the deep-sea shrimp <i>Oplophorus gracilirostris</i>, a bioluminescent marker significantly brighter than the conventional firefly luciferase. Our reporter strain tagged with NL was more than 100 times brighter than <i>P. syringae</i> tagged with the <i>luxCDABE</i> operon from <i>Photorhabdus luminescens</i>, one of the existing luciferase-based strains. In planta imaging was improved by using the surfactant Silwet L-77, particularly at a lower reporter concentration. Using this imaging system, more than 30 epigenetic mutants were analyzed for their resistance traits because the defense signaling pathway is known to be epigenetically regulated. SWC1, a defense-related chromatin remodeling complex, was found to be a positive defense regulator, which supported one of two earlier conflicting reports. Compromises in DNA methylation in the CG context led to enhanced resistance against virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i>. Dicer-like and Argonaute proteins, important in the biogenesis and exerting the effector function of small RNAs, respectively, showed modest but distinct requirements for effector-triggered immunity and basal resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i>. In addition, the transcriptional expression of an epigenetic component was found to be a significant predictor of its immunity contribution. In summary, this study showcased how a high-throughput resistance assay enabled by a pathogen strain with an improved luminescent reporter could provide insightful knowledge about complex defense signaling pathways.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
