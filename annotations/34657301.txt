Generalised dose-response curves are essential to understand how plants acclimate to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> . We carried out a meta-analysis of 630 experiments in which C<sub>3</sub> plants were experimentally grown at different [CO<sub>2</sub> ] under relatively benign conditions, and derived dose-response curves for 85 phenotypic traits. These curves were characterised by form, plasticity, consistency and reliability. Considered over a range of 200-1200 µmol mol<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> , some traits more than doubled (e.g. area-based photosynthesis; intrinsic water-use efficiency), whereas others more than halved (area-based transpiration). At current atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub> ], 64% of the total stimulation in biomass over the 200-1200 µmol mol<sup>-1</sup> range has already been realised. We also mapped the trait responses of plants to [CO<sub>2</sub> ] against those we have quantified before for light intensity. For most traits, CO<sub>2</sub> and light responses were of similar direction. However, some traits (such as reproductive effort) only responded to light, others (such as plant height) only to [CO<sub>2</sub> ], and some traits (such as area-based transpiration) responded in opposite directions. This synthesis provides a comprehensive picture of plant responses to [CO<sub>2</sub> ] at different integration levels and offers the quantitative dose-response curves that can be used to improve global change simulation models.
