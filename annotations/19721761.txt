<i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) produces a chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine (COR), which has multiple virulence functions in planta. One of the hallmarks of bacterial speck disease on tomato leaves is the formation of necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis. The physiological significance of COR-induced chlorosis in disease development is still unknown. In our recent publication in <i>New Phytologist</i>, we demonstrated that COR-induced effects on photosynthetic machinery resulted in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tomato seedlings inoculated with <i>Pst</i> DC3000 and incubated in light showed more disease-associated necrotic cell death than inoculated seedlings COR suppressed the expression of thylakoid-localized Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (<i>Cu/Zn SOD</i>), but not the cytosolic-localized <i>Cu/Zn SOD</i>. In this addendum, we propose a model for the function of COR as a regulator of plant ROS production in different cellular sites leading to disease-associated necrotic cell death during bacterial speck of tomato.

COR: !induces! chlorosis 
COR: !accumulates! ROS 
Cu/Zn SOD: !localizes to! thylakoid 
Cu/Zn SOD: !localizes to! cytosol 
COR: !suppresses! Cu/Zn SOD expression 
COR: !regulates! ROS production 
ROS: !leads to! necrotic cell death
