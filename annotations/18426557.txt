['18426557', 'BACKGROUND: Plant circadian systems regulate various biological processes in  harmony with daily environmental changes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the underlying  clock mechanism is comprised of multiple integrated transcriptional feedbacks,  which collectively lead to global patterns of rhythmic gene expression. The  transcriptional networks are essential within the clock itself and in its output  pathway. RESULTS: Here, to expand understanding of transcriptional networks  within and associated to the clock, we performed both an in silico analysis of  transcript rhythmicity of transcription factor genes, and a pilot assessment of  functional phenomics on the MYB, bHLH, and bZIP families. In our in silico  analysis, we defined which members of these families express a circadian waveform  of transcript abundance. Up to 20% of these families were over-represented as  clock-controlled genes. To detect members that contribute to proper oscillator  function, we systematically measured rhythmic growth via an imaging system in  hundreds of misexpression lines targeting members of the transcription-factor  families. Three transcription factors were found that conferred aberrant  circadian rhythms when misexpressed: MYB3R2, bHLH69, and bHLH92. CONCLUSION:  Transcript abundance of many transcription factors in Arabidopsis oscillates in a  circadian manner. Further, a developed pipeline assessed phenotypic contribution  of a panel of transcriptional regulators in the circadian system.', '2008 Apr 21', 'BMC Genomics', '10.1186/1471-2164-9-182', 'Davis']
