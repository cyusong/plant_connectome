In photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by light-harvesting complexes and used to drive photochemistry. However, a fraction of absorbed light is lost to non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) that reflects several important photosynthetic processes to dissipate excess energy. Currently, estimates of NPQ and its individual components (q<sub>E</sub> , q<sub>I</sub> , q<sub>Z</sub> and q<sub>T</sub> ) are measured from pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence yield and require measurements of the maximal yield of fluorescence in fully dark-adapted material (F<sub>m</sub> ), when NPQ is assumed to be negligible. Unfortunately, this approach requires extensive dark acclimation, often precluding widespread or high-throughput use, particularly under field conditions or in imaging applications, while introducing artefacts when F<sub>m</sub> is measured in the presence of residual photodamaged centres. To address these limitations, we derived and characterized a new set of parameters, NPQ<sub>(T)</sub> , and its components that can be (1) measured in a few seconds, allowing for high-throughput and field applications; (2) does not require full relaxation of quenching processes and thus can be applied to photoinhibited materials; (3) can distinguish between NPQ and chloroplast movements; and (4) can be used to image NPQ in plants with large leaf movements. We discuss the applications benefits and caveats of both approaches.
