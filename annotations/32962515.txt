Histone acetylation modification plays a vital role in plant cell division and differentiation. However, the function on wheat mature embryo culture has not been reported. Here, we used the mature embryo of wheat genotypes including CB037, Fielder, and Chinese Spring (CS) as materials to analyze the effects of different concentrations of trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (SB) on plant regeneration efficiency. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the induction rates of embryogenic callus and green shoot were significantly increased with the addition of 0.5 µM TSA, while they were reduced under treatment of 2.5 µM TSA on wheat mature embryo. With the respective addition of 200 µM and 1000 µM SB, regeneration frequency of three genotypes was enhanced, especially in Fielder, which reached significant difference compared with the control group. Unfortunately, 0.5 µM TSA and 200 µM SB combination had no apparent effect on wheat regeneration frequency. The results indicated that TSA and SB increase plant regeneration in common wheat. In addition, TSA had a common effect and SB had different effect among genotypes on wheat regeneration frequency. The mechanism of action needs further investigation.
