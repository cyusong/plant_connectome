Remorins are well-established marker proteins for plasma membrane microdomains. They specifically localize to the inner membrane leaflet despite an overall hydrophilic amino acid composition. Here, we determined amino acids and post-translational lipidations that are required for membrane association of remorin proteins. We used a combination of cell biological and biochemical approaches to localize remorin proteins and truncated variants of those in living cells and determined S-acylation on defined residues in these proteins. S-acylation of cysteine residues in a C-terminal hydrophobic core contributes to membrane association of most remorin proteins. While S-acylation patterns differ between members of this multi-gene family, initial membrane association is mediated by protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions. However, S-acylation is not a key determinant for the localization of remorins in membrane microdomains. Although remorins bind via a conserved mechanism to the plasma membrane, other membrane-resident proteins may be involved in the recruitment of remorins into membrane domains. S-acylation probably occurs after an initial targeting of the proteins to the plasma membrane and locks remorins in this compartment. As S-acylation is a reversible post-translational modification, stimulus-dependent intracellular trafficking of these proteins can be envisioned.
