Heat stress is a major limiting factor for global wheat production and causes dramatic yield loss worldwide. The TaMBF1c gene is upregulated in response to heat stress in wheat. Understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with heat stress responses will pave the way to improve wheat thermotolerance. Through CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, polysome profiling coupled with RNA-sequencing analysis, and protein-protein interactions, we show that TaMBF1c conferred heat response via regulating a specific gene translation in wheat. The results showed that TaMBF1c is evolutionarily conserved in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat species, and its knockdown and knockout lines show increased heat sensitivity. TaMBF1c is colocalized with the stress granule complex and interacts with TaG3BP. TaMBF1c affects the translation efficiency of a subset of heat responsive genes, which are significantly enriched in the 'sequence-specific DNA binding' term. Moreover, gene expression network analysis demonstrated that TaMBF1c is closely associated with the translation of heat shock proteins. Our findings reveal a contribution of TaMBF1c in regulating the heat stress response via the translation process, and provide a new target for improving heat tolerance in wheat breeding programs.
