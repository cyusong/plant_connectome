Cytokinins control key aspects of plant growth, including shoot and root meristem development and the timing of senescence of leaves and stems. Cytokinin perception triggers a 2-component signaling mechanism that ultimately leads to phosphorylation-dependent activation of a class of transcriptional regulators called type-B ARRs (RRBs). We have recently shown that the stability of the RRB family member ARR1 is increased in response to elevated cytokinin concentrations. In contrast, cytokinin decreases the stability of the closely related RRB member ARR2. The molecular mechanism governing the differential stability regulation of these 2 closely related RRBs remains unknown.
