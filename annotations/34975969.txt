Early leaf senescence phenotype in soybean could be helpful to shorten the maturation period and prevent green stem disorder. From a high-density mutation library, we identified two early leaf senescence soybean mutant lines, <i>els1-1</i> (<i>early leaf senescence 1</i>) and <i>els1-2.</i> The chlorophyll contents of both <i>els1-1</i> and <i>els1-2</i> were low in pre-senescent leaves. They degraded rapidly in senescent leaves, revealing that <i>ELS1</i> is involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis during leaf development and chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence. The causal mutations in <i>els1</i> were identified by next-generation sequencing-based bulked segregant analysis. <i>ELS1</i> encodes the ortholog of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> CaaX-like protease BCM1, which is localized in chloroplasts. Soybean <i>ELS1</i> was highly expressed in green tissue, especially in mature leaves. The accumulation of photosystem I core proteins and light-harvesting proteins in <i>els1</i> was low even in pre-senescent leaves, and their degradation was accelerated during leaf senescence. These results suggest that soybean <i>ELS1</i> is involved in both chlorophyll synthesis and degradation, consistent with the findings in <i>Arabidopsis</i> BCM1. The gene <i>els1,</i> characterized by early leaf senescence and subsequent early maturation, does not affect the flowering time. Hence, the early leaf senescence trait regulated by <i>els1</i> helps shorten the harvesting period because of early maturation characteristics. The <i>els1-1</i> allele with weakly impaired function of <i>ELS1</i> has only a small effect on agricultural traits and could contribute to practical breeding.
