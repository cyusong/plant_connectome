['20963606', 'The plasma membrane is an important cellular organ that perceives incoming  developmental and environmental signals and integrates these signals into  cellular regulatory mechanisms. It also acts as a barrier against unfavorable  extracellular factors to maintain cell viability. Despite its importance for cell  viability, molecular components determining cell viability and underlying  mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that a plasma membrane-localized  MtN3 protein SAG29 regulates cell viability under high salinity in Arabidopsis.  The SAG29 gene is expressed primarily in senescing plant tissues. It is induced  by osmotic stresses via an abscisic acid-dependent pathway. Whereas the  SAG29-overexpressing transgenic plants (35S:SAG29) exhibited an accelerated  senescence and were hypersensitive to salt stress, the SAG29-deficient mutants  were less sensitive to high salinity. Consistent with this, the 35S:SAG29  transgenic plants showed reduced cell viability in the roots under normal growth  condition. In contrast, cell viability in the SAG29-deficient mutant roots was  indistinguishable from that in the roots of control plants. Notably, the mutant  roots exhibited enhanced cell viability under high salinity. Our observations  indicate that the senescence-associated SAG29 protein is associated with cell  viability under high salinity and other osmotic stress conditions. We propose  that the SAG29 protein may serve as a molecular link that integrates  environmental stress responses into senescing process.', '2011 Jan', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1293-8', 'Park']
