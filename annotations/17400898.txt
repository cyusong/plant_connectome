['17400898', 'The exceptional toxicity of arsenate [As(V)] is derived from its close chemical  similarity to phosphate (Pi), which allows the metalloid to be easily  incorporated into plant cells through the high-affinity Pi transport system. In  this study, we identified an As(V)-tolerant mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana named  pht1;1-3, which harbors a semidominant allele coding for the high-affinity Pi  transporter PHT1;1. pht1;1-3 displays a slow rate of As(V) uptake that ultimately  enables the mutant to accumulate double the arsenic found in wild-type plants.  Overexpression of the mutant protein in wild-type plants provokes phenotypic  effects similar to pht1;1-3 with regard to As(V) uptake and accumulation. In  addition, gene expression analysis of wild-type and mutant plants revealed that,  in Arabidopsis, As(V) represses the activation of genes specifically involved in  Pi uptake, while inducing others transcriptionally regulated by As(V), suggesting  that converse signaling pathways are involved in plant responses to As(V) and low  Pi availability. Furthermore, the repression effect of As(V) on Pi starvation  responses may reflect a regulatory mechanism to protect plants from the extreme  toxicity of arsenic.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.041871', 'Leyva']
