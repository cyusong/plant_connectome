Because of climate change, crops will experience increasing heat stress. However, the ways in which heat stress affects crop growth and yield at the molecular level remain poorly understood. We generated spatiotemporal mRNA and small RNA transcriptome data, spanning seven tissues at three time points, to investigate the effects of heat stress on vegetative and reproductive development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Among the small RNAs significantly induced by heat stress was a plastid-derived 19-nucleotide small RNA, which is possibly the residual footprint of a pentatricopeptide repeat protein. This suggests that heat stress induces the turnover of certain plastid transcripts. Consistently, genes responsible for photosynthesis in chloroplasts were repressed after heat stress. Analysis also revealed that the abundance of 24-nucletide small interfering RNAs from transposable elements was conspicuously reduced by heat stress in tassels and roots; nearby genes showed a similar expression trend. Finally, specific microRNA and passenger microRNA species were identified, which in other plant species have not before been reported as responsive to heat stress. This study generated an atlas of genome-wide transcriptomic responses to heat stress, revealing several key regulators as potential targets for thermotolerance improvement in maize.
