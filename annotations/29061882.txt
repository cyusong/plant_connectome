['29061882', 'Here, we show that Arabidopsis ADF10 plays an important role in shaping the  overall organization of apical actin filaments by promoting their turnover and  ordering. ADF10 severs and depolymerizes actin filaments in vitro and is  distributed throughout the entire pollen tube. In adf10 mutants, severing and  monomer dissociation events for apical actin filaments are reduced, and the  apical actin structure extends further toward the tube base than in wild-type  tubes. In particular, the percentage of apical actin filaments that form large  angles to the tube growth axis is much higher in adf10 pollen tubes, and the  actin filaments are more randomly distributed, implying that ADF10 promotes their  ordering. Consistent with the role of apical actin filaments in physically  restricting the movement of vesicles, the region in which apical vesicles  accumulate is enlarged at the tip of adf10 pollen tubes. Both tipward and  backward movements of small vesicles are altered within the growth domain of  adf10 pollen tubes. Thus, our study suggests that ADF10 shapes the organization  of apical actin filaments to regulate vesicle trafficking and pollen tube growth.', '2017 Dec 1', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.207738', 'ORCID:']
