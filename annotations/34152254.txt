Shoot meristems contain stem cells, and they sustain growth and development of the above-ground tissues in land plants. The <i>HAIRY MERISTEM</i> (<i>HAM</i>) family genes, encoding GRAS-domain transcriptional regulators, play essential roles in the control of shoot meristem development and stem cell homeostasis in several flowering plants. Similar to other GRAS proteins, the C-terminal regions of HAM family proteins across land plants are conserved, containing signature motifs that define the GRAS domain. In contrast, the N-terminal regions of HAM family proteins display substantial divergence in sequence and length. Whether the variable and divergent N-termini are required for the conserved functions of HAM proteins is unknown. Our recent work showed that <i>CrHAM</i> - the <i>HAM</i> homolog in the fern <i>Ceratopteris richardii</i> was able to replace the role of type-II <i>HAM</i> genes in Arabidopsis, maintaining established shoot apical meristems and promoting the initiation of new stem cell niches. Here, we provide additional information and show that CrHAM contains a much longer N-terminal region compared to Arabidopsis HAM proteins, which is conserved among different fern HAM homologs. The deletion of this region largely compromises the ability of CrHAM to replace the function of Arabidopsis HAM proteins in shoot meristems. These new data together with previous results suggest that, although lacking the sequence conservation among HAM homologs from different plant lineages, the N-termini are important for the conserved functions of HAM family proteins.
