Microalgae CO<sub>2</sub> fixation results in the production of biomass rich in high-valuable products, such as fatty acids and carotenoids. Enhanced productivity of valuable compounds can be achieved through the microalgae's ability to capture CO<sub>2</sub> efficiently from sources of high CO<sub>2</sub> contents, but it depends on the species. Culture collections of microalgae offer a wide variety of defined strains. However, an inadequate understanding of which groups of microalgae and from which habitats they originate offer high productivity under increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations hampers exploiting microalgae as a sustainable source in the bioeconomy. A large variety of 81 defined algal strains, including new green algal isolates from various terrestrial environments, were studied for their growth under atmospheres with CO<sub>2</sub> levels of 5-25% in air. They were from a pool of 200 strains that had been pre-selected for phylogenetic diversity and high productivity under ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. Green algae from terrestrial environments exhibited enhanced growth up to 25% CO<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, in unicellular red algae and stramenopile algae, which originated through the endosymbiotic uptake of a red algal cell, growth at CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations above 5% was suppressed. While terrestrial stramenopile algae generally tolerated such CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, their counterparts from marine phytoplankton did not. The tests of four new strains in liquid culture revealed enhanced biomass and chlorophyll production under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The 15% CO<sub>2</sub> aeration increased their total carotenoid and fatty acid contents, which were further stimulated when combined with the starvation of macronutrients, i.e., less with phosphate and more with nitrogen-depleted culture media. Green algae originating from terrestrial environments, Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae, exhibit enhanced productivity of carotenoids and fatty acids under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This ability supports the economic and sustainable production of valuable compounds from these microalgae using inexpensive sources of high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, such as industrial exhaust fumes.
