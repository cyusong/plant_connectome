['19038037', 'BACKGROUND: Starch accumulation and degradation in chloroplasts is accomplished  by a suite of over 30 enzymes. Recent work has emphasized the importance of  multi-protein complexes amongst the metabolic enzymes, and the action of  associated non-enzymatic regulatory proteins. Arabidopsis At5g39790 encodes a  protein of unknown function whose sequence was previously demonstrated to contain  a putative carbohydrate-binding domain. RESULTS: We here show that At5g39790 is  chloroplast-localized, and binds starch, with a preference for amylose. The  protein persists in starch binding under conditions of pH, redox and Mg(+2)  concentrations characteristic of both the day and night chloroplast cycles.  Bioinformatic analysis demonstrates a diurnal pattern of gene expression, with an  accumulation of transcript during the light cycle and decline during the dark  cycle. A corresponding diurnal pattern of change in protein levels in leaves is  also observed. Sequence analysis shows that At5g39790 has a strongly-predicted  coiled-coil domain. Similar analysis of the set of starch metabolic enzymes shows  that several have strong to moderate coiled-coil potential. Gene expression  analysis shows strongly correlated patterns of co-expression between At5g39790  and several starch metabolic enzymes. CONCLUSION: We propose that At5g39790 is a  regulatory scaffold protein, persistently binding the starch granule, where it is  positioned to interact by its coiled-coil domain with several potential starch  metabolic enzyme binding-partners.', '2008 Nov 27', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-8-120', 'Moorhead']
