['21558460', 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cell cycle-regulated protein ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE 1  (EDE1) is a novel plant microtubule-associated protein essential for plant cell  division and for microtubule organization in endosperm. EDE1 is only present on  microtubules at mitosis and its expression is highly cell cycle regulated both at  the protein and the transcript levels. METHODS: To search for EDE1-interacting  proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used in which EDE1 was fused with GAL4  DNA binding domain and expressed in a yeast strain that was then mated with a  strain carrying a cDNA library fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain.  Candidate interacting proteins were identified and confirmed in vitro. KEY  RESULTS: 14-3-3 upsilon was isolated several times from the library screen. In in  vitro tests, it also interacted with EDE1: 14-3-3 upsilon most strongly  associates with EDE1 in its free form, but also weakly when EDE1 is bound to  microtubules. This study shows that EDE1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase substrate  but that phosphorylation is not required for interaction with 14-3-3 upsilon.  CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 14-3-3 proteins may play a role in  cytoskeletal organization of plant cells. The potential role of this interaction  in the dynamics of EDE1 during the cell cycle is discussed.', '2011 May', 'Ann Bot', '10.1093/aob/mcr050', 'Doonan']
