Lentil, one of the oldest legumes was investigated for diversity based on botanical descriptors, total seed proteins, isozymes and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. About one fourth of accessions were heterogeneous for botanical descriptors and a seed protein profile. The germplasm collected from the province of Baluchistan revealed the prevalence of indigenous landraces as high diversity was observed for all of the techniques. Diversity explored through various techniques revealed validity irrespective of the sample size or geographic pattern, RAPD being the best choice for investigating both inter- and intra-accession variation in lentil. Although all of the techniques were able to resolve genetic diversity in lentil, isozymes and seed proteins gave low levels of genetic diversity, suggesting that more investigation into isozymes of specific proteins is required. RAPD is the best option for determining inter- and intra-accession variation, and will be required to extend germplasms and primers to continue the study of botanical descriptors.
