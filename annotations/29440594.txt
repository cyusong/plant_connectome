Flowering time (heading date) and panicle branch number are important agronomic traits that determine yield in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The activation of flowering requires histone methylation, but the roles of trimethylation of Lys 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) in modulating heading date and panicle development are unclear. Here, we showed that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching. The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) WD40 protein OsWDR5a interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1/SET domain group protein 723 (SDG723) to form the core components of the COMPASS-like complex. Plants in which <i>OsWDR5a</i> or <i>OsTrx1</i> expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of <i>OsWDR5a</i> function resulted in embryo lethality. OsWDR5a binds to <i>Early heading date 1</i> to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels. Together, our results show that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle development and suggest that modulation of H3K4me3 levels by the COMPASS-like complex is critical for rice development.
