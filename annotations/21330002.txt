Chloroplast RNA metabolism is characterized by multiple RNA processing steps that require hundreds of RNA binding proteins. A growing number of RNA binding proteins have been shown to mediate specific RNA processing steps in the chloroplast, but little do we know about their regulatory importance or mode of molecular action. This review summarizes knowledge on chloroplast proteins that contain an RNA recognition motif, a classical RNA binding domain widespread in pro- and eukaryotes. Several members of this family respond to external and internal stimuli by changes in their expression levels and protein modification state. They therefore appear as ideal candidates for regulating chloroplast RNA processing under shifting environmental conditions.
