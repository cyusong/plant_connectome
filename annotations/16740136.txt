['16740136', 'The reversible post-translational modifier, SUMO (small ubiquitin-related  modifier), modulates the activity of a diverse set of target proteins, resulting  in important consequences to the cellular machinery. Conjugation machinery  charges the processed SUMO so that it can be linked via an isopeptide bond to a  target protein. The removal of SUMO moieties from conjugated proteins by  isopeptidases regenerates pools of processed SUMOs and unmodified target  proteins. The evolutionarily conserved SUMO-conjugating proteins, E1 and E2,  recognize a diverse set of Arabidopsis SUMO proteins using them to modify protein  substrates. In contrast, the deSUMOylating enzymes differentially recognize the  Arabidopsis SUMO proteins, resulting in specificity of the deconjugating  machinery. The specificity of the Arabidopsis deSUMOylating enzymes is further  diversified by the addition of regulatory domains. Therefore the SUMO proteins,  in this signalling system, have evolved to contain information that allows not  only redundancy with the conjugation system but also diversity with the  deconjugating enzymes.', '2006 Sep 15', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20060426', 'Orth']
