Sodium (Na) concentrations are low in plant tissues, and its metabolic function in plants is minor; however, Na is a key nutrient for plant consumers. Previous studies have thus far focused on Na concentration. Nevertheless, a balanced potassium (K) to Na ratio (<i>K:Na</i>) is more important than Na concentration alone since food with high <i>K:Na</i> has detrimental effects on consumers irrespective of Na concentration. Therefore, plants may actively regulate <i>K:Na</i> in their tissues and products, shaping plant-insect interactions. Studies considering nutritional aspects of plant-insect interactions have focused on nonreproductive tissues and nectar. In this study, we consider pollen as serving a primary reproductive function for plants as well as a food of pollinivores. Plants might regulate <i>K:Na</i> in pollen to affect their interactions with pollinivorous pollinators. To investigate whether such a mechanism exists, we manipulated Na concentrations in soil and measured the proportion of K, Na, and 13 other nutrient elements in the pollen of two sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) cultivars. This approach allowed us to account for the overall nutritional quality of pollen by investigating the proportions of many elements that could correlate with the concentrations of K and Na. Of the elements studied, only the concentrations of Na and K were highly correlated. Pollen <i>K:Na</i> was high in both cultivars irrespective of Na fertilization, and it remained high regardless of pollen Na concentration. Interestingly, pollen <i>K:Na</i> did not decrease as pollen increased the Na concentration. We hypothesize that high <i>K:Na</i> in pollen might benefit plant fertilization and embryonic development; therefore, a tradeoff might occur between producing low <i>K:Na</i> pollen as a reward for pollinators and high <i>K:Na</i> pollen to optimize the plant fertilization process. This is the first study to provide data on pollen <i>K:Na</i> regulation by plants. Our findings broaden the understanding of plant-bee interactions and provide a foundation for a better understanding of the role of the soil-plant-pollen-pollinator pathway in nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Specifically, unexplored costs and tradeoffs related to balancing the <i>K:Na</i> by plants and pollinivores might play a role in past and current shaping of pollination ecology.
