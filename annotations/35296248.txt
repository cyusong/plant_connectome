Asparagine synthetase (ASN) is one of the key enzymes of nitrogen (N) metabolism in plants. The product of ASN is asparagine, which is one of the key compounds involved in N transport and storage in plants. Complete genome-wide analysis and classifications of the ASN gene family have recently been reported in different plants. However, little is known about the systematic analysis and expression profiling of ASN proteins in cotton development and N metabolism. Here, various bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify ASN gene family in cotton. In the cotton genome, forty-three proteins were found that determined ASN genes, comprising of 20 genes in Gossypium hirsutum (Gh), 13 genes in Gossypium arboreum, and 10 genes in Gossypium raimondii. The ASN encoded genes unequally distributed on various chromosomes with conserved glutamine amidotransferases and ASN domains. Expression analysis indicated that the majority of GhASNs were upregulated in vegetative and reproductive organs, fiber development, and N metabolism. Overall, the results provide proof of the possible role of the ASN genes in improving cotton growth, fiber development, and especially N metabolism in cotton. The identified hub genes will help to functionally elucidate the ASN genes in cotton development and N metabolism.
