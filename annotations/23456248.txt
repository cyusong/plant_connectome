['23456248', 'Rice is cultivated in water-logged paddy lands. Thus, rice root hairs on the  epidermal layers are exposed to a different redox status of nitrogen species,  organic acids, and metal ions than root hairs growing in drained soil. To  identify genes that play an important role in root hair growth, a forward  genetics approach was used to screen for short-root-hair mutants. A  short-root-hair mutant was identified and isolated by using map-based cloning and  sequencing. The mutation arose from a single amino acid substitution of OsSNDP1  (Oryza sativa Sec14-nodulin domain protein), which shows high sequence homology  with Arabidopsis COW1/AtSFH1 and encodes a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein  (PITP). By performing complementation assays with Atsfh1 mutants, we demonstrated  that OsSNDP1 is involved in growth of root hairs. Cryo-scanning electron  microscopy was utilized to further characterize the effect of the Ossndp1  mutation on root hair morphology. Aberrant morphogenesis was detected in root  hair elongation and maturation zones. Many root hairs were branched and showed  irregular shapes due to bulged nodes. Many epidermal cells also produced  dome-shaped root hairs, which indicated that root hair elongation ceased at an  early stage. These studies showed that PITP-mediated phospholipid signaling and  metabolism is critical for root hair elongation in rice.', '2013 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-013-0033-4', 'Han']
