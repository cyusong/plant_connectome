Although interactions between plants and microbes at the plant-soil interface are known to be important for plant nutrient acquisition, relatively little is known about how root exudates contribute to nutrient exchange over the course of plant development. In this study, root exudates from slow- and fast-growing stages of Arabidopsis thaliana plants were collected, chemically analysed and then applied to a sandy nutrient-depleted soil. We then tracked the impacts of these exudates on soil bacterial communities, soil nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, available phosphorus and potassium) and plant growth. Both pools of exudates shifted bacterial community structure. GeoChip analyses revealed increases in the functional gene potential of both exudate-treated soils, with similar responses observed for slow-growing and fast-growing plant exudate treatments. The fast-growing stage root exudates induced higher nutrient mineralization and enhanced plant growth as compared to treatments with slow-growing stage exudates and the control. These results suggest that plants may adjust their exudation patterns over the course of their different growth phases to help tailor microbial recruitment to meet increased nutrient demands during periods demanding faster growth.
