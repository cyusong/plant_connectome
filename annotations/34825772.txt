Phytophthora capsici is one of the most harmful pathogens in agriculture, which threatens the safe production of multiple crops and causes serious economic losses worldwide. Here, we identified a P. capsici expansin-like protein, PcEXLX1, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry from Nicotiana benthamiana apoplastic fluid infected with P. capsici. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/crispr associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated PcEXLX1 knockout mutants exhibited significantly enhanced virulence, while the overexpression of PcEXLX1 impaired the virulence. Prokaryotically expressed PcEXLX1 activated multiple plant immune responses, which were BRI1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1)- and suppressor of BIR1-1 (SOBIR1)-dependent. Furthermore, overexpression of PcEXLX1 homologs in N. benthamiana could also increase plant resistance to P. capsici. A G-type lectin receptor-like kinase from N. benthamiana, expansin-regulating kinase 1 (ERK1), was shown to regulate the perception of PcEXLX1 and positively mediate the plant resistance to P. capsici. These results reveal that the expansin-like protein, PcEXLX1, is a novel apoplastic effector with plant immunity-inducing activity of oomycetes, perception of which is regulated by the receptor-like kinase, ERK1.
