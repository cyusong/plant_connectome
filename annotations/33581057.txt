Feeding the ever-growing population is a major challenge, especially in light of rapidly changing climate conditions. Genome editing is set to revolutionize plant breeding and could help secure the global food supply. Here, I review the development and application of genome editing tools in plants while highlighting newly developed techniques. I describe new plant breeding strategies based on genome editing and discuss their impact on crop production, with an emphasis on recent advancements in genome editing-based plant improvements that could not be achieved by conventional breeding. I also discuss challenges facing genome editing that must be overcome before realizing the full potential of this technology toward future crops and food production.
