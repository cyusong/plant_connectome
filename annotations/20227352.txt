['20227352', 'The SOS screen, as originally described by Perkins et al. (1999) [7], was setup  with the aim of identifying Arabidopsis functions that might potentially be  involved in the DNA metabolism. Such functions, when expressed in bacteria, are  prone to disturb replication and thus trigger the SOS response. Consistently,  expression of AtRAD51 and AtDMC1 induced the SOS response in bacteria, even  affecting E. coli viability. 100 SOS-inducing cDNAs were isolated from a cDNA  library constructed from an Arabidopsis cell suspension that was found to highly  express meiotic genes. A large proportion of these SOS(+) candidates are clearly  related to the DNA metabolism, others could be involved in the RNA metabolism,  while the remaining cDNAs encode either totally unknown proteins or proteins that  were considered as irrelevant. Seven SOS(+) candidate genes are induced following  gamma irradiation. The in planta function of several of the SOS-inducing clones  was investigated using T-DNA insertional mutants or RNA interference. Only one  SOS(+) candidate, among those examined, exhibited a defined phenotype: silenced  plants for DUT1 were sensitive to 5-fluoro-uracil (5FU), as is the case of the  leaky dut-1 mutant in E. coli that are affected in dUTPase activity. dUTPase is  essential to prevent uracil incorporation in the course of DNA replication.', '2010 May 4', 'DNA Repair (Amst)', '10.1016/j.dnarep.2010.02.009', 'Doutriaux']
