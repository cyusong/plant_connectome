Under favorable moisture, temperature, and light conditions, gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis is induced and triggers seed germination. A major mechanism by which GA promotes seed germination is by promoting the degradation of the DELLA protein RGA-LIKE 2 (RGL2), a major repressor of germination in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. Analysis of seed germination phenotypes of constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (cop1) mutants and complemented COP1-OX/cop1-4 lines in response to GA and paclobutrazol (PAC) suggested a positive role for COP1 in seed germination and a relation with GA signaling. cop1-4 mutant seeds showed PAC hypersensitivity, but transformation with a COP1 overexpression construct rendered them PAC insensitive, with a phenotype similar to that of rgl2 mutant (rgl2-SK54) seeds. Furthermore, cop1-4 rgl2-SK54 double mutants showed a PAC-insensitive germination phenotype like that of rgl2-SK54, identifying COP1 as an upstream negative regulator of RGL2. COP1 interacted directly with RGL2, and in vivo this interaction was strongly enhanced by SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 1. COP1 directly ubiquitinated RGL2 to promote its degradation. Moreover, GA stabilized COP1 with consequent RGL2 destabilization. By uncovering this COP1-RGL2 regulatory module, we reveal a mechanism whereby COP1 positively regulates seed germination and controls the expression of germination-promoting genes.
