We are interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant reactions to the toxic heavy metal cadmium (Cd). To this end, we devised a new screening strategy using agar plates with a gradient of Cd concentrations, termed Cd-gradient agar plates (CGAPs), to isolate Arabidopsis mutants that displayed altered reactions to the metal. Arabidopsis M(2) seeds, derived from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treated seeds, were germinated on the CGAPs such that the primary root of each seedling elongated against increasing concentrations of Cd on the surface of the plate. Under these conditions, the lengths of the primary roots reliably demonstrated the degree of Cd tolerance of individual seedlings. The use of CGAPs also allowed close observation of the root reaction of each seedling to Cd without causing lethal damage. The screen identified three mutant lines, MRC-32, MRC-22 and MRC-26, which showed distinctly different characteristics. MRC-32 plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to Cd and contained Cd at higher concentrations than wild-type (WT) plants treated with the heavy metal. The whole root system of MRC-22 plants showed a Cd-phobic response. MRC-26 plants accumulated less Cd in their aboveground tissues than WT plants, suggesting that they were defective in transporting the heavy metal from roots to aboveground tissues. We also determined the likely chromosomal location of each mutation.

Gene: !affects! Cd tolerance 
Gene: !localizes to! Chromosome 
MRC-32: !enhances! Cd tolerance 
MRC-22: !represses! Cd accumulation 
MRC-26: !reduces! Transport of Cd from roots to aboveground tissues
