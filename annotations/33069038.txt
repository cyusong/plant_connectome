Osmotic stress, caused by drought, salinity, or PEG (polyethylene glycol), is one of the most important abiotic factors that hinder plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis, more than 100 R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) have been identified, and many of them are involved in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of biological processes related to growth and development, as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the MYB TF involving in both plant development and stress response has rarely been reported. We report here that Arabidopsis AtMYB109, a R2R3-MYB TF, functions as a negative regulator of stomatal closure under osmotic stress as well as of pollen tube elongation. Under PEG-induced osmotic stress, whole leaves of AtMYB109-OXs were intensely wilted, while leaves of the wild-type (WT) and myb109 were weakly affected. Moreover, we confirmed that the wilting in AtMYB109-OXs was more severe than in WT and myb109 under drought conditions, and that after re-watering, WT and myb109 plants promptly recovered, while AtMYB109-OXs failed to survive. In addition, stomatal closure was delayed in the AtMYB109-OXs compared to the WT and myb109. However, proline content and the expression of stress-induced and proline synthesis genes were higher in the overexpression lines than in WT and myb109. Then, we observed that the expression of ICS1, a key gene in SA biosynthesis, was greatly suppressed in AtMYB109-OXs. In addition, we found that AtMYB109 expression gradually increased until the flowers were fully opened and thereafter dramatically decreased during silique development. The pollen tube growth was significantly suppressed in AtMYB109-OXs compared to the WT and myb109. Using EMSA and ChIP-qPCR, we confirmed that AtMYB109 bound to the promoter of RABA4D, a gene encoding a pollen development regulator. Taken together, we suggest the delayed stomatal closing and vulnerable phenotypes in the AtMYB109-OXs under osmotic stress are possibly directly or indirectly associated with a SA-mediated mechanism, and that AtMYB109 suppresses RABA4D that modulates pollen tube growth.
