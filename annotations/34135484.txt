The vegetative-to-floral transition is a dramatic developmental change of the shoot apical meristem, promoted by the systemic florigen signal. However, poor molecular temporal resolution of this dynamic process has precluded characterization of how meristems respond to florigen induction. Here, we develop a technology that allows sensitive transcriptional profiling of individual shoot apical meristems. Computational ordering of hundreds of tomato samples reconstructed the floral transition process at fine temporal resolution and uncovered novel short-lived gene expression programs that are activated before flowering. These programs are annulled only when both florigen and a parallel signalling pathway are eliminated. Functional screening identified genes acting at the onset of pre-flowering programs that are involved in the regulation of meristem morphogenetic changes but dispensable for the timing of floral transition. Induced expression of these short-lived transition-state genes allowed us to determine their genetic hierarchies and to bypass the need for the main flowering pathways. Our findings illuminate how systemic and autonomous pathways are integrated to control a critical developmental switch.
