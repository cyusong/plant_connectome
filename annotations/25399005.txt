['25399005', 'Dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) catalyses a key step in the branched-chain amino  acid (BCAA) biosynthetic pathway that exists in numerous organisms, including  bacteria, fungi, and plants, but not humans. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DHAD is  encoded by a single gene (AT3G23940), but its biological function in controlling  plant development remains uncharacterized. In this study, we showed that DHAD is  highly expressed in most vegetative and reproductive tissues. It is an essential  gene, and complete disruption caused partial sterility in both male and female  gametophyte phases. In addition, reduced expression of DHAD in knockdown mutants  resulted in a reduction in the accumulation of all three BCAAs in roots and, as a  consequence, led to a shorter root phenotype, which could be restored by an  exogenous supplement of free BCAAs. Interestingly, the knockdown mutants became  hypersensitive to salt stress, not to heavy metal stress, implying that BCAAs may  act as osmolytes in salt tolerance. This would be the second amino acid shown to  confer such a function in addition to the well-documented proline. Our results  provide evidence that BCAA biosynthesis plays important roles in gametophyte and  root development, and BCAA homeostasis contributes to the adaptation of  Arabidopsis to salinity stress.', '2015 Feb', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eru449', 'He']
