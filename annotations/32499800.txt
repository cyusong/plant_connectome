Leaf or brown rust of wheat caused by <i>Puccinia triticina</i> (<i>Pt</i>) is one of the most damaging diseases globally. Considerable progress has been made to control leaf rust through crop protection chemicals and host plant resistance breeding in southern Africa. However, frequent changes in the pathogen population still present a major challenge to achieve durable resistance. Disease surveillance and monitoring of the pathogen have revealed the occurrence of similar races across the region, justifying the need for concerted efforts by countries in southern Africa to develop and deploy more efficient and sustainable strategies to manage the disease. Understanding the genetic variability and composition of <i>Pt</i> is a pre-requisite for cultivar release with appropriate resistance gene combinations for sustainable disease management. This review highlights the variability and distribution of the <i>Pt</i> population, and the current control strategies, challenges and future prospects of breeding wheat varieties with durable leaf rust resistance in southern Africa. The importance of regular, collaborative and efficient surveillance of the pathogen and germplasm development across southern Africa is discussed, coupled with the potential of using modern breeding technologies to produce wheat cultivars with durable resistance.
