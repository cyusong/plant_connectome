Triticum urartu (2n = 2x = 14, subgenome A<sup>u</sup> A<sup>u</sup> ), a wild diploid wheat progenitor, features broad allelic diversity for a number of traits of agronomic relevance. A thorough characterization of the diversity of T. urartu natural accessions may provide wheat breeders with new alleles potentially contributing to wheat improvement. In this study, we performed an extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization of a world collection of 299 T. urartu ex situ accessions, developing 441 327 single nucleotide polymorphisms and recording trait values for agronomic and quality traits. The collection was highly diverse, with broad variation in phenology and plant architecture traits. Seed features were also varied, and analyses of flour quality reported 18 distinct patterns of glutenins, and carotenoid concentrations and sedimentation volumes in some cases surpassing those of cultivated materials. The genome-wide molecular markers developed on the collection were used to conduct a genome-wide association study reporting 25 highly significant quantitative trait nucleotides for the traits under examination, only partially overlapping loci already reported in wheat. Our data show that T. urartu may be considered a valuable allele pool to support the improvement of wheat agronomy and quality.
