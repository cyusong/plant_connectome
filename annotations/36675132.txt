Insects use a powerful and complex olfactory recognition system to sense odor molecules in the external environment to guide behavior. A large family of odorant receptors (ORs) mediates the detection of pheromone compounds. <i>Anoplophora glabripennis</i> is a destructive pest that harms broad-leaved tree species. Although olfactory sensation is an important factor affecting the information exchange of <i>A. glabripennis</i>, little is known about the key <i>ORs</i> involved. Here, we identified ninety-eight <i>AglaORs</i> in the Agla2.0 genome and found that the <i>AglaOR</i> gene family had expanded with structural and functional diversity. RT-qPCR was used to analyze the expression of <i>AglaORs</i> in sex tissues and in adults at different developmental stages. Twenty-three <i>AglaORs</i> with antennal-biased expression were identified. Among these, eleven were male-biased and two were female-biased and were more significantly expressed in the sexual maturation stage than in the post-mating stage, suggesting that these genes play a role in sexual communication. Relatively, two female-biased <i>AglaORs</i> were overexpressed in females seeking spawning grounds after mating, indicating that these genes might be involved in the recognition of host plant volatiles that may regulate the selection of spawning grounds. Our study provides a theoretical basis for further studies into the molecular mechanism of <i>A. glabripennis</i> olfaction.
