<i>Alternaria brassicae</i>, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, causes Alternaria blight, an important disease of brassica crops. Although many <i>Alternaria</i> spp. have been sequenced, no genome information is available for <i>A. brassicae</i>, a monotypic lineage within the <i>Alternaria</i> genus. A highly contiguous genome assembly of <i>A. brassicae</i> has been generated using Nanopore MinION sequencing with an N50 of 2.98 Mb, yielding nine full chromosome-level sequences. This study adds to the current genomic resources available for the genus <i>Alternaria</i> and will provide opportunities for further analyses to unravel the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity of this important necrotrophic pathogen.
