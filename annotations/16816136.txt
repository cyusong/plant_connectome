['16816136', 'Amino acid transport in plants is mediated by at least two large families of  plasma membrane transporters. Arabidopsis thaliana, a nonmycorrhizal species, is  able to grow on media containing amino acids as the sole nitrogen source.  Arabidopsis amino acid permease (AAP) subfamily genes are preferentially  expressed in the vascular tissue, suggesting roles in long-distance transport  between organs. We show that the broad-specificity, high-affinity amino acid  transporter LYSINE HISTIDINE TRANSPORTER1 (LHT1), an AAP homolog, is expressed in  both the rhizodermis and mesophyll of Arabidopsis. Seedlings deficient in LHT1  cannot use Glu or Asp as sole nitrogen sources because of the severe inhibition  of amino acid uptake from the medium, and uptake of amino acids into mesophyll  protoplasts is inhibited. Interestingly, lht1 mutants, which show growth defects  on fertilized soil, can be rescued when LHT1 is reexpressed in green tissue.  These findings are consistent with two major LHT1 functions: uptake in roots and  supply of leaf mesophyll with xylem-derived amino acids. The capacity for amino  acid uptake, and thus nitrogen use efficiency under limited inorganic N supply,  is increased severalfold by LHT1 overexpression. These results suggest that LHT1  overexpression may improve the N efficiency of plant growth under limiting  nitrogen, and the mutant analyses may enhance our understanding of N cycling in  plants.', '2006 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.041012', 'Koch']
