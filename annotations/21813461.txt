Investigation of heavy metal tolerance genes in green algae is of great importance because heavy metals have become one of the major contaminants in the aquatic ecosystem. In plants, accumulation of heavy metals modifies many aspects of cellular functions. However, the mechanism by which heavy metals exert detrimental effects is poorly understood. In this study, we identified a role for HO-1 (encoding heme oxygenase-1) in regulating the response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga, to mercury (Hg). Transgenic algae overexpressing HO-1 showed high tolerance to Hg exposure, with a 48.2% increase in cell number over the wild type, but accumulated less Hg. Physiological analysis revealed that expression of HO-1 suppressed the Hg-induced generation of reactive oxygen species. We further identified the effect of carbon monoxide (CO), a product of HO-1-mediated heme degradation, on growth and physiological parameters. Interestingly, administration of exogenous CO at non-toxic levels also conferred the tolerance of algae to Hg exposure. The CO-mediated alleviation of Hg toxicity was closely related to the lower accumulation of Hg and free radical species. These results indicate that functional identification of HO-1 is useful for molecular breeding designed to improve plant tolerance to heavy metals and reduce heavy metal accumulation in plant cells.
