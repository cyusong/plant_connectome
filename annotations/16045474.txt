['16045474', 'Despite the fact that several hundred glycosyltransferases have been identified  from sequencing of plant genomes, the biological functions of only a handful have  been established to date. A Poplar glycosyltransferase 64 (GT64) family member  that is differentially expressed during the cell division and elongation phases  of cambial growth was identified from previously generated transcript profiling  of cambium tissues. The predicted Poplar GT64 protein has a closely related  Arabidopsis homolog ECTOPICALLY PARTING CELLS (EPC1). Mutation of the EPC1 gene,  one of three Arabidopsis GT64 family members, results in plants with a  dramatically reduced growth habit, defects in vascular formation and reduced  cell-cell adhesion properties in hypocotyl and cotyledon tissues. Secondary  growth is enhanced in epc1 hypocotyl tissues and it is proposed that this results  from the abnormal cell-cell adhesion within the cortical parenchyma cell layers.  Loss of cell-cell contacts within cotyledon and leaf tissues is also proposed to  account for vascular patterning defects and the fragile nature of epc1 tissues.  The EPC1 protein thus plays a critical role during plant development in  maintaining the integrity of organs via cell-cell adhesion, thereby providing  mechanical strength and facilitating the movement of metabolites throughout the  plant.', '2005 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02455.x', 'Marchant']
