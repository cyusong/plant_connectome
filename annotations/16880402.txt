['16880402', 'In vertebrates, the endocannabinoid signaling pathway is an important lipid  regulatory pathway that modulates a variety of physiological and behavioral  processes. N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) comprise a group of fatty acid derivatives  that function within this pathway, and their signaling activity is terminated by  an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyzes NAEs to  ethanolamine and their corresponding free fatty acids. Bioinformatic approaches  led to the identification of plant homologues of FAAH that are capable of  hydrolyzing NAEs in vitro. To better understand the role of NAEs in plants, we  identified T-DNA knockouts to Arabidopsis FAAH (AtFAAH; At5g64440) and generated  plants overexpressing AtFAAH. Here we show that seeds of AtFAAH knockouts had  elevated levels of endogenous NAEs, and seedling growth was hypersensitive to  exogenously applied NAE. On the other hand, seeds and seedlings of AtFAAH  overexpressors had lower endogenous NAE content, and seedlings were less  sensitive to exogenous NAE. Moreover, AtFAAH overexpressors displayed enhanced  seedling growth and increased cell size. AtFAAH expression and FAAH catalytic  activity increased during seed germination and seedling growth, consistent with  the timing of NAE depletion during seedling establishment. Collectively, our  results show that AtFAAH is one, but not the only, modulator of endogenous NAE  levels in plants, and that NAE depletion likely participates in the regulation of  plant growth.', '2006 Aug 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0603571103', 'Blancaflor']
