For optimal plant growth and development, cellular nitrogen (N) metabolism must be closely coordinated with other metabolic pathways, and mitochondria are thought to play a central role in this process. Recent studies using genetically modified plants have provided insight into the role of mitochondria in N metabolism. Mitochondrial metabolism is linked with N assimilation by amino acid, carbon (C) and redox metabolism. Mitochondria are not only an important source of C skeletons for N incorporation, they also produce other necessary metabolites and energy used in N remobilization processes. Nitric oxide of mitochondrial origin regulates respiration and influences primary N metabolism. Here, we discuss the changes in mitochondrial metabolism during ammonium or nitrate nutrition and under low N conditions. We also describe the involvement of mitochondria in the redistribution of N during senescence. The aim of this review was to demonstrate the role of mitochondria as an integration point of N cellular metabolism.
