The phytohormone cytokinin (CK) is not only essential for plant growth and development but also impacts plant immunity. A mutant screen in a constitutively active plant immune receptor mutant snc1 (suppressor of npr1, constitutive1) identified a suppressor mutation of SNC1-induced defense responses in an ABC transporter coding gene ABCG14. ABCG14 transports CK from roots to the shoots, and the suppression of the SNC1-mediated defense response by the loss of ABCG14 is due to a deficiency of trans-zeatin (tZ)-type CK in the shoot. In addition, exogenous application of the tZ-type CK enhances disease resistance associated with increased expression of the plant immune receptor gene SNC1. Taken together, this study further established the role of tZ-type CK in disease resistance and suggests a new intersection of CKs with plant immunity at the expression regulation of a plant immune receptor gene.
