['22075146', 'The plasma membrane-localized plant steroid hormone receptor, BRASSINOSTEROID  INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), is quiescent in the absence of steroids, largely due to a  negative regulator, BRI1 KINASE INHIBITOR 1 (BKI1). Here, we report that the  steroid-induced, plasma membrane-dissociated and phosphorylated BKI1 also plays  positive roles in BR signaling by interacting with a subset of 14-3-3 proteins.  The cytosolic fraction of BKI1 carboxyl terminal region enhances BR signaling.  Mutations of two serine residues in this region lead to reduced phosphorylation  by the BRI1 kinase and constitutive plasma membrane localization. The 14-3-3  proteins can interact with the phosphorylated BKI1 through a motif that contains  the two phosphorylation sites to release inhibition of BRI1 by BKI1. Meanwhile,  the cytosolic BKI1 antagonizes the 14-3-3 s and enhances accumulation of BRI1 EMS  SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1)/BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) in the nucleus to regulate  BR-responses.', '2011 Nov 15', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2011.08.018', 'Wang']
