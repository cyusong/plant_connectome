In this study, we examined the effect of biliverdin (BV), a product of heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzed reaction, on lateral root (LR) formation in rice. Treatment with BV induced LR formation and HO activity. As well, BV, could induce OsHO1 mRNA expression. Zn protoporphyrin IX (the specific inhibitor of HO) reduced LR number, HO activity and OsHO1 mRNA level induced by BV. Our data suggest that HO is required for BV-induced LR formation in rice.
