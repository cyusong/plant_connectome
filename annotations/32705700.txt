Environmental stress response in plants has been studied using a wide range of approaches, from lab-based investigation of biochemistry and genetics, to glasshouse studies of physiology and growth rates, to field-based trials and ecological surveys. It is also possible to investigate the evolution of environmental stress responses using macroevolutionary and macroecological analyses, analysing data from many different species, providing a new perspective on the way that environmental stress shapes the evolution and distribution of biodiversity. "Macroevoeco" approaches can produce intriguing results and new ways of looking at old problems. In this review, we focus on studies using phylogenetic analysis to illuminate macroevolutionary patterns in the evolution of environmental stress tolerance in plants. We follow a particular thread from our own research-evolution of salt tolerance-as a case study that illustrates a macroevolutionary way of thinking that opens up a range of broader questions on the evolution of environmental stress tolerances. We consider some potential future applications of macroevolutionary and macroecological analyses to understanding how diverse groups of plants evolve in response to environmental stress, which may allow better prediction of current stress tolerance and a way of predicting the capacity of species to adapt to changing environmental stresses over time.
