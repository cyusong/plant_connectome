Selection for root system architectures (RSA) to match target growing environments can improve yields through better adaptation to water and nutrient-limiting conditions in grain legume crops such as mungbean. In this study, the architectural development of root systems in four contrasting mungbean varieties was studied over time to explore their relationships to above-ground growth and development. Key findings suggested that early maturing mungbean varieties were characterized by more rapid root elongation rates and leaf area development, resulting in more vigorous root and shoot growth during early growth stages compared with a late maturing variety. The early maturing varieties also showed root morphological traits generally adapted to water-limited environments, such as deeper, longer and lighter roots. Early maturing varieties more rapidly colonized the top 10-20 cm of the soil profile during early growth stages, whereas the later maturing variety developed less prolific but 20-50% thicker roots in the same profile layers in later stages of crop growth. The diversity of root characteristics identified in these commercial varieties suggests that there are opportunities to combine desirable root traits with maturity types to target different production environments. Examples include deeper, longer, and thinner roots for crops to exploit deep profile reserves of water and nutrients, and thicker and shallower root systems for crops grown in shallow soils with stratified nutrient reserves and/or more favorable in-season rainfall.
