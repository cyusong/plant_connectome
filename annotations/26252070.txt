The LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE (LBD/ASL) genes encodes a unique class of transcription factors that play roles in diverse aspects of lateral organ development in plants. The Arabidopsis LBD gene family comprises 42 members and biological functions of most of the LBD genes are unknown. Our molecular genetic analysis and a variety of functional assays including expression analysis, genetic transmission and pollen viability assays, and pollen development analysis demonstrated that LBD10 co-acts with SIDECAR POLLEN(SCP)/LBD27 to control an early stage of microspore development but also plays a distinct role at later bicellular and tricellular pollen stages and that these 2 LBD genes are essential for Arabidopsis pollen development. We also showed that LBD10 and LBD27 interact with each other to be localized into the nucleus. Our subcellular localization analysis of LBD10 in comparison with LBD27 during pollen development indicated that regulated protein degradation may be involved in determining spatially and temporally distinct and overlapping expression patterns of these LBD transcription factors, contributing to distinct and combinatorial roles of LBD10 and LBD27 in Arabidopsis pollen development.
