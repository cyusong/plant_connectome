['15677481', "Arabidopsis thaliana contains a large number of genes that encode carboxylic  acid-activating enzymes, including nine long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases,  four 4-coumarate:CoA ligases (4CL), and 25 4CL-like proteins of unknown  biochemical function. Because of their high structural and sequence similarity  with bona fide 4CLs and their highly hydrophobic putative substrate-binding  pockets, the 4CL-like proteins At4g05160 and At5g63380 were selected for detailed  analysis. Following heterologous expression, the purified proteins were subjected  to a large scale screen to identify their preferred in vitro substrates. This  study uncovered a significant activity of At4g05160 with medium-chain fatty  acids, medium-chain fatty acids carrying a phenyl substitution, long-chain fatty  acids, as well as the jasmonic acid precursors 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid and  3-oxo-2-(2'-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-hexanoic acid. The closest homolog of  At4g05160, namely At5g63380, showed high activity with long-chain fatty acids and  12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, the latter representing the most efficiently converted  substrate. By using fluorescent-tagged variants, we demonstrated that both  4CL-like proteins are targeted to leaf peroxisomes. Collectively, these data  demonstrate that At4g05160 and At5g63380 have the capacity to contribute to  jasmonic acid biosynthesis by initiating the beta-oxidative chain shortening of  its precursors.", '2005 Apr 8', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M413578200', 'Stuible']
