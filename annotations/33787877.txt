Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play essential roles in plant development and stress responses. CDPKs have a conserved kinase domain, followed by an auto-inhibitory junction connected to the calmodulin-like domain that binds Ca2+. These structural features allow CDPKs to decode the dynamic changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations triggered by hormones and by biotic and abiotic stresses. In response to these signals, CDPKs phosphorylate downstream protein targets to regulate growth and stress responses according to the environmental and developmental circumstances. The latest advances in our understanding of the metabolic, transcriptional, and protein-protein interaction networks involving CDPKs suggest that they have a direct influence on plant carbon/nitrogen (C/N) balance. In this review, we discuss how CDPKs could be key signaling nodes connecting stress responses with metabolic homeostasis, and acting together with the sugar and nutrient signaling hubs SnRK1, HXK1, and TOR to improve plant fitness.
