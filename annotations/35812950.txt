Cultivated peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.), a cosmopolitan oil crop, is susceptible to a variety of pathogens, especially <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> L., which not only vastly reduce the quality of peanut products but also seriously threaten food safety for the contamination of aflatoxin. However, the key genes related to resistance to <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> L. in peanuts remain unclear. This study identifies hub genes positively associated with resistance to <i>A. flavus</i> in two genotypes by comparative transcriptome and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method. Compared with susceptible genotype (Zhonghua 12, <i>S</i>), the rapid response to <i>A. flavus</i> and quick preparation for the translation of resistance-related genes in the resistant genotype (J-11, <i>R</i>) may be the drivers of its high resistance. WGCNA analysis revealed that 18 genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins (PR10), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), MAPK kinase, serine/threonine kinase (STK), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), cytochrome P450, SNARE protein SYP121, pectinesterase, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, and pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein play major and active roles in peanut resistance to <i>A. flavus</i>. Collectively, this study provides new insight into resistance to <i>A. flavus</i> by employing WGCNA, and the identification of hub resistance-responsive genes may contribute to the development of resistant cultivars by molecular-assisted breeding.
