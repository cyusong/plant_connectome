The hormone abscisic acid regulates development and survival of plants in response to environmental stresses. now demonstrate that in response to stress, abscisic acid can be made available via polymerization of a beta-glucosidase enzyme. This enzyme is reported to hydrolyze glucose-conjugated abscisic acid, thus increasing active abscisic acid concentrations.

beta-glucosidase enzyme: !polymerizes! abscisic acid
abscisic acid: !hydrolyzed by! beta-glucosidase enzyme
beta-glucosidase enzyme: !increases! active abscisic acid concentrations
