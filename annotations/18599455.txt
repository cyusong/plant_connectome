['18599455', 'Plant form is shaped by a complex network of intrinsic and extrinsic signals.  Light-directed growth of seedlings (photomorphogenesis) depends on the  coordination of several hormone signals, including brassinosteroids (BRs) and  auxin. Although the close relationship between BRs and auxin has been widely  reported, the molecular mechanism for combinatorial control of shared target  genes has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that BRs synergistically increase  seedling sensitivity to auxin and show that combined treatment with both hormones  can increase the magnitude and duration of gene expression. Moreover, we describe  a direct connection between the BR-regulated BIN2 kinase and ARF2, a member of  the Auxin Response Factor family of transcriptional regulators. Phosphorylation  by BIN2 results in loss of ARF2 DNA binding and repression activities. arf2  mutants are less sensitive to changes in endogenous BR levels, whereas a large  proportion of genes affected in an arf2 background are returned to near wild-type  levels by altering BR biosynthesis. Together, these data suggest a model where  BIN2 increases expression of auxin-induced genes by directly inactivating  repressor ARFs, leading to synergistic increases in transcription.', '2008 Jul 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0803996105', 'Nemhauser']
