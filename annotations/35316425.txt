Our findings suggest most wheat biological processes are under the control of the daily expressed genes. Plant circadian rhythms represent daily changes in the activity of various processes, which are based on changes in the levels of gene expression and protein synthesis. In wheat, some key components of plant circadian clock have been identified, but there is little data on the daily expression and interactions of these genes. To study the common wheat daily transcriptome, RNA sequencing was performed. Using these data, genes expressed in daily pattern and the metabolic pathways controlled by them were identified: responses to stimuli and nutrients, transport, photoperiodism, photomorphogenesis, synthesis and degradation of different metabolites, and regulation of the processes of RNA synthesis. It was shown that a significant part of the transcriptome can vary greatly daily. Five expression patterns were identified. They were characterized by peaks at different time points and described the genes underlying these patterns. The analysis of the enrichment of gene ontology terms with various patterns allowed us to describe the main metabolic pathways in each group. Wheat homologs of the genes related to circadian clock in Arabidopsis were identified. Most of them were represented by three homoeologous genes expressed uniformly. Comparison of their expression patterns demonstrated a shift in the expression peaks for some core and accessory genes; the majority of wheat circadian genes were expressed in accordance with Arabidopsis homologs. This may indicate a similar functional role of these genes in wheat.
