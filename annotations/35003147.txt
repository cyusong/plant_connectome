Stripe rust caused by the biotrophic fungus <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> Westend. is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide, causing high yield and quality losses. Growing resistant cultivars is the most efficient way to control stripe rust, both economically and ecologically. Known resistance genes are already present in numerous cultivars worldwide. However, their effectiveness is limited to certain races within a rust population and the emergence of stripe rust races being virulent against common resistance genes forces the demand for new sources of resistance. Multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations have proven to be a powerful tool to carry out genetic studies on economically important traits. In this study, interval mapping was performed to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe rust resistance in the Bavarian MAGIC wheat population, comprising 394 F<sub>6 : 8</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Phenotypic evaluation of the RILs was carried out for adult plant resistance in field trials at three locations across three years and for seedling resistance in a growth chamber. In total, 21 QTL for stripe rust resistance corresponding to 13 distinct chromosomal regions were detected, of which two may represent putatively new QTL located on wheat chromosomes 3D and 7D.
