Plants can send long-distance cell-to-cell signals from a single tissue subjected to stress to the entire plant. This ability is termed "systemic signaling" and is essential for plant acclimation to stress and/or defense against pathogens. Several signaling mechanisms are associated with systemic signaling, including the reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave, calcium wave, hydraulic wave, and electric signals. The ROS wave coordinates multiple physiological, molecular, and metabolic responses among different parts of the plant and is essential for systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) to stress. In addition, it is linked with several plant hormones, including jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA). However, how these plant hormones modulate the ROS wave and whether they are required for SAA is not clear. Here we report that SA and JA play antagonistic roles in modulating the ROS wave in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). While SA augments the ROS wave, JA suppresses it during responses to local wounding or high light (HL) stress treatments. We further show that ethylene and ABA are essential for regulation of the ROS wave during systemic responses to local wounding treatment. Interestingly, we found that the redox-response protein NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED PROTEIN 1 is required for systemic ROS accumulation in response to wounding or HL stress, as well as for SAA to HL stress. Taken together, our findings suggest that interplay between JA and SA might regulate systemic signaling and SAA during responses of plants to abiotic stress or wounding.
