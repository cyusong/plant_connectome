Mercury accumulation in Arabidopsis shoots is accelerated by endodermis specific expression of fusion proteins of a bacterial mercury transporter MerC and a plant SNARE SYP121 under control of SCARECROW promoter. We previously demonstrated that the CaMV 35S RNA promoter (p35S)-driven ubiquitous expression of a bacterial mercury transporter MerC, fused with SYP121, an Arabidopsis SNARE protein increases mercury accumulation of Arabidopsis. To establish an improved fine-tuned mercury transport system in plants for phytoremediation, the present study generated and characterized transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing MerC-SYP121 specifically in the root endodermis, which is a crucial cell type for root element uptake. We generated four independent transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing a transgene encoding mCherry-MerC-SYP121 under the control of the endodermis-specific SCARECROW promoter (hereafter pSCR lines). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that expression levels of the transgene in roots of the pSCR lines were 3-23% of the p35S driven-overexpressing line. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that mCherry-MerC-SYP121 was dominantly expressed in the endodermis of the meristematic zone as well as in the mature zone of the pSCR roots. Mercury accumulation in shoots of the pSCR lines exposed to inorganic mercury was overall higher than the wild-type and comparable to the p35S over-expressing line. These results suggest that endodermis-specific expression of the MerC-SYP121 fusion proteins in plant roots sufficiently enhances mercury uptake and accumulation into shoots, which would be an ideal phenotype for phytoremediation of mercury-contaminated environments.
