['9305917', 'The vacuole constitutes a large compartment in plant and fungal cells. The VAM3  gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a syntaxin-related protein required for  vacuolar assembly. An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library, designed for expression  in S. cerevisiae, was screened for cDNAs able to complement defective vacuolar  assembly of the Deltavam3 mutation. One cDNA, encoding a 33-kDa protein with  structural similarities to the other syntaxins, was identified. The product of  AtVAM3 (AtVam3p) was expressed in various tissues including roots, leaves,  inflorescence stems, flower buds, and young siliques. The AtVAM3 transcripts were  abundant in undifferentiated cells in the meristematic region. AtVam3p  fractionated predominantly to an 8,000 x g pellet fraction where a vacuolar  membrane protein H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) also  fractionated. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that AtVam3p was localized to  restricted regions on the vacuolar membranes. We propose that AtVam3p provides  the t-SNARE function in the vacuolar assembly in A. thaliana.', '1997 Sep 26', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.272.39.24530', 'Wada']
