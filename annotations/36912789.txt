Root hairs are single-celled tubular structures produced from the epidermis, which play an essential role in water and nutrient uptake from the soil. Therefore, root hair formation and elongation are controlled not only by developmental programs but also by environmental factors, enabling plants to survive under fluctuating conditions. Phytohormones are key signals that link environmental cues to developmental programs; indeed, root hair elongation is known to be controlled by auxin and ethylene. Another phytohormone, cytokinin, also affects root hair growth, while whether cytokinin is actively involved in root hair growth and, if so, how it regulates the signaling pathway governing root hair development have remained unknown. In this study, we show that the two-component system of cytokinin, which involves the B-type response regulators ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 1 (ARR1) and ARR12, promotes the elongation process of root hairs. They directly upregulate ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4) encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a central role in root hair growth, whereas the ARR1/12-RSL4 pathway does not crosstalk with auxin or ethylene signaling. These results suggest that cytokinin signaling constitutes another input onto the regulatory module governed by RSL4, making it possible to fine-tune root hair growth in changing environments.
