The application of jasmonic acid results in an increased secondary growth, as well as additional secondary phloem fibres and higher lignin content in the hypocotyl of textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.). Secondary growth provides most of the wood in lignocellulosic biomass. Textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is cultivated for its phloem fibres, whose secondary cell wall is rich in crystalline cellulose with a limited amount of lignin. Mature hemp stems and older hypocotyls are characterised by large blocks of secondary phloem fibres which originate from the cambium. This study aims at investigating the role of exogenously applied jasmonic acid on the differentiation of secondary phloem fibres. We show indeed that the exogenous application of this plant growth regulator on young hemp plantlets promotes secondary growth, differentiation of secondary phloem fibres, expression of lignin-related genes, and lignification of the hypocotyl. This work paves the way to future investigations focusing on the molecular network underlying phloem fibre development.
