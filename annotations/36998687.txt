Phosphate (Pi) is indispensable for the growth and development of plant, and low-Pi stress is a major limitation for crop growth and yield worldwide. The tolerance to low-Pi stress varied among rice germplasm resources. However, the mechanisms underlying the tolerance of rice to low-Pi stress, as a complex quantitative trait, are not clear. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) through a diverse worldwide collection of 191 rice accessions in the field under normal-Pi and low-Pi supply in two years. Twenty and three significant association loci were identified for biomass and grain yield per plant under low-Pi supply respectively. The expression level of <i>OsAAD</i> as a candidate gene from a associated locus was significantly up-regulated after low-Pi stress treatment for five days and tended to return to normal levels after Pi re-supply in shoots. Suppression of <i>OsAAD</i> expression could improve the physiological phosphorus use efficiency (PPUE) and grain yields through affecting the expression of several genes associated with GA biosynthesis and metabolism. <i>OsAAD</i> would be a promising gene for increasing PPUE and grain yield in rice under normal- and low-Pi supply <i>via</i> genome editing.
