Banana (Musa acuminata) fruits ripening at 30°C or above fail to develop yellow peels; this phenomenon, called green ripening, greatly reduces their marketability. The regulatory mechanism underpinning high temperature-induced green ripening remains unknown. Here we decoded a transcriptional and post-translational regulatory module that causes green ripening in banana. Banana fruits ripening at 30°C showed greatly reduced expression of five chlorophyll catabolic genes (CCGs), MaNYC1 (NON-YELLOW COLORING 1), MaPPH (PHEOPHYTINASE), MaTIC55 (TRANSLOCON AT THE INNER ENVELOPE MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 55), MaSGR1 (STAY-GREEN 1) and MaSGR2 (STAY-GREEN 2), compared to those ripening at 20°C. We identified a MYB transcription factor, MaMYB60, that activated the expression of all five CCGs by directly binding to their promoters during banana ripening at 20°C, while showing a weaker activation at 30°C. At high temperatures, MaMYB60 was degraded. We discovered a RING-type E3 ligase MaBAH1 (Benzoic Acid Hypersensitive 1) that ubiquitinated MaMYB60 during green ripening and targeted it for proteasomal degradation. MaBAH1 thus facilitated MaMYB60 degradation and attenuated MaMYB60-induced transactivation of CCGs and chlorophyll degradation. By contrast, MaMYB60 upregulation increased CCG expression, accelerated chlorophyll degradation, and mitigated green ripening. Collectively, our findings unravel a dynamic, temperature-responsive MaBAH1-MaMYB60-CCG module that regulates chlorophyll catabolism, and the molecular mechanism underpinning green ripening in banana. This study also advances our understanding of plant responses to high-temperature stress.
