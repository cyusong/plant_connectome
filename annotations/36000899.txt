Ascorbic acid (AsA) is a multifunctional phytonutrient that is essential for the human diet as well as plant development. While much is known about AsA biosynthesis in plants, how this process is regulated in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruits remains unclear. Here, we found that auxin treatment inhibited AsA accumulation in the leaves and pericarps of tomato. The auxin response factor gene SlARF4 is induced by auxin to mediate auxin-induced inhibition of AsA accumulation. Specifically, SlARF4 transcriptionally inhibits the transcription factor gene SlMYB11, thereby modulating AsA accumulation by regulating the transcription of the AsA biosynthesis genes l-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase, l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase, and dehydroascorbate. By contrast, abscisic acid (ABA) treatment increased AsA accumulation in tomato under drought stress. ABA induced the expression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase gene SlMAPK8. We demonstrate that SlMAPK8 phosphorylates SlARF4 and inhibits its transcriptional activity, whereas SlMAPK8 phosphorylates SlMYB11 and activates its transcriptional activity. SlMAPK8 functions in ABA-induced AsA accumulation and drought stress tolerance. Moreover, ABA antagonizes the effects of auxin on AsA biosynthesis. Therefore, auxin- and ABA-induced regulation of AsA accumulation is mediated by the SlMAPK8-SlARF4-SlMYB11 module in tomato during fruit development and drought stress responses, shedding light on the roles of phytohormones in regulating AsA accumulation to mediate stress tolerance.
