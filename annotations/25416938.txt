Understanding nitrogen metabolism in plants holds promise for future agricultural improvements. Chellamuthu et al. now identify a feedback regulation in plant nitrogen metabolism through glutamine sensing. This mechanism appears to be conserved from algae to flowering plants with a few surprising exceptions.
