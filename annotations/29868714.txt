Cold acclimation-induced cold tolerance is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) in plants. Here, we hypothesized that calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) induce a crosstalk among ROS, NO, and MPKs, leading to the activation of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in plant adaptation to cold stress. Results showed that cold acclimation significantly increased the transcript levels of CPK27 along with the biosynthesis of ABA in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Silencing of CPK27 compromised acclimation-induced cold tolerance, generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the apoplast, NO and ABA accumulation, and the activation of MPK1/2. Crosstalk among H2O2, NO, and MPK1/2 contributes to the homeostasis of H2O2 and NO, activation of MPK1/2, and cold tolerance. ABA is also critical for CPK27-induced cold tolerance, generation of H2O2 and NO, and the activation of MPK1/2. These results strongly suggest that CPK27 may function as a positive regulator of ABA generation by activating the production of ROS and NO as well as MPK1/2 in cold adaptation.
