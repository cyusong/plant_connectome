ATP, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, acts as the universal cellular energy cofactor fuelling all life processes. Chloroplast ATP synthase produces ATP using the proton motive force created by solar energy-driven thylakoid electron transport reactions. Here we investigate how increasing abundance of ATP synthase affects leaf photosynthesis and growth of rice, Oryza sativa variety Kitaake. We show that overexpression of AtpD, the nuclear-encoded subunit of the chloroplast ATP synthase, stimulates both abundance of the complex, confirmed by immunodetection of thylakoid complexes separated by Blue Native-PAGE, and ATP synthase activity, detected as higher proton conductivity of the thylakoid membrane. Plants with increased AtpD content had higher CO2 assimilation rates when a stepwise increase in CO2 partial pressure was imposed on leaves at high irradiance. Fitting of the CO2 response curves of assimilation revealed that plants overexpressing AtpD had a higher electron transport rate (J) at high CO2, despite having wild-type-like abundance of the cytochrome b6f complex. A higher maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and lower cyclic electron flow detected in transgenic plants both pointed to an increased ATP production compared with wild-type plants. Our results present evidence that the activity of ATP synthase modulates the rate of electron transport at high CO2 and high irradiance.
