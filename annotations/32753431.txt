['32753431', 'In plants, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, endosomal sorting, and autophagy are  essential for protein degradation; however, their interplay remains poorly  understood. Here, we show that four Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) E3  ubiquitin ligases, SEVEN IN ABSENTIA OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA1 (SINAT1), SINAT2,  SINAT3, and SINAT4, regulate the stabilities of FYVE DOMAIN PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR  ENDOSOMAL SORTING1 (FREE1) and VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING23A (VPS23A), key  components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I, to modulate  abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. GFP-SINAT1, GFP-SINAT2, and GFP-SINAT4 primarily  localized to the endosomal and autophagic vesicles. SINATs controlled FREE1 and  VPS23A ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. SINAT overexpressors showed  increased ABA sensitivity, ABA-responsive gene expression, and PYRABACTIN  RESISTANCE1-LIKE4 protein levels. Furthermore, the SINAT-FREE1/VPS23A proteins  were codegraded by the vacuolar pathway. In particular, during recovery post-ABA  exposure, SINATs formed homo- and hetero-oligomers in vivo, which were disrupted  by the autophagy machinery. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism  by which the proteasomal and vacuolar turnover systems regulate ABA signaling in  plants.', '2020 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.20.00267', 'ORCID:']
