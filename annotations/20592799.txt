Auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) is an auxin receptor for responses not primarily regulated by gene regulation. One fast response is protoplast swelling. By using immunological ABP1 tools we showed that the highly conserved box a is not alone important for auxin binding. Box c is another part of the auxin binding domain.1 Here we present a novel method to analyze auxin-induced, ABP1-mediated effects at the plasma membrane on single cell level in vivo. The fluorescence of FM4-64 in the plasma membrane is reduced by auxin and this response is mediated by ABP1. This method indicates a functional role of ABP1 at the plasma membrane.
