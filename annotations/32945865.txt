Organisms need to deal with the absolute requirement for metals and also their possible toxicity. This is achieved through an intricate network of signaling pathways that are integrated to ultimately fine-tune iron uptake and metabolism. The mechanisms by which plants cope with iron limitation and the associated genomic responses are well characterized. On top of this transcriptional cascade is another level of regulation involving the post-translational protein modification and degradation. The ubiquitination and/or degradation of several transcription factors in the iron-deficiency signaling pathways and metal transporters has recently come to light. In this review we discuss the mechanisms and possible roles of protein modification and turnover in the regulation of root iron-deficiency responses. We also highlight the tight coupling between metal sensing by E3 ubiquitin ligases or bifunctional transporters and protein degradation.

E3 ubiquitin ligases: !sense! metals 
bifunctional transporters: !sense! metals 
transcription factors: !ubiquitinated/degraded! in iron-deficiency signaling pathways 
metal transporters: !ubiquitinated/degraded! in iron-deficiency signaling pathways 
protein modification: !regulates! root iron-deficiency responses 
protein turnover: !regulates! root iron-deficiency responses
