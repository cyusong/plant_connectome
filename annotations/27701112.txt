['27701112', 'Morphogenetic signals control the patterning of multicellular organisms.  Cytokinins are mobile signals that are perceived by subsets of plant cells. We  found that the responses to cytokinin signaling during Arabidopsis development  are constrained by the transporter PURINE PERMEASE 14 (PUP14). In our  experiments, the expression of PUP14 was inversely correlated to the cytokinin  signaling readout. Loss of PUP14 function allowed ectopic cytokinin signaling  accompanied by aberrant morphogenesis in embryos, roots, and the shoot apical  meristem. PUP14 protein localized to the plasma membrane and imported bioactive  cytokinins, thus depleting apoplastic cytokinin pools and inhibiting perception  by plasma membrane-localized cytokinin sensors to create a sink for active  ligands. We propose that the spatiotemporal cytokinin sink patterns established  by PUP14 determine the cytokinin signaling landscape that shapes the  morphogenesis of land plants.', '2016 Sep 2', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aaf7254', 'Muller']
