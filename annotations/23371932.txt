Genes of the AGAMOUS subfamily have been shown to play crucial roles in reproductive organ identity determination, fruit, and seed development. They have been deeply studied in eudicot species and especially in Arabidopsis. Recently, the AGAMOUS subfamily of rice has been studied for their role in flower development and an enormous amount of data has been generated. In this review, we provide an overview of these data and discuss the conservation of gene functions between rice and Arabidopsis.
