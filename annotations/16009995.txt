MapMan is a user-driven tool that displays large genomics datasets onto diagrams of metabolic pathways or other processes. Here, we present new developments, including improvements of the gene assignments and the user interface, a strategy to visualize multilayered datasets, the incorporation of statistics packages, and extensions of the software to incorporate more biological information including visualization of corresponding genes and horizontal searches for similar global responses across large numbers of arrays.
