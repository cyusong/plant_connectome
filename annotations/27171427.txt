['27171427', 'The SU(VAR)3-9 homolog SUVH9 and the double-stranded RNA-binding protein IDN2  were thought to be components of an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway  in Arabidopsis. We previously found that SUVH9 interacts with MORC6 but how the  interaction contributes to transcriptional silencing remains elusive. Here, our  genetic analysis indicates that SUVH2 and SUVH9 can either act in the same  pathway as MORC6 or act synergistically with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional  silencing. Moreover, we demonstrate that IDN2 interacts with MORC6 and mediates  the silencing of a subset of MORC6 target loci. Like SUVH2, SUVH9, and IDN2,  other RdDM components including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2 are also required  for transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. MORC6 was  previously shown to mediate transcriptional silencing through heterochromatin  condensation. We demonstrate that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex  components SWI3B, SWI3C, and SWI3D interact with MORC6 as well as with SUVH9 and  then mediate transcriptional silencing. These results suggest that the RdDM  components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MORC6-mediated  heterochromatin condensation. This study illustrates how DNA methylation is  linked to heterochromatin condensation and thereby enhances transcriptional  silencing at methylated genomic regions.', '2016 May', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1006026', 'ORCID:']
