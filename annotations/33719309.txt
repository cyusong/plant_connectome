Leaf senescence is a highly complex genetic process that is finely tuned by multiple layers of regulation. Among them, transcriptional regulation plays a critical role in controlling the initiation and progression of leaf senescence. Here, we found that the NAC transcription factor NAC075 functions as a novel negative regulator of leaf senescence. Loss of function of NAC075 promotes leaf senescence in an age-dependent manner, whereas constitutive overexpression of <i>NAC075</i> delays senescence in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are significantly suppressed in <i>nac075</i> mutants compared with wild-type plants. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed that NAC075 directly binds the promoter of <i>catalase 2</i> (<i>CAT2</i>). Moreover, genetic analysis showed that overexpression of <i>CAT2</i> suppresses the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the early senescence phenotypes of <i>nac075</i> mutants, suggesting that CAT2 acts downstream of NAC075 to delay leaf senescence by repressing ROS accumulation. Collectively, our findings provide a new regulatory module involving NAC075-CAT2-ROS in controlling leaf senescence in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
