['28314829', 'WRINKLED1 (WRI1), a member of the APETALA2 (AP2) class of transcription factors,  positively regulates glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana  Here, we identify mechanistic links between KIN10, the major SUCROSE  NON-FERMENTATION1-RELATED KINASE1 involved in sugar/energy homeostasis, and the  posttranslational regulation of WRI1. Transient expression of WRI1 with OLEOSIN1  in Nicotiana benthamiana stimulates triacylglycerol accumulation, but their  coexpression with KIN10 abrogates this effect by inducing proteasomal degradation  of WRI1. While WRI1 lacks canonical KIN10 target sequences, we demonstrated  direct KIN10-dependent phosphorylation of WRI1 using purified Escherichia  coli-expressed components. The resulting phosphorylated WRI1 was more rapidly  degraded than native WRI1 in cell-free degradation assays. WRI1 phosphorylation  was localized to two variants of the canonical KIN10 recognition sequence, one in  each of its two AP2 DNA binding domains. Conversion of the phosphorylation sites  at Thr-70 and Ser-166 to Ala resulted in a loss of KIN10-dependent  phosphorylation, and when coexpressed with KIN10 the WRI1 double mutant  accumulated to 2- to 3-fold higher levels than native WRI1. KIN10-dependent  degradation of WRI1 provides a homeostatic mechanism that favors lipid  biosynthesis when intracellular sugar levels are elevated and KIN10 is inhibited;  conversely, glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis are curtailed as sugar levels  decrease and KIN10 regains activity.', '2017 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00019', 'ORCID:']
