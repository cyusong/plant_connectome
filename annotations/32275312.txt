Yeast Rpf2 plays a critical role in the incorporation of 5S rRNA into pre-ribosomes by forming a binary complex with Rrs1. The protein characteristics and overexpression phenotypes of Arabidopsis Ribosome Production Factor 2 (ARPF2) and Arabidopsis Regulator of Ribosome Synthesis 1 (ARRS1) have been previously studied. Here, we analyze loss-of-function phenotypes of ARPF2 and ARRS1 using virus-induced gene silencing to determine their functions in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. ARPF2 silencing in Arabidopsis led to pleiotropic developmental defects. RNA gel blot analysis and circular reverse transcription-PCR revealed that ARPF2 depletion delayed pre-rRNA processing, resulting in the accumulation of multiple processing intermediates. ARPF2 fractionated primarily with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Metabolic rRNA labeling and ribosome profiling suggested that ARPF2 deficiency mainly affected 25S rRNA synthesis and 60S ribosome biogenesis. ARPF2 and ARRS1 formed the complex that interacted with the 60S ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL11. ARRS1 silencing resulted in growth defects, accumulation of processing intermediates, and ribosome profiling similar to those of ARPF2-silenced plants. Moreover, depletion of ARPF2 and ARRS1 caused nucleolar stress. ARPF2-deficient plants excessively accumulated anthocyanin and reactive oxygen species. Collectively, these results suggest that the ARPF2-ARRS1 complex plays a crucial role in plant growth and development by modulating ribosome biogenesis.
