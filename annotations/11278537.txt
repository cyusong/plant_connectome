['11278537', 'A gene (AtTRP1) encoding a telomeric repeat-binding protein has been isolated  from Arabidopsis thaliana. AtTRP1 is a single copy gene located on chromosome 5  of A. thaliana. The protein AtTRP1 encoded by this gene is not only homologous to  the Myb DNA-binding motifs of other telomere-binding proteins but also is similar  to several initiator-binding proteins in plants. Gel retardation assay revealed  that the 115 residues on the C terminus of this protein, including the Myb motif,  are sufficient for binding to the double-stranded plant telomeric sequence. The  isolated DNA-binding domain of AtTRP1 recognizes each telomeric repeat centered  on the sequence GGTTTAG. The almost full-length protein of AtTRP1 does not form  any complex at all with the DNA fragments carrying four or fewer GGTTTAG repeats.  However, it forms a complex with the sequence (GGTTTAG)(8) more efficiently than  with the sequence (GGTTTAG)(5). These data suggest that the minimum length of a  telomeric DNA for AtTRP1 binding consists of five GGTTTAG repeats and that the  optimal AtTRP1 binding may require eight or more GGTTTAG repeats. It also implies  that this protein AtTRP1 may bind in vivo primarily to the ends of plant  chromosomes, which consist of long stretches of telomeric repeats.', '2001 May 11', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M009659200', 'Ho']
