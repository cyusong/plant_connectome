In nature plants are usually subjected to a light/temperature regime of warm day and cold night (referred to as +DIF). Compared to growth under +DIF, Arabidopsis plants show compact growth under the same photoperiod, but with an inverse temperature regime (cold day and warm night: -DIF). Here we show that -DIF differentially affects the phase and amplitude of core clock gene expression. Under -DIF the phase of the morning clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) is delayed, similar to that of plants grown on low sucrose. Indeed, under -DIF carbohydrate (CHO) starvation marker genes are specifically upregulated at the End of the Night (EN) in Arabidopsis rosettes. However, only in inner-rosette tissue (small sink leaves and petioles of older leaves) sucrose levels are lower under -DIF compared to under +DIF, suggesting that sucrose in source leaf blades is not sensed for CHO status and that sucrose transport from source to sink may be impaired at EN. CHO-starvation under -DIF correlated with increased starch breakdown during the night and decreased starch accumulation during the day. Moreover, we demonstrate that different ways of inducing CHO-starvation all link to reduced growth of sink leaves. Practical implications for control of plant growth in horticulture are discussed.
