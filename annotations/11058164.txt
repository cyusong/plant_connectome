['11058164', 'Regulation of homeotic gene expression is critical for proper developmental  patterns in both animals and plants. LEUNIG is a key regulator of the Arabidopsis  floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS. Mutations in LEUNIG cause ectopic AGAMOUS mRNA  expression in the outer two whorls of a flower, leading to homeotic  transformations of floral organ identity as well as loss of floral organs. We  isolated the LEUNIG gene by using a map-based approach and showed that LEUNIG  encodes a glutamine-rich protein with seven WD repeats and is similar in motif  structure to a class of functionally related transcriptional corepressors  including Tup1 from yeast and Groucho from Drosophila. The nuclear localization  of LEUNIG-GFP is consistent with a role of LEUNIG as a transcriptional regulator.  The detection of LEUNIG mRNA in all floral whorls at the time of their inception  suggests that the restricted activity of LEUNIG in the outer two floral whorls  must depend on interactions with other spatially restricted factors or on  posttranslational regulation. Our finding suggests that both animals and plants  use similar repressor proteins to regulate critical developmental processes.', '2000 Nov 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.230352397', 'Liu']
