Plants are capable of orienting their root growth towards gravity in a process termed gravitropism, which is necessary for roots to grow into soil, for water and nutrient acquisition and to anchor plants. Here we show that root gravitropism depends on the novel protein, NEGATIVE GRAVITROPIC RESPONSE OF ROOTS (NGR). In both Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana, loss of NGR reverses the direction of root gravitropism, resulting in roots growing upward.

NGR: !affects! root gravitropism 
Medicago truncatula/Arabidopsis thaliana: !lack of! NGR 
root: !grows in! upward direction
