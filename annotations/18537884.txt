* Cadmium (Cd(2+)) is an environmental pollutant that causes increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. To determine the site of ROS production, the effect of Cd(2+) on ROS production was studied in isolated soybean (Glycine max) plasma membranes, potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber mitochondria and roots of intact seedlings of soybean or cucumber (Cucumis sativus). * The effects of Cd(2+) on the kinetics of superoxide (O2*-), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and hydroxyl radical ((*OH) generation were followed using absorption, fluorescence and spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. * In isolated plasma membranes, Cd(2+) inhibited O2*- production. This inhibition was reversed by calcium (Ca(2+)) and magnesium (Mg(2+)). In isolated mitochondria, Cd(2+) increased and H(2)O(2) production. In intact roots, Cd(2+) stimulated H(2)O(2) production whereas it inhibited O2*- and (*)OH production in a Ca(2+)-reversible manner. * Cd(2+) can be used to distinguish between ROS originating from mitochondria and from the plasma membrane. This is achieved by measuring different ROS individually. The immediate (<or= 1 h) consequence of exposure to Cd(2+) in vivo is stimulation of ROS production in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain and inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity in the plasma membrane.
