Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is a devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa). The mechanisms involved in resistance of rice to blast have been studied extensively and the rice--M. oryzae pathosystem has become a model for plant--microbe interaction studies. However, the mechanisms involved in nonhost resistance (NHR) of other plants to rice blast are still poorly understood. We have recently demonstrated that AGB1 and PMR5 contribute to PEN2-mediated preinvasion resistance to M. oryzae in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting a complex genetic network regulating the resistance. To determine whether other defense factors: RAR1, SGT1, and NHO1, affected the A. thaliana-M. oryzae interactions, double mutants were generated between pen2 and these defense-related mutants. All these double mutants exhibited a level of penetration resistance similar to that of the pen2 mutant, suggesting that none of these mutants significantly compromised resistance to M. oryzae in a pen2 background.

AGB1: !contributes to! PEN2-mediated preinvasion resistance 
PMR5: !contributes to! PEN2-mediated preinvasion resistance 
RAR1: !does not significantly compromise! resistance to M. oryzae in a pen2 background 
SGT1: !does not significantly compromise! resistance to M. oryzae in a pen2 background 
NHO1: !does not significantly compromise! resistance to M. oryzae in a pen2 background
