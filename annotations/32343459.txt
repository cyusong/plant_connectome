In cultivated grasses, tillering, spike architecture and seed shattering represent major agronomical traits. In barley, maize and rice, the NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE (NBCL) genes play important roles in development, especially in ligule development, tillering and flower identity. However, compared with dicots, the role of grass NBCL genes is underinvestigated. To better understand the role of grass NBCLs and to overcome any effects of domestication that might conceal their original functions, we studied TILLING nbcl mutants in the non-domesticated grass Brachypodium distachyon. In B. distachyon, the NBCL genes BdUNICULME4 (CUL4) and BdLAXATUM-A (LAXA) are orthologous, respectively, to the barley HvUniculme4 and HvLaxatum-a, to the maize Zmtassels replace upper ears1 and Zmtassels replace upper ears2 and to the rice OsBLADE-ON-PETIOLE1 and OsBLADE-ON-PETIOLE2/3. In B. distachyon, our reverse genetics study shows that CUL4 is not essential for the establishment of the blade-sheath boundary but is necessary for the development of the ligule and auricles. We report that CUL4 also exerts a positive role in tillering and a negative role in spikelet meristem activity. On the other hand, we demonstrate that LAXA plays a negative role in tillering, positively participates in spikelet development and contributes to the control of floral organ number and identity. In this work, we functionally characterized two new NBCL genes in a context of non-domesticated grass and highlighted original roles for grass NBCL genes that are related to important agronomical traits.
