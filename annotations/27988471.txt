Natural flowering can cause serious scheduling problems in the pineapple (Ananas comosus) industry and increase harvest costs. Pineapple flowering is thought to be triggered by increased ethylene levels and artificial forcing of pineapple flowering is a common practice to promote flowering synchronisation. However, little is known about the early hormonal and molecular changes of pineapple flowering induction and development. Here, we aimed to analyse the molecular, hormonal, and histological changes during artificial pineapple flowering by Ethrel<sup>®</sup>48 treatment. Histological analyses of the shoot apical meristem, leaf gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>), and ethylene quantification were carried out during the first 72h after Ethrel<sup>®</sup>48 treatment. Expression profiles from ethylene biosynthesis (AcACS2 and AcACO1), gibberellin metabolism (AcGA2-ox1 and AcDELLA1), and flower development (FT-like gene (AcFT), LFY-like gene (AcLFY), and a PISTILLATA-like gene (AcPI)) genes were analysed during the first 24h after Ethrel<sup>®</sup>48 treatment. Differentiation processes of the shoot apical meristem into flower buds were already present in the first 72h after Ethrel<sup>®</sup>48 treatment. Ethrel<sup>®</sup>48 lead to a reduction in GA<sub>3</sub> levels, probably triggered by elevated ethylene levels and the positive regulation AcGA2-ox1. AcLFY activation upon Ethrel<sup>®</sup>48 may also have contributed to the reduction of GA<sub>3</sub> levels and, along with the up-regulation of AcPI, are probably associated with the flower induction activation. AcFT and AcDELLA1 do not seem to be regulated by GA<sub>3</sub> and ethylene. Decreased GA<sub>3</sub> and increased ethylene levels suggest an accumulation of AcDELLA1, which may display an important role in pineapple flowering induction. Thus, this study shows that molecular, hormonal, and histological changes are present right after Ethrel<sup>®</sup>48 treatment, providing new insights into how pineapple flowering occurs under natural conditions.
