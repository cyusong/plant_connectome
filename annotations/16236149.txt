['16236149', 'Auxin is important for lateral root (LR) initiation and subsequent LR primordium  development. However, the roles of tissue-specific auxin signaling in these  processes are poorly understood. We analyzed transgenic Arabidopsis plants  expressing the stabilized mutant INDOLE-3 ACETIC ACID 14 (IAA14)/SOLITARY-ROOT  (mIAA14) protein as a repressor of the auxin response factors (ARFs), under the  control of tissue-specific promoters. We showed that plants expressing the  mIAA14-glucocorticoid receptor (GR) fusion protein under the control of the  native IAA14 promoter had the solitary-root/iaa14 mutant phenotypes, including  the lack of LR formation under dexamethasone (Dex) treatment, indicating that  mIAA14-GR is functional in the presence of Dex. We then demonstrated that  expression of mIAA14-GR under the control of the stele-specific SHORT-ROOT  promoter suppressed LR formation, and showed that mIAA14-GR expression in the  protoxylem-adjacent pericycle also blocked LR formation, indicating that the  normal auxin response mediated by auxin/indole-3 acetic acid (Aux/IAA) signaling  in the protoxylem pericycle is necessary for LR formation. In addition, we  demonstrated that expression of mIAA14-GR under either the ARF7 or the ARF19  promoter also suppressed LR formation as in the arf7 arf19 double mutants, and  that IAA14 interacted with ARF7 and ARF19 in yeasts. These results strongly  suggest that mIAA14-GR directly inactivates ARF7/ARF19 functions, thereby  blocking LR formation. Post-embryonic expression of mIAA14-GR under the SCARECROW  promoter, which is expressed in the specific cell lineage during LR primordium  formation, caused disorganized LR development. This indicates that normal auxin  signaling in LR primordia, which involves the unknown ARFs and Aux/IAAs, is  necessary for the establishment of LR primordium organization. Thus, our data  show that tissue-specific expression of a stabilized Aux/IAA protein allows  analysis of tissue-specific auxin responses in LR development by inactivating ARF  functions.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02537.x', 'Tasaka']
