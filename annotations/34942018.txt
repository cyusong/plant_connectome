Pollen protects male sperm and allows flowering plants to adapt to diverse terrestrial environments, thereby leading to the rapid expansion of plants into new regions. The process of anther/pollen development is coordinately regulated by internal and external factors including hormones. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying gibberellin (GA)-mediated male reproductive development in plants remain unknown. We show here that rice DELLA/SLR1, which encodes the central negative regulator of GA signaling, is essential for rice anther development. The slr1-5 mutant exhibits premature programmed cell death of the tapetum, lacks Ubisch bodies, and has no exine and no mature pollen. SLR1 is mainly expressed in tapetal cells and tetrads, and is required for the appropriate expression of genes encoding key factors of pollen development, which are suggested to be OsMS188-targeted genes. OsMS188 is the main component in the essential genetic program of tapetum and pollen development. Further, we demonstrate that SLR1 interacts with OsMS188 to cooperatively activate the expression of the sporopollenin biosynthesis and transport-related genes CYP703A3, DPW, ABCG15 and PKS1 for rapid formation of pollen walls. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the GA hormonal signal is integrated into the anther genetic program and regulates rice anther development through the GA-DELLA-OsMS188 module.
