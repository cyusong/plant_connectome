['26212639', 'Although quantitative disease resistance (QDR) is a durable and broad-spectrum  form of resistance in plants, the identification of the genes underlying QDR is  still in its infancy. RKS1 (Resistance related KinaSe1) has been reported  recently to confer QDR in Arabidopsis thaliana to most but not all races of the  bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). We therefore  explored the genetic bases of QDR in A. thaliana to diverse races of  X. campestris (Xc). A nested genome-wide association mapping approach was used to  finely map the genomic regions associated with QDR to Xcc12824 (race 2) and  XccCFBP6943 (race 6). To identify the gene(s) implicated in QDR, insertional  mutants (T-DNA) were selected for the candidate genes and phenotyped in response  to Xc. We identified two major QTLs that confer resistance specifically to  Xcc12824 and XccCFBP6943. Although QDR to Xcc12824 is conferred by At5g22540  encoding for a protein of unknown function, QDR to XccCFBP6943 involves the  well-known immune receptor pair RRS1/RPS4. In addition to RKS1, this study  reveals that three genes are involved in resistance to Xc with strikingly  different ranges of specificity, suggesting that QDR to Xc involves a complex  network integrating multiple response pathways triggered by distinct pathogen  molecular determinants.', '2016 May', 'Mol Plant Pathol', '10.1111/mpp.12298', 'Roby']
