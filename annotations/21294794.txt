['21294794', 'We have identified two endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated Arabidopsis  proteins, KMS1 and KMS2, which are conserved among most species. Fluorescent  protein fusions of KMS1 localised to the ER in plant cells, and over-expression  induced the formation of a membrane structure, identified as ER whorls by  electron microscopy. Hydrophobicity analysis suggested that KMS1 and KMS2 are  integral membrane proteins bearing six transmembrane domains. Membrane protein  topology was assessed by a redox-based topology assay (ReTA) with redox-sensitive  GFP and confirmed by a protease protection assay. A major loop domain between  transmembrane domains 2 and 3, plus the N- and C-termini were found on the  cytosolic side of the ER. A C-terminal di(tri)-lysine motif is involved in  retrieval of KMS1 and deletion led to a reduction of the GFP-KMS1 signal in the  ER. Over-expression of KMS1/KMS2 truncations perturbed ER and Golgi morphology  and similar effects were also seen when KMS1/KMS2 were knocked-down by RNA  interference. Microscopy and biochemical experiments suggested that expression of  KMS1/KMS2 truncations inhibited ER to Golgi protein transport.', '2011 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04522.x', 'Hawes']
