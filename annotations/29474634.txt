Plant-derived strigolactones have diverse functions at ecological scale, including effects upon the growth of plants themselves. The parasitic plants from the family Orobanchaceae interfere with the ecological and hormonal functions of strigolactones to generate unique germination abilities based on the sensing of host-derived strigolactones. Although the recent discovery of strigolactone receptors has enabled us to begin elucidating the mechanism of strigolactone perception, how perception relates to plant parasitism is still a mystery. In this review, we explore emerging questions by introducing recent advances in strigolactone research in parasitic plants. We also attempt to construct a conceptual framework for the unique in planta dynamics of strigolactone perception uncovered through the use of fluorescent probes for strigolactone receptors. Understanding the mechanisms of strigolactone-related processes is essential for controlling the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica, which has caused devastating damage to crop production in Africa.
