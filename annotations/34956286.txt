Bryophytes are the dominant vegetation in the Antarctic continent. They have suffered more unpleasant ultraviolet radiation due to the Antarctic ozone layer destruction. However, it remains unclear about the molecular mechanism of Antarctic moss acclimation to UV-B light. Here, the transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches were conducted to uncover transcriptional and metabolic profiling of the Antarctic moss <i>Leptobryum pyriforme</i> under UV-B radiation. Totally, 67,290 unigenes with N<sub>50</sub> length of 2,055 bp were assembled. Of them, 1,594 unigenes were significantly up-regulated and 3353 unigenes were markedly down-regulated under UV-B radiation. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in UV-B signaling, flavonoid biosynthesis, ROS scavenging, and DNA repair. In addition, a total of 531 metabolites were detected, while flavonoids and anthocyanins accounted for 10.36% of the total compounds. There were 49 upregulated metabolites and 41 downregulated metabolites under UV-B radiation. Flavonoids were the most significantly changed metabolites. qPCR analysis showed that UVR8-COP1-HY5 signaling pathway genes and photolyase genes (i.e., <i>LpUVR3</i>, <i>LpPHR1</i>, and <i>LpDPL</i>) were significantly up-regulated under UV-B light. In addition, the expression levels of JA signaling pathway-related genes (i.e., <i>OPR</i> and <i>JAZ</i>) and flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were also significantly increased under UV-B radiation. The integrative data analysis showed that UVR8-mediated signaling, jasmonate signaling, flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and DNA repair system might contribute to <i>L. pyriforme</i> acclimating to UV-B radiation. Therefore, these findings present a novel knowledge for understanding the adaption of Antarctic moss to polar environments and provide a foundation for assessing the impact of global climate change on Antarctic land plants.
