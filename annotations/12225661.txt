['12225661', 'BACKGROUND: Plant development is exquisitely sensitive to light. Seedlings grown  in the dark have a developmentally arrested etiolated phenotype, whereas in the  light they develop leaves and complete their life cycle. Arabidopsis de-etiolated  1 (det1) mutants develop like light-grown seedlings even when grown in the dark.  DET1 encodes a nuclear protein that appears to act downstream from multiple  photoreceptors to regulate morphogenesis and gene expression in response to  light. However, its function has remained unknown. RESULTS: We used microarrays  to examine defects in transcription in dark-grown det1 seedlings. We found  extensive changes in gene expression, including many of the transcriptional  responses observed in light-treated wild-type seedlings. We used an  epitope-tagging approach to determine the basis of DET1 function. GFP-DET1  rescues the det1 phenotype, is localized to the nucleus, and forms an  approximately 350 kDa complex, which is required for full DET1 activity. We  affinity-purified the DET1 complex and identified an approximately 120 kDa  copurifying protein that is the plant homolog of UV-Damaged DNA Binding Protein 1  (DDB1), a protein implicated in the human disease xeroderma pigmentosa. A null  mutation in Arabidopsis DDB1A results in no obvious phenotype on its own, yet it  enhances the phenotype of a weak det1 allele. CONCLUSIONS: DET1 and DDB1 interact  both biochemically and genetically. In animal cells, DDB1 interacts with histone  acetyltransferase complexes. The DET1/DDB1 complex may regulate gene expression  in response to light via recruitment of HAT activity. Thus, DET1, whose sequence  is conserved in both animals and plants, may play a direct role in the regulation  of many genes.', '2002 Sep 3', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01106-5', 'Chory']
