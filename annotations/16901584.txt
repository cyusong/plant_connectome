The influence of 50 and 100 microM Ni on chlorophyll and tocopherol contents, as well as lipid peroxidation was studied in the shoots of wheat plants. Chlorophyll content in the shoots decreased in response to Ni application. Ni stress led to an enhancement of lipid peroxides content, accompanied by a substantial increase in tocopherol concentration in the wheat shoots.
