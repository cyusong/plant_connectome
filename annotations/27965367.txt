Plant cells communicate with each other using a variety of signaling molecules. Recent studies have revealed that various types of secreted peptides, as well as phytohormones known since long ago, mediate cell-cell communication in diverse contexts of plant life. These peptides affect cellular activities, such as proliferation and cell fate decisions, through their perception by cell surface receptors located on the plasma membrane of target cells. ERECTA (ER), an Arabidopsis thaliana receptor kinase gene, was first identified as a stem growth regulator, and since then an increasing number of studies have shown that ER is involved in a wide range of developmental and physiological processes. In particular, molecular functions of ER have been extensively studied in stomatal patterning. Furthermore, the importance of ER signaling in vascular tissues of inflorescence stems, especially in phloem cells, has recently been highlighted. In this review article, first we briefly summarize the history of ER research including studies on stomatal development, then introduce ER functions in vascular tissues, and discuss its interactions with phytohormones and other receptor kinase signaling pathways. Future questions and challenges will also be addressed.
