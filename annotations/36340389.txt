Jasmine [<i>Jasminum sambac</i> (L.) Aiton] is a commercially important cultivated plant species known for its fragrant flowers used in the perfume industry, medicine and cosmetics. In the present study, we obtained a draft genome for the <i>J. sambac</i> cultivar 'Danbanmoli' (JSDB, a single-petal phenotype). We showed that the final genome of <i>J. sambac</i> was 520.80 Mb in size (contig N50 = 145.43 kb; scaffold N50 = 145.53 kb) and comprised 35,363 genes. Our analyses revealed that the <i>J. sambac</i> genome has undergone only an ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event. We estimated that the lineage that has given rise to <i>J. sambac</i> diverged from the lineage leading to <i>Osmanthus fragrans</i> and <i>Olea europaea</i> approximately 31.1 million years ago (Mya). On the basis of a combination of genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we identified 92 transcription factors (TFs) and 206 genes related to heat stress response. Base on a combination of genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, a range of aroma compounds and genes involved in the benzenoid/phenylpropanoid and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways were identified. In the newly assembled <i>J. sambac</i> genome, we identified a total of 122 MYB, 122 bHLH and 69 WRKY genes. Our assembled <i>J. sambac</i> JSDB genome provides fundamental knowledge to study the molecular mechanism of heat stress tolerance, and improve jasmine flowers and dissect its fragrance.
