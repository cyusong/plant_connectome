In plants, phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) homeostasis is regulated by the interaction of PHR transcription factors with stand-alone SPX proteins, which act as sensors for inositol pyrophosphates. In this study, we combined different methods to obtain a comprehensive picture of how inositol (pyro)phosphate metabolism is regulated by P<sub>i</sub> and dependent on the inositol phosphate kinase ITPK1. We found that inositol pyrophosphates are more responsive to P<sub>i</sub> than lower inositol phosphates, a response conserved across kingdoms. Using the capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) we could separate different InsP<sub>7</sub> isomers in Arabidopsis and rice, and identify 4/6-InsP<sub>7</sub> and a PP-InsP<sub>4</sub> isomer hitherto not reported in plants. We found that the inositol pyrophosphates 1/3-InsP<sub>7</sub>, 5-InsP<sub>7</sub>, and InsP<sub>8</sub> increase several fold in shoots after P<sub>i</sub> resupply and that tissue-specific accumulation of inositol pyrophosphates relies on ITPK1 activities and MRP5-dependent InsP<sub>6</sub> compartmentalization. Notably, ITPK1 is critical for P<sub>i</sub>-dependent 5-InsP<sub>7</sub> and InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis in planta and its activity regulates P<sub>i</sub> starvation responses in a PHR-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ITPK1-mediated conversion of InsP<sub>6</sub> to 5-InsP<sub>7</sub> requires high ATP concentrations and that Arabidopsis ITPK1 has an ADP phosphotransferase activity to dephosphorylate specifically 5-InsP<sub>7</sub> under low ATP. Collectively, our study provides new insights into P<sub>i</sub>-dependent changes in nutritional and energetic states with the synthesis of regulatory inositol pyrophosphates.
