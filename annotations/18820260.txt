The effect of heavy metals on the modification of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.3.14) activity in cucumber roots was studied. In plants stressed for 2 h with 10 microM or 100 microM Cd, Cu or Ni the hydrolytic as well as the transporting activity of H(+)-ATPase in the plasma membranes of root cells was decreased. Transcript levels of Cucumis sativus plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in roots treated with 10 microM Cd, Cu, or Ni as well as with 100 microM Cu or Ni were similar to the control, indicating that the action of metals did not involve the gene expression level. Only in roots exposed to 100 microM Cd was the level of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase mRNA markedly decreased. The inhibition of the plasma membrane proton pump caused by 100 microM Cd, Cu and Ni was partially diminished in the presence of cantharidin, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatases. Western blot analysis with the antibody against phosphothreonine confirmed that decreased activity of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase under heavy metals resulted from dephosphorylation of the enzyme protein. Taken together, these data strongly indicated that alteration of the enzyme under heavy metal stresses was mainly due to the post-translational modification of its proteins in short-term experiments.

Heavy metals: !inhibit! H(+)-ATPase activity 
H(+)-ATPase mRNA: !unchanged! by heavy metals 
Heavy metals: !dephosphorylate! H(+)-ATPase protein 
Cantharidin: !partially diminishes! inhibition of H(+)-ATPase
