Identification of bioactive natural products from plants starts with the screening of extracts for a desired bioactivity such as antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, or neuroprotective. When the bioactivity shows sufficient potency, the plant material is subjected to bio-activity-guided fractionation, which involves, e.g., sequential extraction followed by chromatographic separation, including HPLC. The bioactive compounds are then structurally identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). One of the questions that come up during the purification process is how much of the bioactivity originally present in the crude extract is preserved during the purification process. If this is the case, it is interesting to investigate if the loss of total bioactivity is caused by the loss of material during purification or by the degradation or evaporation of potent compounds. A further possibility would be the loss of synergy between compounds present in the mixture, which disappears when the compounds are separated. In this publication, a novel formula is introduced that allows researchers to calculate total bioactivity in biological samples using experimental data from our research into the discovery of anti-inflammatory compounds from <i>Backhousia myrtifolia</i> (Grey Myrtle). The results presented show that a raw ethanolic extract retains slightly more bioactivity than the sum of all sequential extracts per gram of starting material and that-despite a large loss of material during HPLC purification-the total bioactivity in all purified fractions is retained, which is indicative of rather an additive than a synergistic principle.
