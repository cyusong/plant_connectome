['29284002', 'Ion homeostasis is essential for plant growth and environmental adaptation, and  maintaining ion homeostasis requires the precise regulation of various ion  transporters, as well as correct root patterning. However, the mechanisms  underlying these processes remain largely elusive. Here, we reported that a  choline transporter gene, CTL1, controls ionome homeostasis by regulating the  secretory trafficking of proteins required for plasmodesmata (PD) development, as  well as the transport of some ion transporters. Map-based cloning studies  revealed that CTL1 mutations alter the ion profile of Arabidopsis thaliana. We  found that the phenotypes associated with these mutations are caused by a  combination of PD defects and ion transporter misregulation. We also established  that CTL1 is involved in regulating vesicle trafficking and is thus required for  the trafficking of proteins essential for ion transport and PD development.  Characterizing choline transporter-like 1 (CTL1) as a new regulator of protein  sorting may enable researchers to understand not only ion homeostasis in plants  but also vesicle trafficking in general.', '2017 Dec', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.2002978', 'Chao']
