Pit membranes between xylem vessels play a major role in angiosperm water transport. Yet, their three-dimensional (3D) structure as fibrous porous media remains unknown, largely due to technical challenges and sample preparation artefacts. Here, we applied a modelling approach based on thickness measurements of fresh and fully shrunken pit membranes of seven species. Pore constrictions were also investigated visually by perfusing fresh material with colloidal gold particles of known sizes. Based on a shrinkage model, fresh pit membranes showed tiny pore constrictions of ca. 20 nm, but a very high porosity (i.e. pore volume fraction) of on average 0.81. Perfusion experiments showed similar pore constrictions in fresh samples, well below 50 nm based on transmission electron microscopy. Drying caused a 50% shrinkage of pit membranes, resulting in much smaller pore constrictions. These findings suggest that pit membranes represent a mesoporous medium, with the pore space characterized by multiple constrictions. Constrictions are much smaller than previously assumed, but the pore volume is large and highly interconnected. Pores do not form highly tortuous, bent, or zigzagging pathways. These insights provide a novel view on pit membranes, which is essential to develop a mechanistic, 3D understanding of air-seeding through this porous medium.
