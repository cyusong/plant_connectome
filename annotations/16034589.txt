Side branch formation in the moss, Physcomitrella patens, has been shown to be light dependent with cryptochrome 1a and 1b (Ppcry1a and Ppcry1b), being the blue light receptors for this response (Imaizumi et al. in Plant Cell 14:373, 2002). In this study, detailed photobiological analyses were performed, which revealed that this response involves multiple photoreceptors including cryptochromes. For light induction of branches, blue light of a fluence rate higher than 6 micromol m(-2) s(-1) for period longer than 3 h is required. The number of branches increased with the increase in fluence rate and in the irradiation period. The number of branches also increased when red light was applied together with the blue light, although red light alone had a very few effect. By partially irradiating a cell, both receptive sites for blue and red light were found to be located around the nucleus. Further, both red and blue light determine the positions of branches being dependent upon the vibration plane of polarized light. Red light control of branch position was nullified by simultaneous far-red light irradiation. A blue light effect on branch position was not found in lines with disrupted phototropin genes. Thus, dichroic phytochrome and phototropin, possibly on the plasma membrane, regulate branch position. These results indicate that at least four distinct photoreceptor systems, namely, cryptochromes and red light receptor around or in the nucleus, dichroic phytochrome and phototropin around the cell periphery, are involved in the light induction of side branches in the moss Physcomitrella patens.
