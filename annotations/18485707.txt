['18485707', 'In bacterial and animal systems, mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels are thought  to mediate the perception of pressure, touch, and sound [1-3]. Although plants  respond to a wide variety of mechanical stimuli, and although many  mechanosensitive channel activities have been characterized in plant membranes by  the patch-clamp method, the molecular nature of mechanoperception in plant  systems has remained elusive [4]. Likely candidates are relatives of MscS  (Mechanosensitive channel of small conductance), a well-characterized MS channel  that serves to protect E. coli from osmotic shock [5]. Ten MscS-Like (MSL)  proteins are found in the genome of the model flowering plant Arabidopsis  thaliana[4, 6, 7]. MSL2 and MSL3, along with MSC1, a MscS family member from  green algae, are implicated in the control of organelle morphology [8, 9]. Here,  we characterize MSL9 and MSL10, two MSL proteins found in the plasma membrane of  root cells. We use a combined genetic and electrophysiological approach to show  that MSL9 and MSL10, along with three other members of the MSL family, are  required for MS channel activities detected in protoplasts derived from root  cells. This is the first molecular identification and characterization of MS  channels in plant membranes.', '2008 May 20', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.039', 'Frachisse']
