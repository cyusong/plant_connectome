Although recent studies suggest that the plant cytoskeleton is associated with plant stress responses, such as salt, cold, and drought, the molecular mechanism underlying microtubule function in plant salt stress response remains unclear. We performed a comparative proteomic analysis between control suspension-cultured cells (A0) and salt-adapted cells (A120) established from <i>Arabidopsis</i> root callus to investigate plant adaptation mechanisms to long-term salt stress. We identified 50 differentially expressed proteins (45 up- and 5 down-regulated proteins) in A120 cells compared with A0 cells. Gene ontology enrichment and protein network analyses indicated that differentially expressed proteins in A120 cells were strongly associated with cell structure-associated clusters, including cytoskeleton and cell wall biogenesis. Gene expression analysis revealed that expressions of cytoskeleton-related genes, such as <i>FBA8</i>, <i>TUB3</i>, <i>TUB4</i>, <i>TUB7</i>, <i>TUB9</i>, and <i>ACT7</i>, and a cell wall biogenesis-related gene, <i>CCoAOMT1</i>, were induced in salt-adapted A120 cells. Moreover, the loss-of-function mutant of <i>Arabidopsis</i>&nbsp;<i>TUB9</i> gene, <i>tub9</i>, showed a hypersensitive phenotype to salt stress. Consistent overexpression of <i>Arabidopsis</i>&nbsp;<i>TUB9</i> gene in rice transgenic plants enhanced tolerance to salt stress. Our results suggest that microtubules play crucial roles in plant adaptation and tolerance to salt stress. The modulation of microtubule-related gene expression can be an effective strategy for developing salt-tolerant crops.
