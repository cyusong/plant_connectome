Pollen tube integrity, growth and guidance are crucial factors in plant sexual reproduction. Members of the plant Skewed5 (SKU5) Similar (SKS) family show strong similarity to multicopper oxidases (MCOs), but they lack conserved histidines in MCO active sites. The functions of most SKS family members are unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis pollen-expressed SKS11 and SKS12 play important roles in pollen tube integrity, growth and guidance. The sks11sks12 mutant exhibited significantly reduced male fertility. Most of the pollen from sks11sks12 plants burst when germinated, and the pollen tubes grew slowly and exhibited defective growth along the funiculus and micropyle. SKS11-GFP and SKS12-mCherry were detected at the cell wall in pollen tubes. The contents of several cell wall polysaccharides and arabinogalactans were decreased in the pollen tube cell walls of sks11sks12 plants. Staining with a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive dye and use of the H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> sensor HyPer revealed that the ROS content in the pollen tubes of sks11sks12 plants was remarkably reduced. SKS11<sup>444His-Ala</sup> , in which the last conserved histidine was mutated, could restore the mutant phenotypes of sks11sks12. Thus, SKS11/12 are required for pollen tube integrity, growth and guidance possibly by regulating the ROS level and cell wall polysaccharide deposition or remodeling in pollen tubes.
