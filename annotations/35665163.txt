In previous research on the resistance of cotton to Verticillium wilt (VW), <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> and <i>G. barbadense</i> were usually used as the susceptible and resistant cotton species, despite their different genetic backgrounds. Herein, we present data independent acquisition (DIA)-based comparative proteomic analysis of two <i>G. barbadense</i> cultivars differing in VW tolerance, susceptible XH7 and resistant XH21. A total of 4,118 proteins were identified, and 885 of them were differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Eight co-expressed modules were identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis. GO enrichment analysis of the module that significantly correlated with <i>V. dahliae</i> infection time revealed that oxidoreductase and peroxidase were the most significantly enriched GO terms. The last-step rate-limiting enzyme for ascorbate acid (AsA) biosynthesis was further uncovered in the significantly enriched GO terms of the 184 XH21-specific DAPs. Additionally, the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (<i>APX</i>) members showed quick accumulation after inoculation. Compared to XH7, XH21 contained consistently higher AsA contents and rapidly increased levels of <i>APX</i> expression, suggesting their potential importance for the resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Silencing <i>GbAPX1</i>/<i>12</i> in both XH7 and XH 21 resulted in a dramatic reduction in VW resistance. Our data indicate that APX-mediated oxidoreductive metabolism is important for VW resistance in cotton.
