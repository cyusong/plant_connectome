The homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) defines the shoot stem cell niche, but the mechanisms underlying the establishment of <i>WUS</i> expression remain unclear. Here, we show that cytokinin signaling precedes <i>WUS</i> expression in leaf axils and activates <i>WUS</i> expression de novo in the leaf axil to promote axillary meristem initiation. Furthermore, type-B Arabidopsis response regulator proteins, which are transcriptional activators in the cytokinin signaling pathway, directly bind to the <i>WUS</i> promoter and activate its expression. Finally, we show that cytokinin activation of <i>WUS</i> in the leaf axil correlates with increased histone acetylation and methylation markers associated with transcriptional activation, supporting the fact that <i>WUS</i> expression requires a permissive epigenetic environment to restrict it to highly defined meristematic tissues. Taken together, these findings explain how cytokinin regulates axillary meristem initiation and establish a mechanistic framework for the postembryonic establishment of the shoot stem cell niche.
