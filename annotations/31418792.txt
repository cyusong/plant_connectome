SCO (synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase) proteins are involved in the insertion of copper during the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the final enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Two SCO proteins, namely, homolog of copper chaperone 1 and 2 (HCC1 and HCC2) are present in seed plants, but HCC2 lacks the residues involved in copper binding, leading to uncertainties about its function. In this study, we performed a transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with reduced expression of HCC1 or HCC2. We observed that a deficiency in HCC1 causes a decrease in the expression of several stress-responsive genes, both under basal growth conditions and after applying a short-term high salinity treatment. In addition, HCC1 deficient plants show a faster decrease in chlorophyll content, photosystem II quantum efficiency and COX levels after salinity stress, as well as a faster increase in alternative oxidase capacity. Notably, HCC2 deficiency causes opposite changes in most of these parameters. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis indicated that both proteins are able to interact. We postulate that HCC1 is a limiting factor for COX assembly during high salinity conditions and that HCC2 probably acts as a negative modulator of HCC1 activity through protein-protein interactions. In addition, a direct or indirect role of HCC1 and HCC2 in the gene expression response to stress is proposed.

HCC1: !synthesizes! COX
HCC2: !interacts with! HCC1
HCC1: !enhances! stress-responsive gene expression
HCC2: !represses! HCC1 activity
