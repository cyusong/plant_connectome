Iron (Fe) is an essential plant micronutrient since many cellular processes including photosynthesis, respiration, and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species depend on adequate Fe levels; however, non-complexed Fe ions can be dangerous for cells, as they can act as pro-oxidants. Hence, plants possess a complex homeostatic control system for safely taking up Fe from the soil and transporting it to its various cellular destinations, and for its subcellular compartmentalization. At the end of the plant's life cycle, maturing seeds are loaded with the required amount of Fe needed for germination and early seedling establishment. In this review, we discuss recent findings on how the microbiota in the rhizosphere influence and interact with the strategies adopted by plants to take up iron from the soil. We also focus on the process of seed-loading with Fe, and for crop species we also consider its associated metabolism in wild relatives. These two aspects of plant Fe nutrition may provide promising avenues for a better comprehension of the long pathway of Fe from soil to seeds.
