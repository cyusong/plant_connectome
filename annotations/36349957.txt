Increasing plant photosynthetic capacity is a promising approach to boost yields, but it is particularly challenging in C<sub>3</sub> crops, such as soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Here, we identified GmFtsH25, encoding a member of the filamentation temperature-sensitive protein H protease family, as a major gene involved in soybean photosynthesis, using linkage mapping and a genome-wide association study. Overexpressing GmFtsH25 resulted in more grana thylakoid stacks in chloroplasts and increased photosynthetic efficiency and starch content, while knocking out GmFtsH25 produced the opposite phenotypes. GmFtsH25 interacted with photosystem I light harvesting complex 2 (GmLHCa2), and this interaction may contribute to the observed enhanced photosynthesis. GmFtsH25 overexpression lines had superior yield traits, such as yield per plant, compared to the wild type and knockout lines. Additionally, we identified an elite haplotype of GmFtsH25, generated by natural mutations, which appears to have been selected during soybean domestication. Our study sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which GmFtsH25 modulates photosynthesis and provides a promising strategy for improving the yields of soybean and other crops.
