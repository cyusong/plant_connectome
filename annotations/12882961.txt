['12882961', 'In plants, gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA), a non-protein amino acid, accumulates  rapidly in response to a variety of abiotic stresses such as oxygen deficiency.  Under normoxia, GABA is catabolized to succinic semialdehyde and then to  succinate with the latter reaction being catalyzed by succinic semialdehyde  dehydrogenase (SSADH). Complementation of an SSADH-deficient yeast mutant with an  Arabidopsis cDNA library enabled the identification of a novel cDNA (designated  as AtGH-BDH for Arabidopsis thaliana gamma-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), which  encodes a 289-amino acid polypeptide containing an NADP-binding domain.  Constitutive expression of AtGHBDH in the mutant yeast enabled growth on 20 mm  GABA and significantly enhanced the cellular concentrations of  gamma-hydroxybutyrate, the product of the GHDBH reaction. These data confirm that  the cDNA encodes a polypeptide with GHBDH activity. Arabidopsis plants subjected  to flooding-induced oxygen deficiency for up to 4 h possessed elevated  concentrations of gamma-hydroxybutyrate as well as GABA and alanine. RNA  expression analysis revealed that GHBDH transcription was not up-regulated by  oxygen deficiency. These findings suggest that GHBDH activity is regulated by the  supply of succinic semialdehyde or by redox balance. It is proposed that GHBDH  and SSADH activities in plants are regulated in a complementary fashion and that  GHBDH and gamma-hydroxybutyrate function in oxidative stress tolerance.', '2003 Oct 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M305717200', 'Shelp']
