The heat stress response is an important adaptation, enabling plants to survive challenging environmental conditions. Our previous work demonstrated that Arabidopsis thaliana Phosphoinositide-Specific Phospholipase C Isoform 9 (AtPLC9) plays an important role in thermotolerance. During prolonged heat treatment, mutants of AtPLC3 showed decreased heat resistance. We observed no obvious phenotypic differences between plc3 mutants and wild type (WT) seedlings under normal growth conditions, but after heat shock, the plc3 seedlings displayed a decline in thermotolerance compared with WT, and also showed a 40-50% decrease in survival rate and chlorophyll contents. Expression of AtPLC3 in plc3 mutants rescued the heat-sensitive phenotype; the AtPLC3-overexpressing lines also exhibited much higher heat resistance than WT and vector-only controls. The double mutants of plc3 and plc9 displayed increased sensitivity to heat stress, compared with either single mutant. In transgenic lines containing a AtPLC3:GUS promoter fusion, GUS staining showed that AtPLC3 expresses in all tissues, except anthers and young root tips. Using the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent probe Fluo-3/AM and aequorin reconstitution, we showed that plc3 mutants show a reduction in the heat-induced Ca(2+) increase. The expression of HSP genes (HSP18.2, HSP25.3, HSP70-1 and HSP83) was down-regulated in plc3 mutants and up-regulated in AtPLC3-overexpressing lines after heat shock. These results indicated that AtPLC3 also plays a role in thermotolerance in Arabidopsis, and that AtPLC3 and AtPLC9 function additionally to each other.
