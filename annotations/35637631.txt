Sympatric genetic divergence is the most appealing and controversial pattern in the theory of ecological speciation. Examples that support sympatric genetic divergence in plant species are extremely rare. Solid evidence of sympatric genetic divergence will provide deep insights for revealing the underlying mechanisms of ecological speciation. We analysed the total genomic DNA sequences of 120 weedy rice (WR; Oryza sativa f. spontanea) plants, representing three WR population pairs separately from three early- and late-season rice fields, in comparison with those of the co-occurring rice cultivars and other rice materials. We detected substantial genetic divergence within the pairs of the sympatric early- and late-season WR populations, although genetic divergence was unevenly distributed across the genomes. Restricted gene flow was determined between the sympatric WR populations, resulting in their distinct genetic structures. We also detected relatively low genetic diversity that was likely to be associated with stronger selection in early-season WR populations. Our findings provide strong evidence for sympatric genetic divergence between the WR populations in the same fields but in different seasons. We conclude that temporal isolation plays an important role in creating genetic divergence between sympatric populations/species in plants.
