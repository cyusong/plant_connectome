Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are involved in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and conversion, a fundamental process in photosynthetic organisms. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and intracellular conversion in cyanobacteria is largely unknown. We report the characterization of a previously unrecognized thylakoid-located CA Slr0051 (EcaB) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which possesses CA activity to regulate CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. Inactivation of ecaB stimulated CO<sub>2</sub> hydration in the thylakoids, suppressed by the classical CA inhibitor acetazolamide. Absence of ecaB increased the reduced state of the photosynthetic electron transport system, lowered the rate of photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution at high light (HL) and pH, and decreased the cellular affinity for extracellular inorganic carbon. Furthermore, EcaB was upregulated in cells grown at limiting CO<sub>2</sub> concentration or HL in tandem with CupA. EcaB is mainly located in the thylakoid membranes where it interacts with CupA and CupB involved in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by converting it to bicarbonate. We propose that modulation of the EcaB level and activity in response to CO<sub>2</sub> changes, illumination or pH reversibly regulates its conversion to HCO<sub>3</sub> by the two CO<sub>2</sub> -uptake systems (CupA, CupB), dissipating the excess HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and alleviating photoinhibition, and thereby optimizes photosynthesis, especially under HL and alkaline conditions.
