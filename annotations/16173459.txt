To investigate the temporal sequence of physiological reactions of garlic (Allium sativum) to cadmium (Cd) treatment, seedlings developed from cloves were grown in increasing concentrations of CdCl2, ranging from 1-10 mM, for up to 8 days in sand. Analysis of Cd uptake indicated that most Cd accumulated in roots, but some was also translocated and accumulated in leaves at longer exposure time (after 12h) and higher concentrations (5 and 10mM) of CdCl2. Changes in activities of antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), were characterized in leaves of garlic seedlings. Cd (5 and 10 mM) initially inhibited the activities of SOD and CAT but thereafter recovered or even increased compared with control plants. POD activities at 5 and 10 mM of Cd increased more than 3-4 times over control plants within 12 h and then dropped, but were still higher than controls at the end of the experiment. Otherwise lipid peroxidation enhanced with the increasing of incubation time and concentrations of external Cd. Leaves exposed to 1 mM CdCl2 showed a less pronounced response and only a small reduction in shoot growth. These results suggested that in leaves of garlic seedlings challenged by CdCl2 at higher concentrations, induction of these various enzymes is part of a general defense strategy to cope with overproduction of reactive oxygen. The possible mechanism of antioxidative enzymes changing before Cd accumulation in leaves of garlic seedlings is discussed.
