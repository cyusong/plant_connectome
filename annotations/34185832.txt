Plants are exposed to a wide range of temperatures during their life cycle and need to continuously adapt. These adaptations need to deal with temperature changes on a daily and seasonal level and with temperatures affected by climate change. Increasing global temperatures negatively impact crop performance, and several physiological, biochemical, morphological and developmental responses to increased temperature have been described that allow plants to mitigate this. In this review, we assess various growth, development, and yield-related responses of crops to extreme and moderate high temperature, focusing on knowledge gained from both monocot (e.g. wheat, barley, maize, rice) and dicot crops (e.g. soybean and tomato) and incorporating information from model plants (e.g. Arabidopsis and Brachypodium). This revealed common and different responses between dicot and monocot crops, and defined different temperature thresholds depending on the species, growth stage and organ.
