['31444832', 'In Arabidopsis, lateral root (LR) development is mainly controlled by several  known auxin-regulated transcription factors (TFs). Here, we show that AtHB23 (a  homeodomain-leucine zipper I TF) participates in this intricate network. Our  study of the expression pattern of AtHB23 revealed that it is transcriptionally  activated in the early stages of secondary LR primordium (LRP). We found that  AtHB23 directly limits the expression of LBD16, a key factor in LR initiation,  and also directly induces the auxin transporter gene LAX3. We propose that this  HD-Zip I mediates the regulation of LAX3 by ARF7/19. Furthermore, AtHB23 plays  distinct roles during the formation of secondary and tertiary roots, exhibiting  differential expression patterns. ATHB23 is expressed throughout the tertiary  root primordium, whereas it is restricted to early stages in secondary primordia,  likely later repressing LBD16 in tertiary LR development and further inhibiting  root emergence. Our results suggest that different genetic programs govern the  formation of LRP from the main or secondary roots, thereby shaping the global  dynamic architecture of the root system.', '2019 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14511', 'ORCID:']
