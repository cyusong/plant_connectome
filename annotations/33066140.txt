Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. Plant species respond to N fluctuations and N sources, i.e., ammonium or nitrate, differently. Masson pine (<i>Pinus massoniana</i> Lamb.) is one of the pioneer plants in the southern forests of China. It shows better growth when grown in medium containing ammonium as compared to nitrate. In this study, we had grown masson pine seedlings in medium containing ammonium, nitrate, and a mixture of both, and performed comparative transcriptome and proteome analyses to observe the differential signatures. Our transcriptome and proteome resulted in the identification of 1593 and 71 differentially expressed genes and proteins, respectively. Overall, the masson pine roots had better performance when fed with a mixture of ammonium and nitrate. The transcriptomic and proteomics results combined with the root morphological responses suggest that when ammonium is supplied as a sole N-source to masson pine seedlings, the expression of ammonium transporters and other non-specific NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-channels increased, resulting in higher NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations. This stimulates lateral roots branching as evidenced from increased number of root tips. We discussed the root performance in association with ethylene responsive transcription factors, WRKYs, and MADS-box transcription factors. The differential analysis data suggest that the adaptability of roots to ammonium is possibly through the promotion of TCA cycle, owing to the higher expression of malate synthase and malate dehydrogenase. Masson pine seedlings managed the increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> influx by rerouting N resources to asparagine production. Additionally, flavonoid biosynthesis and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis pathways were differentially regulated in response to increased ammonium influx. Finally, changes in the glutathione s-transferase genes suggested the role of glutathione cycle in scavenging the possible stress induced by excess NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. These results demonstrate that masson pine shows increased growth when grown under ammonium by increased N assimilation. Furthermore, it can tolerate high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> content by involving asparagine biosynthesis and glutathione cycle.
