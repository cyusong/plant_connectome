The demand for agricultural crops continues to escalate with the rapid growth of the population. However, extreme climates, pests and diseases, and environmental pollution pose a huge threat to agricultural food production. Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are beneficial for plant growth and production and can be used as nanopesticides, nanoherbicides, and nanofertilizers in agriculture. This article provides a review of the absorption and transportation of SNPs in plants, as well as their role and mechanisms in promoting plant growth and enhancing plant resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. In general, SNPs induce plant resistance against stress factors by strengthening the physical barrier, improving plant photosynthesis, activating defensive enzyme activity, increasing anti-stress compounds, and activating the expression of defense-related genes. The effect of SNPs on plants stress is related to the physical and chemical properties (e.g., particle size and surface charge) of SNPs, soil, and stress type. Future research needs to focus on the "SNPs-plant-soil-microorganism" system by using omics and the in-depth study of the molecular mechanisms of SNPs-mediated plant resistance.
