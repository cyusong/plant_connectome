Drought is one of the most important environmental constraints affecting plant growth and development and ultimately leads to yield loss. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) are believed to play key roles in coping with environmental stresses. In rice, it is estimated that there are more than 200 <i>UGT</i> genes. However, most of them have not been identified as their physiological significance. In this study, we reported the characterization of a putative glycosyltransferase gene <i>UGT85E1</i> in rice. <i>UGT85E1</i> gene is significantly upregulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The overexpression of <i>UGT85E1</i> led to an enhanced tolerance in transgenic rice plants to drought stress, while the <i>ugt85e1</i> mutants of rice showed a more sensitive phenotype to drought stress. Further studies indicated that <i>UGT85E1</i> overexpression induced ABA accumulation, stomatal closure, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, increased proline and sugar contents, and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress conditions. Moreover, when <i>UGT85E1</i> was ectopically overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the transgenic plants showed increased tolerance to drought as well as in rice. Our findings suggest that <i>UGT85E1</i> plays an important role in mediating plant response to drought and oxidative stresses. This work may provide a promising candidate gene for cultivating drought-tolerant crops both in dicots and monocots.
