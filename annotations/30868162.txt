Senescence is a regulated process of tissue degeneration that can affect any plant organ and consists of the degradation and remobilization of molecules to other growing tissues. Senescent organs display changes at the microscopic level as well as modifications to internal cellular structure and differential gene expression. A large number of factors influencing senescence have been described including age, nutrient supply, and environmental interactions. Internal factors such as phytohormones also affect the timing of leaf senescence. A link between the senescence process and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in senescing tissues has been known for many years. Remarkably, this link can be either a positive or a negative correlation depending upon the organ. NO can be both a signaling or a toxic molecule and is known to have multiple roles in plants; this review considers the duality of NO roles in the senescence process of two different plant organs, namely the leaves and root nodules.
