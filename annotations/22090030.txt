['22090030', 'Subclass III SnRK2s (SnRK2.6/2.3/2.2) are the key positive regulators of abscisic  acid (ABA) signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana. The kinases, activated by  ABA or osmotic stress, phosphorylate stress-related transcription factors and ion  channels, which ultimately leads to the protection of plants from dehydration or  high salinity. In the absence of stressors, SnRK2s are subject to negative  regulation by group A protein phosphatase type 2Cs (PP2C), whereas the underlying  molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we report the crystal  structure of the kinase domain of SnRK2.6 at 2.6-A resolution. Structure-guided  biochemical analyses identified two distinct interfaces between SnRK2.6 and ABI1,  a member of group A PP2Cs. Structural modeling suggested that the two interfaces  lock SnRK2.6 and ABI1 in an orientation such that the activation loop of SnRK2.6  is posited to the catalytic site of ABI1 for dephosphorylation. These studies  revealed the molecular basis for PP2Cs-mediated inhibition of SnRK2s and provided  important insights into the downstream signal transduction of ABA.', '2012 Jan 2', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111.313106', 'Yan']
