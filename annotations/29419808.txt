When plants are subjected to unfavorable environmental conditions, overall gene expression in stressed cells is altered from a programmed pattern for normal development to an adaptive pattern for survival. Rapid changes in plant gene expression include production of stress responsive proteins for protection as well as reduction of irrelevant proteins to minimize energy consumption during growth. In addition to the many established mechanisms known to modulate gene expression in eukaryotes, a novel strategy involving tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) was recently reported to control gene expression. In animals, tRFs are shown to play a certain role in infected or cancer cells. However, tRFs are expected to function in the regulation of gene expression against abiotic stress conditions in plants. Moreover, the underlying mechanism linking up-regulation of tRFs under stress conditions with the stress tolerant response remains unknown. In this review, the biogenesis and putative function of diverse tRFs in abiotic stress signaling are discussed with a focus on tRFs as a transcriptional/post-transcriptional/translational regulator.
