Bradyrhizobium ORS285 forms a nitrogen-fixating symbiosis with both Nod factor (NF)-dependent and NF-independent <i>Aeschynomene</i> spp. The <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> ORS285 <i>ribBA</i> gene encodes for a putative bifunctional enzyme with 3,4-dihydroxybutanone phosphate (3,4-DHBP) synthase and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase II activities, catalyzing the initial steps in the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. In this study, we show that inactivating the <i>ribBA</i> gene does not cause riboflavin auxotrophy under free-living conditions and that, as shown for RibBAs from other bacteria, the GTP cyclohydrolase II domain has no enzymatic activity. For this reason, we have renamed the annotated <i>ribBA</i> as <i>ribBX</i>. Because we were unable to identify other <i>ribBA</i> or <i>ribA</i> and <i>ribB</i> homologs in the genome of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> ORS285, we hypothesize that the ORS285 strain can use unconventional enzymes or an alternative pathway for the initial steps of riboflavin biosynthesis. Inactivating <i>ribBX</i> has a drastic impact on the interaction of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> ORS285 with many of the tested <i>Aeschynomene</i> spp. In these <i>Aeschynomene</i> spp., the ORS285 <i>ribBX</i> mutant is able to infect the plant host cells but the intracellular infection is not maintained and the nodules senesce early. This phenotype can be complemented by reintroduction of the 3,4-DHBP synthase domain alone. Our results indicate that, in <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> ORS285, the RibBX protein is not essential for riboflavin biosynthesis under free-living conditions and we hypothesize that its activity is needed to sustain riboflavin biosynthesis under certain symbiotic conditions.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
