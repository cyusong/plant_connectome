['32152179', 'The circadian clock provides a time-keeping mechanism that synchronizes various  biological activities with the surrounding environment. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), encoding a MYB-related  transcription factor, is a key component of the core oscillator of the circadian  clock, with peak expression in the morning. The molecular mechanisms regulating  the light induction and rhythmic expression of CCA1 remain elusive. In this  study, we show that two phytochrome signaling proteins, FAR-RED ELONGATED  HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and its paralog FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1), are  essential for the light-induced expression of CCA1 FHY3 and FAR1 directly bind to  the CCA1 promoter and activate its expression, whereas PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING  FACTOR5 (PIF5) directly binds to its promoter and represses its expression.  Furthermore, PIF5 and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 physically interact with FHY3 and  FAR1 to repress their transcriptional activation activity on CCA1 expression.  These findings demonstrate that the photosensory-signaling pathway integrates  with circadian oscillators to orchestrate clock gene expression. This mechanism  might form the molecular basis of the regulation of the clock system by light in  response to daily changes in the light environment, thus increasing plant  fitness.', '2020 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00981', 'ORCID:']
