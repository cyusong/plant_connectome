['19074258', 'DNA photolyases and cryptochromes (cry) form a family of flavoproteins that use  light energy in the blue/UV-A region for the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions or  for signaling, respectively. Very recently, it was shown that members of the DASH  cryptochrome subclade repair specifically cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in  UV-damaged single-stranded DNA. Here, we report the crystal structure of  Arabidopsis cryptochrome 3 with an in-situ-repaired CPD substrate in  single-stranded DNA. The structure shows a binding mode similar to that of  conventional DNA photolyases. Furthermore, CPD lesions in double-stranded DNA are  bound and repaired with similar efficiency as in single-stranded DNA if the CPD  lesion is present in a loop structure. Together, these data reveal that DASH  cryptochromes catalyze light-driven DNA repair like conventional photolyases but  lack an efficient flipping mechanism for interaction with CPD lesions within  duplex DNA.', '2008 Dec 30', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0805830106', 'Essen']
