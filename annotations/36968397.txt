Acclimation of photosynthesis to light intensity (photoacclimation) takes days to achieve and so naturally fluctuating light presents a potential challenge where leaves may be exposed to light conditions that are beyond their window of acclimation. Experiments generally have focused on unchanging light with a relatively fixed combination of photosynthetic attributes to confer higher efficiency in those conditions. Here a controlled LED experiment and mathematical modelling was used to assess the acclimation potential of contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes following transfer to a controlled fluctuating light environment, designed to present frequencies and amplitudes more relevant to natural conditions. We hypothesize that acclimation of light harvesting, photosynthetic capacity and dark respiration are controlled independently. Two different ecotypes were selected, Wassilewskija-4 (Ws), Landsberg erecta (Ler) and a GPT2 knock out mutant on the Ws background (gpt2-), based on their differing abilities to undergo dynamic acclimation i.e. at the sub-cellular or chloroplastic scale. Results from gas exchange and chlorophyll content indicate that plants can independently regulate different components that could optimize photosynthesis in both high and low light; targeting light harvesting in low light and photosynthetic capacity in high light. Empirical modelling indicates that the pattern of 'entrainment' of photosynthetic capacity by past light history is genotype-specific. These data show flexibility of photoacclimation and variation useful for plant improvement.
