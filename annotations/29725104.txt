The plant hormone gibberellin plays key roles in almost all aspects of plant development, but its detailed function and underlying regulatory mechanism in embryo development are not yet clearly defined. Here, we illustrate an essential role of gibberellin in late embryogenesis of Arabidopsis. Bioactive gibberellins are highly biosynthesized during the late developmental stage of embryos. At that time, deficiency in gibberellin biosynthesis or signalling results in an abnormal embryo phenotype characterized by less-developed cotyledons and shortened embryo axis. In contrast, gibberellin overdose leads to a significantly larger size of mature embryo. We reveal that the gibberellin signalling repressor DELLA interact with LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), the key regulator in late embryogenesis. Gibberellin triggers the degradation of DELLAs to relieve their repression of LEC1, thus promoting auxin accumulation to facilitate embryo development. Therefore, we uncover a space/time-specific role of gibberellin in regulating late embryogenesis through the gibberellin-DELLA-LEC1 signalling cascade, providing a novel mechanistic understanding of how phytohormones regulate embryogenesis.
