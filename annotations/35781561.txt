Preferential expression of OsPLC1 is detected at the heading stage of rice, OsPLC1 overexpression results in early flowering, increased-grain size and yield; however, opposing phenotypes produced in the osplc1 mutants. Abstract: The importance of phospholipase C (PLC) in plant development has been demonstrated in several studies. OsPLC1, a member of PI-PLC in rice, although its role in the response to salt stress of rice seedlings has been reported, its functions in the growth and development of rice is elusive. Here, we report that OsPLC1 expression could be detectable in various tissues throughout the developmental stages of rice, and the highest expression level of OsPLC1 was detected at the heading stage. OsPLC1 overexpression (OE) produced rice plants with early flowering, whereas OsPLC1 loss-of-function led to delay in flowering. The expression levels of subset genes, which are involved in the control of flowering time in rice, were altered in the plants of OE and osplc1. In addition, the enlargement of grain size was observed in OE plants, however, the reduction of grain size was noticed in osplc1 mutants. The increase in the grain size and the grain yield of OE lines were associated with the improvement of cell length and expression levels of a set of genes related to cell expansion, contrarily, the decrease in osplc1 mutant grain size and yield were linked to declined cell length and expression levels of related genes. No significant differences, in terms of the grain quality of mature seeds, were found in OE and osplc1 mutants, with compared to those in Nipponbare (Nip). In summary, our study suggests that OsPLC1 could modulate rice flowering time and grain size.
