['25757472', 'Organ growth involves the coordination of cell proliferation and cell growth with  differentiation. Endoreduplication is correlated with the onset of cell  differentiation and with cell and organ size, but little is known about the  molecular mechanisms linking cell and organ growth with endoreduplication. We  have previously demonstrated that the ubiquitin receptor DA1 influences organ  growth by restricting cell proliferation. Here, we show that DA1 and its close  family members DAR1 and DAR2 are redundantly required for endoreduplication  during leaf development. DA1, DAR1, and DAR2 physically interact with the  transcription factors TCP14 and TCP15, which repress endoreduplication by  directly regulating the expression of cell-cycle genes. We also show that DA1,  DAR1, and DAR2 modulate the stability of TCP14 and TCP15 proteins in Arabidopsis  thaliana. Genetic analyses demonstrate that DA1, DAR1, and DAR2 function in a  common pathway with TCP14/15 to regulate endoreduplication. Thus, our findings  define an important genetic and molecular mechanism involving the ubiquitin  receptors DA1, DAR1, and DAR2 and the transcription factors TCP14 and TCP15 that  links endoreduplication with cell and organ growth.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.132274', 'ORCID:']
