During plant development, a precise balance of cytokinin is crucial for correct growth and patterning, but it remains unclear how this is achieved across different cell types and in the context of a growing organ. Here we show that in the root apical meristem, the TMO5/LHW complex increases active cytokinin levels via two cooperatively acting enzymes. By profiling the transcriptomic changes of increased cytokinin at single-cell level, we further show that this effect is counteracted by a tissue-specific increase in CYTOKININ OXIDASE 3 expression via direct activation of the mobile transcription factor SHORTROOT. In summary, we show that within the root meristem, xylem cells act as a local organizer of vascular development by non-autonomously regulating cytokinin levels in neighbouring procambium cells via sequential induction and repression modules.

TMO5/LHW: !increases! active cytokinin levels
CYTOKININ OXIDASE 3: !increased by! SHORTROOT
SHORTROOT: !activates! CYTOKININ OXIDASE 3
xylem cells: !regulate! cytokinin levels in procambium cells
