['10220464', 'Mutation of the PRL1 gene, encoding a regulatory WD protein, results in glucose  hypersensitivity and derepression of glucose-regulated genes in Arabidopsis. The  yeast SNF1 protein kinase, a key regulator of glucose signaling, and Arabidopsis  SNF1 homologs AKIN10 and AKIN11, which can complement the Deltasnf1 mutation,  were found to interact with an N-terminal domain of the PRL1 protein in the  two-hybrid system and in vitro. AKIN10 and AKIN11 suppress the yeast Deltasnf4  mutation and interact with the SNF4p-activating subunit of SNF1. PRL1 and SNF4  bind independently to adjacent C-terminal domains of AKIN10 and AKIN11, and these  protein interactions are negatively regulated by glucose in yeast. AKIN10 and  AKIN11, purified in fusion with glutathione S-transferase, undergo  autophosphorylation and phosphorylate a peptide of sucrose phosphate synthase in  vitro. The sucrose phosphate synthase-peptide kinase activity of AKIN complexes  detected by immunoprecipitation is stimulated by sucrose in light-grown  Arabidopsis plants. In comparison with wild type, the activation level of AKIN  immunocomplexes is higher in the prl1 mutant, suggesting that PRL1 is a negative  regulator of Arabidopsis SNF1 homologs. This conclusion is supported by the  observation that PRL1 is an inhibitor of AKIN10 and AKIN11 in vitro.', '1999 Apr 27', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.96.9.5322', 'Koncz']
