['16387834', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast protein ACCELERATED CELL DEATH2 (ACD2)  modulates the amount of programmed cell death (PCD) triggered by Pseudomonas  syringae and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) treatment. In vitro, ACD2 can reduce red  chlorophyll catabolite, a chlorophyll derivative. We find that ACD2 shields root  protoplasts that lack chlorophyll from light- and PPIX-induced PCD. Thus,  chlorophyll catabolism is not obligatory for ACD2 anti-PCD function. Upon P.  syringae infection, ACD2 levels and localization change in cells undergoing PCD  and in their close neighbors. Thus, ACD2 shifts from being largely in  chloroplasts to partitioning to chloroplasts, mitochondria, and, to a small  extent, cytosol. ACD2 protects cells from PCD that requires the early  mitochondrial oxidative burst. Later, the chloroplasts of dying cells generate  NO, which only slightly affects cell viability. Finally, the mitochondria in  dying cells have dramatically altered movements and cellular distribution.  Overproduction of both ACD2 (localized to mitochondria and chloroplasts) and  ascorbate peroxidase (localized to chloroplasts) greatly reduces P.  syringae-induced PCD, suggesting a pro-PCD role for mitochondrial and chloroplast  events. During infection, ACD2 may bind to and/or reduce PCD-inducing  porphyrin-related molecules in mitochondria and possibly chloroplasts that  generate reactive oxygen species, cause altered organelle behavior, and activate  a cascade of PCD-inducing events.', '2006 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.036251', 'Greenberg']
