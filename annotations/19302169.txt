['19302169', 'Plant temperature-induced lipocalins (TILs) have been shown to be responsive to  heat stress (HS), but the nature of this response was unknown. In this study, a  reverse genetic approach was taken to elucidate the role of Arabidopsis TIL1  (At5g58070) in thermotolerance. A T-DNA knock-out line of TIL1 (til1-1) showed  severe defects in basal (BT) and acquired thermotolerance (AT), which could be  complemented by introducing the wild-type gene. However, over-expression of TIL1  did not significantly enhance thermotolerance in transgenic plants. TIL1 is  peripherally associated with plasma membrane. Transcriptomic analysis showed that  the heat shock response in til1-1 seedlings was about the same as in the  wild-type plants except the expression of TIL1. The level of TIL1 did not affect  the temperature threshold for heat shock protein induction. Ion leakage analysis  revealed no significant difference in membrane stability between the wild-type  and til1-1 seedlings. These results suggest that TIL1 is not involved in  regulating membrane fluidity or stability. Nevertheless, the mutant plants were  also more sensitive than the wild type to tert-butyl hydroperoxide, a reagent  that induces lipid peroxidation. Taken together, these data indicate that TIL1 is  an essential component for thermotolerance and probably functions by acting  against lipid peroxidation induced by severe HS.', '2009 Jul', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01972.x', 'Charng']
