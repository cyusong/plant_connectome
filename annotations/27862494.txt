Plants have mechanisms to recognize and reject pollen from other species. Although widespread, these mechanisms are less well understood than the self-incompatibility (SI) mechanisms plants use to reject pollen from close relatives. Previous studies have shown that some interspecific reproductive barriers (IRBs) are related to SI in the Solanaceae. For example, the pistil SI proteins S-RNase and HT protein function in a pistil-side IRB that causes rejection of pollen from self-compatible (SC) red/orange-fruited species in the tomato clade. However, S-RNase-independent IRBs also clearly contribute to rejecting pollen from these species. We investigated S-RNase-independent rejection of Solanum lycopersicum pollen by SC Solanum pennellii LA0716, SC. Solanum habrochaites LA0407, and SC Solanum arcanum LA2157, which lack functional S-RNase expression. We found that all three accessions express HT proteins, which previously had been known to function only in conjunction with S-RNase, and then used RNAi to test whether they also function in S-RNase-independent pollen rejection. Suppressing HT expression in SC S. pennellii LA0716 allows S. lycopersicum pollen tubes to penetrate farther into the pistil in HT suppressed plants, but not to reach the ovary. In contrast, suppressing HT expression in SC. Solanum habrochaites LA0407 and in SC S. arcanum LA2157 allows S. lycopersicum pollen tubes to penetrate to the ovary and produce hybrids that, otherwise, would be difficult to obtain. Thus, HT proteins are implicated in both S-RNase-dependent and S-RNase-independent pollen rejection. The results support the view that overall compatibility results from multiple pollen-pistil interactions with additive effects.
