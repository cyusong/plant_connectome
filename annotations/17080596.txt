Sugars are essential to plant growth and metabolism, both as energy source and as structural components. Sugar production and use are in part controlled at the level of gene expression by the sugars themselves. Responses to sugar are closely integrated with response pathways that indicate environmental conditions such as light and water availability. High sugar levels inhibit seedling development, repress photosynthetic gene expression and induce genes of storage metabolism such as those of starch biosynthesis. Genetic approaches have demonstrated the importance of abscisic acid (ABA) and the transcriptional regulator ABA-insensitive4 (ABI4) in sugar response pathways. Recent analysis of both photosynthetic and starch biosynthetic gene promoters suggest a direct role for ABI4 in their control. The increased understanding of the regulatory promoter elements controlling gene expression, in response to sugar and ABA, allows transcriptional networks to be understood at a molecular level.
