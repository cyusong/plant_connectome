Sulfate transporters are integral membrane proteins controlling the flux of sulfate (SO42-) entering the cells and subcellular compartments across the membrane lipid bilayers. Sulfate uptake is a dynamic biological process that occurs in multiple cell layers and organs in plants. In vascular plants, sulfate ions are taken up from the soil environment to the outermost cell layers of roots and horizontally transferred to the vascular tissues for further distribution to distant organs. The amount of sulfate ions being metabolized in the cytosol and chloroplast/plastid or temporarily stored in the vacuole depends on expression levels and functionalities of sulfate transporters bound specifically to the plasma membrane, chloroplast/plastid envelopes, and tonoplast membrane. The entire system for sulfate homeostasis, therefore, requires different types of sulfate transporters to be expressed and coordinately regulated in specific organs, cell types, and subcellular compartments. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms control the expression levels and functions of sulfate transporters to optimize sulfate uptake and internal distribution in response to sulfate availability and demands for synthesis of organic sulfur metabolites. This review article provides an overview of sulfate transport systems and discusses their regulatory aspects investigated in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.
