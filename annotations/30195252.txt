Plants can use induced volatiles to detect herbivore- and pathogen-attacked neighbors and prime their defenses. Several individual volatile priming cues have been identified, but whether plants are able to integrate multiple cues from stress-related volatile blends remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how maize plants respond to two herbivore-induced volatile priming cues with complementary information content, the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (HAC) and the aromatic volatile indole. In the absence of herbivory, HAC directly induced defence gene expression, whereas indole had no effect. Upon induction by simulated herbivory, both volatiles increased jasmonate signalling, defence gene expression, and defensive secondary metabolite production and increased plant resistance. Plant resistance to caterpillars was more strongly induced in dual volatile-exposed plants than plants exposed to single volatiles.. Induced defence levels in dual volatile-exposed plants were significantly higher than predicted from the added effects of the individual volatiles, with the exception of induced plant volatile production, which showed no increase upon dual-exposure relative to single exposure. Thus, plants can integrate different volatile cues into strong and specific responses that promote herbivore defence induction and resistance. Integrating multiple volatiles may be beneficial, as volatile blends are more reliable indicators of future stress than single cues.

HAC: !induces! defence gene expression
Indole: !has no effect! in absence of herbivory
HAC/Indole: !increase! jasmonate signalling
HAC/Indole: !increase! defence gene expression
HAC/Indole: !increase! defensive secondary metabolite production
HAC/Indole: !increase! plant resistance
HAC/Indole: !induce! stronger defence than single volatiles
