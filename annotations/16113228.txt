['16113228', 'We identified the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) tanmei/emb2757 (tan)  mutation that causes defects in both embryo and seedling development. tan mutant  embryos share many characteristics with the leafy cotyledon (lec) class of  mutants in that they accumulate anthocyanin, are intolerant of desiccation, form  trichomes on cotyledons, and have reduced accumulation of storage proteins and  lipids. Thus, TAN functions both in the early and late phases of embryo  development. Moreover, the TAN and LEC genes interact synergistically, suggesting  that they do not act in series in the same genetic pathway but, rather, that they  have overlapping roles during embryogenesis. tan mutants die as embryos, but  immature mutant seeds can be germinated in culture. However, tan mutant seedlings  are defective in shoot and root development, their hypocotyls fail to elongate in  the dark, and they die as seedlings. We isolated the TAN gene and showed that the  predicted polypeptide has seven WD repeat motifs, suggesting that TAN forms  complexes with other proteins. Together, these results suggest that TAN interacts  with other proteins to control many aspects of embryo development.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.060467', 'Harada']
