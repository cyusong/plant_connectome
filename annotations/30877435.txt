Inoculation of endophytic Methylobacterium oryzae CBMB20 in salt-stressed rice plants improves photosynthesis and reduces stress volatile emissions due to mellowing of ethylene-dependent responses and activating vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase-producing Methylobacterium oryzae CBMB20 in acclimation of plant to salt stress by controlling photosynthetic characteristics and volatile emission in salt-sensitive (IR29) and moderately salt-resistant (FL478) rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Saline levels of 50 mM and 100 mM NaCl with and without bacteria inoculation were applied, and the temporal changes in stress response and salinity resistance were assessed by monitoring photosynthetic characteristics, ACC accumulation, ACC oxidase activity (ACO), vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity, and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Salt stress considerably reduced photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, PSII efficiency and vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity, but it increased ACC accumulation, ACO activity, green leaf volatiles, mono- and sesquiterpenes, and other stress volatiles. These responses were enhanced with increasing salt stress and time. However, rice cultivars treated with CBMB20 showed improved plant vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity, photosynthetic characteristics and decreased ACC accumulation, ACO activity and VOC emission. The bacteria-dependent changes were greater in the IR29 cultivar. These results indicate that decreasing photosynthesis and vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity rates and increasing VOC emission rates in response to high-salinity stress were effectively mitigated by M. oryzae CBMB20 inoculation.
