['7727751', 'A multiple gene family of at least four members, related to a GA-stimulated  transcript (GAST1) from tomato, was characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana by  analysing four related cDNAs, named GASA1 to GASA4. The corresponding peptides  display comparable structural features: (1) a putative signal peptide of 18 to 23  residues; (2) a highly divergent hydrophilic region of about 22 amino acids; (3)  a conservative 60 amino acid C-terminal domain containing 12 cysteines. This  organization has also bean shown in two related peptides from tomato, GAST1 found  in shoots and RSI-1 found in early lateral roots. Southern blot hybridization  patterns showed single-copy genes for all four members of the GASA family.  Accumulation of the various transcripts, monitored by northern blot  hybridization, indicated that the various genes are expressed differentially in  plant organs: Specific mRNAs were mostly detected in flower buds and immature  siliques in the case of GASA1, in siliques and dry seeds in the case of GASA2 and  3, and in growing roots and flower buds in the case of GASA4. At least two of the  GASA genes are activated in GA-deficient mutant ga5, as early as 4 to 8 h after  spraying with 50 microM GA3. The complex patterns of expression and regulation of  the various genes suggest that the related peptides are involved in a  developmental regulation process in Arabidopsis.', '1995 Feb', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00020227', 'Grellet']
