['32984814', 'A complex network of cellular receptors, RNA targeting pathways, and  small-molecule signaling provides robust plant immunity and tolerance to viruses.  To maximize their fitness, viruses must evolve control mechanisms to balance host  immune evasion and plant-damaging effects. The genus Potyvirus comprises plant  viruses characterized by RNA genomes that encode large polyproteins led by the P1  protease. A P1 autoinhibitory domain controls polyprotein processing, the release  of a downstream functional RNA-silencing suppressor, and viral replication. Here,  we show that P1Pro, a plum pox virus clone that lacks the P1 autoinhibitory  domain, triggers complex reprogramming of the host transcriptome and high levels  of abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation. A meta-analysis highlighted ABA connections  with host pathways known to control RNA stability, turnover, maturation, and  translation. Transcriptomic changes triggered by P1Pro infection or ABA showed  similarities in host RNA abundance and diversity. Genetic and hormone treatment  assays showed that ABA promotes plant resistance to potyviral infection. Finally,  quantitative mathematical modeling of viral replication in the presence of  defense pathways supported self-control of polyprotein processing kinetics as a  viral mechanism that attenuates the magnitude of the host antiviral response.  Overall, our findings indicate that ABA is an active player in plant antiviral  immunity, which is nonetheless evaded by a self-controlled RNA virus.', '2020 Sep 14', 'Plant Commun', '10.1016/j.xplc.2020.100099', 'Garcia']
