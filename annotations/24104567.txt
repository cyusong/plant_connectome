['24104567', 'Plastids provide plants with metabolic pathways that are unique among eukaryotes,  including the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway for the production of  isoprenoids essential for photosynthesis and plant growth. Here, we show that the  first enzyme of the pathway, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), interacts  with the J-protein J20 in Arabidopsis thaliana. J-proteins typically act as  adaptors that provide substrate specificity to heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a  molecular chaperone. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that J20 and DXS are  found together in vivo and confirmed the presence of Hsp70 chaperones in DXS  complexes. Mutants defective in J20 activity accumulated significantly increased  levels of DXS protein (but no transcripts) and displayed reduced levels of DXS  enzyme activity, indicating that loss of J20 function causes posttranscriptional  accumulation of DXS in an inactive form. Furthermore, J20 promotes degradation of  DXS following a heat shock. Together, our data indicate that J20 might identify  unfolded or misfolded (damaged) forms of DXS and target them to the Hsp70 system  for proper folding under normal conditions or degradation upon stress.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.113001', 'Rodriguez-Concepcion']
