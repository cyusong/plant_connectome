The <i>CONSTANS-LIKE (COL)</i> genes are important signaling component in the photoperiod pathway and flowering regulation pathway. However, people still know little about their role in <i>Brassica napus</i>. To achieve a better understanding of the members of the <i>BnaCOL</i> gene family, reveal their evolutionary relationship and related functions involved in photoperiod regulation, we systematically analyzed the <i>BnaCOL</i> family members in <i>B. napus</i> genome. A total of 33 <i>BnaCOL</i> genes distributed unevenly on 16 chromosomes were identified in <i>B. napus</i> and could be classified into three subfamilies. The same subfamilies have relatively conservative gene structures, three-dimensional protein structures and promoter motifs such as light-responsive <i>cis</i>-elements. The collinearity analysis detected 37 pairs of repetitive genes in <i>B. napus</i> genome. A 67.7% of the <i>BnaCOL</i> genes were lost after <i>B. napus</i> genome polyploidization. In addition, the <i>BnaCOL</i> genes showed different tissue-specific expression patterns. A 81.8% of the <i>BnaCOL</i> genes were mainly expressed in leaves, indicating that they may play a conservative role in leaves. Subsequently, we tested the circadian expression profiles of nine homologous genes that regulate flowering in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Most <i>BnaCOL</i> genes exhibit several types of circadian rhythms, indicating that these <i>BnaCOL</i> genes are involved in the photoperiod pathway. As such, our research has laid the foundation for understanding the exact role of the <i>BnaCOL</i> family in the growth and development of rapeseed, especially in flowering.
