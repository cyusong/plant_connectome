The common name witchweed synonymous with the Latin name <i>Striga</i> befits the bewitching effects, <i>viz</i> wilting and chlorosis, the parasite inflicts on its hosts long before it emerges and becomes visible above the ground. However, interactions in the rhizosphere between host roots and <i>Striga</i> seedlings are concealed and inscrutable. In vitro experiments revealed that abscisic acid was produced by <i>S. hermonthica</i> seedlings and a considerable portion of the phytohormone was exuded. The phytohormone in the rhizosphere could, at least in part, contribute to the bewitching effects, disrupt host immunity and promote commencement of parasitism.
