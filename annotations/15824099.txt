Benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (BOA) is an allelochemical most commonly associated with monocot species, formed from the O-glucoside of 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one by a two-step degradation process. The capacity of Arabidopsis to detoxify exogenously supplied BOA was analyzed by quantification of the major known metabolites BOA-6-OH, BOA-6-O-glucoside, and glucoside carbamate, revealing that detoxification occurs predominantly through O-glucosylation of the intermediate BOA-6-OH, most likely requiring the sequential action of as-yet-unidentified cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucosyltransferase activities. Transcriptional profiling experiments were also performed with Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to BOA concentrations, representing I(50) and I(80) levels based on root elongation inhibition assays. One of the largest functional categories observed for BOA-responsive genes corresponded to protein families known to participate in cell rescue and defense, with the majority of these genes potentially associated with chemical detoxification pathways. Further experiments using a subset of these genes revealed that many are also transcriptionally induced by a variety of structurally diverse xenobiotic compounds, suggesting they comprise components of a coordinately regulated, broad specificity xenobiotic defense response. The data significantly expand upon previous studies examining plant transcriptional responses to allelochemicals and other environmental toxins and provide novel insights into xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms in plants.
