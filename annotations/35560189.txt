Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) constitute a well-conserved family of proteins in eukaryotes that are important in stress responses and development. Past studies have shown that ACBPs are involved in maintaining, transporting and protecting acyl-CoA esters during lipid biosynthesis in plants, mammals, and yeast. ACBPs show differential expression and various binding affinities for acyl-CoA esters. Hence, ACBPs can play a crucial part in maintaining lipid homeostasis. This review summarizes the functions of ACBPs during the stages of reproduction in plants and other organisms. A comprehensive understanding on the roles of ACBPs during plant reproduction may lead to opportunities in crop improvement in agriculture.
