Legumes such as soybean are considered important crops as they provide proteins and oils for humans and livestock around the world. Different from other crops, leguminous crops accumulate nitrogen (N) for plant growth through symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in coordination with rhizobia. A number of studies have shown that efficient SNF requires the cooperation of other nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), a nutrient deficient in most soils. During the last decades, great progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between SNF and P nutrition, specifically through the identification of transporters involved in P transport to nodules and bacteroids, signal transduction, and regulation of P homeostasis in nodules. These studies revealed a distinct N-P interaction in leguminous crops, which is characterized by specific signaling cross talk between P and SNF. This review aimed to present an updated picture of the cross talk between N fixation and P nutrition in legumes, focusing on soybean as a model crop, and Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus as model plants. We also discuss the possibilities for enhancing SNF through improving P nutrition, which are important for high and sustainable production of leguminous crops.
