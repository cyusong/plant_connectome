Leaves with high photosynthetic capacity require high transpiration capacity. Consequently, hydraulic conductance, stomatal conductance, and assimilation capacities should be positively correlated. These traits make independent demands on anatomical space, particularly due to the propensity for veins to have bundle sheath extensions that exclude stomata from the local epidermis. We measured density and area occupation of bundle sheath extensions, density and size of stomata and subsidiary cells, and venation density for a sample of extant angiosperms and fossil and living nonangiosperm tracheophytes. For most nonangiosperms, even modest increases in vein density and stomatal conductance would require substantial reconfigurations of anatomy. One characteristic of the angiosperm syndrome (e.g. small cell sizes, etc.) is hierarchical vein networks that allow expression of bundle sheath extensions in some, but not all veins, contrasting with all-or-nothing alternatives available with the single-order vein networks in most nonangiosperms. Bundle sheath modulation is associated with higher vein densities in three independent groups with hierarchical venation: angiosperms, Gnetum (gymnosperm) and Dipteris (fern). Anatomical and developmental constraints likely contribute to the stability in leaf characteristics - and ecophysiology - seen through time in different lineages and contribute to the uniqueness of angiosperms in achieving the highest vein densities, stomatal densities, and physiological rates.
