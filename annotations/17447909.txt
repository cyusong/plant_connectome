The pollen tube has been widely used to study the mechanisms underlying polarized tip growth in plants. A steep tip-to-base gradient of free cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) is essential for pollen-tube growth. Local Ca(2+) influx mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable channels plays a key role in maintaining this [Ca(2+)](cyt) gradient. Here, we developed a protocol for successful isolation of spheroplasts from pollen tubes of Pyrus pyrifolia and identified a hyperpolarization-activated cation channel using the patch-clamp technique. We showed that the cation channel conductance displayed a strong selectivity for divalent cations, with a relative permeability sequence of barium (Ba(2+)) approximately Ca(2+) > magnesium (Mg(2+)) > strontium (Sr(2+)) > manganese (Mn(2+)). This channel conductance was selective for Ca(2+) over chlorine (Cl(-)) (relative permeability P(Ca)/P(Cl) = 14 in 10 mm extracellular Ca(2+)). We also showed that the channel was inhibited by the Ca(2+) channel blockers lanthanum (La(3+)) and gadolinium (Gd(3+)). Furthermore, channel activity depended on extracellular pH and pollen viability. We propose that the Ca(2+)-permeable channel is likely to play a role in mediating Ca(2+) influx into the growing pollen tubes to maintain the [Ca(2+)](cyt) gradient.
