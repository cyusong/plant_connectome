Plant cuticles are composed of hydrophobic cuticular waxes and cutin. Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are components of epidermal waxes and the plasma membrane and are involved in organ morphogenesis. By screening a barrelclover (Medicago truncatula) mutant population tagged by the transposable element of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cell type1 (Tnt1), we identified two types of mutants with unopened flower phenotypes, named unopened flower1 (uof1) and uof2. Both UOF1 and UOF2 encode enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of VLCFAs and cuticular wax. Comparative analysis of the mutants indicated that the mutation in UOF1, but not UOF2, leads to the increased number of leaflets in M. truncatula. UOF1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer (L1) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and leaf primordia. The uof1 mutants displayed defects in VLCFA-mediated plasma membrane integrity, resulting in the disordered localization of the PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) ortholog SMOOTH LEAF MARGIN1 (SLM1) in M. truncatula. Our work demonstrates that the UOF1-mediated biosynthesis of VLCFAs in L1 is critical for compound leaf patterning, which is associated with the polarization of the auxin efflux carrier in M. truncatula.
