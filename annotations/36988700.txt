Transcript isoform dynamics, spatiotemporal expression, and mutational analysis uncover that Arabidopsis RabC1 GTPase is required for root length, flowering time, seed size, and seed mucilage. Rab GTPases are crucial regulators for moving different molecules to their specific compartments according to the needs of the cell. In this work, we illustrate the role of RabC1 GTPase in Arabidopsis growth and seed development. We identify and analyze the expression pattern of three transcript isoforms of RabC1 in different development stages, along with their tissue-specific transcript abundance. The promoter activity of RabC1 using promoter-GUS fusion shows that it is widely expressed during the growth of Arabidopsis, particularly in seed tissues such as chalazal seed coat and chalazal endosperm. Lack of RabC1 function led to shorter roots, lesser biomass, delayed flowering, and sluggish plant development. The mutants had smaller seeds than the wildtype, less seed mass, and lower seed coat permeability. Developing seeds also revealed a smaller endosperm cavity and shorter integument cells. Additionally, we found that the knock-out mutant had downregulated expression of genes implicated in the transit of sugars and amino acids from maternal tissue to developing seed. The seeds of the loss-of-function mutant had reduced seed mucilage. All the observed mutant phenotypes were restored in the complemented lines confirming the function of RabC1 in seed development and plant growth.
