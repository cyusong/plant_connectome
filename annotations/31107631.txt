The potato common scab pathogen <i>Streptomyces scabies</i> produces <i>N-</i>coronafacoyl-l-isoleucine (CFA-Ile), which is a member of the coronafacoyl family of phytotoxins that are synthesized by multiple plant pathogenic bacteria. The CFA-Ile biosynthetic gene cluster contains a regulatory gene, <i>cfaR</i>, which directly controls the expression of the phytotoxin structural genes. In addition, a gene designated <i>orf1</i> encodes a predicted ThiF family protein and is cotranscribed with <i>cfaR</i>, suggesting that it also plays a role in the regulation of CFA-Ile production. In this study, we demonstrated that CfaR is an essential activator of coronafacoyl phytotoxin production, while ORF1 is dispensable for phytotoxin production and may function as a helper protein for CfaR. We also showed that CFA-Ile inhibits the ability of CfaR to bind to the promoter region driving expression of the phytotoxin biosynthetic genes and that elevated CFA-Ile production by overexpression of both <i>cfaR</i> and <i>orf1</i> in <i>S. scabies</i> increases the severity of disease symptoms induced by the pathogen during colonization of potato tuber tissue. Overall, our study reveals novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms controlling CFA-Ile production in <i>S. scabies</i> and it provides further evidence that CFA-Ile is an important virulence factor for this organism.
