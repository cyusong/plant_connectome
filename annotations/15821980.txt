The formation and the development of the floral organs require an intercalate expression of organ-specific genes. At the same time, meristem-specific genes are repressed to complete the differentiation of the organs in the floral whorls. In an Arabidopsis activation tagging population, a mutant affected in inflorescence architecture was identified. This gain-of-function mutant, designated downwards siliques1 (dsl1-D), has shorter internodes and the lateral organs such as flowers are bending downwards, similar to the loss-of-function brevipedicellus (bp) mutant. The affected gene in dsl1-D appeared to be ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE1 (ASL1)/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES domain gene 36 (LBD36), which is a member of the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2)/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) domain gene family. Analysis of the loss-of-function mutant asl1/lbd36 did not show morphological aberration. Double mutant analysis of asl1/lbd36 together with as2, the ASL1/LBD36 closest homologue, demonstrates that these two members of the AS2/LOB family act partially redundant to control cell fate determination in Arabidopsis petals. Moreover, molecular analysis revealed that overexpression of ASL1/LBD36 leads to repression of the homeobox gene BP, which supports the model that an antagonistic relationship between ASL/LBD and homeobox members is required for the differentiation of lateral organs.
