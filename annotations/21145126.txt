Artificial aphid infestation experiments on the three chrysanthemum cultivars 'Keiun', 'Han6' and 'Jinba' showed that the three cultivars vary markedly in their resistance. Of the three cultivars, the most resistant ('Keiun') produced the longest, highest and densest trichomes, the largest and fullest gland cells, and the most wax on the lower leaf epidermis. Superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), ascorbate peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.11), polyphenol oxidase activity (EC 1.14.18.1) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.5) were enhanced by aphid herbivory. In the two more resistant cultivars ('Keiun' and 'Han6'), the activity of superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase enzymes rapidly increased following infestation, and their levels remained high from seventy-two to one hundred and sixty-eight hours after inoculation. We suggest that these two antioxidant enzymes contribute to aphid resistance of these chrysanthemum cultivars. All three cultivars showed quick responses to aphid infestation by increasing polyphenol oxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activities during the early period after inoculation. Activities of these two defense enzymes were higher in the two resistant cultivars after 72h after inoculation, suggesting involvement of these two enzymes in aphid resistance.
