Crenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forsk.) is a devastating parasitic weed threatening the cultivation of legumes around the Mediterranean and in the Middle East. So far, only moderate levels of resistance were reported to occur in pea (Pisum sativum L.) natural germplasm, and most commercial cultivars are prone to severe infestation. Here, we describe the selection of a pea line highly resistant to O. crenata, following the screening of local genetic resources. Time series observations show that delayed emergence of the parasite is an important parameter associated with broomrape resistance. High performance liquid chromatography connected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis and in vitro broomrape germination bioassays suggest that the resistance mechanism might involve the reduced secretion of strigolactones, plant hormones exuded by roots and acting as signaling molecules for the germination of parasitic weeds. Two years of replicated trials in noninfested fields indicate that the resistance is devoid of pleiotropic effects on yield, in contrast to pea experimental mutants impaired in strigolactone biosynthesis and, thus, is suitable for use in breeding programs.
