The urgent requirement for improving the efficiency of agricultural plant protection operations has spurred considerable interest in multiple plant protection UAV systems. In this study, a performance-guaranteed distributed control scheme is developed in order to address the control of multiple plant protection UAV systems with collision avoidance and a directed topology. First, a novel concept called predetermined time performance function (PTPF) is proposed, such that the tracking error can converge to an arbitrary small preassigned region in finite time. Second, combined with the two-order filter for each UAV, the information estimation from the leader is generated. The distributed protocol avoids the use of an asymmetric Laplace matrix of a directed graph and solves the difficulty of control design. Furthermore, by introducing with a collision prediction mechanism, a repulsive force field is constructed between the dynamic obstacle and the UAV, in order to avoid the collision. Finally, it is rigorously proved that the consensus of the multiple plant protection UAV system can be achieved while guaranteeing the predetermined time performance. A numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the presented method, such that the multiple UAVs system can fulfill time-constrained plant protection tasks.
