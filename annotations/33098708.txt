We recently achieved targeted disruptions of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)-associated genes in the mitochondrial genomes of rice and rapeseed by using mitochondria-targeted transcription activator-like effector nucleases (mitoTALENs). It was the first report of stable and heritable targeted gene modification of plant mitochondrial genomes. Here, we attempted to use mitoTALENs to disrupt two mitochondrial genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) using three different promoters and two types of TALENs. The targets were the two isoforms of the ATP synthase subunit 6 gene, atp6-1 and atp6-2. Each of these genes was successfully deleted and the mitochondrial genomes were recovered in a homoplasmic state. The nuclear genome also has a copy of atp6-1, and we were able to confirm that it was the mitochondrial gene and not the nuclear pseudogene that was knocked out. Among the three mitoTALEN promoters tried, the RPS5A promoter was the most effective. Conventional mitoTALENs were more effective than single-molecule mito-compactTALENs. Targeted mitochondrial gene deletion was achieved by crossing as well as by floral-dip transformation to introduce the mitoTALEN constructs into the nucleus. The gene disruptions were caused by large (kb-size) deletions. The ends of the remaining sequences were connected to distant loci, mostly by illegitimate homologous recombinations between repeats.

RPS5A promoter: !most effective for! mitoTALENs
conventional mitoTALENs: !more effective than! single-molecule mito-compactTALENs
crossing: !introduces! mitoTALEN constructs into nucleus
illegitimate homologous recombinations: !connect! distant loci
