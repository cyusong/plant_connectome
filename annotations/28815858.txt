['28815858', 'Protein phosphatases (PPs) counteract kinases in reversible phosphorylation  events during numerous signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes. PP2Cs, one of  the four major classes of the serine/threonine-specific PP family, are greatly  expanded in plants. Thus, PP2Cs are thought to play a specific role in signal  transduction pathways. Some rice PP2Cs classified in subgroup K are responsive to  infection by the compatible Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of  bacterial blight. In Arabidopsis thaliana, orthologous PP2C genes (AtPP2C62 and  AtPP2C26) classified to subgroup K are also responsive to Xanthomonas campestris  pv. campestris (Xcc, causal agent of black rot) infection. To elucidate the  function of these subgroup K PP2Cs, atpp2c62- and atpp2c26-deficient A. thaliana  mutants were characterized. A double mutant plant which was inoculated with a  compatible Xcc showed reduced lesion development, as well as the suppression of  bacterial multiplication. AtPP2C62 and AtPP2C26 localized to the chloroplast.  Furthermore, the photosynthesis-related protein, chaperonin-60, was indicated as  the potential candidate for the dephosphorylated substrate catalysed by AtPP2C62  and AtPP2C26 using two-dimensional isoelectric focusing sodium  dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-IDF-SDS-PAGE). Taken  together, AtPP2C62 and AtPP2C26 are suggested to be involved in both  photosynthesis and suppression of the plant immune system. These results imply  the occurrence of crosstalk between photosynthesis and the plant defence system  to control productivity under pathogen infection.', '2018 May', 'Mol Plant Pathol', '10.1111/mpp.12596', 'Ochiai']
