['14740211', 'The major class of glucosinolates in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. are  biosynthesized from methionine involving a three-step chain-elongation cycle.  Each passage through the cycle results in the net addition of a single methylene  group, with up to six cycles of elongation occurring in A. thaliana. The first  reaction of the cycle is catalyzed by a methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAMS),  which condenses a omega-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acid with acetyl-CoA. Here we  have demonstrated that MAM1, one of two similar genes in the A. thaliana ecotype  Columbia, encodes a MAMS catalyzing the condensing reactions of the first two  elongation cycles but not those of further cycles. The Columbia ecotype is  dominated by compounds that have undergone only two elongation cycles. The A.  thaliana MAM1 protein exhibits basic sequence similarity to other previously  described enzymes catalyzing the condensation of 2-oxo acids and acetyl-CoA, such  as isopropylmalate synthase (EC 2.3.3.13), an enzyme of leucine biosynthesis, and  homocitrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.14). It also shares similar properties with them,  including the catalytic requirements for a divalent metal ion and an adenine  nucleotide. However, the MAM1 protein does not show activity with the substrates  of any of these other enzymes, and was chromatographically separable from  isopropylmalate synthase in extracts of A. thaliana. Thus, MAM1 is exclusively an  enzyme of secondary metabolism, distinct from primary metabolic enzymes  catalyzing similar reactions.', '2004 Apr', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-003-1184-3', 'Gershenzon']
