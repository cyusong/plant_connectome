Potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants susceptible to late blight disease caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans display enhanced resistance upon infiltration with the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), Pep-13. Here, we characterize a potato gene similar to Arabidopsis 5-phosphatases which was identified in transcript arrays performed to identify Pep-13 regulated genes, and termed StIPP. Recombinant StIPP protein specifically dephosphorylated the D5-position of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> ) in vitro. Other phosphoinositides or soluble inositolpolyphosphates were not converted. When transiently expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes, a StIPP-YFP fusion localized to the subapical plasma membrane and antagonized PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -dependent effects on cell morphology, indicating in vivo functionality. Phytophthora infestans-infection of N. benthamiana leaf epidermis cells resulted in relocalization of StIPP-GFP from the plasma membrane to the extra-haustorial membrane (EHM). Colocalizion with the effector protein RFP-AvrBlb2 at infection sites is consistent with a role of StIPP in the plant-oomycete interaction. Correlation analysis of fluorescence distributions of StIPP-GFP and biosensors for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) indicate StIPP activity predominantly at the EHM. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, expression of StIPP resulted in the stabilization of the PAMP receptor, FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2, indicating that StIPP may act as a PAMP-induced and localized antagonist of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -dependent processes during plant immunity.
