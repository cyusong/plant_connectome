['12482606', 'Sulfurtransferases/rhodaneses (ST) are a group of enzymes widely distributed in  all three phyla that catalyze the transfer of sulfur from a donor to a thiophilic  acceptor substrate. All ST contain distinct structural domains, and can exist as  single-domain proteins, as tandemly repeated modules in which the C-terminal  domain bears the active site, or as members of multi-domain proteins. We  identified several ST in Arabidopsis resembling the C-terminus of the Arabidopsis  two-domain ST1 and the single-domain GlpE protein from Escherichia coli. Two of  them (accession numbers BAB10422 and BAB10409) were expressed in E. coli and  purified. Both proteins showed thiosulfate-specific ST enzyme activity.', '2002 Dec 18', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03723-7', 'Papenbrock']
