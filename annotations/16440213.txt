It is frequently observed that winter habit types are more low-temperature (LT) tolerant than spring habit types. This raises the question of whether this is due to pleiotropic effects of the vernalization loci or to the linkage of LT-tolerance genes to these vernalization loci. Reciprocal near-isogenic lines (NILs) for alleles at the Vrn-A1 locus, Vrn-A1 and vrn-A1, determining spring and winter habit respectively, in two diverse genetic backgrounds of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were used to separate the effects of vernalization, photoperiod, and development on identical, or near identical, genetic backgrounds. The vrn-A1 allele in the winter lines allowed full expression of genotype dependent LT tolerance potential. The winter allele (vrn-A1) in a very cold tolerant genetic background resulted in 11 degrees C, or a 2.4-fold, greater LT tolerance compared to the spring allele. Similarly, the delay in development caused by short-day (SD) versus long-day (LD) photoperiod in the identical spring habit NIL resulted in an 8.5 degrees C or 2.1-fold, increase in LT tolerance. The duration of time in early developmental stages was shown to underlie full expression of genetic LT-tolerance potential. Therefore, pleiotropic effects of the vernalization loci can explain the association of LT tolerance and winter habit irrespective of either the proposed closely linked Fr-A1 or the more distant Fr-A2 LT-tolerance QTLs. Plant development progressively reduced LT-acclimation ability, particularly after the main shoot meristem had advanced to the double ridge reproductive growth stage. The Vrn-1 genes, or other members of the flowering induction pathway, are discussed as possible candidates for involvement in LT-tolerance repression.
