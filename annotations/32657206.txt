To assess the role of genes involved in polyamines synthesis, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), copper amine oxidase activity (CuAO) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in regulation of stomatal aperture to drought stress in <i>Rosa canina</i> L., a study was performed at three irrigating levels (25%, 50%, and 100% field capacity) with three replications at 1, 3, 6 and 12 days. The results showed that putrescine (Put) accumulation occurred under both 50% and 25% FC at 1 d. Furthermore, the role of the Put direct biosynthesis pathway ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was more effective under 50% FC whereas in the 25% FC the Put indirect production pathway (agmatine iminohydrolase (AIH), N-carbamoyl putrescine amidohydrolase (CPA) and arginine decarboxylase (ADC)) was more effective. HPLC results showed that the accumulation of spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) is consistent with the expression of <i>S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase</i> (<i>SAMDC), spermidine synthase</i> (<i>SPDS</i>) and <i>spermine synthase</i> (<i>SPMS</i>) genes. Spd accumulation under both 50% and 25% FC occurred on the 3 d and then decreased in the other days. Spm content showed an increasing trend from 6 d under 50% FC and from 3 d under 25% FC. Our results suggest that among the measured polyamines, Put oxidation through CuAO activity increased resulted in an increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation also as a secondary messenger led to enhance in <i>NOS</i> gene expression. Increase in <i>NOS</i> gene expression can act as a signal resulting in stomatal closure.
