['7777559', 'Five different clones encoding thioredoxin homologues were isolated from  Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA libraries. On the basis of the sequences they encode  divergent proteins, but all belong to the cytoplasmic thioredoxins h previously  described in higher plants. The five proteins obtained by overexpressing the  coding sequences in Escherichia coli present typical thioredoxin activities  (NADP(+)-malate dehydrogenase activation and reduction by Arabidopsis thioredoxin  reductase) despite the presence of a variant active site, Trp-Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys, in  three proteins in place of the canonical Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys sequence described  for thioredoxins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Southern blots show that each  cDNA is encoded by a single gene but suggest the presence of additional related  sequences in the Arabidopsis genome. This very complex diversity of thioredoxins  h is probably common to all higher plants, since the Arabidopsis sequences appear  to have diverged very early, at the beginning of plant speciation. This diversity  allows the transduction of a redox signal into multiple pathways.', '1995 Jun 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.92.12.5620', 'Meyer']
