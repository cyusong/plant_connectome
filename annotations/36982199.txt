The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the effects of different stress factors on higher plants, with particular attention given to the typical and unique dose-dependent responses that are essential for plant growth and development. Specifically, this review highlights the impact of stress on genome instability, including DNA damage and the molecular, physiological, and biochemical mechanisms that generate these effects. We provide an overview of the current understanding of predictable and unique dose-dependent trends in plant survival when exposed to low or high doses of stress. Understanding both the negative and positive impacts of stress responses, including genome instability, can provide insights into how plants react to different levels of stress, yielding more accurate predictions of their behavior in the natural environment. Applying the acquired knowledge can lead to improved crop productivity and potential development of more resilient plant varieties, ensuring a sustainable food source for the rapidly growing global population.
