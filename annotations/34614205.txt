Conifers prevail in the canopies of many terrestrial biomes, holding a great ecological and economic importance globally. Current increases in temperature and aridity are imposing high transpirational demands and resulting in conifer mortality. Therefore, identifying leaf structural determinants of water use efficiency is essential for predicting physiological impacts due to environmental variation. Using synchrotron-generated microtomography imaging, we extracted leaf volumetric anatomy and stomatal traits in 34 species across conifers with a special focus on Pinus, the richest conifer genus. We show that intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub> ) is positively driven by leaf vein volume. Needle-like leaves of Pinus, as opposed to flat leaves or flattened needles of other genera, showed lower mesophyll porosity, decreasing the relative mesophyll volume. This led to increased ratios of stomatal pore number per mesophyll or intercellular airspace volume, which emerged as powerful explanatory variables, predicting both stomatal conductance and WUE<sub>i</sub> . Our results clarify how the three-dimensional organisation of tissues within the leaf has a direct impact on plant water use and carbon uptake. By identifying a suite of structural traits that influence important physiological functions, our findings can help to understand how conifers may respond to the pressures exerted by climate change.
