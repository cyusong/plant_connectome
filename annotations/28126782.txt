Norby et al center their critique on the design of the data set and the response variable used. We address these criticisms and reinforce the conclusion that plants that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi exhibit larger biomass and growth responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> compared with plants that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizae.

CO2: !enhances! Plant biomass and growth
Plants: !associate with! Ectomycorrhizal fungi
Plants: !associate with! Arbuscular mycorrhizae
