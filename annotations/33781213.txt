E2F/DP proteins have been shown to regulate genes implicated in cell cycle control and DNA repair. However, to date, research into the potential role of the Moso bamboo E2F/DP family has been limited. Here, we identified 23 E2F/DPs in the Moso bamboo genome, including nine E2F genes, six DP genes, eight DEL genes and one gene with a partial E2F domain. An estimation of the divergence time of the paralogous gene pairs suggested that the E2F/DP family expansion primarily occurred through a whole-genome duplication event. A regulatory element and coexpression network analysis indicated that E2F/DP regulated the expression of cell cycle-related genes. A yeast two-hybrid assay and expression analysis based on transcriptome data and in situ hybridization indicated that the PheE2F-PheDP complex played important roles in winter Moso bamboo shoot growth. The qRT-PCR results showed that the PheE2F/DPs exhibited diverse expression patterns in response to drought and salt treatment and diurnal cycles. Our findings provide novel insights into the Moso bamboo E2F/DP family and partial experimental evidence for further functional verification of the PheE2F/DPs.
