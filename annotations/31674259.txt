Uptake, assimilation, and recycling of nutrients are essential for optimal plant growth and development. A large number of studies have contributed significantly to highlight the major features that shape an efficient utilization of nutrients in plants, especially at the transcriptional level. However, only a few examples have explored the epigenetic mechanisms that are intrinsically associated to the transcriptional reprogramming events in response to nutritional fluctuations. In this review, we gather the chromatin-based mechanisms that have been described in response to variations of nutrients availability. At this time of genome and epigenome editing, such mechanisms could potentially represent new targets for crop improvement.
