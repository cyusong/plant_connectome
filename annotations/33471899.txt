With the growth of the global population and the increasing frequency of natural disasters, crop yields must be steadily increased to enhance human adaptability to risks. Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), a term mainly used to describe the phenomenon in which grains germinate on the mother plant directly before harvest, is a serious global problem for agricultural production. After domestication, the dormancy level of cultivated crops was generally lower than that of their wild ancestors. Although the shortened dormancy period likely improved the industrial performance of cereals such as wheat, barley, rice, and maize, the excessive germination rate has caused frequent PHS in areas with higher rainfall, resulting in great economic losses. Here, we systematically review the causes of PHS and its consequences, the major indicators and methods for PHS assessment, and emphasize the biological significance of PHS in crop production. Wheat quantitative trait loci functioning in the control of PHS are also comprehensively summarized in a meta-analysis. Finally, we use Arabidopsis as a model plant to develop more complete PHS regulatory networks for wheat. The integration of this information is conducive to the development of custom-made cultivated lines suitable for different demands and regions, and is of great significance for improving crop yields and economic benefits.
