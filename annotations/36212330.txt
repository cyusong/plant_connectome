Cytochrome <i>b</i> <sub>5</sub> (CB5) is a small heme-binding protein, known as an electron donor delivering reducing power to the terminal enzymes involved in oxidative reactions. In plants, the CB5 protein family is substantially expanded both in its isoform numbers and cellular functions, compared to its yeast and mammalian counterparts. As an electron carrier, plant CB5 proteins function not only in fatty acid desaturation, hydroxylation and elongation, but also in the formation of specialized metabolites such as flavonoids, phenolic esters, and heteropolymer lignin. Furthermore, plant CB5s are found to interact with different non-catalytic proteins such as ethylene signaling regulator, cell death inhibitor, and sugar transporters, implicating their versatile regulatory roles in coordinating different metabolic and cellular processes, presumably in respect to the cellular redox status and/or carbon availability. Compared to the plentiful studies on biochemistry and cellular functions of mammalian CB5 proteins, the cellular and metabolic roles of plant CB5 proteins have received far less attention. This article summarizes the fragmentary information pertaining to the discovery of plant CB5 proteins, and discusses the conventional and peculiar functions that plant CB5s might play in different metabolic and cellular processes. Gaining comprehensive insight into the biological functions of CB5 proteins could offer effective biotechnological solutions to tailor plant chemodiversity and cellular responses to environment stimuli.
