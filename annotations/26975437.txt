In Sinorhizobium meliloti, the nodG gene is located in the nodFEG operon of the symbiotic plasmid. Although strong sequence similarity (53% amino acid identities) between S. meliloti NodG and Escherichia coli FabG was reported in 1992, it has not been determined whether S. meliloti NodG plays a role in fatty acid synthesis. We report that expression of S. meliloti NodG restores the growth of the E. coli fabG temperature-sensitive mutant CL104 under nonpermissive conditions. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrated that NodG is able to catalyze the reduction of the 3-oxoacyl-ACP intermediates in E. coli fatty acid synthetic reaction. Moreover, although deletion of the S. meliloti nodG gene does not cause any growth defects, upon overexpression of nodG from a plasmid, the S. meliloti fabG gene encoding the canonical 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase (OAR) can be disrupted without any effects on growth or fatty acid composition. This indicates that S. meliloti nodG encodes an OAR and can play a role in fatty acid synthesis when expressed at sufficiently high levels. Thus, a bacterium can simultaneously possess two or more OARs that can play a role in fatty acid synthesis. Our data also showed that, although SmnodG increases alfalfa nodulation efficiency, it is not essential for alfalfa nodulation.
