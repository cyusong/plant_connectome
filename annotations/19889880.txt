Many plants flower in response to seasonal changes in daylength. This response often varies between accessions of a single species. We studied the variation in photoperiod response found in the model species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Seventy-two accessions were grown under six daylengths varying in 2-h intervals from 6 to 16 h. The typical response was sigmoidal, so that plants flowered early under days longer than 14 h, late under days shorter than 10 h, and at intermediate times under 12-h days. However, many accessions diverged from this pattern and were clustered into groups showing related phenotypes. Thirty-one mutants and transgenic lines were also scored under the same conditions. Statistical comparisons demonstrated that some accessions show stronger responses to different daylengths than are found among the mutants. Genetic analysis of two such accessions demonstrated that different quantitative trait loci conferred an enhanced response to shortening the daylength from 16 to 14 h. Our data illustrate the spectrum of daylength response phenotypes present in accessions of Arabidopsis and demonstrate that similar phenotypic variation in photoperiodic response can be conferred by different combinations of loci.
