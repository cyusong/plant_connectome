['18703589', 'We characterized three Arabidopsis polyamine oxidase genes, AtPAO2, AtPAO3 and  AtPAO4. Transient expression of these genes as monomeric red fluorescent protein  fusion proteins in Arabidopsis root cells revealed that all are peroxisomal  proteins. Quantitative analysis of their transcripts in various organs suggested  that AtPAO4 is the major isoform in root peroxisomes. Analysis of recombinant  AtPAO4 protein indicated that it is a flavoprotein that catalyzed the oxidative  conversion of spermine to spermidine. AtPAO4-deficient mutants established by  using T-DNA insertion and RNA interference techniques had markedly increased  spermine and decreased spermidine levels in the roots. These results suggest that  AtPAO4 is a root peroxisomal polyamine oxidase that participates in polyamine  catabolism. Microarray analysis showed that AtPAO4 deficiency induced alterations  in the expression of genes related to the drought stress response and flavonoid  biosynthesis.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcn114', 'Nishimura']
