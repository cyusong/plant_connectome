['30976809', 'Plastoglobules are lipoprotein particles that are found in different types of  plastids. They contain a very specific and specialized set of lipids and  proteins. Plastoglobules are highly dynamic in size and shape, and are therefore  thought to participate in adaptation processes during either abiotic or biotic  stresses or transitions between developmental stages. They are suggested to  function in thylakoid biogenesis, isoprenoid metabolism, and chlorophyll  degradation. While several plastoglobular proteins contain identifiable domains,  others provide no structural clues to their function. In this study, we  investigate the role of plastoglobular protein 18 (PG18), which is conserved from  cyanobacteria to higher plants. Analysis of a PG18 loss-of-function mutant in  Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that PG18 plays an important role in thylakoid  formation; the loss of PG18 results in impaired accumulation, assembly, and  function of thylakoid membrane complexes. Interestingly, the mutant accumulated  less chlorophyll and carotenoids, whereas xanthophyll cycle pigments were  increased. Accumulation of photosynthetic complexes is similarly affected in both  a Synechocystis and an Arabidopsis PG18 mutant. However, the ultrastructure of  cyanobacterial thylakoids is not compromised by the lack of PG18, probably due to  its less complex architecture.', '2019 Aug 7', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erz177', 'Schwenkert']
