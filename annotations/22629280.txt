['22629280', "Mechanisms for sensing and regulating metabolic processes at the cellular level  are critical for the general physiology and development of living organisms. In  higher plants, sugar signaling is crucial for adequate regulation of carbon and  energy metabolism and affects virtually every aspect of development. Although  many genes are regulated by sugar levels, little is known on how sugar levels are  measured by plants. Several components of the sugar signaling network have been  unraveled and demonstrated to have extensive overlap with hormone signaling  networks. Here we describe the reduced sugar response1-1 (rsr1-1) mutant as a new  early flowering mutant that displays decreased sensitivity to abscisic acid. Both  hexokinase1 (HXK1)-dependent and glucose phosphorylation-independent signaling is  reduced in rsr1-1. Map-based identification of the affected locus demonstrated  that rsr1-1 carries a premature stop codon in the gene for a CstF64-like putative  RNA processing factor, ESP1, which is involved in mRNA 3'-end formation. The  identification of RSR1/ESP1 as a nuclear protein with a potential threonine  phosphorylation site may explain the impact of protein phosphorylation cascades  on sugar-dependent signal transduction. Additionally, RSR1/ESP1 may be a crucial  factor in linking sugar signaling to the control of flowering time.", '2012', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2012.00080', 'Hellmann']
