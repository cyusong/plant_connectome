KEY MESSAGE: (1) The fes1a bag6 double mutant shows an increased short term thermotolerance compared to fes1a. BAG6 is a suppressor of Fes1A; (2) IQ motif is essential to effective performance of BAG6. (3) Calmodulin was involved in signal transduction. (4) BAG6 is localized in the nucleus. HSP70s play an important role in the heat-induced stress tolerance of plants. However, effective HSP70 function requires the assistance of many co-chaperones. BAG6 and Fes1A are HSP70-binding proteins that are critical for Arabidopsis thaliana thermotolerance. Despite this importance, little is known about how these co-chaperones interact. In this study, we assessed the thermotolerance of a fes1a bag6 double mutant. We found that the fes1a bag6 double mutant shows an increased short-term thermotolerance compared to fes1a. However, calmodulin inhibitors diminished this enhanced thermotolerance in the fes1a bag6 double mutant. In addition, we found the IQ motif to be essential for effective BAG6 performance. Since BAG6 is localized in the nucleus, the signal transduction is likely to involve nuclear calcium signaling.
