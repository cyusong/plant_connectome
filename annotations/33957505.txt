As a high-yielding forage grass, Phalaris arundinacea widely distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region of China. To explore physiological and molecular response mechanism of Phalaris arundinacea under waterlogging, we analyzed the biomass and physiological indexes of three locally grown strains under the submerged condition of 10 cm. The material Z0611 showed the strongest waterlogging resistance while the YS showed the weakest performance. Transcriptome sequencing analysis demonstrated that the YS and Z0611 had 17010 and 7566 differently expression genes (DEGs), respectively, which were mainly concentrated in the metabolic process, cell, ribosome, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in GO and KEGG databases. We also identified a large number of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, hormone signaling regulation, transcription factors, antioxidant system, and ethylene signaling. Our research may provide a scientific basis for the restoration of wetland environment on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and lay a foundation for further exploration of the waterlogging resistance genes of Phalaris arundinacea and breeding of new strains resistant with waterlogging stress.
