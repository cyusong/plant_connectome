The development of lateral roots in Arabidopsis thaliana is strongly dependent on signaling directed by the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7), which in turn activates LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) transcription factors (LBD16, LBD18 and LBD29). Here, the product of PRH1, a PR-1 homolog annotated previously as encoding a pathogen-responsive protein, was identified as a target of ARF7-mediated auxin signaling and also as participating in the development of lateral roots. PRH1 was shown to be strongly induced by auxin treatment, and plants lacking a functional copy of PRH1 formed fewer lateral roots. The transcription of PRH1 was controlled by the binding of both ARF7 and LBDs to its promoter region.
