['9375398', 'In rosette plants, the formation of initial flowers is closely linked to the  lengthening of internodes (bolting). In order to clarify the molecular basis of  bolting, mutants with reduced lengths of internodes were screened. This paper  presents the identification and characterization of recessive mutations in  ACAULIS5 (ACL5), a gene required for internodal growth in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Unlike previously described mutants with reduced size of organs, the acl5 mutant  has a severe defect that is restricted to the process of cell elongation after  transition to the reproductive stage and shows no phenotype before floral  induction. The results of RNA blot hybridizations showed that the acl5 mutation  causes a striking reduction in the transcript levels of genes encoding the  tonoplast intrinsic protein (gamma-TIP) and the endoxyloglucan transferase  (EXGT-A1), both of which have recently been suggested to be important for cell  elongation. Furthermore, our morphological study indicates that the mutation also  causes proliferative arrest of the apical inflorescence meristem. These results  strongly suggest that, during the reproductive phase, the wild-type ACL5 gene  product has a critical function not only in the control of elongation growth of  organs but also in the continued maintenance of the proliferative activity of  flower-producing meristems.', '1997 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1997.12040863.x', 'Komeda']
