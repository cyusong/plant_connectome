The formation of gametes is a prerequisite for any sexually reproducing organism in order to complete its life cycle. In plants, female gametes are formed in a multicellular tissue, the female gametophyte or embryo sac. Although the events leading to the formation of the female gametophyte have been morphologically characterized, the molecular control of embryo sac development remains elusive. We used single and double mutants as well as cell-specific marker lines to characterize a novel class of gene regulators in Arabidopsis thaliana, the RWP-RK domain-containing (RKD) transcription factors. Morphological and histological analyses were conducted using confocal laser scanning and differential interference contrast microscopy. Gene expression and transcriptome analyses were performed using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and RNA sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that RKD genes are expressed during distinct stages of embryo sac development. Morphological analysis of the mutants revealed severe distortions in gametophyte polarity and cell differentiation. Transcriptome analysis revealed changes in the expression of several gametophyte-specific gene families (RKD2 and RKD3) and ovule development-specific genes (RKD3), and identified pleiotropic effects on phytohormone pathways (RKD5). Our data provide novel insight into the regulatory control of female gametophyte development. RKDs are involved in the control of cell differentiation and are required for normal gametophytic development.
