<i>Fagopyrum cymosum</i> is considered as most probable wild ancestor of cultivated buckwheat. However, the evolutionary route from <i>F. cymosum</i> to <i>F. esculentum</i> remains to be deciphered. We hypothesized that a hybrid species exists in natural habitats between diploid <i>F. cymosum</i> and <i>F. esculentum</i>. The aim of this research was to determine the phylogenetic position of <i>F. esculentum</i> ssp. <i>ancestrale</i> and to provide new thoughts on buckwheat evolution. Different methodologies including evaluation of morphological traits, determination of secondary metabolites, fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH), comparative chloroplast genomics, and molecular markers were deployed to determine the phylogenetic relationship of <i>F. esculentum</i> ssp. <i>ancestrale</i> with <i>F. cymosum</i> and <i>F. esculentum</i>. The ambiguity observed in morphological pattern of genetic variation in three species revealed that <i>F.</i> <i>esculentum</i> ssp. ancestrale is closely related to <i>F. cymosum</i> and <i>F. esculentum</i>. Flavonoid analysis revealed that <i>F.</i> <i>esculentum</i> ssp. <i>ancestrale</i> is closely related to <i>F. esculentum</i>. Comparative chloroplast genome analysis further supported the close proximity of <i>F. esculentum</i> ssp. <i>ancestrale</i> with <i>F. esculentum</i>. Additionally, molecular marker analysis revealed that <i>F. esculentum</i> ssp. <i>ancestrale</i> exhibits co-dominance with the bands amplified by <i>F. cymosum</i> and <i>F. esculentum</i>. These finding provided supporting evidence in favor of the hypothesis that <i>F. esculentum</i> ssp. <i>ancestrale</i> is a hybrid species between <i>F. cymosum</i> to <i>F. esculentum</i>, which was probably originated by spontaneous hybridization under natural conditions.
