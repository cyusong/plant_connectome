['31688904', "Plants have evolved the ability to derive the benzenoid moiety of the respiratory  cofactor and antioxidant, ubiquinone (coenzyme Q), either from the beta-oxidative  metabolism of p-coumarate or from the peroxidative cleavage of kaempferol. Here,  isotopic feeding assays, gene co-expression analysis and reverse genetics  identified Arabidopsis 4-COUMARATE-COA LIGASE 8 (4-CL8; At5g38120) as a  contributor to the beta-oxidation of p-coumarate for ubiquinone biosynthesis. The  enzyme is part of the same clade (V) of acyl-activating enzymes than At4g19010, a  p-coumarate CoA ligase known to play a central role in the conversion of  p-coumarate into 4-hydroxybenzoate. A 4-cl8 T-DNA knockout displayed a 20%  decrease in ubiquinone content compared with wild-type plants, while 4-CL8  overexpression boosted ubiquinone content up to 150% of the control level.  Similarly, the isotopic enrichment of ubiquinone's ring was decreased by 28% in  the 4-cl8 knockout as compared with wild-type controls when Phe-[Ring-13C6] was  fed to the plants. This metabolic blockage could be bypassed via the exogenous  supply of 4-hydroxybenzoate, the product of p-coumarate beta-oxidation. Arabidopsis  4-CL8 displays a canonical peroxisomal targeting sequence type 1, and confocal  microscopy experiments using fused fluorescent reporters demonstrated that this  enzyme is imported into peroxisomes. Time course feeding assays using  Phe-[Ring-13C6] in a series of Arabidopsis single and double knockouts blocked in  the beta-oxidative metabolism of p-coumarate (4-cl8; at4g19010; at4g19010 x 4-cl8),  flavonol biosynthesis (flavanone-3-hydroxylase), or both  (at4g19010 x flavanone-3-hydroxylase) indicated that continuous high light  treatments (500 microE m-2 s-1; 24 h) markedly stimulated the de novo biosynthesis of  ubiquinone independently of kaempferol catabolism.", '2019 Nov 29', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BCJ20190688', 'Basset']
