['10398702', 'We have identified a new locus that regulates vegetative phase change and  flowering time in Arabidopsis. An early-flowering mutant, eaf1 (early flowering  1) was isolated and characterized. eaf1 plants flowered earlier than the wild  type under either short-day or long-day conditions, and showed a reduction in the  juvenile and adult vegetative phases. When grown under short-day conditions, eaf1  plants were slightly pale green and had elongated petioles, phenotypes that are  observed in mutants altered in either phytochrome or the gibberellin (GA)  response. eaf1 seed showed increased resistance to the GA biosynthesis inhibitor  paclobutrazol, suggesting that GA metabolism and/or response had been altered.  Comparison of eaf1 to other early-flowering mutants revealed that eaf1 shifts to  the adult phase early and flowers early, similarly to the phyB (phytochrome B)  and spy (spindly) mutants. eaf1 maps to chromosome 2, but defines a locus  distinct from phyB, clf (curly leaf), and elf3 (early-flowering 3). These results  demonstrate that eaf1 defines a new locus involved in an autonomous pathway and  may affect GA regulation of flowering.', '1999 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.120.3.675', 'Honma']
