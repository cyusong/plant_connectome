Responses specific to ultraviolet B (UV-B) wavelengths are still poorly understood, both in terms of initial signalling and effects on morphogenesis. Arabidopsis thaliana UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is the only known UV-B specific signalling component, but the role of UVR8 in leaf morphogenesis is unknown. The regulatory effects of UVR8 on leaf morphogenesis at a range of supplementary UV-B doses were characterized, revealing both UVR8-dependent and independent responses to UV irradiation. Inhibition of epidermal cell division in response to UV-B is largely independent of UVR8. However, overall leaf growth under UV-B irradiation in wild-type plants is enhanced compared with a uvr8 mutant because of a UVR8-dependent compensatory increase of cell area in wild-type plants. UVR8 was also required for the regulation of endopolyploidy in response to UV-B, and the uvr8 mutant also has a lower density of stomata than the wild type in the presence of UV-B, indicating that UVR8 has a regulatory role in other developmental events. Our findings show that, in addition to regulating UV-protective gene expression responses, UVR8 is involved in controlling aspects of leaf growth and morphogenesis. This work extends our understanding of how UV-B response is orchestrated at the whole-plant level.
