Understanding how biological and environmental factors interactively shape the global distribution of plant and animal genetic diversity is fundamental to biodiversity conservation. Genetic diversity measured in local populations (GD<sub>P</sub>) is correspondingly assumed representative for population fitness and eco-evolutionary dynamics. For 8356 populations across the globe, we report that plants systematically display much lower GD<sub>P</sub> than animals, and that life history traits shape GD<sub>P</sub> patterns both directly (animal longevity and size), and indirectly by mediating core-periphery patterns (animal fecundity and plant dispersal). Particularly in some plant groups, peripheral populations can sustain similar GD<sub>P</sub> as core populations, emphasizing their potential conservation value. We further find surprisingly weak support for general latitudinal GD<sub>P</sub> trends. Finally, contemporary rather than past climate contributes to the spatial distribution of GD<sub>P</sub>, suggesting that contemporary environmental changes affect global patterns of GD<sub>P</sub>. Our findings generate new perspectives for the conservation of genetic resources at worldwide and taxonomic-wide scales.
