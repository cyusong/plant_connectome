Recent findings suggest that alternative splicing has a critical role in controlling the responses of plants to temperature variations. However, alternative splicing factors in plants are largely uncharacterized. Here we establish the putative splice regulator, PORCUPINE (PCP), as temperature-specific regulator of development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings point to the misregulation of WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 as the possible cause for the meristem defects affecting the pcp-1 loss-of-function mutants at low temperatures.
