High-temperature-mediated adaptation in plant architecture is linked to the increased synthesis of the phytohormone auxin, which alters cellular auxin homeostasis. The auxin gradient, modulated by cellular auxin homeostasis, plays an important role in regulating the developmental fate of plant organs. Although the signaling mechanism that integrates auxin and high temperature is relatively well understood, the cellular auxin homeostasis mechanism under high temperature is largely unknown. Using the Arabidopsis thaliana root as a model, we demonstrate that under high temperature, roots counterbalance the elevated level of intracellular auxin by promoting shootward auxin efflux in a PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2)-dependent manner. Further analyses revealed that high temperature selectively promotes the retrieval of PIN2 from late endosomes and sorts them to the plasma membrane through an endosomal trafficking pathway dependent on SORTING NEXIN1. Our results demonstrate that recycling endosomal pathway plays an important role in facilitating plants adaptation to increased temperature.

High temperature: !promotes! PIN2 retrieval 
PIN2: !facilitates! plant adaptation 
SORTING NEXIN1: !mediates! endosomal trafficking 
Auxin: !alters! cellular homeostasis 
Auxin gradient: !regulates! developmental fate
