The YODA (YDA) kinase pathway is intimately associated with the control of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) embryo development, but little is known regarding its regulators. Using genetic analysis, HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 90 (HSP90) proteins emerge as potent regulators of YDA in the process of embryo development and patterning. This study is focused on the characterization and quantification of early embryonal traits of single and double hsp90 and yda mutants. HSP90s genetic interactions with YDA affected the downstream signaling pathway to control the development of both basal and apical cell lineage of embryo. Our results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal expression of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 8 (WOX8) and WOX2 is changed when function of HSP90s or YDA is impaired, suggesting their essential role in the cell fate determination and possible link to auxin signaling during early embryo development. Hence, HSP90s together with YDA signaling cascade affect transcriptional networks shaping the early embryo development.
