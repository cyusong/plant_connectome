Auxin, primarily indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), is a versatile signal molecule that regulates many aspects of plant growth, development, and stress response. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), a type of short non-coding RNA, have emerged as master regulators of the auxin response pathways by affecting auxin homeostasis and perception in plants. The combination of these miRNAs and the autoregulation of the auxin signaling pathways, as well as the interaction with other hormones, creates a regulatory network that controls the level of auxin perception and signal transduction to maintain signaling homeostasis. In this review, we will detail the miRNAs involved in auxin signaling to illustrate its in planta complex regulation.
