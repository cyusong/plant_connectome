Magnoliids are the third-largest group of angiosperms and occupy a critical position in angiosperm evolution. In the past years, due to the lack of sequenced genomes, the disease resistance gene (<i>R</i> gene) profile of magnoliids remains poorly understood. By the genome-wide identification of 1,832 <i>NLR</i> genes from seven magnoliid genomes, we built a framework for the evolution of magnoliid <i>R</i> genes. <i>TNL</i> genes were completely absent from five magnoliids, presumably due to immune pathway deficiencies. A total of 74 ancestral <i>R</i> genes (70 <i>CNLs</i>, 3 <i>TNLs</i>, and 1 <i>RNL</i>) were recovered in a common ancestor of magnoliids, from which all current <i>NLR</i> gene repertoires were derived. Tandem duplication served as the major drive for <i>NLR</i> genes expansion in seven magnoliid genomes, as most surveyed angiosperms. Due to recent rapid expansions, most magnoliids exhibited "a first expansion followed by a slight contraction and a further stronger expansion" evolutionary pattern, while both <i>Litsea cubeba</i> and <i>Persea americana</i> showed a two-times-repeated pattern of "expansion followed by contraction." The transcriptome analysis of seven different tissues of <i>Saururus chinensis</i> revealed a low expression of most <i>NLR</i> genes, with some <i>R</i> genes displaying a relatively higher expression in roots and fruits. Overall, our study sheds light on the evolution of <i>NLR</i> genes in magnoliids, compensates for insufficiency in major angiosperm lineages, and provides an important reference for a better understanding of angiosperm <i>NLR</i> genes.
