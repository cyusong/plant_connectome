['12566578', 'The hypersensitive response (HR) in plants is a programmed cell death that is  commonly associated with disease resistance. A novel mutation in Arabidopsis,  hlm1, which causes aberrant regulation of cell death, manifested by a  lesion-mimic phenotype and an altered HR, segregated as a single recessive  allele. Broad-spectrum defense mechanisms remained functional or were  constitutive in the mutant plants, which also exhibited increased resistance to a  virulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato. In response to avirulent  strains of the same pathogen, the hlm1 mutant showed differential abilities to  restrict bacterial growth, depending on the avirulence gene expressed by the  pathogen. The HLM1 gene encodes a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, CNGC4.  Preliminary study of the HLM1/CNGC4 gene pro-duct in Xenopus oocytes (inside-out  patch-clamp technique) showed that CNGC4 is permeable to both K(+) and Na(+) and  is activated by both cGMP and cAMP. HLM1 gene expression is induced in response  to pathogen infection and some pathogen-related signals. Thus, HLM1 might  constitute a common downstream component of the signaling pathways leading to  HR/resistance.', '2003 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.006999', 'Roby']
