The Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) perceives jasmonate (JA) signals and subsequently targets the Jasmonate-ZIM domain proteins (JAZs) for degradation by the SCF(COI1)-26S proteasome pathway to mediate various jasmonate-regulated processes, including fertility, root growth, anthocyanin accumulation, senescence, and defense. In this study, we screened JAZ-interacting proteins from an Arabidopsis cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system. MYB21 and MYB24, two R2R3-MYB transcription factors, were found to interact with JAZ1, JAZ8, and JAZ11 in yeast and in planta. Genetic and physiological experiments showed that the myb21 myb24 double mutant exhibited defects specifically in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and filament elongation leading to male sterility. Transgenic expression of MYB21 in the coi1-1 mutant was able to rescue male fertility partially but unable to recover JA-regulated root growth inhibition, anthocyanin accumulation, and plant defense. These results demonstrate that the R2R3-MYB transcription factors MYB21 and MYB24 function as direct targets of JAZs to regulate male fertility specifically. We speculate that JAZs interact with MYB21 and MYB24 to attenuate their transcriptional function; upon perception of JA signal, COI1 recruits JAZs to the SCF(COI1) complex for ubiquitination and degradation through the 26S proteasome; MYB21 and MYB24 are then released to activate expression of various genes essential for JA-regulated anther development and filament elongation.
