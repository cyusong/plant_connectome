Arabidopsis class 1 reversibly glycosylated polypeptides (C1RGPs) were shown to be plasmodesmal-associated proteins. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants constitutively expressing GFP tagged AtRGP2 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter are stunted, have a rosette-like growth pattern, and in source leaves exhibit strong chlorosis, increased photoassimilate retention and starch accumulation that results in elevated leaf specific fresh and dry weights. Basal callose levels around plasmodesmata (Pd) of leaf epidermal cells in transgenic plants are higher than in WT. Such a phenotype is characteristic of virus-infected plants and some transgenic plants expressing Pd-associated viral movement proteins (MP). The local spread of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is inhibited in AtRGP2:GFP transgenics compared to WT. Taken together these observations suggest that overexpression of the AtRGP2:GFP leads to a reduction in Pd permeability to photoassimilate, thus lowering the normal rate of translocation from source leaves to sink organs. Such a reduction may also inhibit the local cell-to-cell spread of viruses in transgenic plants. The observed reduction in Pd permeability could be due to a partial Pd occlusion caused either by the accumulation of AtRGP2:GFP fusion in Pd, and/or by constriction of Pd by the excessive callose accumulation.
