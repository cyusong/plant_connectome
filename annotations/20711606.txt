cis-jasmone (CJ) is a plant-derived chemical that enhances direct and indirect plant defence against herbivorous insects. To study the signalling pathway behind this defence response, we performed microarray-based transcriptome analysis of CJ-treated Arabidopsis plants. CJ influenced a different set of genes from the structurally related oxylipin methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting that CJ triggers a distinct signalling pathway. CJ is postulated to be biosynthetically derived from jasmonic acid, which can boost its own production through transcriptional up-regulation of the octadecanoid biosynthesis genes LOX2, AOS and OPR3. However, no effect on these genes was detected by treatment with CJ. Furthermore, CJ-responsive genes were not affected by mutations in COI1 or JAR1, which are critical signalling components in MeJA response pathway. Conversely, a significant proportion of CJ-inducible genes required the three transcription factors TGA2, TGA5 and TGA6, as well as the GRAS regulatory protein SCARECROW-like 14 (SCL14), indicating regulation by a different pathway from the classical MeJA response. Moreover, the biological importance was demonstrated in that mutations in TGA2, 5, 6, SCL14 and the CJ-inducible gene CYP81D11 blocked CJ-induced attraction of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi, demonstrating that these components play a key role in CJ-induced indirect defence. Collectively, our results identify CJ as a member of the jasmonates that controls indirect plant defence through a distinct signalling pathway.
