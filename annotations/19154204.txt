In yeast and animals, tri- and dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3/2) are markers of transcriptionally active genes that have recently been shown to be primary ligands for the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. However, PHD fingers able to bind to H3K4me3/2 have not been identified in plants. Here, we identify 83 canonical PHD fingers in the Arabidopsis proteome database that are supported by both SMART and Pfam prediction. Among these, we focus on PHD fingers in ING (inhibitor of growth) homologues (AtING) and Alfin1-like (AL) proteins, which are highly similar to those in human ING2 and bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF), based on predicted tertiary structures. ING proteins are found in yeast, animals and plants, whereas AL proteins exist only in plants. In vitro binding experiments indicated that PHD fingers in AtING and AL proteins in Arabidopsis can bind to H3K4me3, and, to a lesser extent, to H3K4me2. In addition, mutational analysis confirmed that a predicted aromatic cage and a specific conserved acidic residue are both crucial for binding to H3K4me3/2. Finally, we demonstrate that AtING and AL proteins are nuclear proteins that are expressed in various tissues of the Arabidopsis plant. Thus, we propose that ING and AL proteins are nuclear proteins that are involved in chromatin regulation by binding to H3K4me3/2, the active histone markers, in plants.
