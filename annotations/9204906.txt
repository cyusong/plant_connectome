['9204906', 'The plant growth regulator gibberellin (GA) has a profound effect on shoot  development and promotes developmental transitions such as flowering. Little is  known about any analogous effect GA might have on root development. In a screen  for mutants, Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation designated pickle (pkl) were  isolated in which the primary root meristem retained characteristics of embryonic  tissue. Expression of this aberrant differentiation state was suppressed by GA.  Root tissue from plants carrying the pkl mutation spontaneously regenerated new  embryos and plants.', '1997 Jul 4', 'Science', '10.1126/science.277.5322.91', 'Somerville']
