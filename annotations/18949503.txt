['18949503', 'Lipoxygenases (LOX) catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the  first step in the biosynthesis of a large group of biologically active fatty acid  metabolites collectively named oxylipins. In the present study we report the  characterization of the enzymatic activity of the six lipoxygenases found in the  genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Recombinant expressed AtLOX-1 and  AtLOX-5 had comparable oxygenase activity with either linoleic acid or linolenic  acid. AtLOX-2, AtLOX-3, AtLOX-4 and AtLOX-6 displayed a selective oxygenation of  linolenic acid. Analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that AtLOX-1 and AtLOX-5 are  9S-lipoxygenases, and AtLOX-2, AtLOX-3, AtLOX-4 and AtLOX-6 are  13S-lipoxygenases. None of the enzymes had dual positional specificity. The  determined activities correlated with that predicted by their phylogenetic  relationship to other biochemically-characterized plant lipoxygenases.', '2009 Feb', 'Lipids', '10.1007/s11745-008-3245-7', 'Castresana']
