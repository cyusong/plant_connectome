['23623553', 'The parallel alignment of stiff cellulose microfibrils in plant-cell walls  mediates anisotropic growth. This is largely controlled by cortical microtubules,  which drive the insertion and trajectory of the cellulose synthase (CESA) complex  at the plasma membrane. The CESA interactive protein 1 (CSI1) acts as a physical  linker between CESA and cortical microtubules. Here we show that the  inflorescence stems of csi1 mutants exhibit subtle right-handed torsion. Because  cellulose deposition is largely uncoupled from cortical microtubules in csi1, we  hypothesize that strictly transverse deposition of microfibrils in the wild-type  is replaced by a helical orientation of uniform handedness in the mutant and that  the helical microfibril alignment generates torsion. Interestingly, both elastic  and viscous models for an expanding cell predict that a net helical orientation  of microfibrils gives rise to a torque. We indeed observed tilted microfibrils in  csi1 cells, and the torsion was almost absent in a csi1 prc1 background with  impaired cellulose synthesis. In addition, the stem torsion led to a novel  bimodal and robust phyllotactic pattern in the csi1 mutant, illustrating how  growth perturbations can replace one robust mathematical pattern with a  different, equally robust pattern.', '2013 May 20', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2013.04.013', 'Hamant']
