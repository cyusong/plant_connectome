This study aims to provide insights into plant-insect interaction during the formation and development of open gall structure on the leaves of Robinia pseudoacacia during gall formation by Obolodiplosis robiniae. This was the first time such far-reaching studies were performed at a biochemical and anatomical level. The gall wall is created from a few thick cells covered with epidermis. This parenchymatous nutritive tissue is rich in starch. Sclerenchyma only occurs around the vascular bundles as a result of the lignification of the parenchyma of the bundle sheaths. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the new structure was reduced and catalase activity was inhibited, which suggests another pathway of ROS decomposition - e.g. by ascorbate or glutathione peroxidase. The gall structure was combined with an increasing level of protein and non-protein thiols. Phenols seems to be a good protective factor; whose level was lower in infected leaflets. Levels of MUFA (monosaturated fatty acids) and SFA (saturated fatty acids) rose, probably as source of food for insects. The amount of fatty acid is positively correlated with the plant response. We detected that non infected leaflets produced C6:0 (hexanoic acid) and C8:0 (octanoic acid) fatty acids connected with odor. Changes in gall color as they develop are connected with photosynthetic pigments degradation (mainly chlorophylls) where the pathway of astaxanthin transformation to fatty acid is considered to be the most important process during gall maturation. Nutritive tissue is composed mainly of octadecanoic acid (C18:0) - a main source of food for O. robiniae.
