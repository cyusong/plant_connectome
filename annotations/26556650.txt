['26556650', 'Xylan, a major constituent of secondary cell walls, is made of a linear chain of  beta-1,4-linked xylosyl residues that are often substituted with glucuronic  acid/methylglucuronic acid side chains and acetylated at O-2 and O-3. Previous  studies have shown that ESK1, an Arabidopsis DUF231 protein, is an  acetyltransferase catalyzing 2-O- and 3-O-monoacetylation of xylan. However, the  esk1 mutation only causes a partial loss of xylan 2-O- and 3-O-monoacetylation,  suggesting that additional xylan acetyltransferase activities are involved. In  this report, we demonstrated the essential roles of two other Arabidopsis DUF231  genes, TBL3 and TBL31, in xylan acetylation. The expression of both TBL3 and  TBL31 was shown to be induced by overexpression of the secondary wall master  transcriptional regulator SND1 (secondary wall-associated NAC domain protein1)  and down-regulated by simultaneous mutations of SND1 and its paralog NST1,  indicating their involvement in secondary wall biosynthesis. beta-Glucurondase (GUS)  reporter gene analysis showed that TBL3 and TBL31 were specifically expressed in  the xylem and interfascicular fibers in stems and the secondary xylem in root  hypocotyls. Expression of fluorescent protein-tagged TBL3 and TBL31 in  protoplasts revealed their localization in the Golgi, where xylan biosynthesis  occurs. Although mutation of either TBL3 or TBL31 alone did not cause any  apparent alterations in cell wall composition, their simultaneous mutations were  found to result in a reduction in xylan acetylation. Further structural analysis  demonstrated that the tbl3 tbl31 double mutant had a specific reduction in  3-O-acetylation of xylan. In addition, the tbl3 tbl31 esk1 triple mutant  displayed a much more drastic decrease in 3-O-acetylation of xylan, indicating  their functional redundancy in xylan 3-O-acetylation. These findings indicate  that TBL3 and TBL31 are secondary wall-associated DUF231 genes specifically  involved in xylan 3-O-acetylation.', '2016 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcv172', 'Ye']
