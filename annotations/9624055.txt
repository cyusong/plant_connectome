['9624055', 'The AXR1 (auxin-resistant) protein, which has features of the  ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, is required for normal response to the plant  hormone auxin in Arabidopsis thaliana. ECR1 functions together with AXR1 to  activate members of the RUB/NEDD8 family of ubiquitin-related proteins. Extracts  from mutant seedlings lacking AXR1 did not promote formation of the RUB-ECR1  thiolester, indicating that AXR1 is the major activity in this tissue. AXR1 was  localized primarily to the nucleus of dividing and elongating cells, suggesting  that the targets of RUB modification are nuclear. These results indicate that  auxin response depends on RUB modification of one or more nuclear proteins.', '1998 Jun 12', 'Science', '10.1126/science.280.5370.1760', 'Estelle']
