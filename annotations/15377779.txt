['15377779', 'More than 50 distinct amino acid transporter genes have been identified in the  genome of Arabidopsis, indicating that transport of amino acids across membranes  is a highly complex feature in plants. Based on sequence similarity, these  transporters can be divided into two major superfamilies: the amino acid  transporter family and the amino acid polyamine choline transporter family.  Currently, mainly transporters of the amino acid transporter family have been  characterized. Here, a molecular and functional characterization of amino acid  polyamine choline transporters is presented, namely the cationic amino acid  transporter (CAT) subfamily. CAT5 functions as a high-affinity, basic amino acid  transporter at the plasma membrane. Uptake of toxic amino acid analogs implies  that neutral or acidic amino acids are preferentially transported by CAT3, CAT6,  and CAT8. The expression profiles suggest that CAT5 may function in reuptake of  leaking amino acids at the leaf margin, while CAT8 is expressed in young and  rapidly dividing tissues such as young leaves and root apical meristem. CAT2 is  localized to the tonoplast in transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts and thus may  encode the long-sought vacuolar amino acid transporter.', '2004 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.045278', 'Ludewig']
