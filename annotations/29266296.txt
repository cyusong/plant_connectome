Plants emit a plethora of volatile organic compounds in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. These compounds act as infochemicals for ecological communication in the phytobiome. This study reviews the role of microbe-induced plant volatiles (MIPVs) in plant-microbe interactions. MIPVs are affected by the taxonomic position of the microbe, the identity of the plant and the type of interaction. Plants also emit exclusive blends of volatiles in response to nonhost and host interactions, as well as to beneficial microbes and necrotrophic/biotrophic pathogens. These MIPVs directly inhibit pathogen growth and indirectly promote resistance/susceptibility to subsequent plant pathogen attack. Viruses and phloem-limiting bacteria modify plant volatiles to attract insect vectors. Susceptible plants can respond to MIPVs from resistant plants and become resistant. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MIPV synthesis in plants and how plant pathogen effectors manipulate their biosynthesis are discussed. This knowledge will help broaden our understanding of plant-microbe interactions and should facilitate the development of new emerging techniques for sustainable plant disease management.
