The worldwide molecular plant-microbe interactions research community was significantly diminished in November 2019 by the death of James "Jim" Robert Alfano at age 56. Jim was a giant in our field, who gained key insights into plant pathogenesis using the model bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. As a mentor, collaborator, and, above all, a friend, I know Jim's many dimensions and accomplishments and, sadly, the depth of loss being felt by the many people around the world who were touched by him. In tracing the path of Jim's career, I will emphasize the historical context and impact of his advances and, finally, the essence of the person we will so miss.
