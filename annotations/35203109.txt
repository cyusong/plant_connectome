Phaseolus vulgaris plants from the Mesoamerican centre of genetic diversification establish a preferential and more efficient root nodule symbiosis with sympatric Rhizobium etli strains. This is mediated by changes in host gene expression, which might occur either at the transcriptional or at the post-transcriptional level. However, the implication of small RNA (sRNA)-mediated control of gene expression in strain selectivity has remained elusive. sRNA sequencing was used to identify host microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially regulated in roots at an early stage of the symbiotic interaction, which were further characterized by applying a reverse genetic approach. In silico analysis identified known and new miRNAs that accumulated to a greater extent in the preferential and more efficient interaction. One of them, designated as Pvu-miR5924, participates in the mechanisms that determine the selection of R. etli strains that will colonize the nodules. In addition, the functional analysis of Pvu-miR390b verified that this miRNA is a negative modulator of nodule formation and bacterial infection. This study not only extended the list of miRNAs identified in P. vulgaris but also enabled the identification of miRNAs that play relevant functions in nodule formation, rhizobial infection and the selection of the rhizobial strains that will occupy the nodule.
