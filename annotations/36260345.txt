Drought, which directly affects the yield of crops and trees, is a natural stress with a profound impact on the economy. Improving water use efficiency (WUE) and drought tolerance are relatively effective strategies to alleviate drought stress. OPEN STOMATA1 (OST1), at the core of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, can improve WUE by regulating stomatal closure and photosynthesis. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ABA crosstalk is considered to be involved in the response to drought stress, but the detailed molecular mechanism is insufficiently known. Here, Populus euphratica, which naturally grows in arid and semiarid regions, was selected as the species for studying MeJA and ABA crosstalk under drought. A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using PeOST1 as bait and a nucleus-localized factor, JASMONATE ZIM-domain protein 2 (PeJAZ2), was found to participate in MeJA signaling by interacting with PeOST1. Overexpression of PeJAZ2 in poplar notably increased water deficit tolerance and WUE in both severe and mild drought stress by regulating ABA signaling rather than ABA synthesis. Furthermore, a PeJAZ2 overexpression line was shown to have greater ABA-induced stomatal closure and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Collectively, this evidence establishes a mechanism in which PeJAZ2 acts as a positive regulator in response to drought stress via ABA-induced stomatal closure caused by H2O2 production. Our study presents a new insight into the crosstalk of ABA and jasmonic acid signaling in regulating WUE and drought stress, providing a basis of the drought tolerance mechanism of P. euphratica.
