The pathway of photosystem II (PSII) assembly is well understood, and multiple auxiliary proteins supporting it have been identified, but little is known about rate-limiting steps controlling PSII biogenesis. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, indications exist that the biosynthesis of the chloroplast-encoded D2 reaction center subunit (PsbD) limits PSII accumulation. To determine the importance of D2 synthesis for PSII accumulation in vascular plants and elucidate the contributions of transcriptional and translational regulation, we modified the 5'-untranslated region of psbD via chloroplast transformation in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). A drastic reduction in psbD mRNA abundance resulted in a strong decrease in PSII content, impaired photosynthetic electron transport, and retarded growth under autotrophic conditions. Overexpression of the psbD mRNA also increased transcript abundance of psbC (the CP43 inner antenna protein), which is co-transcribed with psbD. Because translation efficiency remained unaltered, translation output of pbsD and psbC increased with mRNA abundance. However, this did not result in increased PSII accumulation. The introduction of point mutations into the Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence or start codon of psbD decreased translation efficiency without causing pronounced effects on PSII accumulation and function. These data show that neither transcription nor translation of psbD and psbC are rate-limiting for PSII biogenesis in vascular plants and that PSII assembly and accumulation in tobacco are controlled by different mechanisms than in cyanobacteria or in C. reinhardtii.
