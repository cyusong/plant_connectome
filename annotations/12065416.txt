['12065416', 'ABI1, a protein phosphatase 2C, is a key component of signal transduction in  Arabidopsis. It regulates diverse responses to the phytohormone abscisic acid  (ABA) such as stomatal closure, seed dormancy and inhibition of vegetative  growth. By analysing proteins capable of interacting with ABI1, we have  identified the homeodomain protein ATHB6 as a regulator of the ABA signal  pathway. Critical for interaction between ATHB6 and ABI1 is an intact protein  phosphatase domain and the N-terminal domain of ATHB6 containing the DNA-binding  site. ATHB6 recognizes a cis-element present in its promoter, which encompasses  the core motif (CAATTATTA) that mediated ATHB6- and ABA-dependent gene expression  in protoplasts. In addition, transgenic plants containing a luciferase gene  controlled by the ATHB6 promoter documented a strong ABA-inducible expression of  the reporter which was abrogated in the ABA-insensitive abi1 mutant. Arabidopsis  plants with constitutive expression of the transcriptional regulator revealed ABA  insensitivity in a subset of ABI1-dependent responses. Thus, the homeodomain  protein ATHB6 seems to represent a negative regulator of the ABA signal pathway  and to act downstream of ABI1.', '2002 Jun 17', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/cdf316', 'Grill']
