The nature of plant behaviour is discussed, and it is concluded that it is best described as what plants do. The possibility that plant behaviour is simply signal-induced phenotypic plasticity is outlined, and some limitations of this assumption are considered. Natural environments present many challenges to growing plants, and the consequent signalling that plants perceive is becoming extremely complex. Plant behaviour is active, purposeful and intentional, and examples are discussed. Much plant behaviour, concerned with stress and herbivory, is also based on an assessment of the future likelihood of further damaging episodes and is therefore predictive. Plant behaviour involves the acquisition and processing of information. Informational terminology provides a suitable way of incorporating the concepts of learning, memory and intelligence into plant behaviour, capabilities that plants are rarely credited with. Finally, trade-offs, cost-benefit assessments and decision making are common plant behavioural attributes. It is suggested that intelligent assessments that involve the whole plant are essential to optimize these adaptive capabilities.
