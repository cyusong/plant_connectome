['16771839', 'The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) functions as a sliding clamp for  DNA polymerase, and is thus a key actor in DNA replication. It is also involved  in DNA repair, maintenance of heterochromatic regions throughout replication,  cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death. Identification of PCNA partners  is therefore necessary for understanding these processes. Here we identify two  Arabidopsis SET-domain proteins that interact with PCNA: ATXR5 and ATXR6. A  truncated ATXR5Deltaex2, incapable of interacting with PCNA, also occurs in  planta. ATXR6, upregulated during the S phase, is upregulated by AtE2F  transcription factors, suggesting that it is required for S-phase progression.  The two proteins differ in their subcellular localization: ATXR5 has a dual  localization in plastids and in the nucleus, whereas ATXR6 is solely nuclear.  This indicates that the two proteins may play different roles in plant cells.  However, overexpression of either ATXR5 or ATXR6 causes male sterility because of  the degeneration of defined cell types. Taken together, our results suggest that  both proteins may play a role in the cell cycle or DNA replication, and that the  activity of ATXR5 may be regulated via its subcellular localization.', '2006 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02799.x', 'Bergounioux']
