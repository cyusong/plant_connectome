['8639741', 'We have cloned an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding serine acetyltransferase (EC  2.3.1.30) by functional complementation of the Escherichia coli cysE mutant JM15.  The cDNA clone Sat-1 conferred serine acetyltransferase activity (with apparent  Km for the two substrates acetyl CoA and L-serine of 0.043 and 3.47 mmol/dm3  respectively) on the cysE mutant. The 1515 bp full-length cDNA encodes a deduced  protein of 391 amino acids which includes a putative chloroplastic targeting  presequence. Northern analysis revealed a single message of 1.5 kb, while  Southern hybridisation suggests a small multigene family of related sequences.', '1996 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00020814', 'Wray']
