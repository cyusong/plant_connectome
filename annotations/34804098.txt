<i>Triticum boeoticum</i> Boiss (A<sup>b</sup>A<sup>b</sup>, 2n = 2x = 14) is one of the sources of the blue grain trait controlled by <i>blue aleurone layer 2</i> (<i>Ba2</i>). However, the underlying genes have not been cloned. In this study, a transcriptomic comparison between a blue-grained wheat-<i>T. boeoticum</i> substitution line and its wheat parent identified 41 unigenes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis and 29 unigenes related to transport. The bHLH transcription factor gene <i>TbMYC4A</i> showed a higher expression level in the blue-grained substitution line. <i>TbMYC4A</i> contained the three characteristic bHLH transcription factor domains (bHLH-MYC_N, HLH and ACT-like) and clustered with genes identified from other wheat lines with the blue grain trait derived from other Triticeae species. <i>TbMYC4A</i> overexpression confirmed that it was a functional bHLH transcription factor. The analysis of a <i>TbMYC4A-</i>specific marker showed that the gene was also present in <i>T. boeoticum</i> and <i>T. monococcum</i> with blue aleurone but absent in other Triticeae materials with white aleurone. These results indicate that <i>TbMYC4A</i> is a candidate gene of <i>Ba2</i> controlling the blue aleurone trait. The isolation of <i>TbMYC4A</i> is helpful for further clarifying the genetic mechanism of the blue aleurone trait and is of great significance for breeding blue-grained wheat varieties.
