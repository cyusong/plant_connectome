Chl breakdown is a hallmark of leaf senescence. Protein degradation is tightly associated with accelerated Chl catabolism during leaf senescence. Therefore, blocking or reducing Chl breakdown and thereby improving Chl and leaf protein contents is desirable for agronomic improvement in perennial forage grasses. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is one principle cool-season forage grass in temperate areas throughout the world. In this study, the perennial ryegrass STAY-GREEN gene (LpSGR) was cloned and characterized. LpSGR was highly expressed in developmentally or dark-induced senescent leaves. LpSGR was subcellularly localized in chloroplast and interacted with the other Chl catabolic enzymes. RNA interference (RNAi) of LpSGR in perennial ryegrass blocked the degradation of Chl, resulting in increased Chl content and photochemical efficiency in senescent leaves. The RNAi transgenic plants had significantly improved forage quality, with up to 46.1% increased protein content in the harvested biomass. Transcriptome comparison revealed that suppression of LpSGR led to multiple alterations in metabolic pathways in locations inside the chloroplast. Most transcription factors of senescence-associated hormonal signaling pathways (e.g. ABA, ethylene and jasmonic acid) had decreased expression levels in the RNAi plants. These results provided a foundation for the further study on the regulatory mechanism of LpSGR in perennial ryegrass for the purpose of forage improvement with delayed leaf senescence and higher forage quality.
