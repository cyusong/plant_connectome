Successful regeneration of genetically modified plants from cell culture is highly dependent on the species, genotype, and tissue-type being targeted for transformation. Studies in some plant species have shown that when expression is altered, some genes regulating developmental processes are capable of triggering plant regeneration in a variety of plant cells and tissue-types previously identified as being recalcitrant to regeneration. In the present research, we report that developmental genes encoding GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORS positively enhance regeneration and transformation in both monocot and dicot species. In sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris</i>), ectopic expression of <i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>GRF5</i> (<i>AtGRF5</i>) in callus cells accelerates shoot formation and dramatically increases transformation efficiency. More importantly, overexpression of <i>AtGRF5</i> enables the production of stable transformants in recalcitrant sugar beet varieties. The introduction of <i>AtGRF5</i> and <i>GRF5</i> orthologs into canola (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.), soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.), and sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i> L.) results in significant increases in genetic transformation of the explant tissue. A positive effect on proliferation of transgenic callus cells in canola was observed upon overexpression of <i>GRF5</i> genes and <i>AtGRF6</i> and <i>AtGRF9</i>. In soybean and sunflower, the overexpression of <i>GRF5</i> genes seems to increase the proliferation of transformed cells, promoting transgenic shoot formation. In addition, the transformation of two putative <i>AtGRF5</i> orthologs in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) significantly boosts transformation efficiency and resulted in fully fertile transgenic plants. Overall, the results suggest that overexpression of <i>GRF</i> genes render cells and tissues more competent to regeneration across a wide variety of crop species and regeneration processes. This sets GRFs apart from other developmental regulators and, therefore, they can potentially be applied to improve transformation of monocot and dicot plant species.
