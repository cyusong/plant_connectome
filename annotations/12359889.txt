['12359889', 'We have examined the floral morphology and ontogeny of three mutants of  Arabidopsis thaliana, Ap2-5, Ap2-6, and Ap2-7, that exhibit homeotic changes of  the perianth organs because of single recessive mutations in the AP2 gene.  Homeotic conversions observed are: sepals to carpels in all three mutants, petals  to stamens in Ap2-5, and petals to carpels in Ap2-6. Our analysis of these  mutants suggests that the AP2 gene is required early in floral development to  direct primordia of the first and second whorls to develop as perianth rather  than as reproductive organs. In addition, our results support one of the two  conflicting hypotheses concerning the structures of the calyx and the gynoecium  in the Brassicaceae.', '1989 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.1.12.1195', 'Haughn']
