Anthropogenic global change is driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of drought and flood events, along with associated imbalances and limitation of several soil nutrients. In the context of an increasing human population, these impacts represent a global-scale challenge for biodiversity conservation and sustainable crop production to ensure food security. Plants have evolved strategies to enhance uptake of soil nutrients under environmental stress conditions; for example, symbioses with fungi (mycorrhization) in the rhizosphere and the release of exudates from roots. Although crop cultivation is managed for the effects of limited availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), there is increasing evidence for limitation of plant growth and fitness because of the low availability of other soil nutrients such as the metals potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and iron (Fe), which may become increasingly limiting for plant productivity under global change. The roles of mycorrhizas and plant exudates on N and P uptake have been studied intensively; however, our understanding of the effects on metal nutrients is less clear and still inconsistent. Here, we review the literature on the role of mycorrhizas and root exudates in plant uptake of key nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Fe) in the context of potential nutrient deficiencies in crop and non-crop terrestrial ecosystems, and identify knowledge gaps for future research to improve nutrient-uptake capacity in food crop plants.
