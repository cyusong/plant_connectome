The molecular events underlying the resistance of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to the root-knot nematode (RKN) are largely unknown. In this report, we further characterize the previously identified MIC3 gene including the identification of 14 related MIC cDNAs in nematode-infected roots of allotetraploid cotton that show >85% identity with MIC3. A time-course analysis of RKN infection in resistant and susceptible cotton lines showed that maximum MIC transcript accumulation occurred immediately prior to the phenotypic manifestation of resistance. MIC expression was not induced by mechanical wounding or by virulent reniform nematode infection. MIC expression was undetectable in cotton leaves undergoing a hypersensitive response to Xanthomonas campestris. A time-course analysis of defense gene expression (PR10, ERF5, CDNS, LOX1, POD4, POD8) in resistant and susceptible cotton roots showed that RKN infection specifically elicits the induction of MIC in resistant roots and not other common defense-signaling pathways. These results suggest that cotton resistance to RKN involves novel defense-signaling pathways and further supports the idea that the MIC genes are intimately involved in this resistance response and represent a group of root-specific defense-related genes in cotton.
