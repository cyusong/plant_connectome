['17535918', 'Acid soil syndrome causes severe yield losses in various crop plants because of  the rhizotoxicities of ions, such as aluminum (Al(3+)). Although protons (H(+))  could be also major rhizotoxicants in some soil types, molecular mechanisms of  their tolerance have not been identified yet. One mutant that was hypersensitive  to H(+) rhizotoxicity was isolated from ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized seeds,  and a single recessive mutation was found on chromosome 1. Positional cloning  followed by genomic sequence analysis revealed that a missense mutation in the  zinc finger domain in a predicted Cys(2)His(2)-type zinc finger protein, namely  sensitive to proton rhizotoxicity (STOP)1, is the cause of hypersensitivity to  H(+) rhizotoxicity. The STOP1 protein belongs to a functionally unidentified  subfamily of zinc finger proteins, which consists of two members in Arabidopsis  based on a Blast search. The stop1 mutation resulted in no effects on cadmium,  copper, lanthanum, manganese and sodium chloride sensitivitities, whereas it  caused hypersensitivity to Al(3+) rhizotoxicity. This stop1 mutant lacked the  induction of the AtALMT1 gene encoding a malate transporter, which is concomitant  with Al-induced malate exudation. There was no induction of AtALMT1 by Al(3+)  treatment in the stop1 mutant. These results indicate that STOP1 plays a critical  role in Arabidopsis tolerance to major stress factors in acid soils.', '2007 Jun 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0700117104', 'Kobayashi']
