The atmospheric concentration of CO2 will probably rise to about 700 micromol mol(-1) by the end of this century. The effects of elevated growth CO2 on photosynthesis are still not fully understood. Effects of elevated growth CO2 on the capacity for photosynthesis of a single leaf and a whole plant were investigated with the radish cultivar White Cherish. The plants were grown under ambient ( approximately 400 micromol mol(-1)) or elevated CO2 ( approximately 750 micromol mol(-1)). The rates of net photosynthesis per leaf area with a whole plant and a single leaf of plants of various ages (15-26 d after planting) were measured under ambient and elevated CO2. The rates of photosynthesis were increased by 20-28% by elevated CO2. There was no effect of elevated growth CO2 on the rate of photosynthesis, clearly indicating no downward acclimation of photosynthesis to elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 increased dry weight accumulation by >27%. The effect of elevated CO2 on other growth characteristics will also be shown.
