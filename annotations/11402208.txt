['11402208', "The inositol triphosphate (IP(3))-signaling pathway has been associated with  several developmental and physiological processes in plants, but we currently  know little about the regulation of this pathway. Inositol 5' phosphatases  (5PTases) are enzymes that remove a 5' phosphate from several potential second  messengers, including IP(3). In catalyzing the removal of a 5' phosphate from  second messenger substrates, 5PTases can act to terminate signal transduction  events. We describe the molecular analysis of At5PTase1, a 5PTase gene from  Arabidopsis. When expressed transiently in Arabidopsis leaf tissue or ectopically  in transgenic plants, At5PTase1 allowed for the increased hydrolysis of  I(1,4,5)P(3) and I(1,3,4,5)P(4) substrates. At5PTase1 did not hydrolyze I(1)P,  I(1,4)P(2), or PI(4,5)P(2) substrates. This substrate specificity was similar to  that of the human Type I 5PTase. We identified 14 other potential At5PTase genes  and constructed an unrooted phylogenetic tree containing putative Arabidopsis,  human, and yeast 5PTase proteins. This analysis indicated that the Arabidopsis  5PTases were grouped in two separate branches of the tree. The multiplicity of  At5PTases indicates that these enzymes may have different substrate specificities  and play different roles in signal termination in Arabidopsis.", '2001 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.126.2.801', 'Gillaspy']
