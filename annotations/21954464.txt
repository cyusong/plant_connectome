['21954464', 'The pollen tube germinates from pollen and, during its migration, it perceives  and responds to guidance cues from maternal tissue and from the female  gametophyte. The putative female cues have recently been identified, but how the  pollen tube responds to these signals remains to be unveiled. In a genetic screen  for male determinants of the pollen tube response, we identified the pollen  defective in guidance1 (pod1) mutant, in which the pollen tubes fail to target  the female gametophyte. POD1 encodes a conserved protein of unknown function and  is essential for positioning and orienting the cell division plane during early  embryo development. Here, we demonstrate that POD1 is an endoplasmic reticulum  (ER) luminal protein involved in ER protein retention. Further analysis shows  that POD1 interacts with the Ca(2+) binding ER chaperone CALRETICULIN3 (CRT3), a  protein in charge of folding of membrane receptors. We propose that POD1  modulates the activity of CRT3 or other ER resident factors to control the  folding of proteins, such as membrane proteins in the ER. By this mechanism, POD1  may regulate the pollen tube response to signals from the female tissues during  pollen tube guidance and early embryo patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2011 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.088914', 'Yang']
