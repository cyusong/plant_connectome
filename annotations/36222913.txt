Using virus-induced gene silencing, we demonstrated that the enzymes GES, ISY, and MLPL are responsible for nepetalactone biosynthesis in Nepeta cataria. Nepetalactone is the main iridoid that is found in the Nepeta genus and is well-known for its psychoactive effect on house cats. Moreover, there is a burgeoning interest into the effect of nepetalactone on insects. Although the enzymes for nepetalactone biosynthesis have been biochemically assayed in vitro, validation of the role that these enzymes have in planta has not been demonstrated. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a silencing method that relies on transient transformation and is an approach that has been particularly successful when applied to a variety of non-model plants. Here, we use a recently designed visual-marker dependent VIGS system to demonstrate that the nepetalactone biosynthetic enzymes GES, ISY, and MLPL impact nepetalactone biosynthesis in Nepeta cataria.

GES: !synthesizes! nepetalactone
ISY: !synthesizes! nepetalactone
MLPL: !synthesizes! nepetalactone
VIGS: !demonstrates! role of enzymes in planta
VIGS: !validates! role of enzymes in Nepeta cataria
