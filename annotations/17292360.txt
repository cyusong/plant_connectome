['17292360', "The major anthocyanin in A. thaliana is a cyanidin derivative modified by  glycosylation as well as by the addition of three acyl moieties: malonyl,  p-coumaroyl, and sinapoyl. We have isolated a member of the BAHD acyltransferase  family which catalyzes this malonylation reaction by combining a reverse genetics  approach with biochemical genomics. A mutant line containing a T-DNA insertion in  At3g29590, the gene encoding the malonylating enzyme, is incapable of producing  malonylated anthocyanins. Transgenic plants harboring an RNAi silencing cassette  for At3g29590 demonstrate a positive correlation between reduction in the  At3g29590 gene transcript and the decrease of malonylated anthocyanins.  Transcript levels for both At3g29590 and the epistatic gene At4g14090, encoding  5-O-anthocyanin glucosyltransferase, increase in several plant lines as they  accumulate anthocyanin pigments. Investigation of the heterologously expressed  and purified malonylating enzyme showed that the activity is specific for  malonyl-CoA and for anthocyanins with 5-O-glucosylation. The malonyl transfer  itself occurs only to the 5-O-glucoside function, and not to any of the other  sugar moieties present in A. thaliana anthocyanins. Hence, both in vivo and in  vitro results define the activity of the At3g29590-encoded enzyme as an  anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6''-O-malonyltransferase (At5MAT).", '2007 Mar 6', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.01.060', 'Gershenzon']
