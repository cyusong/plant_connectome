Seed germination is the process through which a quiescent organ reactivates its metabolism culminating with the resumption cell divisions. It is usually the growth of a plant contained within a seed and results in the formation of a seedling. Post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in gene expression. In cells, post-transcriptional regulation is mediated by many factors, such as RNA-binding proteins, microRNAs, and the spliceosome. This review provides an overview of the relationship between seed germination and post-transcriptional regulation. It addresses the relationship between seed germination and RNA-binding proteins, microRNAs and alternative splicing. This presentation of the current state of the knowledge will promote new investigations into the relevance of the interactions between seed germination and post-transcriptional regulation in plants.

RNA-binding proteins: !regulate! Post-transcriptional regulation
microRNAs: !regulate! Post-transcriptional regulation
spliceosome: !regulates! Post-transcriptional regulation
Post-transcriptional regulation: !affects! Seed germination
Seed germination: !affected by! Post-transcriptional regulation
