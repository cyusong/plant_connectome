The degradation of the grassland system has severely threatened the safety of the ecological environment and animal husbandry. The supplement of key substances lost due to degradation is widely used to accelerate the restoration of the degraded grassland ecosystem. In this study, we investigated the effects of biochar and nitrogen addition on soil properties and microorganisms of degraded alpine grassland. The experimental treatments consisted of the control without any addition, only nitrogen addition (10 gN/m<sup>2</sup>), only biochar addition (4.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup> biochar), and the mixed addition of biochar and nitrogen (4.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup> biochar and 10 gN/m<sup>2</sup> nitrogen, respectively). Adding N alone did not significantly change the pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass (MB), and the composition proportion of microbes of the soil, but increased the contents of soil water content (SWC), NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>-N, NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-N, available phosphorus (AP), and the biomass of bacteria and fungi. The addition of biochar or the mixture of biochar and nitrogen increased the contents of pH, TOC, TN, MB, SWC, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>-N, NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-N, AP, bacteria, and fungi in the soil and changed the structure of the soil microbial community. The increasing intensity of AP, bacteria, and fungi under the addition of biochar or the mixture of biochar and nitrogen was significantly greater than that under N addition alone. These results indicated that the separated addition of nitrogen and biochar and the mixed addition of biochar and nitrogen all improved the soil condition of the moderate-severe degraded alpine grassland, but the mixed addition of biochar and nitrogen could be a better strategy to remediate the degraded alpine grassland.
