Elongation factor 1 A (EF1A), an essential regulator for protein synthesis, has been reported to participate in abiotic stress responses and environmental adaption in plants. However, the role of EF1A in abiotic stress response was barely studied in Medicago truncatula. Here, we identified elongation factor (EF) genes of M. truncatula and studied the salt stress response function of MtEF1A1 (MTR_6g021805). A total of 34 EF genes were identified in the M. truncatula genome. Protein domains and motifs of EFs were highly conserved in plants. MtEF1A1 has the highest expression levels in root nodules and roots, followed by the leaves and stems. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing MtEF1A1 was more resistant to salt stress treatment, with higher germination rate, longer roots, and more lateral roots than wild type plant. In addition, lower levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also detected in transgenic Arabidopsis. Similarly, MtEF1A1 overexpressing M. truncatula was more resistant to salt stress and had lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in leaves. Furthermore, the expression levels of abiotic stress-responsive genes (MtRD22A and MtCOR15A) and calcium-binding genes (MtCaM and MtCBL4) were upregulated in MtEF1A1 overexpressing lines of M. truncatula. These results suggested that MtEF1A1 play a positive role in salt stress regulation. MtEF1A1 may realize its function by binding to calmodulin (CaM) or by participating in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathway. This study revealed that MtEF1A1 is an important regulator for salt stress response in M. truncatula, and provided potential strategy for salt-tolerant plant breeding.
