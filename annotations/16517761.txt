['16517761', "Arabidopsis thaliana mutants prors1-1 and -2 were identified on the basis of a  decrease in effective photosystem II quantum yield. Mutations were localized to  the 5'-untranslated region of the nuclear gene PROLYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE1 (PRORS1),  which acts in both plastids and mitochondria. In prors1-1 and -2, PRORS1  expression is reduced, along with protein synthesis in both organelles. PRORS1  null alleles (prors1-3 and -4) result in embryo sac and embryo development  arrest. In mutants with the leaky prors1-1 and -2 alleles, transcription of  nuclear genes for proteins involved in photosynthetic light reactions is  downregulated, whereas genes for other chloroplast proteins are upregulated.  Downregulation of nuclear photosynthetic genes is not associated with a marked  increase in the level of reactive oxygen species in leaves and persists in the  dark, suggesting that the transcriptional response is light and photooxidative  stress independent. The mrpl11 and prpl11 mutants are impaired in the  mitochondrial and plastid ribosomal L11 proteins, respectively. The prpl11 mrpl11  double mutant, but neither of the single mutants, resulted in strong  downregulation of nuclear photosynthetic genes, like that seen in leaky mutants  for PRORS1, implying that, when organellar translation is perturbed, signals  derived from both types of organelles cooperate in the regulation of nuclear  photosynthetic gene expression.", '2006 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039073', 'Leister']
