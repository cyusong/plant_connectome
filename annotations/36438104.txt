Identification of the evolution history and genetic diversity of a species is important in the utilization of novel genetic variation in this species, as well as for its conservation. <i>Pistacia chinensis</i> is an important biodiesel tree crop in China, due to the high oil content of its fruit. The aim of this study was to uncover the genetic structure of <i>P. chinensis</i> and to investigate the influence of intraspecific gene flow on the process of domestication and the diversification of varieties. We investigated the genetic structure of <i>P. chinensis</i>, as well as evolution and introgression in the subpopulations, through analysis of the plastid and nuclear genomes of 39 P<i>. chinensis</i> individuals from across China. High levels of variation were detected in the <i>P. chinensis</i> plastome, and 460 intraspecific polymorphic sites, 104 indels and three small inversions were identified. Phylogenetic analysis and population structure using the plastome dataset supported five clades of <i>P. chinensis</i>. Population structure analysis based on the nuclear SNPs showed two groups, clearly clustered together, and more than a third of the total individuals were classified as hybrids. Discordance between the plastid and nuclear genomes suggested that hybridization events may have occurred between highly divergent samples in the <i>P. chinensis</i> subclades. Most of the species in the <i>P. chinensis</i> subclade diverged between the late Miocene and the mid-Pliocene. The processes of domestication and cultivation have decreased the genetic diversity of <i>P. chinensis.</i> The extensive variability and structuring of the <i>P. chinensis</i> plastid together with the nuclear genomic variation detected in this study suggests that much unexploited genetic diversity is available for improvement in this recently domesticated species.
