['18535009', 'NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) is a homolog of respiratory complex I and mediates  one of the two pathways of cyclic electron flow around PSI (CEF I). Although 15  ndh subunits have been identified in the chloroplastic and nuclear genomes of  higher plants, no electron accepter subunits have been identified to date. To  identify the missing chloroplastic NDH subunits, we undertook an in silico  approach based on co-expression analysis. In this report, we characterized the  novel gene NDF6 (NDH-dependent flow 6; At1g18730) which encodes a protein that is  essential for NDH activity. NDF6 has one transmembrane domain and is localized in  the thylakoid membrane fraction. Homologous proteins of NDF6 were identified in  the genomes of terrestrial plants; however, no homologs have been found in  cyanobacteria, which are thought to be the origin of chloroplasts and have a  minimal NDH complex unit. NDF6 is unstable in ndhB-impaired or disrupted mutants  of higher plants in which the chloroplastic NDH complex is thought to be  degraded. These results suggest that NDF6 is a novel subunit of chloroplastic NDH  that was added to terrestrial plants during evolution.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcn083', 'Sato']
