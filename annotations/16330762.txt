['16330762', 'UV-B radiation in sunlight has diverse effects on humans, animals, plants, and  microorganisms. UV-B can cause damage to molecules and cells, and consequently  organisms need to protect against and repair UV damage to survive in sunlight. In  plants, low nondamaging levels of UV-B stimulate transcription of genes involved  in UV-protective responses. However, remarkably little is known about the  underlying mechanisms of UV-B perception and signal transduction. Here we report  that Arabidopsis UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) is a UV-B-specific signaling  component that orchestrates expression of a range of genes with vital  UV-protective functions. Moreover, we show that UVR8 regulates expression of the  transcription factor HY5 specifically when the plant is exposed to UV-B. We  demonstrate that HY5 is a key effector of the UVR8 pathway, and that it is  required for survival under UV-B radiation. UVR8 has sequence similarity to the  eukaryotic guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1, but we found that it has  little exchange activity. However, UVR8, like RCC1, is located principally in the  nucleus and associates with chromatin via histones. Chromatin immunoprecipitation  showed that UVR8 associates with chromatin in the HY5 promoter region, providing  a mechanistic basis for its involvement in regulating transcription. We conclude  that UVR8 defines a UV-B-specific signaling pathway in plants that orchestrates  the protective gene expression responses to UV-B required for plant survival in  sunlight.', '2005 Dec 13', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0507187102', 'Jenkins']
