A crucial step for identifying genes of interest in legume crops is to determine gene function in Medicago truncatula. To facilitate functional genomics in this species, an ecophysiological framework of analysis was developed. Our primary aim was to establish a standard terminology for identifying each organ on the plant. A standard system for the characterization of the vegetative and the reproductive developmental stages was then proposed. Using these tools, the time course of vegetative development of nitrogen-fixing A17 plants was analysed in experiments conducted under different environmental conditions. To take into account the influence of temperature on plant development timing, an original approach was used by modelling vegetative development as a function of thermal time. Interestingly, the use of thermal time highlighted genotypic constants in plant development. Thereafter, to illustrate how this methodology can be used in explaining phenotypic alterations, the phenotype of two allelic mutants was analysed. Because the tools proposed in this paper allow the following: (1) standardization of how the plant material should be characterized to be used for functional genomics; (2) prediction of plant vegetative development; and (3) a more accurate phenotyping, the use of these tools by the M. truncatula community should provide a relevant framework for facilitating the production of reproducible functional genomics data.
