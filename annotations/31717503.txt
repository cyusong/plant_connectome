Abiotic stress greatly inhibits crop growth and reduces yields. However, little is known about the transcriptomic changes that occur in the industrial oilseed crop, rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), in response to abiotic stress. In this study, we examined the physiological and transcriptional responses of rapeseed to drought (simulated by treatment with 15% (<i>w</i>/<i>v</i>) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000) and salinity (150 mM NaCl) stress. Proline contents in young seedlings greatly increased under both conditions after 3 h of treatment, whereas the levels of antioxidant enzymes remained unchanged. We assembled transcripts from the leaves and roots of rapeseed and performed BLASTN searches against the rapeseed genome database for the first time. Gene ontology analysis indicated that DEGs involved in catalytic activity, metabolic process, and response to stimulus were highly enriched. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the categories metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were highly enriched. We determined that myeloblastosis (MYB), <i>NAM</i>/<i>ATAF1-2</i>/<i>CUC2</i> (NAC), and APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding proteins (AP2-EREBP) transcription factors function as major switches that control downstream gene expression and that proline plays a role under short-term abiotic stress treatment due to increased expression of synthesis and decreased expression of degradation. Furthermore, many common genes function in the response to both types of stress in this rapeseed.
