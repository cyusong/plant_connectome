Rusts are among the most important foliar biotrophic fungal diseases in legumes. <i>Lathyrus cicera</i> crop can be severely damaged by <i>Uromyces pisi</i>, to which partial resistance has been identified. Nevertheless, the underlying genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of this resistance are poorly understood in <i>L. cicera</i>. To prioritise the causative variants controlling partial resistance to rust in <i>L. cicera</i>, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, segregating for response to this pathogen, was used to combine the detection of related phenotypic- and expression-quantitative trait loci (pQTLs and eQTLs, respectively). RILs' <i>U. pisi</i> disease severity (DS) was recorded in three independent screenings at seedling (growth chamber) and in one season of exploratory screening at adult plant stage (semi-controlled field conditions). A continuous DS range was observed in both conditions and used for pQTL mapping. Different pQTLs were identified under the growth chamber and semi-controlled field conditions, indicating a distinct genetic basis depending on the plant developmental stage and/or the environment. Additionally, the expression of nine genes related to <i>U. pisi</i> resistance in <i>L. cicera</i> was quantified for each RIL individual and used for eQTL mapping. One <i>cis</i>-eQTL and one trans-eQTL were identified controlling the expression variation of one gene related to rust resistance - a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 17. Integrating phenotyping, gene expression and linkage mapping allowed prioritising four candidate genes relevant for disease-resistance precision breeding involved in adaptation to biotic stress, cellular, and organelle homeostasis, and proteins directly involved in plant defence.
