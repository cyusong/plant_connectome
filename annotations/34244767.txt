['34244767', 'Cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) are evolutionarily conserved organelles that  store neutral lipids and play critical roles in plant growth, development, and  stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their biogenesis  at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain obscure. Here we show that a recently  identified protein termed LD-associated protein [LDAP]-interacting protein (LDIP)  works together with both endoplasmic reticulum-localized SEIPIN and the LD-coat  protein LDAP to facilitate LD formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Heterologous  expression in insect cells demonstrated that LDAP is required for the targeting  of LDIP to the LD surface, and both proteins are required for the production of  normal numbers and sizes of LDs in plant cells. LDIP also interacts with SEIPIN  via a conserved hydrophobic helix in SEIPIN and LDIP functions together with  SEIPIN to modulate LD numbers and sizes in plants. Further, the co-expression of  both proteins is required to restore normal LD production in SEIPIN-deficient  yeast cells. These data, combined with the analogous function of LDIP to a  mammalian protein called LD Assembly Factor 1, are discussed in the context of a  new model for LD biogenesis in plant cells with evolutionary connections to LD  biogenesis in other eukaryotes.', '2021 Sep 24', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab179', 'ORCID:']
