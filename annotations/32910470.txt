Sphagnum farming can substitute peat with renewable biomass and thus help mitigate climate change. Large volumes of the required founder material can only be supplied sustainably by axenic cultivation in bioreactors. We established axenic in vitro cultures from sporophytes of 19 Sphagnum species collected in Austria, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Russia, and Sweden: S. angustifolium, S. balticum, S. capillifolium, S. centrale, S. compactum, S. cuspidatum, S. fallax, S. fimbriatum, S. fuscum, S. lindbergii, S. medium/divinum, S. palustre, S. papillosum, S. rubellum, S. russowii, S. squarrosum, S. subnitens, S. subfulvum and S. warnstorfii. These species cover five of the six European Sphagnum subgenera; namely, Acutifolia, Cuspidata, Rigida, Sphagnum and Squarrosa. Their growth was measured in suspension cultures, whereas their ploidy was determined by flow cytometry and compared with the genome size of Physcomitrella patens. We identified haploid and diploid Sphagnum species, found that their cells are predominantly arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and did not find a correlation between plant productivity and ploidy. DNA barcoding was achieved by sequencing introns of the BRK1 genes. With this collection, high-quality founder material for diverse large-scale applications, but also for basic Sphagnum research, is available from the International Moss Stock Center.
