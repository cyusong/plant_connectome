['11698666', 'Two Arabidopsis thaliana extragenic mutations that suppress NaCl hypersensitivity  of the sos3-1 mutant were identified in a screen of a T-DNA insertion population  in the genetic background of Col-0 gl1 sos3-1. Analysis of the genome sequence in  the region flanking the T-DNA left border indicated that sos3-1 hkt1-1 and sos3-1  hkt1-2 plants have allelic mutations in AtHKT1. AtHKT1 mRNA is more abundant in  roots than shoots of wild-type plants but is not detected in plants of either  mutant, indicating that this gene is inactivated by the mutations. hkt1-1 and  hkt1-2 mutations can suppress to an equivalent extent the Na(+) sensitivity of  sos3-1 seedlings and reduce the intracellular accumulation of this cytotoxic ion.  Moreover, sos3-1 hkt1-1 and sos3-1 hkt1-2 seedlings are able to maintain  [K(+)](int) in medium supplemented with NaCl and exhibit a substantially higher  intracellular ratio of K(+)/Na(+) than the sos3-1 mutant. Furthermore, the hkt1  mutations abrogate the growth inhibition of the sos3-1 mutant that is caused by  K(+) deficiency on culture medium with low Ca(2+) (0.15 mM) and <200 microM K(+).  Interestingly, the capacity of hkt1 mutations to suppress the Na(+)  hypersensitivity of the sos3-1 mutant is reduced substantially when seedlings are  grown in medium with low Ca(2+) (0.15 mM). These results indicate that AtHKT1 is  a salt tolerance determinant that controls Na(+) entry and high affinity K(+)  uptake. The hkt1 mutations have revealed the existence of another Na(+) influx  system(s) whose activity is reduced by high [Ca(2+)](ext).', '2001 Nov 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.241501798', 'Hasegawa']
