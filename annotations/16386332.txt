Lipid peroxidation is common to all biological systems, both appearing in developmentally and environmentally regulated processes. Products are hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acids and metabolites derived there from collectively named oxylipins. They may either originate from chemical oxidation or are synthesized by the action of various enzymes, such as lipoxygenases (LOXes). Signalling compounds such as jasmonates, antimicrobial and antifungal compounds such as leaf aldehydes or divinyl ethers, and a plant-specific blend of volatiles including leaf alcohols are among the numerous products. Cloning of many LOXes and other key enzymes metabolizing oxylipins, as well as analyses by reverse genetic approaches and metabolic profiling revealed new insights on oxylipin functions, new reactions and the first hints on enzyme mechanisms. These aspects are reviewed with respect to function of specific LOX forms and on the development of new models on their substrate and product specificity.
