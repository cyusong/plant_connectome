Pear (Pyrus pyrifolia L.) possesses an S-RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system, and S-RNase, the self-incompatibility (SI) determinant in the pistil, has also been implicated in the rejection of self-pollen and genetically identical pollen. We have demonstrated that S-RNase depolymerises actin cytoskeleton, triggers mitochondrial alteration and DNA degradation in the incompatible pollen tube, which indicates programmed cell death (PCD) may occur in SI response of Pyrus pyrifolia. Recently, we have identified that S-RNase specifically disrupted tip-localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) of incompatible pollen tube via arrest of ROS formation in mitochondria and cell walls in Pyrus pyrifolia. Furthermore, tip-localized ROS disruption not only decreased the Ca(2+) current and depolymerised the actin cytoskeleton, but it also induced nuclear DNA degradation in the pollen tube. The results mentioned above indicate that a cascade signal pathway may occur in SI of Pyrus pyrifolia and PCD is used to terminate the incompatible pollen tubes growth. In this addendum, we review the cascade signal pathway of Pyrus pyrifolia SI.
