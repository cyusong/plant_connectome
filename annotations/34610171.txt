Apple leaf spot, a disease caused by Alternaria alternata f. sp. mali and other fungal species, leads to severe defoliation and results in tremendous losses to the apple (Malus × domestica) industry in China. We previously identified three RPW8, nucleotide-binding, and leucine-rich repeat domain CC<sub>R</sub> -NB-LRR proteins (RNLs), named MdRNL1, MdRNL2, and MdRNL3, that contribute to Alternaria leaf spot (ALT1) resistance in apple. However, the role of NB-LRR proteins in resistance to fungal diseases in apple remains poorly understood. We therefore used MdRNL1/2/3 as baits to screen ALT1-inoculated leaves for interacting proteins and identified only MdRNL6 (another RNL) as an interactor of MdRNL2. Protein interaction assays demonstrated that MdRNL2 and MdRNL6 interact through their NB-ARC domains. Transient expression assays in apple indicated that complexes containing both MdRNL2 and MdRNL6 are necessary for resistance to Alternaria leaf spot. Intriguingly, the same complexes were also required to confer resistance to Glomerella leaf spot and Marssonina leaf spot in transient expression assays. Furthermore, stable transgenic apple plants with suppressed expression of MdRNL6 showed hypersensitivity to Alternaria leaf spot, Glomerella leaf spot, and Marssonina leaf spot; these effects were similar to the effects of suppressing MdRNL2 expression in transgenic apple plantlets. The identification of these novel broad-spectrum fungal resistance genes will facilitate breeding for fungal disease resistance in apple.
