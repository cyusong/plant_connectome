DNA introduction into cells is an essential technique for molecular genetic analysis. Here, we show that DNA is easily introduced into cells of the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae by a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated protocol. In this study, the beta-tubulin gene of C. merolae was cloned on a plasmid and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag then added at the C-terminus. This plasmid was then introduced into C. merolae cells by a PEG-mediated transformation protocol. At 24 h after PEG-mediated transformation, intracellular localization of the tagged protein was detected by anti-HA immunocytochemistry, indicating the utility of this transient expression system for molecular genetic analyses.
