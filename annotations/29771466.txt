['29771466', 'Seed germination and early seedling establishment, critical developmental stages  in the life cycle of seed plants, are modulated by diverse endogenous hormones  and the surrounding environment. Arabidopsis ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) is  a central transcription factor of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling that represses  those processes. ABI5 is precisely modulated at post-translational level;  however, whether it interacts with other crucial transcriptional regulators  remains to be investigated. In this study, VQ18 and VQ26, two members of the  recently-identified VQ family, were found to interact with ABI5 in vitro and  in vivo. Phenotypic analysis showed that VQ18 and VQ26 are responsive to ABA and  negatively mediate ABA signaling redundantly during seed germination.  Simultaneously decreasing VQ18 and VQ26 expression levels enhanced ABA signaling  to suppress seed germination, whereas overexpressing these two VQ genes resulted  in the germinated seeds being less ABA-sensitive. Consistently, the expression  levels of several ABI5 targets were modulated by VQ18 and VQ26. The increased ABA  signaling of plants in which VQ18 and VQ26 were simultaneously suppressed  required ABI5. Additionally, VQ18 and VQ26 acted as negative interactors of the  ABI5 transcription factor. Our study reveals a previously unidentified regulatory  role of VQ proteins, which act antagonistically with ABI5 to maintain the  appropriate ABA signaling level to fine-tune seed germination and early seedling  establishment.', '2018 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13969', 'Yu']
