Multiple genetic pathways coordinately determine the timing of the floral transition from vegetative to reproductive development in response to various endogenous and environmental signals. We have recently reported that a novel flowering promoter, DNAJ HOMOLOG 3 (J3), acts downstream of various floral pathways and mediates the transcriptional regulation of two floral pathway integrators, FLOWRING LOCUS T and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1, through its interaction with a potent flowering repressor, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE. Here we show that J3 expression driven by the promoter of SUCROSE TRANSPORTER 2 significantly rescues the late-flowering phenotype of j3-1 loss-of-function mutants, suggesting that J3 activity in leaves mainly contributes to its role in regulating flowering time. Furthermore, we reveal that endogenous expression of J3 requires the cis-element(s) located within J3 coding regions or introns.
