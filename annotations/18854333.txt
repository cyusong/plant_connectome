We examined the effect of (+)-ABA on the in vitro interaction of rice FCA and FY homologs, OsFCA and OsFY. From this analysis, we found no disruption of the OsFCA-OsFY complexes by ABA treatment. This result prompted us to examine the effect of ABA on the FCA-FY interaction. In these experiments, we could not reproduce the inhibitory effect of (+)-ABA on the interaction between FCA and FY. Based on these combined results, we believe that the inhibitory effect of (+)-ABA on the FCA-FY interaction should be cautiously reconsidered.

OsFCA: !interacts with! OsFY
FCA: !interacts with! FY
ABA: !disrupts! OsFCA-OsFY complexes
ABA: !inhibits! FCA-FY interaction
