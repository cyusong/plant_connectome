Using subtractive hybridization analysis, the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene from Capsicum annuum was isolated and renamed CaSAMDC. We generated independent transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) lines constitutively expressing a 35S::CaSAMDC construct. Drought tolerance was significantly enhanced in Arabidopsis T4 transgenic homozygous lines as compared to wild-type (WT) plants. The levels of main polyamines (PAs) were more significantly increased in CaSAMDC-overexpressing transgenic plants after 6 h of drought stress as compared to stressed WT plants. Basal transcription of polyamine oxidase (PAO) showed at a much higher level in unstressed-transgenic plants as compared to unstressed WT plants. However, the difference in PAO transcription level between WT and transgenic plants was reduced after drought stress. Cellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly reduced following drought stress in transgenic Arabidopsis plants as compared to WT plants. These results were in agreement with additional observations that stress-induced ROS generation, as determined by qRT-PCR analysis of NADPH oxidase (RbohD and RbohF), was significantly suppressed while transcription of ROS-detoxifying enzymes was notably elevated in transgenic lines in response to drought stress. Further, ROS-induced transcription of the metacaspase II gene was remarkably inhibited in transgenic plants. Collectively, these results suggest that drought stress tolerance due to reduction of ROS production and enhancement of ROS detoxification can be attributed to elevation of PAs.
