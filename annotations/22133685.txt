['22133685', 'The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex which participates in  diverse cellular and developmental processes. CSN1, one of the subunits of CSN,  is essential for assembly of the multiprotein complex via PCI (proteasome, COP9  signalosome and initiation factor 3) domain in the C-terminal half of CSN1.  However, the role of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CSN1, which is critical for  the function of CSN, is not completely understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)  screen, we found that the NTD of CSN1 interacts with TSK-associating protein 1  (TSA1), a reported Ca(2+)-binding protein. The interaction between CSN1 and TSA1  was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in Arabidopsis. tsa1 mutants exhibited a  short hypocotyl phenotype in darkness but were similar to wild-type Arabidopsis  under white light, which suggested that TSA1 might regulate Arabidopsis hypocotyl  development in the dark. Furthermore, the expression of TSA1 was significantly  lower in a csn1 null mutant (fus6), while CSN1 expression did not change in a  tsa1 mutant with weak TSA1 expression. Together, these findings suggest a  functional relationship between TSA1 and CSN1 in seedling development.', '2011 Nov 20', 'J Genet Genomics', '10.1016/j.jgg.2011.08.007', 'Wang']
