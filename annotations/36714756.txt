The seed weight of soybean [<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr.] is one of the major traits that determine soybean yield and is closely related to seed size. However, the genetic basis of the synergistic regulation of traits related to soybean yield is unclear. To understand the molecular genetic basis for the formation of soybean yield traits, the present study focused on QTLs mapping for seed size and weight traits in different environments and target genes mining. A total of 85 QTLs associated with seed size and weight traits were identified using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from Guizao1×B13 (GB13). We also detected 18 environmentally stable QTLs. Of these, <i>qSL-3-1</i> was a novel QTL with a stable main effect associated with seed length. It was detected in all environments, three of which explained more than 10% of phenotypic variance (PV), with a maximum of 15.91%. In addition, <i>qSW-20-3</i> was a novel QTL with a stable main effect associated with seed width, which was identified in four environments. And the amount of phenotypic variance explained (PVE) varied from 9.22 to 21.93%. Five QTL clusters associated with both seed size and seed weight were summarized by QTL cluster identification. Fifteen candidate genes that may be involved in regulating soybean seed size and weight were also screened based on gene function annotation and GO enrichment analysis. The results provide a biologically basic reference for understanding the formation of soybean seed size and weight traits.
