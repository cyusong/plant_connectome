['27513887', 'Several physiological functions have been attributed to class III peroxidases  (PRXs) in plants, but the in planta role of most members of this family still  remains undetermined. Here, we report the first functional characterization of  PRX17 (At2g22420), one of the 73 members of this family in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Localization of PRX17 was examined by transient expression in Nicotiana  benthamiana. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants in A. thaliana were studied.  Regulation at the gene and protein levels was analyzed using beta-glucuronidase  (GUS) activity, quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR, zymography, and  chromatin immunoprecipitation. Phenotypes were characterized including lignin and  xylan contents. PRX17 was expressed in various tissues, including vascular  tissues, and PRX17 was localized to the cell wall. In prx17, the lignin content  was reduced in the stem and siliques and bolting was delayed, while the opposite  phenotype was observed in 35S:PRX17 plants, together with a significant increase  of lignin and xylan immunofluorescence signal. Finally, we demonstrated that the  transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) binds to the PRX17 promoter and  regulates PRX17 expression level. This converging set of structural,  transcriptomic and physiological data suggests that PRX17, under the control of  AGL15, contributes to developmental programs by playing an essential role in  regulating age-dependent lignified tissue formation, including changes in cell  wall properties.', '2017 Jan', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.14127', 'Dunand']
