Plant intracellular NLR proteins detect pathogen effectors and then form multimeric protein complexes ("resistosomes") that activate immune responses and cell death through unknown mechanisms. In this issue of Cell, Bi et al. show that the ZAR1 resistosome exhibits cation channel activity, enabling calcium influx that activates defense mechanisms and culminates in cell death.

NLR proteins: !detect! pathogen effectors 
ZAR1 resistosome: !exhibits! cation channel activity 
cation channel activity: !enables! calcium influx 
calcium influx: !activates! defense mechanisms 
defense mechanisms: !culminate in! cell death
