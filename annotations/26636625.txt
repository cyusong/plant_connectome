Plants have developed highly efficient and remarkable mechanisms to survive under frequent and extreme environmental stress conditions. Exposure of plants to various stress factors is associated with coordinated changes in gene expression at the transcriptional level and hence transcription factors, such as those belonging to the MYB family play a central role in triggering the right responses. MYB transcription factors have been extensively studied in regard of their involvement in the regulation of a number of such stress responses in plants. Genetic and molecular biological studies, primarily in Arabidopsis, have also begun to unravel the role of MYB transcription factors in the epigenetic regulation of stress responses in plants. This review focuses on the role of MYB transcription factors in the regulation of various stress responses in general, highlighting on recent advances in our understanding of the involvement of this class of transcription factors in epigenetic regulation of stress response in plant genome.
