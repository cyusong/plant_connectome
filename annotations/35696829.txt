Geminiviruses are a large group of plant viruses that have been a serious threat to worldwide agriculture. Transcription of the virus-encoded genes is necessary for geminiviruses to complete their life cycle, but the host proteins which directly target geminivirus promoters for suppression of viral gene transcription remain to be identified. Using Beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV) which causes severe plant symptoms as a system, we performed a yeast one-hybrid screening and identified ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), a critical transcription factor in Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling transduction, as an interactor with the viral promoter. Further data showed that an ABA-responsive element in the viral promoter is necessary for its interaction with ABI5 and symptom development. Overexpression of ABI5 suppresses the transcription activity of the viral promoter and BSCTV infection in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis; whilst depletion of ABI5 enhances the infection of BSCTV in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our study uncovered the function of ABI5 in the plant-virus interaction and will provide us with a new strategy to protect crops from geminivirus infection.
