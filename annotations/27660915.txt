The transposase-derived transcription factor genes FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1) have redundant and multifaceted roles in plant growth and development during the vegetative stage, including phytochrome A-mediated far-red light (FR) signaling and circadian clock entrainment. Little is known about their functions in the reproductive stage. We recently demonstrated that FHY3 plays important roles in shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance and floral meristem (FM) determinacy through its target genes CLAVATA3 (CLV3), SEPALLATA1 (SEP1) and SEP2. Here we present data that FHY3 but not its homolog, FAR1, has a distinct role in FM determinacy in a manner independent of its light signaling and circadian pathway functions. Moreover, genome-wide gene expression profiling showed that the homeostasis of the FM is critical for the regulation of FM activity.
