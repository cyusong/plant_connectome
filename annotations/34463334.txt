Zinc is an essential nutrient at low concentrations, but toxic at slightly higher ones. It has been proposed that hyperaccumulator plants may use the excess zinc to fend off pathogens and herbivores. However, there is little evidence of a similar response in other plants. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana leaves inoculated with the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina BMM (PcBMM) accumulate zinc and manganese at the infection site. Zinc accumulation did not occur in a double mutant in the zinc transporters HEAVY METAL ATPASE2 and HEAVY METAL ATPASE4 (HMA2 and HMA4), which has reduced zinc translocation from roots to shoots. Consistent with a role in plant immunity, expression of HMA2 and HMA4 was up-regulated upon PcBMM inoculation, and hma2hma4 mutants were more susceptible to PcBMM infection. This phenotype was rescued upon zinc supplementation. The increased susceptibility to PcBMM infection was not due to the diminished expression of genes involved in the salicylic acid, ethylene, or jasmonate pathways since they were constitutively up-regulated in hma2hma4 plants. Our data indicate a role of zinc in resistance to PcBMM in plants containing ordinary levels of zinc. This layer of immunity runs in parallel to the already characterized defence pathways, and its removal has a direct effect on resistance to pathogens.
