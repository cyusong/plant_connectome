Regulation of gene expression is mediated by diverse RNA binding proteins which play important roles in development and defense processes. Pumilio/FBF (Puf) protein in mammals functions as a posttranscriptional/translational repressor by binding to the 3' UTR regions of its target mRNAs. Previous study reported that APUM5 provides protection against CMV infection by directly binding to CMV RNAs in Arabidopsis. CMV RNAs contain putative Pumilio-binding motifs and APUM5 bound to the 3' UTR and some of its internal motifs both in vitro and in vivo. APUM5 works as a negative regulator of the 3' UTR of CMV and it might regulate CMV replication. Our findings suggest that APUM5 acts as a defensive repressor in plants during CMV infection. However, functions of APUM5 and other APUM members are still not clear and more studies are needed to find out the interacting partners and target mRNAs in host plant.
