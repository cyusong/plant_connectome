['15632053', 'We have characterized the requirements to inhibit the function of the plant  vacuolar sorting receptor BP80 in vivo and gained insight into the crucial role  of receptor recycling between the prevacuolar compartment and the Golgi  apparatus. The drug wortmannin interferes with the BP80-mediated route to the  vacuole and induces hypersecretion of a soluble BP80-ligand. Wortmannin does not  prevent receptor-ligand binding itself but causes BP80 levels to be limiting.  Consequently, overexpression of BP80 partially restores vacuolar cargo transport.  To simulate receptor traffic, we tested a truncated BP80 derivative in which the  entire lumenal domain of BP80 has been replaced by the green fluorescent protein  (GFP). The resulting chimeric protein (GFP-BP80) accumulates in the prevacuolar  compartment as expected, but a soluble GFP fragment can also be detected in  purified vacuoles. Interestingly, GFP-BP80 coexpression interferes with the  correct sorting of a BP80-ligand and causes hypersecretion that is reversible by  expressing a 10-fold excess of full-length BP80. This suggests that GFP-BP80  competes with endogenous BP80 mainly at the retrograde transport route that  rescues receptors from the prevacuolar compartment. Treatment with wortmannin  causes further leakage of GFP-BP80 from the prevacuolar compartment to the  vacuoles, whereas BP80-ligands are secreted. We propose that recycling of the  vacuolar sorting receptor from the prevacuolar compartment to the Golgi apparatus  is an essential process that is saturable and wortmannin sensitive.', '2005 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.026351', 'Denecke']
