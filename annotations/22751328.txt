On the search for sparingly available nutrients, plants may alter their root architecture to improve soil exploration. So far, the examples for root system modifications induced by a heterogeneous availability of nutrients have been reported for the macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P). In an attempt to extend this type of knowledge to other nutrients, we recently provided evidence that Arabidopsis roots are able to sense a local availability of the micronutrient iron (Fe) and to respond with lateral root elongation into the Fe-containing patch. This specific root response was caused by enhanced elongation of cells leaving the root meristem and was dependent on an AUX1-mediated auxin accumulation in the lateral root apices. In this report, we compare mechanisms underlying this response with those known for other nutrients and show that a substantial genotypic variation exists among accessions of A. thaliana in the responsiveness of lateral roots toward localized Fe supplies.

AUX1: !mediates! auxin accumulation
Fe: !induces! lateral root elongation
A. thaliana: !varies in! responsiveness to Fe
