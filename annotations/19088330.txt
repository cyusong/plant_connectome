['19088330', 'Plant freezing tolerance involves the prevention of lethal freeze-induced damage  to the plasma membrane. We hypothesized that plant freezing tolerance involves  membrane resealing, which, in animal cells, is accomplished by calcium-dependent  exocytosis following mechanical disruption of the plasma membrane. In Arabidopsis  thaliana protoplasts, extracellular calcium enhanced not only freezing tolerance  but also tolerance to electroporation, which typically punctures the plasma  membrane. However, calcium did not enhance survival when protoplasts were exposed  to osmotic stress that mimicked freeze-induced dehydration. Calcium-dependent  freezing tolerance was also detected with leaf sections in which ice crystals  intruded into tissues. Interestingly, calcium-dependent freezing tolerance was  inhibited by extracellular addition of an antibody against the cytosolic region  of SYT1, a homolog of synaptotagmin known to be a calcium sensor that initiates  exocytosis. This inhibition indicates that the puncture allowing the antibody to  flow into the cytoplasm occurs during freeze/thawing. Thus, we propose that  calcium-dependent freezing tolerance results from resealing of the punctured  site. Protoplasts or leaf sections isolated from Arabidopsis SYT1-RNA  interference (RNAi) plants lost calcium-dependent freezing tolerance, and intact  SYT1-RNAi plants had lower freezing tolerance than control plants. Taken  together, these findings suggest that calcium-dependent freezing tolerance  results from membrane resealing and that this mechanism involves SYT1 function.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062679', 'Uemura']
