Cytokinin is a phytohormone involved in the regulation of diverse developmental and physiological processes in plants. Its potential in biotechnology and for development of higher-yield and more resilient plants has been recognized, yet the molecular mechanisms behind its action are far from understood. In this report, the roots of barley seedlings were explored as a new source to reveal as yet unknown cytokinin-responsive proteins for crop improvement. Here we found significant differences reproducibly observed for 178 proteins, for which some of the revealed cytokinin-responsive pathways were confirmed in metabolome analysis, including alterations phenylpropanoid pathway, amino acid biosynthesis and ROS metabolism. Bioinformatics analysis indicated a significant overlap between cytokinin response and response to abiotic stress. This was confirmed by comparing proteome and metabolome profiles in response to drought, salinity or a period of temperature stress. The results illustrate complex abiotic stress response in the early development of model crop plant and confirm an extensive crosstalk between plant hormone cytokinin and response to temperature stimuli, water availability or salinity stress.
