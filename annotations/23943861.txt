['23943861', 'Gene expression profiling studies are usually performed on pooled samples grown  under tightly controlled experimental conditions to suppress variability among  individuals and increase experimental reproducibility. In addition, to mask  unwanted residual effects, the samples are often subjected to relatively harsh  treatments that are unrealistic in a natural context. Here, we show that  expression variations among individual wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants  grown under the same macroscopic growth conditions contain as much information on  the underlying gene network structure as expression profiles of pooled plant  samples under controlled experimental perturbations. We advocate the use of  subtle uncontrolled variations in gene expression between individuals to uncover  functional links between genes and unravel regulatory influences. As a case  study, we use this approach to identify ILL6 as a new regulatory component of the  jasmonate response pathway.', '2013 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.112268', 'Maere']
