['17026539', 'In Arabidopsis four root-expressed AMT genes encode functional ammonium  transporters, which raises the question of their role in primary ammonium uptake.  After pre-culturing under nitrogen-deficiency conditions, we quantified the  influx of (15)N-labeled ammonium in T-DNA insertion lines and observed that the  loss of either AMT1;1 or AMT1;3 led to a decrease in the high-affinity ammonium  influx of approximately 30%. Under nitrogen-sufficient conditions the ammonium  influx was lower in Columbia glabra compared with Wassilewskija (WS), and AMT1;1  did not contribute significantly to the ammonium influx in Col-gl. Ectopic  expression of AMT1;3 under the control of a 35S promoter in either of the  insertion lines amt1;3-1 or amt1;1-1 increased the ammonium influx above the  level of their corresponding wild types. In transgenic lines carrying  AMT-promoter-GFP constructs, the promoter activities of AMT1;1 and AMT1;3 were  both upregulated under nitrogen-deficiency conditions and were localized to the  rhizodermis, including root hairs. AMT gene-GFP fusions that were stably  expressed under the control of their own promoters were localized to the plasma  membrane. The double insertion line amt1;1-1amt1;3-1 showed a decreased  sensitivity to the toxic ammonium analog methylammonium and a decrease in the  ammonium influx of up to 70% relative to wild-type plants. These results suggest  an additive contribution of AMT1;1 and AMT1;3 to the overall ammonium uptake  capacity in Arabidopsis roots under nitrogen-deficiency conditions.', '2006 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02887.x', 'von']
