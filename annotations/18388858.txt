['18388858', 'The transcriptional regulator CONSTANS (CO) promotes flowering of Arabidopsis  under long summer days (LDs) but not under short winter days (SDs).  Post-translational regulation of CO is crucial for this response by stabilizing  the protein at the end of a LD, whereas promoting its degradation throughout the  night under LD and SD. We show that mutations in CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1  (COP1), a component of a ubiquitin ligase, cause extreme early flowering under  SDs, and that this is largely dependent on CO activity. Furthermore,  transcription of the CO target gene FT is increased in cop1 mutants and decreased  in plants overexpressing COP1 in phloem companion cells. COP1 and CO interact in  vivo and in vitro through the C-terminal region of CO. COP1 promotes CO  degradation mainly in the dark, so that in cop1 mutants CO protein but not CO  mRNA abundance is dramatically increased during the night. However, in the  morning CO degradation occurs independently of COP1 by a phytochrome B-dependent  mechanism. Thus, COP1 contributes to day length perception by reducing the  abundance of CO during the night and thereby delaying flowering under SDs.', '2008 Apr 23', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2008.68', 'Coupland']
