A strong root system facilitates the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil, to improve the growth of crops. However, to date, there are still very few root development regulatory genes that can be used in crop breeding for agriculture. In this study, we cloned a negative regulator gene of root development, Robust Root System 1 (RRS1), which encodes an R2R3-type MYB family transcription factor. RRS1 knockout plants showed enhanced root growth, including longer root length, longer lateral root length, and larger lateral root density. RRS1 represses root development by directly activating the expression of OsIAA3 which is involved in the auxin signaling pathway. A natural variation in the coding region of RRS1 changes the transcriptional activity of its protein. RRS1<sup>T</sup> allele, originating from wild rice, possibly increases root length by means of weakening regulation of OsIAA3. Knockout of RRS1 enhances drought resistance by promoting water absorption and improving water use efficiency. This study provides a new gene resource for improving root systems and cultivating drought-resistant rice varieties with important values in agricultural applications.
