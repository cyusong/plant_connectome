High-throughput sequencing and yeast one and two-hybrid library screening reveal that DKGA2ox1 and miR171f_3 are involved in the regulation of scion dwarfing with 'Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi' as interstocks. Diospyros kaki Thunb. cv. Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi ('Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi') interstocks play a critical role in the scion dwarfing. However, the understanding of the molecular signaling pathways that regulate the scion dwarfing with 'Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi' as interstocks remain unclear. In this work, the regulatory network in the scion dwarfing with 'Nan-tong-xiao-fang-shi' as interstocks was identified. Using a yeast one-hybrid library screening, luciferase activity analysis, luciferase complementation imaging assays and GFP signal detection, a SPL transcription factor named Diospyros kaki SPL (DKSPL), potentially functioning as a transcriptional activator of the Diospyros kaki GA2ox1 (DKGA2ox1) gene, was identified as a key stimulating factor in the persimmon growth and development. The DKSPL was found in the nucleus, and might play a role in the transcriptional regulation system. A microRNA named miR171f_3 was identified, which might act as a negative regulator of Diospyros kaki SCR (DKSCR) in persimmon. The interactions between DKSCR and seven proteins were experimentally validated with a yeast two-hybrid library screening. Compared to the non-grafted wildtype persimmon, the tissue section of graft union healed well due to the increased expression of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase. These results indicate that DKGA2ox1 and miR171f_3 may co-promote the scion dwarfing by plant hormone signal transduction pathways.
