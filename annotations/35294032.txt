The remobilization of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) reserved in rice (Oryza sativa) sheaths is essential for grain filling. This assimilate distribution between plant tissues and organs is determined by sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1). However, the SnRK1-mediated mechanism regulating the sheath-to-panicle transport of NSCs in rice remains unknown. In this study, leaf cutting treatment was used to accelerate NSC transport in the rice sheaths. Accelerated NSC transport was accompanied by increased levels of OsSnRK1a mRNA expression, SnRK1a protein expression, catalytic subunit phosphorylation of SnRK1, and SnRK1 activity, indicating that SnRK1 activity plays an important role in sheath NSC transport. We also discovered that trehalose-6-phosphate, a signal of sucrose availability, slightly reduced SnRK1 activity in vitro. Since SnRK1 activity is mostly regulated by OsSnRK1a transcription in response to low sucrose content, we constructed an snrk1a mutant to verify the function of SnRK1 in NSC transport. NSCs accumulated in the sheaths of snrk1a mutant plants and resulted in a low seed setting rate and grain weight, verifying that SnRK1 activity is essential for NSC remobilization. Using phosphoproteomics and parallel reaction monitoring, we identified 20 SnRK1-dependent phosphosites that are involved in NSC transport. In addition, the SnRK1-mediated phosphorylation of the phosphosites directly affected starch degradation, sucrose metabolism, phloem transport, sugar transport across the tonoplast, and glycolysis in rice sheaths to promote NSC transport. Therefore, our findings reveal the importance, function, and possible regulatory mechanism of SnRK1 in the sheath-to-panicle transport of NSCs in rice.
