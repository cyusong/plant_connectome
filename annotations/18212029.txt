Much attention has been paid to nitric oxide (NO) research since its discovery as a physiological mediator of plant defence responses. In recent years, newer roles have been attributed to NO, ranging from root development to stomatal closure. The molecular mechanisms underlying NO action in plants are just begun to emerge. The currently available data illustrate that NO can directly influence the activity of target proteins through nitrosylation and has the capacity to act as a Ca2+-mobilizing intracellular messenger. The interplay between NO and Ca2+ has important functional implications, expanding and enriching the possibilities for modulating transduction processes. Furthermore, protein kinases regulated through NO-dependent mechanisms are being discovered, offering fresh perspective on processes such as stress tolerance.
