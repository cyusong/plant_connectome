The key structures and functions of land plants are most often studied in flowering plant models. However, the evolution of these traits (character states) is often difficult to infer, because we lack an accurate phylogenetic frame of reference. The potential branching order of the earliest land plants has now been further condensed, narrowing down potential reference frameworks for comparative studies.
