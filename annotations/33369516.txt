Submergence and waterlogging lead to significant reductions in crop productivity and trigger dramatic changes in gene expression of plant biotic/abiotic stress response. Several of the host factors are involved in low-oxygen stress that is induced by endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. <u>H</u>ypoxia-response <u>u</u>nknown <u>p</u>rotein (HUP) has been found as a host factor of hypoxia screening but HUPs function largely is unknown. In this study, we found the Arabidopsis <i>HUP26</i> gene which was conserved in different plant species and responded to various oxidative stress. <i>HUP26</i> promoter analysis showed GUS activity in root and leaf tissues was significantly responsive to oxidative stress. HUP26-GFP is predominantly located in the cytoplasmic region. <i>HUP26</i> overexpression results in altered enhanced <i>pathogenesis-related gene 1</i> gene expression and reduced ion leakage levels compared with <i>hup26</i> knockout and WT plants after inoculation with <i>Pst</i> DC3000. <i>HUP26</i> overexpression transgenic plants showed improved resistance to <i>Pst</i> DC3000, but <i>hup26</i> knockout plants exhibited increased susceptibility. Collectively, these results indicate that HUP26 plays important role in responses to various oxidative stress and confers biotic stress resistance. Engineering of <i>HUP26</i> gene expression may represent a strategy to enhance biotic stress resistance of crops.
