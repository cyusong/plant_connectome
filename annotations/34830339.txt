Cancer is, globally, one of the main causes of death. Even though various therapies are available, they are still painful because of their adverse side effects. Available treatments frequently fail due to unpromising responses, resistance to classical anticancer drugs, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and low accessibility to tumor tissues. Developing novel strategies to minimize adverse side effects, improve chemotherapy sensitivity, and control cancer progression is needed. Many studies have suggested small dietary molecules as complementary treatments for cancer patients. Different components of herbal/edible plants, known as flavonoids, have recently garnered attention due to their broad biological properties (e.g., antioxidant, antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, anticancer, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective). These flavonoids have shown anticancer activity by affecting different signaling cascades. This article summarizes the key progress made in this area and discusses the role of flavonoids by specifically inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in various cancers.
