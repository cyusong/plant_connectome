['17174261', '2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate kinase/thiamin monophosphate  pyrophosphorylase (HMPPK/TMPPase) is a key enzyme involved in thiamin  biosynthesis. A candidate HMPPK/TMPPase gene identified in the Arabidopsis genome  complemented the thiamin auxotrophy of the th1 mutant, thus proving that the th1  locus corresponds to the structural gene for the HMPPK/TMPPase. Sequence  comparisons between the wild-type HMPPK/TMPPase gene and the th1-201 mutant  allele identified a single point mutation that caused the substitution of a  phenylalanine for a conserved serine residue in the HMPPK domain. Functional  analyses of the mutant HMPPK/TMPPase in Escherichia coli revealed that the amino  acid substitution in the HMPPK domain of mutant enzyme resulted in a  conformational change that severely compromised both activities of the  bifunctional enzyme. Studies were also performed to identify the chloroplast as  the specific subcellular locale of the Arabidopsis HMPPK/TMPPase.', '2007 Mar 1', 'Arch Biochem Biophys', '10.1016/j.abb.2006.11.011', 'Shintani']
