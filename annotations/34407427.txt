['34407427', 'Plants have served as a preeminent study system for photoperiodism due to their  propensity to flower in concordance with the seasons. A nearly singular focus on  understanding photoperiodic flowering has prevented the discovery of other  photoperiod measuring systems necessary for vegetative health. Here, we use  bioinformatics to identify photoperiod-induced genes in Arabidopsis. We show that  one, PP2-A13, is expressed exclusively in, and required for, plant fitness in  short, winter-like photoperiods. We create a real-time photoperiod reporter,  using the PP2-A13 promoter driving luciferase, and show that photoperiodic  regulation is independent of the canonical CO/FT mechanism for photoperiodic  flowering. We then reveal that photosynthesis combines with  circadian-clock-controlled starch production to regulate cellular sucrose levels  to control photoperiodic expression of PP2-A13. This work demonstrates the  existence of a photoperiod measuring system housed in the metabolic network of  plants that functions to control seasonal cellular health.', '2021 Sep 13', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2021.07.016', 'Gendron']
