The membrane-embedded FtsH proteases found in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria are involved in diverse cellular processes including protein quality control and regulation. The genome of the model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp PCC 6803 encodes four FtsH homologs designated FtsH1 to FtsH4. The FtsH3 homolog is present in two hetero-oligomeric complexes: FtsH2/3, which is responsible for photosystem II quality control, and the essential FtsH1/3 complex, which helps maintain Fe homeostasis by regulating the level of the transcription factor Fur. To gain a more comprehensive insight into the physiological roles of FtsH hetero-complexes, we performed genome-wide expression profiling and global proteomic analyses of <i>Synechocystis</i> mutants conditionally depleted of FtsH3 or FtsH1 grown under various nutrient conditions. We show that the lack of FtsH1/3 leads to a drastic reduction in the transcriptional response to nutrient stress of not only Fur but also the Pho, NdhR, and NtcA regulons. In addition, this effect is accompanied by the accumulation of the respective transcription factors. Thus, the FtsH1/3 complex is of critical importance for acclimation to iron, phosphate, carbon, and nitrogen starvation in <i>Synechocystis.</i>plantcell;31/12/2912/FX1F1fx1.
