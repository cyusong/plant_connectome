Radiation frost events, which have become more common in the Mediterranean Basin in recent years, inflict extensive damage to tropical/subtropical fruit crops. During radiation frost, sub-zero temperatures are encountered in the dark, followed by high light during the subsequent clear-sky day. One of the key processes affected by these conditions is photosynthesis, which, when significantly inhibited, leads to the enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage. The use of 'chemical priming' treatments that induce plants' endogenous stress responses is a possible strategy to improve their coping with stress conditions. Herein, we studied the effects of priming with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S), on the response of photosynthesis to overnight frost and day high-light conditions in 'Hass' avocado (Persea americana Mill). We found that priming with a single foliar application of NaHS had positive effects on the response of grafted 'Hass' plants. Primed plants exhibited significantly reduced inhibition of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, a lower accumulation of hydrogen peroxide as well as lower photoinhibition, as compared to untreated plants. The ability to maintain a high CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation capacity after the frost was attained on the background of considerable inhibition in stomatal conductance. Thus, it was likely related to the lower accumulation of ROS and photodamage observed in primed 'Hass' plants. This work contributes toward the understanding of the response of photosynthesis in a subtropical crop species to frost conditions and provides a prospect for chemical priming as a potential practice in orchards during cold winters.
