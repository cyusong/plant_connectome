bZIP transcription factors play a significant role in many aspects of plant growth and development and also play critical regulatory roles during plant responses to various stresses. Overexpression of the Brachypodium bZIP10 (Bradi1g30140) transcription factor conferred enhanced oxidative stress tolerance and increased viability when plants or cells were exposed to the herbicide paraquat. To gain a better understanding of genes involved in bZIP10 conferred oxidative stress tolerance, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) was performed on BdbZIP10 overexpressing plants in the presence of oxidative stress. We identified a transcription factor binding motif, TGDCGACA, different from most known bZIP TF motifs but with strong homology to the Arabidopsis zinc deficiency response element. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated sequences revealed an enrichment of gene ontology groups with metal ion transmembrane transporter, transferase, catalytic and binding activities. Functional categories including kinases and phosphotransferases, cation/ion transmembrane transporters, transferases (phosphorus-containing and glycosyl groups), and some nucleoside/nucleotide binding activities were also enriched. Brachypodium bZIP10 is involved in zinc homeostasis, as it relates to oxidative stress.
