Cell wall thickness (T<sub>cw</sub> ) has been proposed as an important anatomical trait that could determine photosynthesis through land plants' phylogeny, bryophytes being the plant group presenting the thickest walls and the lowest photosynthetic rates. Also, it has recently been suggested that cell wall composition may have the potential to influence both thickness and mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ), representing a novel trait that could ultimately affect photosynthesis. However, only a few studies in spermatophytes have demonstrated this issue. In order to explore the role of cell wall composition in determining both T<sub>cw</sub> and g<sub>m</sub> in mosses, we tested six species grown under field conditions in Antarctica. We performed gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, an anatomical characterization, and a quantitative analysis of cell wall main composition (i.e., cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins) in these six species. We found the photosynthetic rates to vary between the species, and they also presented differences in anatomical characteristics and in cell wall composition. Whilst g<sub>m</sub> correlated negatively with T<sub>cw</sub> and pectins content, a positive relationship between T<sub>cw</sub> and pectins emerged, suggesting that pectins could contribute to determine cell wall porosity. Although our results do not allow us to provide conclusive statements, we suggest for the first time that cell wall composition-with pectins playing a key role-could strongly influence T<sub>cw</sub> and g<sub>m</sub> in Antarctic mosses, ultimately defining photosynthesis.
