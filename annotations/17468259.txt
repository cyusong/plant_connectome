['17468259', 'The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II is phosphorylated during the  transcription cycle by three cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs): CDK7, CDK8, and  CDK9. CDK9 and its interacting cyclin T partners belong to the positive  transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complexes, which phosphorylate the CTD  to promote transcription elongation. We report that Arabidopsis thaliana  CDK9-like proteins, CDKC;1 and CDKC;2, and their interacting cyclin T partners,  CYCT1;4 and CYCT1;5, play important roles in infection with Cauliflower mosaic  virus (CaMV). cdkc;2 and cyct1;5 knockout mutants are highly resistant and cdkc;2  cyct1;5 double mutants are extremely resistant to CaMV. The mutants respond  normally to other types of plant viruses that do not replicate by reverse  transcription. Expression of a reporter gene driven by the CaMV 35S promoter is  markedly reduced in the cdkc;2 and cyct1;5 mutants, indicating that the kinase  complexes are important for transcription from the viral promoter. Loss of  function of CDKC;1/CDKC;2 or CYCT1;4/CYCT1;5 results in complete resistance to  CaMV as well as altered leaf and flower growth, trichome development, and delayed  flowering. These results establish Arabidopsis CDKC kinase complexes as important  host targets of CaMV for transcriptional activation of viral genes and critical  regulators of plant growth and development.', '2007 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.051375', 'Chen']
