The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) stimulates developmental transitions including seed germination, flowering, and the transition from juvenile to adult growth stage. This study provided evidence that GA and the GA receptor <i>GID1</i> (<i>GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1</i>) are also needed for the embryo-to-seedling transition in Arabidopsis. The <i>ga1-3</i> GA biosynthesis mutant fails to germinate unless GA is applied, whereas the <i>gid1abc</i> triple mutant fails to germinate because it cannot perceive endogenous or applied GA. Overexpression of the <i>GID1a, GID1b</i>, and <i>GID1c</i> GA receptors rescued the germination of a small percentage of <i>ga1-3</i> seeds without GA application, and this rescue was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments, after-ripening and cold stratification. While <i>GID1</i> overexpression stimulated <i>ga1-3</i> seed germination, this germination was aberrant suggesting incomplete rescue of the germination process. Cotyledons emerged before the radicle, and the resulting "ghost" seedlings failed to develop a primary root, lost green coloration, and eventually died. The development of <i>ga1-3</i> seedlings overexpressing <i>GID1</i> was rescued by pre-germinative but not post-germinative GA application. Since the <i>gid1abc</i> mutant also exhibited a ghost phenotype after germination was rescued by cutting the seed coat, we concluded that both GA and <i>GID1</i> are needed for the embryo-to-seedling transition prior to emergence from the seed coat.
