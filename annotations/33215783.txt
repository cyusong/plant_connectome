Pollen formation and pollen tube growth are essential for the delivery of male gametes into the female embryo sac for double fertilization. Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the late developmental process of pollen formation and pollen germination. In this study, we characterized a group of Arabidopsis AGC kinase proteins, NDR2/4/5, involved in pollen development and pollen germination. The NDR2/4/5 genes are mainly expressed in pollen grains at the late developmental stages and in pollen tubes. They function redundantly in pollen formation and pollen germination. At the tricellular stages, the ndr2 ndr4 ndr5 mutant pollen grains exhibit an abnormal accumulation of callose, precocious germination and burst in anthers, leading to a drastic reduction in fertilization and a reduced seed set. NDR2/4/5 proteins can interact with another group of proteins (MOB1A/1B) homologous to the MOB proteins from the Hippo signaling pathway in yeast and animals. The Arabidopsis mob1a mob1b mutant pollen grains also have a phenotype similar to that of ndr2 ndr4 ndr5 pollen grains. These results provide new evidence demonstrating that the Hippo signaling components are conserved in plants and play important roles in sexual plant reproduction.
