At the early stage of pollination, the difference in gene expression between compatibility and incompatibility is highly significant about the pollen-specific expression of the LRR gene, resistance, and defensin genes. In Rosaceae, incompatible pollen can penetrate into the style during the gametophytic self-incompatibility response. It is therefore considered a stylar event rather than a stigmatic event. In this study, we explored the differences in gene expression between compatibility and incompatibility in the early stage of pollination. The self-compatible pear variety "Jinzhuili" is a naturally occurring bud mutant from "Yali", a leading Chinese native cultivar exhibiting typical gametophytic self-incompatibility. We collected the styles of 'Yali' and 'Jinzhuili' at 0.5 and 2 h after self-pollination and then performed high-throughput sequencing. According to the KEGG analysis of the differentially expressed genes, several metabolic pathways, such as "Plant hormone signal transduction", "Plant-pathogen interaction", are the main pathways was the most represented pathway. Quantitative PCR was used to validate these differential genes. The expression levels of genes related to pollen growth and disease inhibition, such as LRR (Leucine-rich repeat extensin), resistance, defensin, and auxin, differed significantly between compatible and incompatible pollination. Interestingly, at 0.5 h, most of these genes were upregulated in the compatible pollination system compared with the incompatible pollination system. Calcium transport, which requires ATPase, also demonstrated upregulated expression. In summary, the self-incompatibility reaction was initiated when the pollen land on the stigma.

LRR: !upregulated in! compatible pollination
resistance: !upregulated in! compatible pollination
defensin: !upregulated in! compatible pollination
auxin: !upregulated in! compatible pollination
ATPase: !upregulated in! compatible pollination
