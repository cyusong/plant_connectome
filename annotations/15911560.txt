A highly reproducible regeneration system through somatic embryogenesis from the excised mature embryos (MEs) of dry seeds of a range of European barley cultivars was developed. By minimizing the germination of plated MEs, primary callus could be obtained with high frequency which permitted efficient embryogenesis and regeneration of a large number of green plants. Different approaches were tested to reduce or prevent normal germination: (i) the use of a well defined balance of maltose and 2,4-D in the induction medium, (ii) soaking of seeds in water containing 2,4-D solution, (iii) direct culture of excised embryonic axes, (iv) longitudinally bisected MEs giving two halves, and (v) complete removal of the elongated main shoot including any roots within a week of culture initiation. Culturing of bisected MEs and whole embryonic axes gave the best responses with respect to large amounts of callus combined with minimal germination. The incorporation of BAP at low levels in the medium was found to be most effective for embryogenesis and the maintenance of long-term morphogenic capacity (more than 11 months up to now). This procedure allows the complete regeneration of plants in 16-20 weeks, from the initial isolation of MEs through all the steps to the development of plants ready to be transferred to the soil. The protocol was first developed for cv. Golden Promise and successfully applied to commercial cultivars. All cultivars tested formed embryogenic callus, with overall rates ranging from 22-55% and an average number of green plants per embryogenic callus from 1.5 to 7.5 across the genotypes.
