Plant growth and development are challenged by biotic and abiotic stresses including salinity and heat stresses. For <i>Populus simonii × P. nigra</i> as an important greening and economic tree species in China, increasing soil salinization and global warming have become major environmental challenges. We aim to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying tree tolerance to salt stress and high temprerature (HT) stress conditions. Transcriptomics revealed that a <i>PsnNAC036</i> transcription factor (TF) was significantly induced by salt stress in <i>P. simonii × P. nigra</i>. This study focuses on addressing the biological functions of <i>PsnNAC036</i>. The gene was cloned, and its temporal and spatial expression was analyzed under different stresses. <i>PsnNAC036</i> was significantly upregulated under 150 mM NaCl and 37 °C for 12 h. The result is consistent with the presence of stress responsive <i>cis</i>-elements in the <i>PsnNAC036</i> promoter. Subcellular localization analysis showed that <i>PsnNAC036</i> was targeted to the nucleus. Additionally, <i>PsnNAC036</i> was highly expressed in the leaves and roots. To investigate the core activation region of <i>PsnNAC036</i> protein and its potential regulatory factors and targets, we conducted trans-activation analysis and the result indicates that the C-terminal region of 191-343 amino acids of the <i>PsnNAC036</i> was a potent activation domain. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>PsnNAC036</i> stimulated plant growth and enhanced salinity and HT tolerance. Moreover, 14 stress-related genes upregulated in the transgenic plants under high salt and HT conditions may be potential targets of the <i>PsnNAC036</i>. All the results demonstrate that <i>PsnNAC036</i> plays an important role in salt and HT stress tolerance.
