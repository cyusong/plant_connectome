Reactive oxygen species play a central role in the regulation of plant responses to environmental stress. Under prolonged iron (Fe) deficiency, increased levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) initiate signaling events, resulting in the attenuation of Fe acquisition through the inhibition of FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT). As this H2O2 increase occurs in a FIT-dependent manner, our aim was to understand the processes involved in maintaining H2O2 levels under prolonged Fe deficiency and the role of FIT. We identified the CAT2 gene, encoding one of the three Arabidopsis catalase isoforms, as regulated by FIT. CAT2 loss-of-function plants displayed severe susceptibility to Fe deficiency and greatly increased H2O2 levels in roots. Analysis of the Fe homeostasis transcription cascade revealed that H2O2 influences the gene expression of downstream regulators FIT, BHLH genes of group Ib, and POPEYE (PYE); however, H2O2 did not affect their upstream regulators, such as BHLH104 and ILR3. Our data shows that FIT and CAT2 participate in a regulatory loop between H2O2 and prolonged Fe deficiency.
