Magnesium (Mg) is an essential element for the growth of both plants and bacteria. Low availability of Mg in agriculture can limit crop productivity and quality. In addition to direct effects on plant growth, limited Mg supply may also impact biological dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub> ) fixation in nodules formed from symbiotic interactions between legumes and rhizobial bacteria. To date, the physiological mechanisms involved in Mg-dependent nodulation remains largely unknown. The objectives of this work were to assess how Mg supply affects nodule growth and development in symbiotic systems, and to test if any observed changes in nodule and soybean are correlated with Mg supply. Here, we found that external Mg supply enhanced nodule growth under nitrogen (N) limited conditions, and subsequently improved N<sub>2</sub> fixation and soybean growth. Mg supply altered neither nodule structure nor Mg homeostasis, but remarkably promoted nodule enlargement, resulting in an increase in the number of big nodules. In addition, high Mg supply decreased starch and sucrose accumulation in leaves, and increased their concentrations in roots, which consequently enhanced carbohydrate import into the rhizobia infection zone of nodules. In this study, Mg was shown to promote nodule growth in soybean. This Mg-promoted nodule growth is derived from Mg-facilitated alteration of carbohydrate partitioning and transport into nodules.
