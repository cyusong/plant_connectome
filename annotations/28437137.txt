Ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) is an indispensable plant protein regulated, in part, by ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) which, in turn, is a key regulator of plant responses to stresses and developmental cues. Increased expression of RPS6 was detected in Nicotiana benthamiana during infection by diverse plant viruses. Silencing of the RPS6 and S6K genes in N. benthamiana affected accumulation of Cucumber mosaic virus, Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), and Potato virus A (PVA) in contrast to Turnip crinkle virus and Tobacco mosaic virus. In addition, the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) of TuMV and PVA interacted with S6K in plant cells, as detected by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. The VPg-S6K interaction was detected in cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus, whereas the green fluorescent protein-tagged S6K alone showed cytoplasmic localization only. These results demonstrate that the requirement for RPS6 and S6K differs for diverse plant viruses with different translation initiation strategies and suggest that potyviral VPg-S6K interaction may affect S6K functions in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
