CcBLH6 is a bell-like homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays an important role of lignin biosynthesis in the control of fruit lignification pattern in Camellia chekiangoleosa. The fruit of Camellia chekiangoleosa has a unique lignification pattern that features with a thick pericarp containing a low level of lignification. Yet the fruit lignification pattern and the regulatory network of responsible gene transcription are poorly understood. Here, we characterized a bell-like homeodomain-containing (BLH) transcription factor from C. chekiangoleosa, CcBLH6, in the control of fruit lignification. CcBLH6 expression was highly correlated with the unique lignification pattern during fruit development. The ectopic expression of CcBLH6 promoted the lignification process of stem and root in Arabidopsis. We found that expression of genes related to lignin biosynthesis and its transcriptional regulation was altered in transgenic lines. In a Camellia callus-transformation system, overexpression of CcBLH6 greatly enhanced the expression of genes related to lignin biosynthesis and its transcriptional regulation was altered in transgenic lines. In the callus-transformation system, overexpression of CcBLH6 greatly enhanced the lignification of parenchymal cells, and the regulation of several genes involved in lignin accumulation was largely consistent between Arabidopsis and Camellia. Our study reveals a positive role of CcBLH6 in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis during fruit lignification in Camellia.
