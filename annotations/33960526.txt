Though root architecture modifications may be critically important for improving phosphorus (P) efficiency in crops, the regulatory mechanisms triggering these changes remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that genotypic variation in GmEXPB2 expression is strongly correlated with root elongation and P acquisition efficiency, and enhancing its transcription significantly improves soybean yield in the field. Promoter deletion analysis was performed using 5' truncation fragments (P1-P6) of GmEXPB2 fused with the GUS gene in soybean transgenic hairy roots, which revealed that the P1 segment containing three E-box elements significantly enhances induction of gene expression in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation. Further experimentation demonstrated that GmPTF1, a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is the regulatory factor responsible for the induction of GmEXPB2 expression in response to Pi starvation. In short, Pi starvation induced expression of GmPTF1, with the GmPTF1 product directly binding to the E-box motif in the P1 region of the GmEXPB2 promoter. Plus, both GmPTF1 and GmEXPB2 highly expressed in lateral roots, and were significantly enhanced by P deficiency. Further work with soybean stable transgenic plants through RNA sequencing analysis showed that altering GmPTF1 expression significantly impacted the transcription of a series of cell wall genes, including GmEXPB2, and thereby affected root growth, biomass and P uptake. Taken together, this work identifies a novel regulatory factor, GmPTF1, involved in changing soybean root architecture partially through regulation of the expression of GmEXPB2 by binding the E-box motif in its promoter region.
