['30456348', 'Mammalian Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3-domain-binding proteins (G3BPs) are a  highly conserved family of RNA-binding proteins that link kinase  receptor-mediated signaling to RNA metabolism. Mammalian G3BP1 is a  multifunctional protein that functions in viral immunity. Here, we show that the  Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of human G3BP1 negatively regulates plant immunity.  Arabidopsis g3bp1 mutants showed enhanced resistance to the virulent bacterial  pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Pathogen resistance was mediated in  Atg3bp1 mutants by altered stomatal and apoplastic immunity. Atg3bp1 mutants  restricted pathogen entry into stomates showing insensitivity to bacterial  coronatine-mediated stomatal reopening. AtG3BP1 was identified as a negative  regulator of defense responses, which correlated with moderate up-regulation of  salicylic acid biosynthesis and signaling without growth penalty.', '2018 May', 'Life Sci Alliance', '10.26508/lsa.201800046', 'ORCID:']
