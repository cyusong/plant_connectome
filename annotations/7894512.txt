['7894512', 'Here, a complete study is described of all the genes and isoenzymes for aspartate  aminotransferase (AspAT) present in Arabidopsis thaliana. Four classes of cDNAs  representing four distinct AspAT genes (ASP1-ASP4) have been cloned from  Arabidopsis. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs suggests that the encoded proteins  are targeted to different subcellular compartments. ASP1 encodes a mitochondrial  form of AspAT, ASP3 encodes a chloroplastic/plastidic form of AspAT, whereas ASP2  and ASP4 each encode cytosolic forms of AspAT. Three distinct AspAT holoenzymes  (AAT1-AAT3) were resolved by activity gel analysis. Organelle isolation reveals  that AAT1 is mitochondrial-localized, AAT3 is plastid-localized, and AAT2 is  cytosolic. Gene-specific Northern analysis reveals that each Asp mRNA accumulates  differentially with respect to organ-type. However, the individual Asp mRNAs show  no dramatic fluctuations in response to environmental stimuli such as light.  Southern analysis reveals that four distinct nuclear genes probably represent the  entire AspAT gene family in Arabidopsis. These molecular studies shed light on  the subcellular synthesis of aspartate in Arabidopsis and suggest that some of  the AspAT isoenzymes may play overlapping roles in plant nitrogen metabolism.', '1995 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1995.07010061.x', 'Coruzzi']
