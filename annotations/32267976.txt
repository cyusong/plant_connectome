How plants have shaped Earth surface feedbacks over geologic time is a key question in botanical and geological inquiry. Recent work has suggested that biomes during the Carboniferous Period contained plants with extraordinary physiological capacity to shape their environment, contradicting the previously dominant view that plants only began to actively moderate the Earth's surface with the rise of angiosperms during the Mesozoic Era. A recently published Viewpoint disputes this recent work, thus here, we document in detail, the mechanistic underpinnings of our modeling and illustrate the extraordinary ecophysiological nature of Carboniferous plants.
