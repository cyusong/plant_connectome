Adverse variations of abiotic environmental cues that deviate from an optimal range impose stresses to plants. Abiotic stresses severely impede plant physiology and development. Consequently, such stresses dramatically reduce crop yield and negatively impact on ecosystem stability and composition. Physical components of abiotic stresses can be, for example, suboptimal temperature and osmotic perturbations, while representative chemical facets of abiotic stresses can be toxic ions or suboptimal nutrient availability. The sheer complexity of abiotic stresses causes a multitude of diverse components and mechanisms for their sensing and signal transduction. Ca<sup>2+</sup> , as a versatile second messenger, plays multifaceted roles in almost all abiotic stress responses in that, for a certain abiotic stress, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not only reciprocally connected with its perception, but also multifunctionally ensures subsequent signal transduction. Here, we will focus on salt/osmotic stress and responses to altered nutrient availability as model cases to detail novel insights into the identity of components that link stress perception to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal formation as well as on new insights into mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal implementation. Finally, we will deduce emerging conceptual consequences of these novel insights and outline arising avenues of future research on the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in abiotic stress responses in plants.
