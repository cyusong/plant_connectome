['22426856', 'It is currently held that thiamin is made in chloroplasts and converted in the  cytosol to the active cofactor thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), and that mitochondria  and plastids import ThDP. The organellar transporters that mediate ThDP import in  plants have not been identified. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that two  members of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) in Arabidopsis (At5g48970 and  At3g21390) and two in maize (GRMZM2G118515 and GRMZM2G124911) are related to the  ThDP carriers of animals and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of each of  these plant proteins in a S. cerevisiae ThDP carrier (TPC1) null mutant  complemented the growth defect on fermentable carbon sources and restored the  level of mitochondrial ThDP and the activity of the mitochondrial ThDP-dependent  enzyme acetolactate synthase. The plant proteins were targeted to mitochondria as  judged by dual import assays with purified pea mitochondria and chloroplasts, and  by microscopic analysis of the subcellular localization of green fluorescent  protein fusions in transiently transformed tobacco suspension cells. Both maize  genes were shown to be expressed throughout the plant, which is consistent with  the known ubiquity of mitochondrial ThDP-dependent enzymes. Collectively, these  data establish that plants have mitochondrially located MCF carriers for ThDP,  and indicate that these carriers are highly evolutionarily conserved. Our data  provide a firm basis to propagate the functional annotation of mitochondrial ThDP  carriers to other angiosperm genomes.', '2012 Jun', 'Funct Integr Genomics', '10.1007/s10142-012-0273-4', 'Hanson']
