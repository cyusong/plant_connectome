The signal compound ethylene and its relationships with oxidative burst and cell death were analyzed in cultured tobacco cells treated with the proteinaceous elicitor quercinin. Quercinin belongs to the protein family of elicitins and was isolated from the soil-born oak pathogen Phytophthora quercina. It was shown to induce a dose-dependent oxidative burst in tobacco cell culture in concentrations from 0.05 to 0.5 nM, and subsequently, cell death. The characteristics of quercinin-induced cell death included both membrane damage and DNA fragmentation in tobacco cell culture. At higher quercinin concentrations (2 nM), H(2)O(2) formation and ethylene biosynthesis were inhibited. Ethylene at low concentrations proved to be necessary for induction and maintenance of H(2)O(2) production in tobacco cells treated with quercinin. It was demonstrated that external addition of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis such as alpha-amino-oxy-acetic acid (AOA) and CoCl(2) also decreased or even inhibited the quercinin-induced oxidative burst, but did not influence cell death induction. These results demonstrate evidence for a requirement of the plant hormone ethylene for the onset of the quercinin-induced oxidative burst.
