['27220875', 'Photosystem II is a protein complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of  photosynthetic organisms and performs the light driven water oxidation into  electrons and molecular oxygen that initiate the photosynthetic process. This  important complex is composed of more than two dozen of intrinsic and peripheral  subunits, of those half are low molecular mass proteins. PsbY is one of those low  molecular mass proteins; this 4.7-4.9kDa intrinsic protein seems not to bind any  cofactors. Based on structural data from cyanobacterial and red algal Photosystem  II PsbY is located closely or in direct contact with cytochrome b559. Cytb559  consists of two protein subunits (PsbE and PsbF) ligating a heme-group in-between  them. While the exact function of this component in Photosystem II has not yet  been clarified, a crucial role for assembly and photo-protection in prokaryotic  complexes has been suggested. One unique feature of Cytb559 is its  redox-heterogeneity, forming high, medium and low potential, however, neither  origin nor mechanism are known. To reveal the function of PsbY within Photosystem  II of Arabidopsis we have analysed PsbY knock-out plants and compared them to  wild type and to complemented mutant lines. We show that in the absence of PsbY  protein Cytb559 is only present in its oxidized, low potential form and plants  depleted of PsbY were found to be more susceptible to photoinhibition.', '2016 Sep', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbabio.2016.05.004', 'Schroder']
