['34113372', 'Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are members of the hydroxyproline-rich  glycoprotein (HRGP) superfamily, a group of highly diverse proteoglycans that are  present in the cell wall, plasma membrane as well as secretions of almost all  plants, with important roles in many developmental processes. The role of GALT8  (At1g22015), a Glycosyltransferase-31 (GT31) family member of the  Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database (CAZy), was examined by biochemical  characterization and phenotypic analysis of a galt8 mutant line. To characterize  its catalytic function, GALT8 was heterologously expressed in tobacco leaves and  its enzymatic activity tested. GALT8 was shown to be a  beta-(1,3)-galactosyltransferase (GalT) that catalyzes the synthesis of a  beta-(1,3)-galactan, similar to the in vitro activity of KNS4/UPEX1 (At1g33430), a  homologous GT31 member previously shown to have this activity. Liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) confirmed the products were of  2-6 degree of polymerisation (DP). Previous reporter studies showed that GALT8 is  expressed in the central and synergid cells, from whence the micropylar endosperm  originates after the fertilization of the central cell of the ovule. Homozygous  mutants have multiple seedling phenotypes including significantly shorter  hypocotyls and smaller leaf area compared to wild type (WT) that are attributable  to defects in female gametophyte and/or endosperm development. KNS4/UPEX1 was  shown to partially complement the galt8 mutant phenotypes in genetic  complementation assays suggesting a similar but not identical role compared to  GALT8 in beta-(1,3)-galactan biosynthesis. Taken together, these data add further  evidence of the important roles GT31 beta-(1,3)-GalTs play in elaborating type II  AGs that decorate AGPs and pectins, thereby imparting functional consequences on  plant growth and development.', '2021', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2021.678564', 'Doblin']
