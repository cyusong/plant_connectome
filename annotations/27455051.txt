['27455051', 'Casparian strips are precisely localized and aligned ring-like cell wall  modifications in the root of all higher plants. They set up an extracellular  diffusion barrier analogous to animal tight junctions, and are crucial for  maintaining the homeostatic capacity of plant roots. Casparian strips become  localized because of the formation of a highly stable plasma membrane domain,  consisting of a family of small transmembrane proteins called Casparian strip  membrane domain proteins (CASPs). Here we report a large-scale forward genetic  screen directly visualizing endodermal barrier function, which allowed us to  identify factors required for the formation and integrity of Casparian strips. We  present the identification and characterization of one of the mutants, schengen1  (sgn1), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase that we show localizes in a strictly  polar fashion to the outer plasma membrane of endodermal cells and is required  for the positioning and correct formation of the centrally located CASP domain.', '2016 Jul 25', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/nplants.2016.113', 'Geldner']
