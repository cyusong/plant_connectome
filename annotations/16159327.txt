['16159327', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana mutants de-etiolated3 (det3), pom-pom1 (pom1) and  ectopic lignification1 (eli1) all deposit lignins in cells where these polymers  would not normally be found. Comparison of these mutants provides an opportunity  to determine if the shared mutant phenotype arose by perturbing a common  regulatory mechanism in each of the mutants. The mutants were compared using a  combination of genetics, histochemistry, chemical profiling, transcript profiling  using both Northern blots and microarrays, and bioinformatics. The subset of  cells that ectopically lignified was shared between all three mutants, but clear  differences in cell wall chemistry were evident between the mutants. Northern  blot analysis of lignin biosynthetic genes over diurnal and circadian cycles  revealed that transcript abundance of several key genes was clearly altered in  all three mutants. Microarray analysis suggests that changes in the expression of  specific members of the R2R3-MYB and Dof transcription factor families may  contribute to the ectopic lignification phenotypes. This comparative analysis  provides a suite of hypotheses that can be tested to examine the control of  lignin biosynthesis.', '2005 Oct', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01496.x', 'Campbell']
