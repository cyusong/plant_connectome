['29497438', 'The ERA (E. coli RAS-like protein)-related GTPase (ERG) is a nuclear-encoded  GTPase with two conserved domains: a GTPase domain and a K Homology (KH) domain.  ERG plays a vital role in early seed development in Antirrhinum majus. However,  the mechanism that regulates seed development remains unclear. Blasting the  genome sequence revealed two homologies of ERG, AtERG1, and AtERG2 in  Arabidopsis. In this study, we found that AtERG2 is localized in the mitochondria  and binds mitochondrial 18S RNA. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that  AtERG2 was mainly expressed in the leaf vein, trichome, and ovule. The T-DNA  insertion lines of AtERG2 showed silique shortage, early seed abortion, and  sporophytic maternal effects (SME), in which some seeds arrested in the zygotic  stage at 1.5 days after pollination (DAP) and aborted at 2.0 DAP in aterg2-1 +/-.  We further showed that the ovules of these arrested seeds presented unusual  tissue degradation inside the embryo sacs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)  accumulated at 1.0 and 1.5 DAP in the arrested seeds, and the transcription of  several ROS-responsive genes, WRKY40, ANAC017, and AOX1a, was up-regulated in the  aterg2-1 +/- arrested seeds at 1.5 and 2.0 DAP, but not in wild-type (WT) and  aterg2-1 +/- developed seeds. The cell death-related gene BAG6 was also  transcriptionally activated in aterg2-1 +/- seeds arrested at 2.0 DAP.  Additionally, the protein level of mitochondria protein ATPase Subunit 6 was  lower in 2-DAP siliques of aterg2-1 +/- than it was in those of WT. These results  suggested that AtERG2 promotes early seed development by affecting the maturation  of the mitochondria ribosome small subunit and mitochondrial protein translation  in Arabidopsis.', '2018', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2018.00182', 'Han']
