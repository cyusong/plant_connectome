The ABC model in flower development represents a milestone of plant developmental studies and is essentially conserved across a wide range of angiosperm species. Despite this overall conservation, individual genes in the ABC model are not necessarily conserved and sometimes play a species-specific role, depending on the plant. We previously reported that carpels are specified by the YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) in rice (Oryza sativa), which bears flowers that are distinct from those of eudicots. In contrast, another group reported that carpels are specified by two class C genes, OsMADS3 and OsMADS58. Here, we have addressed this controversial issue by phenotypic characterization of floral homeotic gene mutants. Analysis of a complete loss-of-function mutant of OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 revealed that carpel-like organs expressing DL were formed in the absence of the two class C genes. Furthermore, no known flower organs including carpels were specified in a double mutant of DL and SUPERWOMAN1 (a class B gene), which expresses only class C genes in whorls 3 and 4. These results suggest that, in contrast to Arabidopsis, class C genes are not a key regulator for carpel specification in rice. Instead, they seem to be involved in the elaboration of carpel morphology rather than its specification. Our phenotypic analysis also revealed that, similar to its Arabidopsis ortholog CRABS CLAW, DL plays an important function in regulating flower meristem determinacy in addition to carpel specification.

DL: !specifies! carpels 
OsMADS3/OsMADS58: !elaborate! carpel morphology 
DL: !regulates! flower meristem determinacy
