The foliar application of Nod factor [Nod Bj V (C(18:1), MeFuc)] enhanced (P<0.05) the photosynthetic rate of corn; the increases were 36%, 23% and 12% for 10(-6), 10(-8) and 10(-10)M treated plants, respectively. Similarly, lumichrome at 10(-5) and 10(-6)M stimulated the photosynthetic rate of corn plants 1 and 2 days after application. Lumichrome (10(-5) and 10(-6)M) also increased the photosynthetic rates of soybean plants 3 days after treatment. Foliar applications of LCO (10(-6)M) to corn and soybean and of lumichrome (10(-5)M) to soybean increased leaf area, shoot dry mass and total dry mass relative to control plants. However, lumichrome treatments did not affect any growth variable of corn. Results of this study indicate that this signal compound can enhance the photosynthetic rate and growth of plants.
