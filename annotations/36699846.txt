Fluxes are the ultimate phenotype of metabolism and their accurate quantification is fundamental to any understanding of metabolic networks. Steady state metabolic flux analysis has been the method of choice for quantifying fluxes in heterotrophic cells, but it is unable to measure fluxes during short-lived metabolic states, such as a transient oxidative load. Isotopically non-stationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) can be performed over shorter timescales (minutes - hours) and might overcome this limitation. INST-MFA has recently been applied to photosynthesising leaves, but agriculturally important tissues such as roots and storage organs, or plants during the night are heterotrophic. Here we outline the application of INST-MFA to heterotrophic plant cells. Using INST-MFA we were able to identify changes in the fluxes supported by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme under oxidative load, highlighting the potential of INST-MFA to measure fluxes during short-lived metabolic states. We discuss the challenges in applying INST-MFA, and highlight further development required before it can be routinely used to quantify fluxes in heterotrophic plant cells.
