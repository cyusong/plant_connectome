The balance between the capacities of RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) carboxylation (V(cmax)) and RuBP regeneration (expressed as the maximum electron transport rate, J(max)) determines the CO(2) dependence of the photosynthetic rate. As it has been suggested that this balance changes depending on the growth temperature, the hypothesis that the seasonal change in air temperature affects the balance and modulates the CO(2) response of photosynthesis was tested. V(cmax) and J(max) were determined in summer and autumn for young and old leaves of Polygonum cuspidatum grown at two CO(2) concentrations (370 and 700 micromol mol(-1)). Elevated CO(2) concentration tended to reduce both V(cmax) and J(max) without changing the J(max):V(cmax) ratio. The seasonal environment, on the other hand, altered the ratio such that the J(max):V(cmax) ratio was higher in autumn leaves than summer leaves. This alternation made the photosynthetic rate more dependent on CO(2) concentration in autumn. Therefore, when photosynthetic rates were compared at growth CO(2) concentration, the stimulation in photosynthetic rate was higher in young-autumn than in young-summer leaves. In old-autumn leaves, the stimulation of photosynthesis brought by a change in the J(max):V(cmax) ratio was partly offset by accelerated leaf senescence under elevated CO(2). Across the two seasons and the two CO(2) concentrations, V(cmax) was strongly correlated with Rubisco and J(max) with cytochrome f content. These results suggest that seasonal change in climate affects the relative amounts of photosynthetic proteins, which in turn affect the CO(2) response of photosynthesis.
