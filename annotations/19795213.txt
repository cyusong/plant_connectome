['19795213', 'Eighteen genes that encode the proteins with highly conserved Domain of Unknown  Function 724 (DUF724) and Agenet domains were identified in plant taxa but not in  animals and fungi. They are actively expressed in many different plant tissues,  implying that they may play important roles in plants. Here we report the  characterization of their structural organizations, expression patterns and  protein-protein interactions. In Arabidopsis, the DUF724 genes were expressed in  roots, leaves, shoot apical meristems, anthers and pollen grains. At least seven  of the ten Arabidopsis DUF724 proteins (AtDuf1 to AtDuf10) were localized in  nucleus. Three of them (AtDuf3, AtDuf5 and AtDuf7) may form homodimers or  homopolymers, but did not interact with other members of the same family.  Together with the significant similarity between DUF724 proteins and FMRP in the  fundamental and characteristic molecular architecture, the results implies the  DUF724 gene family may be involved in the polar growth of plant cells via  transportation of RNAs.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-009-9551-5', 'Ye']
