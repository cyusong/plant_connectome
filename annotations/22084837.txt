In plants and animals, the SCF-type ubiquitin protein ligases play an important role in many different physiological processes by regulating protein stability such as S-RNase-based self-compatibility, flower development, hormone responses and meiosis. This study identified an SlFbf gene in tomato that encodes 381 amino acid residues containing a typical F-box motif and an FBA_1 motif associated proteasome pathway; the transcripts of SlFbf was detected in all the tissues (root, stem, leaf, sepal, petal, stamen, pistil, green fruit, breaker fruit and red fruit), with the highest in stamen specifically during flowering stage; SlFbf responded to gibberellins, abscisic acid and light. Suppressed SlFbf leads to bigger pollen and less seeds showing that SlFbf might have an effect on fertilization through regulating stamen development. These findings provide more information about the functions of Fbf gene family.
