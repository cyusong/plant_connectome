['12943542', 'Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyses the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA,  forming malonyl-CoA, which is used in the plastid for fatty acid synthesis and in  the cytosol in various biosynthetic pathways including fatty acid elongation. In  Arabidopsis thaliana, ACC1 and ACC2, two genes located in a tandem repeat within  a 25-kbp genomic region near the centromere of chromosome 1, encode two  multifunctional ACCase isoforms. Both genes, ACC1 and ACC2, appear to be  ubiquitously expressed, but little is known about their respective function and  importance. Here, we report the isolation and characterisation of two allelic  mutants disrupted in the ACC1 gene. Both acc1-1 and acc1-2 mutations are  recessive and embryo lethal. Embryo morphogenesis is impaired and both alleles  lead to cucumber-like structures lacking in cotyledons, while the shortened  hypocotyl and root exhibit a normal radial pattern organisation of the body axis.  In this abnormal embryo, the maturation process still occurs. Storage proteins  accumulate normally, while triacylglycerides (TAG) are synthesised at a lower  concentration than in the wild-type seed. However, these TAG are totally devoid  of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and consequently enriched in C18:1, like  all lipid fractions analysed in the mutant seed. These data demonstrate, in  planta, the role of ACCase 1 in VLCFA elongation. Furthermore, this  multifunctional enzyme also plays an unexpected and central function in embryo  morphogenesis, especially in apical meristem development.', '2003 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.016010.x', 'Rochat']
