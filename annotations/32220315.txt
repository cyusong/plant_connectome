['32220315', 'The circadian clock modulates immune responses in plants and animals; however, it  is unclear how host-pathogen interactions affect the clock. Here we analyzed  clock function in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defective immune responses  and found that enhanced disease susceptibility 4 (eds4) displays alterations in  several circadian rhythms. Mapping by sequencing revealed that EDS4 encodes the  ortholog of NUCLEOPORIN 205, a core component of the inner ring of the nuclear  pore complex (NPC). Consistent with the idea that the NPC specifically modulates  clock function, we found a strong enrichment in core clock genes, as well as an  increased nuclear to total mRNA accumulation, among genes that were  differentially expressed in eds4 mutants. Interestingly, infection with  Pseudomonas syringae in wild-type (WT) plants downregulated the expression of  several morning core clock genes as early as 1 h post-infection, including all  members of the NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED (LNK) gene family, and  this effect was attenuated in eds4. Furthermore, lnk mutants were more  susceptible than the WT to P. syringae infection. These results indicate that  bacterial infection, acting in part through the NPC, alters core clock gene  expression and/or mRNA accumulation in a way that favors bacterial growth and  disease susceptibility.', '2020 May 4', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.058', 'Yanovsky']
