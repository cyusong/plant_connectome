['19244141', 'In common with a range of environmental and biological stresses, heat shock  results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and a collection of downstream  consequences for cellular homeostasis and growth. Within this complex array of  responses, the sensing of and responses to misfolded proteins in specific  subcellular compartments involves specific chaperones, transcriptional  regulators, and expression profiles. Using biological (ectopic protein expression  and virus infection) and chemical triggers for misfolded protein accumulation, we  have profiled the transcriptional features of the response to misfolded protein  accumulation in the cytosol (i.e., the cytoplasmic protein response [CPR]) and  identified the effects as a subcomponent of the wider effects induced by heat  shock. The CPR in Arabidopsis thaliana is associated with the heat shock promoter  element and the involvement of specific heat shock factors (HSFs), notably HSFA2,  which appears to be regulated by alternative splicing and non-sense-mediated  decay. Characterization of Arabidopsis HSFA2 knockout and overexpression lines  showed that HSFA2 is one of the regulatory components of the CPR.', '2009 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062596', 'Maule']
