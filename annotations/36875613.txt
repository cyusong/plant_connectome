Low temperature and overcast rain are harmful to directly seeding early rice, it can hinder rice growth and lower rice biomass during the seedling stage, which in turn lowers rice yield. Farmers usually use N to help rice recuperate after stress and minimize losses. However, the effect of N application on the growth recovery for rice seedlings after such low temperature stress and its associated physiological changes remain unclearly. Two temperature settings and four post-stress N application levels were used in a bucket experiment to compare B116 (strong growth recovery after stress) with B144 (weak growth recovery). The results showed that the stress (average daily temperature at 12°C for 4 days) inhibited the growth of rice seedlings. Compared to the zero N group, the N application group's seedling height, fresh weight and dry weight significantly increased after 12 days. In particular, the increases in all three growth indicators were relatively higher than that of N application at normal temperature, indicating the importance of N application to rice seedlings after low temperature stress. The antioxidant enzyme activity of rice seedlings increased significantly after N application, which reduced the damaging effect of ROS (reactive oxygen species) to rice seedlings. At the same time, the soluble protein content of seedlings showed a slow decrease, while the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA (malondialdehyde) content decreased significantly. Nitrogen could also promote nitrogen uptake and utilization by increasing the expression of genes related to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow> <mn>4</mn> <mo>+</mo></msubsup> </mrow> </math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </mrow> </math> uptake and transport, as well as improving the activity of NR (nitrate reductase) and GS (glutamine synthetase) in rice. N could affect GA<sub>3</sub> (gibberellin A3) and ABA (abscisic acid) levels by regulating the anabolism of GA<sub>3</sub> and ABA. The N application group maintained high ABA levels as well as low GA<sub>3</sub> levels from day 0 to day 6, and high GA<sub>3</sub> levels as well as low ABA levels from day 6 to day 12. The two rice varieties showed obvious characteristics of accelerated growth recovery and positive physiological changes by nitrogen application after stress, while B116 generally showed more obvious growth recovery and stronger growth-related physiological reaction than that of B144. The N application of 40 kg hm<sup>-2</sup> was more conducive to the rapid recovery of rice growth after stress. The above results indicated that appropriate N application promoted rice seedling growth recovery after low temperature stress mainly by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and nitrogen metabolizing enzymes as well as regulating the levels of GA<sub>3</sub> and ABA. The results of this study will provide a reference for the regulation of N on the recovery of rice seedling growth after low temperature and weak light stress.
