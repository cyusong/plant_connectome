['33007532', 'We investigated the role of AtbZIP62, an uncharacterized Arabidopsis bZIP TF, in  oxidative, nitro-oxidative and drought stress conditions using reverse genetics  approach. We further monitored the expression of AtPYD1 gene (orthologous to rice  OsDHODH1 involved in the pyrimidine biosynthesis) in atbzip62 knock-out (KO)  plants in order to investigate the transcriptional interplay of AtbZIP62 and  AtPYD1. The atbzip62 KO plants showed significant increase in shoot length under  oxidative stress, while no significant difference was recorded for root length  compared to WT. However, under nitro-oxidative stress conditions, atbzip62 showed  differential response to both NO-donors. Further characterization of AtbZIP62  under drought conditions showed that both atbzip62 and atpyd1-2 showed a  sensitive phenotype to drought stress, and could not recover after re-watering.  Transcript accumulation of AtbZIP62 and AtPYD1 showed that both were highly  up-regulated by drought stress in wild type (WT) plants. Interestingly, AtPYD1  transcriptional level significantly decreased in atbzip62 exposed to drought  stress. However, AtbZIP62 expression was highly induced in atpyd1-2 under the  same conditions. Both AtbZIP62 and AtPYD1 were up-regulated in atnced3 and atcat2  while showing a contrasting expression pattern in atgsnor1-3. The recorded  increase in CAT, POD, and PPO-like activities, the accumulation of chlorophylls  and total carotenoids, and the enhanced proline and malondialdehyde levels would  explain the sensitivity level of atbzip62 towards drought stress. All results  collectively suggest that AtbZIP62 could be involved in AtPYD1 transcriptional  regulation while modulating cellular redox state and photosynthetic processes. In  addition, AtbZIP62 is suggested to positively regulate drought stress response in  Arabidopsis.', '2020 Nov', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.09.013', 'Yun']
