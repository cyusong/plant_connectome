Cross-protection triggered by a mild strain of virus acts as a prophylaxis to prevent subsequent infections by related viruses in plants; however, the underling mechanisms are not fully understood. Through mutagenesis, we isolated a mutant strain of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), named Tu-GK, that contains an Arg182Lys substitution in helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro(K)) that confers complete cross-protection against infection by a severe strain of TuMV in Nicotiana benthamiana, Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, and the Arabidopsis dcl2-4/dcl4-1 double mutant defective in DICER-like ribonuclease (DCL)2/DCL4-mediated silencing. Our analyses showed that HC-Pro(K) loses the ability to interfere with microRNA pathways, although it retains a partial capability for RNA silencing suppression triggered by DCL. We further showed that Tu-GK infection triggers strong salicylic acid (SA)-dependent and SA-independent innate immunity responses. Our data suggest that DCL2/4-dependent and -independent RNA silencing pathways are involved, and may crosstalk with basal innate immunity pathways, in host defense and in cross-protection.
