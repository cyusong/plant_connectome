<i>Phytophthora infestans</i> is a devastating pathogen causing potato late blight (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>). Here we report the sequencing, assembly and genome annotation for two <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> isolates sampled in Republic of Korea. Genome sequencing was carried out using long read (Oxford Nanopore) and short read (Illumina Nextseq) sequencing technologies that significantly improved the contiguity and quality of <i>P. infestans</i> genome assembly. Our resources would help researchers better understand the molecular mechanisms by which <i>P. infestans</i> causes late blight disease in the future.
