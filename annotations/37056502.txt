The plant phyllosphere is colonized by microbial communities that can influence the fitness and growth of their host, including the host's resilience to plant pathogens.There are multiple factors involved in shaping the assemblages of bacterial and fungal endophytes within the phyllosphere, including host genetics and environment. In this work, the role of host genetics in plant-microbiome assembly was studied in a full-sibling family of apple (Malus x domestica) trees infected with the fungal pathogen Neonectria ditissima. A Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis showed that there are multiple loci which influence the abundance of individual endophytic taxa, with the majority of QTL having a moderate to large effect (20-40%) on endophyte abundance. QTL regions on LG 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 were shown to affect multiple taxa. Only a small proportion of the variation in overall taxonomic composition was affected by host genotype, with significant QTL hits for principal components explaining <8% and <7.4% of the total variance in bacterial and fungal composition, respectively. Four of the identified QTL colocalised with previously identified regions associated with tolerance to Neonectria ditissima. These results suggest that there is a genetic basis shaping apple endophyte composition and that microbe-host associations in apple could be tailored through breeding.
