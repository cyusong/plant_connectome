Rye 6R-derived stripe rust resistance gene <i>Yr83</i> in wheat background was physically mapped to fraction length (FL) 0.87-1.00 on the long arm by non-denaturing-fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (ND-FISH), Oligo-FISH painting and 6R-specific PCR markers.Stripe rust resistance gene <i>Yr83</i> derived from chromosome 6R of rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>) "Merced" has displayed high resistance to both Australian and Chinese wheat stripe rust isolates. With the aim to physically map <i>Yr83</i> to a more precise region, new wheat- 6R deletion and translocation lines were produced from derived progenies of the 6R(6D) substitution line. The non-denaturing fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (ND-FISH) patterns of 6R were established to precisely characterize the variations of 6R in different wheat backgrounds. Comparative ND-FISH analysis localized the breakpoints of 6RL chromosomes relative to Oligo-pSc200 and Oligo-pSc119.2 rich sites in deletion lines. Molecular marker and resistance analyses confirmed that <i>Yr83</i> is physically located at the fraction length (FL) 0.87-1.00 of 6RL and covers the corresponding region of 806-881 Mb in the reference genome of Lo7. Oligo-FISH painting demonstrated that the region carrying <i>Yr83</i> is syntenic to the distal end of long arm of homoeologous group 7 of the Triticeae genome. The developed wheat-6R lines carrying the <i>Yr83</i> gene will be useful for breeding for rust resistance.
