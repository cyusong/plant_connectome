['31328223', 'Prevailing evidence indicates that abscisic acid (ABA) negatively influences  immunity to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea in most but not all cases. ABA  is required for cuticle biosynthesis, and cuticle permeability enhances immunity  to Botrytis via unknown mechanisms. This complex web of responses obscures the  role of ABA in Botrytis immunity. Here, we addressed the relationships between  ABA sensitivity, cuticle permeability, and Botrytis immunity in the Arabidopsis  thaliana ABA-hypersensitive mutants protein phosphatase2c quadruple mutant  (pp2c-q) and enhanced response to aba1 (era1-2). Neither pp2c-q nor era1-2  exhibited phenotypes predicted by the known roles of ABA; conversely, era1-2 had  a permeable cuticle and was Botrytis resistant. We employed RNA-seq analysis in  cuticle-permeable mutants of differing ABA sensitivities and identified a core  set of constitutively activated genes involved in Botrytis immunity and  susceptibility to biotrophs, independent of ABA signaling. Furthermore, botrytis  susceptible1 (bos1), a mutant with deregulated cell death and enhanced ABA  sensitivity, suppressed the Botrytis immunity of cuticle permeable mutants, and  this effect was linearly correlated with the extent of spread of wound-induced  cell death in bos1. Overall, our data demonstrate that Botrytis immunity  conferred by cuticle permeability can be genetically uncoupled from  PP2C-regulated ABA sensitivity, but requires negative regulation of a parallel  ABA-dependent cell-death pathway.', '2019 Oct 24', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erz345', 'Overmyer']
