Phosphorylation dynamics of LHCSR3 were investigated in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by quantitative proteomics and genetic engineering. LHCSR3 protein expression and phosphorylation were induced in high light. Our data revealed synergistic and dynamic N-terminal LHCSR3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated LHCSR3 associated with PSII-LHCII supercomplexes. The phosphorylation status of LHCB4 was closely linked to the phosphorylation of multiple sites at the N-terminus of LHCSR3, indicating that LHCSR3 phosphorylation may operate as a molecular switch modulating LHCB4 phosphorylation, which in turn is important for PSII-LHCII disassembly. Notably, LHCSR3 phosphorylation diminished under prolonged high light, which coincided with onset of CEF. Hierarchical clustering of significantly altered proteins revealed similar expression profiles of LHCSR3, CRX, and FNR. This finding indicated the existence of a functional link between LHCSR3 protein abundance and phosphorylation, photosynthetic electron flow, and the oxidative stress response.
