Arabidopsis thaliana plants that lack ceramide kinase, encoded by ACCELERATED CELL DEATH5 (ACD5), display spontaneous programmed cell death late in development and accumulate substrates of ACD5. Here, we compared ceramide accumulation kinetics, defense responses, ultrastructural features, and sites of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in wild-type and acd5 plants during development and/or Botrytis cinerea infection. Quantitative sphingolipid profiling indicated that ceramide accumulation in acd5 paralleled the appearance of spontaneous cell death, and it was accompanied by autophagy and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Plants lacking ACD5 differed significantly from the wild type in their responses to B. cinerea, showing earlier and higher increases in ceramides, greater disease, smaller cell wall appositions (papillae), reduced callose deposition and apoplastic ROS, and increased mitochondrial ROS. Together, these data show that ceramide kinase greatly affects sphingolipid metabolism and the site of ROS accumulation during development and infection, which likely explains the developmental and infection-related cell death phenotypes. The acd5 plants also showed an early defect in restricting B. cinerea germination and growth, which occurred prior to the onset of cell death. This early defect in B. cinerea restriction in acd5 points to a role for ceramide phosphate and/or the balance of ceramides in mediating early antifungal responses that are independent of cell death.
