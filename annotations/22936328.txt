Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRLKs) are class of membrane proteins found in higher plants that are involved in diverse functions ranging from plant growth and development to stress tolerance. The basic structure of LecRLK protein comprises of a lectin and a kinase domain, which are interconnected by transmembrane region. Here we have identified LecRLKs from Arabidopsis and rice and studied these proteins on the basis of their expression profile and phylogenies. We were able to identify 32 G-type, 42 L-type and 1 C-type LecRLKs from Arabidopsis and 72 L-type, 100 G-type and 1 C-type LecRLKs from rice on the basis of their annotation and presence of lectin as well kinase domains. The whole family is rather intron-less. We have sub-grouped the gene family on the basis of their phylogram. Although on the basis of sequence the members of each group are closely associated but their functions vary to a great extent. The interacting partners and coexpression data of the genes revealed the importance of gene family in physiology and stress related responses. An in-depth analysis on gene-expression suggested clear demarcation in roles assigned to each gene. To gain additional knowledge about the LecRLK gene family, we searched for previously unreported motifs and checked their importance structurally on the basis of homology modelling. The analysis revealed that the gene family has important roles in diverse functions in plants, both in the developmental stages and in stress conditions. This study thus opens the possibility to explore the roles that LecRLKs might play in life of a plant.
