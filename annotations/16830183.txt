We have developed a novel 'electronic barcode' system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, cell phones, and portable computers to link phenotypic, environmental, and genomic data. We describe a secure, inexpensive system to record and retrieve data from plant samples. It utilizes RFID tags, computers, PDAs, and cell phones to link, record, and retrieve positional, and functional genomic data. Our results suggest that RFID tags can be used in functional genomic screens to record information that is involved in plant development or disease.

RFID tags: !link! phenotypic, environmental, and genomic data
RFID tags: !record! positional and functional genomic data
Computers/PDAs/Cell phones: !retrieve! positional and functional genomic data
Functional genomic screens: !utilize! RFID tags
