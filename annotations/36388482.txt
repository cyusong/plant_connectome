<i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i> (<i>Xcc</i>) is a vascular bacteria pathogen causing black rot in cabbage. Here, the resistance mechanisms of cabbage against <i>Xcc</i> infection were explored by integrated metabolome and transcriptome analysis. Pathogen perception, hormone metabolisms, sugar metabolisms, and phenylpropanoid metabolisms in cabbage were systemically re-programmed at both transcriptional and metabolic levels after <i>Xcc</i> infection. Notably, the salicylic acid (SA) metabolism pathway was highly enriched in resistant lines following <i>Xcc</i> infection, indicating that the SA metabolism pathway may positively regulate the resistance of <i>Xcc</i>. Moreover, we also validated our hypothesis by showing that the flavonoid pathway metabolites chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid could effectively inhibit the growth of <i>Xcc</i>. These findings provide valuable insights and resource datasets for further exploring <i>Xcc</i>-cabbage interactions and help uncover molecular breeding targets for black rot-resistant varieties in cabbage.
