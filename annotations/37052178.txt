Plant water uptake is determined by the root system architecture and its hydraulic capacity, which together define the root hydraulic architecture. The current research aims at understanding the water uptake capacities of maize (Zea mays), a model organism and major crop. We explored the genetic variations within a collection of 224 maize inbred Dent lines and successively defined core genotype subsets to access multiple architectural, anatomical, and hydraulic parameters in the primary root (PR) and seminal roots (SR) of hydroponically grown seedlings. We found 9-fold, 3.5-fold and 12.4-fold genotypic differences for root hydraulics (Lpr), PR size, and lateral root (LR) size, respectively, that shaped wide and independent variations of root structure and function. Within genotypes, PR and SR showed similarities in hydraulics and, to a lesser extent, in anatomy. They had comparable aquaporin activity profiles that, however, could not be explained by aquaporin expression levels. Genotypic variations in the size and number of late meta xylem vessels were positively correlated with Lpr. Inverse modeling further revealed dramatic genotypic differences in the xylem conductance profile. Thus, tremendous natural variation of maize root hydraulic architecture underlies a high diversity of water uptake strategies and paves the way to quantitative genetic dissection of its elementary traits.
