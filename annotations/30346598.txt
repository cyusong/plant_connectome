The Arabidopsis thaliana gain-of-function T-DNA insertion mutant jaw-1D produces miR319A, a microRNA that represses genes encoding CIN-like TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORs (TCPs), a family of transcription factors that play key roles in leaf morphogenesis. In this study, we show that jaw-1D is responsive to paramutation-like epigenetic silencing. A genetic cross of jaw-1D with the polycomb gene mutant curly leaf-29 (clf-29) leads to attenuation of the jaw-1D mutant plant phenotype. This induced mutation, jaw-1D*, was associated with down-regulation of miR319A, was heritable independently from clf-29, and displayed paramutation-like non-Mendelian inheritance. Down-regulation of miR319A in jaw-1D* was linked to elevated levels of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation and DNA methylation at the CaMV35S enhancer located within the activation-tagging T-DNA of the jaw-1D locus. Examination of 21 independent T-DNA insertion mutant lines revealed that 11 could attenuate the jaw-1D mutant phenotype in a similar way to the paramutation induced by clf-29. These paramutagenic mutant lines shared the common feature that their T-DNA insertion was present as multi-copy tandem repeats and contained high levels of CG and CHG methylation. Our results provide important insights into paramutation-like epigenetic silencing, and caution against the use of jaw-1D in genetic interaction studies.
