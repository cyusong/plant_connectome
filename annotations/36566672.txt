Blue light can regulate the photomorphogenesis of plants through blue light receptors to influence seedling growth and development. The COP9 signaling complex (CSN), a vital regulator of photomorphogenesis, is a highly conserved protein complex. CSN1 is the largest and most critical subunit in the CSN with a complex N-terminal function that supports most of the functions of CSN1 and is mainly involved in plant growth and development processes. The CSN is also required in the blue light-mediated photomorphogenesis response of seedlings. In this study, the OsCSN1 subunit of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (rice) was edited and screened, and OsCSN1 deletion mutant, OsCSN1 weak expression mutant and OsCSN1 overexpression mutant were constructed. The mechanism of OsCSN1 and its N-terminal effects on rice seedling growth and development under blue light conditions were investigated. The addition of exogenous hormone gibberellin (GA<sub>3</sub>) and gibberellin synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) caused aboveground phenotypic and protein (such as CUL4 and SLR1) changes. Blue light regulates the degradation of SLR1 through OsCSN1, which regulates the growth and development of rice seedling height, the first incomplete leaf, and the coleoptile. It is hypothesized that rice affects CRY-COP1 interactions after sensing blue light signals through the cryptochrome, and the nuclear localization of COP1 is regulated by the CSN complex. OsCSN1 is a negative regulator in response to blue light. The core structural domain of action that inhibits the growth of the aboveground part of rice seedlings is located at the N-terminal of OsCSN1. OsCSN1 regulates the nuclear localization of COP1 through the COP9 signaling complex and degrades SLR1 through CUL4-based E3 ligase. Ultimately, it affects the synthesis of the endogenous hormone GA, thereby inhibiting the aboveground growth and development of rice seedlings.
