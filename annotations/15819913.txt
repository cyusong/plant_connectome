Day-to-day variability in the carbon isotope composition of phloem sap (delta13Chd) and ecosystem respiratory CO2 (delta13CR) were measured to assess the tightness of coupling between canopy photosynthesis (delta13Chd) and ecosystem respiration (delta13CR) in two mature Nothofagus solandri (Hook. f.) forests in New Zealand. Abundant phloem-tapping scale insects allowed repeated, nondestructive access to stem phloem sap 1-2 m above ground. delta13Chd was compared with delta13C predicted by an environmentally driven, process-based canopy photosynthesis model. Keeling plots of within-canopy CO2 were used to estimate delta13CR. By including a lag of 3 d, there was good agreement in the timing and direction of variation in delta13Chd and predictions by the canopy photosynthesis model, suggesting that delta13Chd represents a photosynthesis-weighted, integrative record of canopy photosynthesis and conductance. Significant day-to-day variability in delta13CR was recorded at one of the two forests. At this site, delta13CR reflected variability in delta13Chd only on days with <2 mm rain. We conclude that the degree of coupling between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration varies between sites, and with environmental conditions at a single site.
