['27923776', 'Tissue-specific gene expression is often thought to arise from spatially  restricted transcriptional cascades. However, it is unclear how expression is  established at the top of these cascades in the absence of pre-existing  specificity. We generated a transcriptional network to explore how transcription  factor expression is established in the Arabidopsis thaliana root ground tissue.  Regulators of the SHORTROOT-SCARECROW transcriptional cascade were validated in  planta. At the top of this cascade, we identified both activators and repressors  of SHORTROOT. The aggregate spatial expression of these regulators is not  sufficient to predict transcriptional specificity. Instead, modeling,  transcriptional reporters, and synthetic promoters support a mechanism whereby  expression at the top of the SHORTROOT-SCARECROW cascade is established through  opposing activities of activators and repressors.', '2016 Dec 5', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2016.09.031', 'Benfey']
