['11706174', "We have characterized the mechanism of action of four transgenes (AtBCB  [Arabidopsis blue copper-binding protein], parB [tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)  glutathione S-transferase], NtPox [tobacco peroxidase], and NtGDI1 [tobacco GDP  dissociation inhibitor]) that independently Al resistance on transgenic  Arabidopsis. All four transgenic lines showed lower deposition of callose after  Al treatment than the Landsberg erecta ecotype of Arabidopsis, confirming that  the four genes function to ameliorate Al toxicity. Influx and efflux experiments  of Al ions suggested that the AtBCB gene may suppress Al absorption, whereas  expression of the NtGDI1 gene promotes a release of Al in the root tip region of  Arabidopsis. The total enzyme activities of glutathione S-transferases or  peroxidases in transgenic lines carrying either the parB or NtPox genes were  significantly higher than in the Landsberg erecta ecotype of Arabidopsis, and  these enzyme activities were maintained at higher levels during Al stress.  Furthermore, lipid peroxidation caused by Al stress was repressed in these two  transgenic lines, suggesting that overexpression of these two genes diminishes  oxidative damage caused by Al stress. Al-treated roots of transgenic plants were  also stained by 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole to monitor cell death caused by Al  toxicity. The result suggested that cell death is repressed in the NtPox line.  Analysis of F(1) hybrids between the four transgenic lines suggests that more  resistant transgenic plants can be constructed by combinations of these four  genes.", '2001 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '6920', 'Matsumoto']
