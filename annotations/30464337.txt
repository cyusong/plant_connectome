['30464337', 'The two-membrane envelope is a defining feature of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts  evolved from a Gram-negative cyanobacterial endosymbiont. During evolution, genes  of the endosymbiont have been transferred to the host nuclear genome. Most  chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher-molecular-mass  preproteins with an N-terminal transit peptide. Preproteins are transported into  chloroplasts by the TOC and TIC (translocons at the outer- and inner-envelope  membranes of chloroplasts, respectively) machineries(1,2), but how TOC and TIC  are assembled together is unknown. Here we report the identification of the TIC  component TIC236; TIC236 is an integral inner-membrane protein that projects a  230-kDa domain into the intermembrane space, which binds directly to the  outer-membrane channel TOC75. The knockout mutation of TIC236 is embryonically  lethal. In TIC236-knockdown mutants, a smaller amount of the inner-membrane  channel TIC20 was associated with TOC75; the amount of TOC-TIC supercomplexes was  also reduced. This resulted in a reduced import rate into the stroma, though  outer-membrane protein insertion was unaffected. The size and the essential  nature of TIC236 indicate that-unlike in mitochondria, in which the outer- and  inner-membrane translocons exist as separate complexes and a supercomplex is only  transiently assembled during preprotein translocation(3,4)-a long and stable  protein bridge in the intermembrane space is required for protein translocation  into chloroplasts. Furthermore, TIC236 and TOC75 are homologues of bacterial  inner-membrane TamB(5) and outer-membrane BamA, respectively. Our evolutionary  analyses show that, similar to TOC75, TIC236 is preserved only in plants and has  co-evolved with TOC75 throughout the plant lineage. This suggests that the  backbone of the chloroplast protein-import machinery evolved from the bacterial  TamB-BamA protein-secretion system.', '2018 Dec', 'Nature', '10.1038/s41586-018-0713-y', 'Li']
