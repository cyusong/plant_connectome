['18952773', 'Boron (B) in soil is taken up by roots through NIP5;1, a boric acid channel, and  is loaded into the xylem by BOR1, a borate exporter. Here, the function of  Arabidopsis thaliana NIP6;1, the most similar gene to NIP5;1, was studied. NIP6;1  facilitates the rapid permeation of boric acid across the membrane but is  completely impermeable to water. NIP6;1 transcript accumulation is elevated in  response to B deprivation in shoots but not in roots. NIP6;1  promoter-beta-glucuronidase is predominantly expressed in nodal regions of  shoots, especially the phloem region of vascular tissues. Three independently  identified T-DNA insertion lines for the NIP6;1 gene exhibited reduced expansion  of young rosette leaves only under low-B conditions. B concentrations are reduced  in young rosette leaves but not in the old leaves of these mutants. Taken  together, these data strongly suggest that NIP6;1 is a boric acid channel  required for proper distribution of boric acid, particularly among young  developing shoot tissues. We propose that NIP6;1 is involved in xylem-phloem  transfer of boric acid at the nodal regions and that the water-tight property of  NIP6;1 is important for this function. It is proposed that during evolution,  NIP5;1 and NIP6;1 were diversified in terms of both the specificity of their  expression in plant tissues and their water permeation properties, while  maintaining their ability to be induced under low B and their boric acid  transport activities.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.058628', 'Fujiwara']
