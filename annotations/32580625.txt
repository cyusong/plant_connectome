UV-B is an important environmental factor that differentially affects plant growth and secondary metabolites. However, our knowledge regarding the physiological and biochemical changes in under-ground plant organs responded to UV-B treatment remains limited. In this study, we investigated potato plant (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.) and tuber responses to short-term supplemental UV-B exposure performed during tuber development. Our results indicated that the supplemental UV-B radiation with relative low dose had no obvious adverse impact on plant growth or tuber production. Nutritional composition analyses of tubers revealed that the contents of starch, soluble sugars, and proteins were significantly increased under lower UV-B radiation relative to controls. Similarly, low dose of UV-B treatment promoted the health-promoting compounds, including anthocyanin, phenols, and flavonoids in tubers. Moreover, higher activities of antioxidant enzymes were significantly induced in tubers in response to lower UV-B radiation. These findings suggest that short-term UV-B radiation supplementation at relative low doses can improve the tuber quality in potato plants.
