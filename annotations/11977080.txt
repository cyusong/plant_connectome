['11977080', 'Profilin is a low-molecular weight, actin monomer-binding protein that regulates  the organization of actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotes, including higher plants.  Unlike the simple human or yeast systems, the model plant Arabidopsis has an  ancient and highly divergent multi-gene family encoding five distinct profilin  isovariants. Here we compare and characterize the regulation of these profilins  in different organs and during microspore development using isovariant-specific  monoclonal antibodies. We show that PRF1, PRF2, and PRF3 are constitutive, being  strongly expressed in all vegetative tissues at various stages of development.  These profilin isovariants are also predominant in ovules and microspores at the  early stages of microsporogenesis. In contrast, PRF4 and PRF5 are late  pollen-specific and are not detectable in other cell types of the plant body  including microspores and root hairs. Immunocytochemical studies at the  subcellular level reveal that both the constitutive and pollen-specific profilins  are abundant in the cytoplasm. In vegetative cell types, such as root apical  cells, profilins showed localization to nuclei in addition to the cytoplasmic  staining. The functional diversity of profilin isovariants is discussed in light  of their spatio-temporal regulation during vegetative development, pollen  maturation, and pollen tube growth.', '2002 May', 'Cell Motil Cytoskeleton', '10.1002/cm.10029', 'Meagher']
