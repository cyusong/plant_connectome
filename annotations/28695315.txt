UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASES play important roles in plant development and stress responses. Protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination are reversible processes, which can modulate the stability, activity as well as subcellular localization of the substrate proteins. UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE (UBP) protein family participates in protein deubiquitination. Members of UBP family are involved in a variety of physiological processes in plants, as evidenced by their functional characterization in model plant Arabidopsis and other plants. UBPs are conserved in plants and distinct UBPs function in different regulatory processes, although functional redundancies exist between some members. Here we briefly reviewed recent advances in understanding the biological functions of UBP protein family in Arabidopsis, particularly the molecular mechanisms by which UBPs regulate plant development and stress responses. We believe that elucidation of UBPs function and regulation in Arabidopsis will provide new insights about protein deubiquitination and might shed light on the understanding of the mechanistic roles of UBPs in general, which will definitely contribute to crop improvement in agriculture.
