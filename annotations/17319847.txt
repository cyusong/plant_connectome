['17319847', 'Phytochromes are red/far-red light receptors that regulate various light  responses by initiating the transcriptional cascades responsible for changing the  expression patterns of 10-30% of the entire plant transcriptome. Several  transcription factors that are thought to participate in this process have been  identified, but the functional relationships among them have not yet been fully  elucidated. Here we investigated the functional relationship between two such  transcription factors, PIF3 and HY5, and their effects on anthocyanin  biosynthesis. Our results revealed that PIF3 and HY5 do not regulate each other  at either the transcriptional or the protein levels in continuous light  conditions, suggesting that they are not directly linked within  phytochrome-mediated signaling. We found that both PIF3 and HY5 positively  regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis by activating the transcription of the same  anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, but the positive effects of PIF3 required  functional HY5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that both PIF3  and HY5 regulate anthocyanin biosynthetic gene expression by directly binding to  different regions of the gene promoters in vivo. Additional experiments revealed  that PIF3 bound the promoters regardless of light and HY5. Collectively, these  data show that PIF3 and HY5 regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis by simultaneously  binding anthocyanin biosynthetic gene promoters at separate sequence elements.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.03021.x', 'Choi']
