Members of the plant-specific gibberellic acid-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA) gene family play roles in hormone response, defense and development. We have identified six new Arabidopsis GASA genes, bringing the total number of family members to 14. Here we show that these genes all encode small polypeptides that share the common structural features of an N-terminal putative signal sequence, a highly divergent intermediate region and a conserved 60 amino acid C-terminal domain containing 12 conserved cysteine residues. Analysis of promoter::GUS (beta-glucuronidase) transgenic plants representing six different GASA loci reveals that the promoters are activated in a variety of stage- and tissue-specific patterns during development, indicating that the GASA genes are involved in diverse processes. Characterization of GASA4 shows that the promoter is active in the shoot apex region, developing flowers and developing embryos. Phenotypic analyses of GASA4 loss-of-function and gain-of-function lines indicate that GASA4 regulates floral meristem identity and also positively affects both seed size and total seed yield.
