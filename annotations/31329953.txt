Plants encode over 1800 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that modulate a myriad of steps in gene regulation from chromatin organization to translation, yet only a small number of these proteins and their target transcripts have been functionally characterized. Two classes of eukaryotic RBPs, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) and pumilio/fem-3 binding factors (PUF), recognize and bind to specific sequential RNA sequences through protein-RNA interactions. These modular proteins possess helical structural units containing key residues with high affinity for specific nucleotides, whose sequential order determines binding to a specific target RNA sequence. PPR proteins are nucleus-encoded, but largely regulate post-transcriptional gene regulation within plastids and mitochondria, including splicing, translation and RNA editing. Plant PUFs are involved in gene regulatory processes within the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. The modular structures of PPRs and PUFs that determine sequence specificity has facilitated identification of their RNA targets and biological functions. The protein-based RNA-targeting of PPRs and PUFs contrasts to the prokaryotic cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated proteins (Cas) that target RNAs in prokaryotes. Together the PPR, PUF and CRISPR-Cas systems provide varied opportunities for RNA-targeted engineering applications.
