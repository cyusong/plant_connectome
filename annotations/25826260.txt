The effects of the allelochemical benzoxazolin-2-(3H)-one (BOA) were evaluated on growth, lignin content and its monomers p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) in roots, stems and leaves of soybean. BOA decreased the lengths and fresh weights of roots and stems, and the fresh weights and areas of leaves. Reductions in the growth were accompanied by enhanced lignin content in all tissues. In roots, the allelochemical increased the content of H, G and S monomers as well as the overall amount of lignin (referred to as the sum of H+G+S), but did not alter the S/G ratio. In stems and leaves, BOA increased the H, G, S and H+G+S contents while decreasing the S/G ratio. In brief, BOA-induced inhibition of soybean may be due to excessive production of monomers that increase the degree of polymerization of lignin, limit cell expansion, solidify the cell wall and restrict plant growth.
