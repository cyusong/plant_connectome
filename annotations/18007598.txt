['18007598', "Obligatory homologous recombination (HR) is required for chiasma formation and  chromosome segregation in meiosis I. Meiotic HR is initiated by DNA double-strand  breaks (DSBs), generated by Spo11, a homologue of the archaebacterial  topoisomerase subunit Top6A. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad50, Mre11 and  Com1/Sae2 are essential to process an intermediate of the cleavage reaction  consisting of Spo11 covalently linked to the 5' termini of DNA. While Rad50 and  Mre11 also confer genome stability to vegetative cells and are well conserved in  evolution, Com1/Sae2 was believed to be fungal-specific. Here, we identify  COM1/SAE2 homologues in all eukaryotic kingdoms. Arabidopsis thaliana Com1/Sae2  mutants are sterile, accumulate AtSPO11-1 during meiotic prophase and fail to  form AtRAd51 foci despite the presence of unrepaired DSBs. Furthermore, DNA  fragmentation in AtCom1 is suppressed by eliminating AtSPO11-1. In addition,  AtCOM1 is specifically required for mitomycin C resistance. Interestingly, we  identified CtIP, an essential protein interacting with the DNA repair machinery,  as the mammalian homologue of Com1/Sae2, with important implications for the  molecular role of CtIP.", '2007 Dec 12', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601913', 'Schlogelhofer']
