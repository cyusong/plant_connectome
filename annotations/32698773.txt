Salinity is one of the most serious threats to world agriculture. An important sugar-yielding crop sugar beet, which shows some tolerance to salt via a mechanism that is poorly understood. Proteomics data can provide important clues that can contribute to finally understand this mechanism. Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in sugar beet under salt stress treatment were identified in leaves (70 DAPs) and roots (76 DAPs). Functions of these DAPs were predicted, and included metabolism and cellular, environmental information and genetic information processing. We hypothesize that these processes work in concert to maintain cellular homeostasis. Some DAPs are closely related to salt resistance, such as choline monooxygenase, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and F-type H<sup>+</sup>-transporting ATPase. The expression pattern of ten DAPs encoding genes was consistent with the iTRAQ data. During sugar beet adaptation to salt stress, leaves and roots cope using distinct mechanisms of molecular metabolism regulation. This study provides significant insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the response of higher plants to salt stress, and identified some candidate proteins involved in salt stress countermeasures.
