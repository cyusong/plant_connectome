ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) is the first C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) gene from plants and controls leaf width and pattern of trichome branching in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. We characterized an ortholog of AN from Ipomoea nil (L.) Roth (Japanese morning glory) and designated it Ipomoea nil's AN (IAN). IAN is a single-copy gene in the genome and is expressed ubiquitously in various organs of I. nil. IAN contains not only a D2-HDH motif, which is highly conserved within the CtBP family, but also LXCXE, NLS and PEST motifs, which are specific to the AN subfamily. The expression of IAN cDNA driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter restored a defect in leaf expansion in the leaf width direction in the angustifolia-1 (an-1) mutant of Arabidopsis, suggesting that IAN retains a common function with AN. In contrast, the complementation by IAN of a defect in the trichome branching pattern on the leaf surface of the an-1 mutant was less effective than that observed for leaf shape. These results suggest that the mechanisms by which AN regulates leaf width and trichome branching are separable.
