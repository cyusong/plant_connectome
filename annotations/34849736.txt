The European mistletoe (Viscum album) is an epiphytic hemiparasite that attaches to its host by an endophytic system. Two aspects are essential for its survival: the structural integrity of the host-parasite interface must be maintained during host growth and the functional integrity of the interface must be maintained during ontogeny and under mechanical stress. We investigated the mechanical properties of the mistletoe-host interaction. Intact and sliced mistletoe-host samples, with host wood as reference, were subjected to tensile tests up to failure. We quantified the rough fractured surface by digital microscopy and analysed local surface strains by digital image correlation. Tensile strength and deformation energy were independent of mistletoe age but exhibited markedly lower values than host wood samples. Cracks initiated at sites with a major strain of about 30%, especially along the mistletoe-host interface. The risk of sudden failure was counteracted by various sinkers and a lignification gradient that smooths the differences in the mechanical properties between the two species. Our results improve the understanding of the key mechanical characteristics of the host-mistletoe interface and show that the mechanical connection between the mistletoe and its host is age-independent. Thus, functional and structural integrity is ensured over the lifetime of the mistletoe.
