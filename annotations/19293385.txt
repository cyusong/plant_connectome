['19293385', 'We found that Arabidopsis AtTDX, a heat-stable and plant-specific thioredoxin  (Trx)-like protein, exhibits multiple functions, acting as a disulfide reductase,  foldase chaperone, and holdase chaperone. The activity of AtTDX, which contains 3  tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains and a Trx motif, depends on its oligomeric  status. The disulfide reductase and foldase chaperone functions predominate when  AtTDX occurs in the low molecular weight (LMW) form, whereas the holdase  chaperone function predominates in the high molecular weight (HMW) complexes.  Because deletion of the TPR domains results in a significant enhancement of AtTDX  disulfide reductase activity and complete loss of the holdase chaperone function,  our data suggest that the TPR domains of AtTDX block the active site of Trx and  play a critical role in promoting the holdase chaperone function. The  oligomerization status of AtTDX is reversibly regulated by heat shock, which  causes a transition from LMW to HMW complexes with concomitant functional  switching from a disulfide reductase and foldase chaperone to a holdase  chaperone. Overexpression of AtTDX in Arabidopsis conferred enhanced heat shock  resistance to plants, primarily via its holdase chaperone activity.', '2009 Apr 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0811231106', 'Lee']
