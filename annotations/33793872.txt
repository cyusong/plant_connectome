REMORINs (REMs) are a plant-specific protein family, proposed regulators of membrane-associated molecular assemblies and well-established markers of plasma membrane nanodomains. REMs play a diverse set of functions in plant interactions with pathogens and symbionts, responses to abiotic stresses, hormone signaling and cell-to-cell communication. In this review, we highlight the established and more putative roles of REMs throughout the literature. We discuss the physiological functions of REMs, the mechanisms underlying their nanodomain-organization and their putative role as regulators of nanodomain-associated molecular assemblies. Furthermore, we discuss how REM phosphorylation may regulate their functional versatility. Overall, through data-mining and comparative analysis of the literature, we suggest how to further study the molecular mechanisms underpinning the functions of REMs.
