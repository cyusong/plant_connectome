Cyanobacteria require light to perform photosynthesis, but not all colors of light are equally useable for them. In particular, blue light-grown cyanobacterial strains, including the well-studied model organism Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis), have been observed to exhibit slower growth rates than white or red light-grown cells. In this issue of Physiologia Plantarum, Luimstra et al. (2020) have attempted to understand why cyanobacterial cells suffer under blue light. They measured the molecular and genetic responses of Synechocystis cells to being shifted from white light to blue light. They found that blue light-grown cells make changes that lead to a redistribution of energy flow between the two photosystems that power photosynthesis. These findings could help researchers identify avenues for optimizing photosynthesis in cyanobacterial species, a group of organisms which show great promise as potential solar-powered factories for the production of biofuels and other high-value products.
