['31671241', 'One of the goals of biofortification is to generate iron-enriched crops to combat  growth and developmental defects especially iron (Fe) deficiency anaemia.  Fe-fortification of food is challenging because soluble Fe is unstable and  insoluble Fe is nonbioavailable. Genetic engineering is an alternative approach  for Fe-biofortification, but so far strategies to increase Fe content have only  encompassed a few genes with limited success. In this study, we demonstrate that  the ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutant, iron deficiency tolerant1 (idt1), can  accumulate 4-7 times higher amounts of Fe than the wild type in roots, shoots and  seeds, and exhibits the metal tolerance and iron accumulation (Metina) phenotype  in Arabidopsis. Fe-regulated protein stability and nuclear localisation of the  upstream transcriptional regulator bHLH34 were uncovered. The C to T transition  mutation resulting in substitution of alanine to valine at amino acid position  320 of bHLH34 (designated as IDT1(A320V) ) in a conserved motif among mono- and  dicots was found to be responsible for a dominant phenotype that possesses  constitutive activation of the Fe regulatory pathway. Overexpression of  IDT1(A320V) in Arabidopsis and tobacco led to the Metina phenotype; a phenotype  that has escalated specificity towards optimising Fe homeostasis and may be  useful in Fe-biofortification. Knowledge of the high tolerance and accumulation  of heavy metals of this mutant can aid the development of tools for  phytoremediation of contaminants.', '2020 May', 'Plant Biotechnol J', '10.1111/pbi.13285', 'ORCID:']
