MY C2 is an important transcription factor, which modulates transcription by directly binding to Z-, G- and E-box elements present in the promoters of light and different stress responsive genes. Very recently, we have shown that MY C2 plays a role in the regulation of Z- and/or G-box containing promoters during both seedling and adult plant growth. Although, MY C2 does not bind to the GATA box light responsive element (LRE ) in vitro as shown in DNA binding assays, its involvement in the regulation of GATA -box containing promoter in planta, if any, is not known. Here, we report that the promoter activity of GATA-NOS101 in atmyc2 mutant was found to be similar to wild-type in BL and dark grown seedlings, whereas it was found to be lower compared with wild-type as revealed from GUS staining results. Further, we will discuss the consequences of MY C2 regulating GATA -box containing promoter in combination with G-box containing promoters.
