['21447790', 'BROTHER OF LUX ARRHYTHMO (BOA) is a GARP family transcription factor in  Arabidopsis thaliana and is regulated by circadian rhythms. Transgenic lines that  constitutively overexpress BOA exhibit physiological and developmental changes,  including delayed flowering time and increased vegetative growth under standard  growing conditions. Arabidopsis circadian clock protein CIRCADIAN CLOCK  ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) binds to the evening element of the BOA promoter and  negatively regulates its expression. Furthermore, the period of BOA rhythm was  shortened in cca1-11, lhy-21 (for LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL), and cca1-11 lhy-21  genetic backgrounds. BOA binds to the promoter of CCA1 through newly identified  promoter binding sites and activates the transcription of CCA1 in vivo and in  vitro. In transgenic Arabidopsis lines that overexpress BOA, the period length of  CCA1 rhythm was increased and the amplitude was enhanced. Rhythmic expression of  other clock genes, including LHY, GIGANTEA (GI), and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1  (TOC1), was altered in transgenic lines that overexpress BOA. Rhythmic expression  of BOA was also affected in mutant lines of toc1-1, gi-3, and gi-4. Results from  these studies indicate that BOA is a critical component of the regulatory circuit  of the circadian clock.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.084293', 'Beachy']
