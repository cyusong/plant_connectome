Strigolactones are plant signaling molecules that induce germination of parasitic plant seeds, initiate host plant - arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus symbiosis and act as plant hormones controlling shoot branching and root architecture. To date four unique strigolactones (e.g., orobanchol, didehydroorobanchol isomers 1 and 2 and the aromatic strigolactone solanacol) have been reported in the root exudates and extracts of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Here we report on the presence of several additional strigolactones in tomato root exudates and extracts, orobanchyl acetate, two 7-hydroxyorobanchol isomers, 7-oxoorobanchol and two additional didehydroorobanchol isomers and discuss their possible biological relevance.
