DNA barcoding is impending towards the generation of universal standards for species discrimination with a standard gene region that can be sequenced accurately and within short span of time. In this study, we were successful in developing efficient barcode locus in the Nepenthes genus. A total of 317 accessions were retrieved from GenBank of NCBI which represent 140 different species Nepenthes and evaluated the efficacy of ITS, rbcl and matK barcode candidates using barcode gap, applied distance similarity, and tree-based methods. Our result indicates that single-locus ITS or combined with plastid regions (matK) showed the best species discrimination with distinctive barcoding gaps. Therefore, we tentatively proposed the combination of ITS+matK as a core barcode for Nepenthes genus. This study provides a report on DNA barcoding for unique insectivores' Nepenthes genus. As the different species of Nepenthes are higly endemic and endangered, it would be a useful study to understand the evolutionary relationship, sketched in emigration, mislabeling and can be a probable assessment for its biodiversity.
