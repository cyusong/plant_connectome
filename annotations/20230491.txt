['20230491', 'MADS-domain transcription factors play pivotal roles in various developmental  processes. The lack of simple loss-of-function phenotypes provides impediments to  understand the biological function of some of the MADS-box transcription factors.  Here we have characterized the potential role of the Arabidopsis thaliana  AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) gene by fusing full-length coding sequence with  transcriptional activator and repressor domains and suggest a role for AGL6 in  lateral organ development and flowering. Upon photoperiodic induction of  flowering, AGL6 becomes expressed in abaxial and proximal regions of cauline leaf  primordia, as well as the cryptic bracts subtending flowers. In developing  flowers, AGL6 is detected in the proximal regions of all floral organs and in  developing ovules. Converting AGL6 into a strong activator through fusion to the  VP16 domain triggers bract outgrowth, implicating AGL6 in the development of  bractless flowers in Arabidopsis. In addition, ectopic reproductive structures  form on both bracts and flowers in gAGL6::VP16 transgenic plants, which is  dependent on B and C class homeotic genes, but independent of LEAFY.  Overexpression of both AGL6 and its transcriptional repressor form, AGL6::EAR,  causes precocious flowering and terminal flower formation, suggesting that AGL6  suppresses the function of a floral repressor.', '2010 Jun 1', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04192.x', 'Kim']
