['20682769', 'Splicing of plant organellar transcripts is facilitated by members of a large  protein family, the pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. We have identified a  pentatricopeptide repeat protein in a genetic screen for mutants resistant to  inhibition of root growth by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of  glutathione synthesis and consequently named BIR6 (BSO-insensitive roots 6). BIR6  is involved in splicing of intron 1 of the mitochondrial nad7 transcript.  Loss-of-function mutations in BIR6 result in a strongly reduced accumulation of  fully processed nad7 transcript. This affects assembly of Complex I and results  in moderate growth retardation. In agreement with disruption of Complex I  function, the genes encoding alternative NADH oxidizing enzymes are induced in  the mutant, and the mutant plants are less sensitive to mannitol and salt stress.  Mutation in the BIR6 gene allowed normal root growth in presence of BSO and  strongly attenuated depletion of glutathione content at these conditions. The  same phenotype was observed with other mutants affected in function of Complex I,  thus reinforcing the importance of Complex I function for cellular redox  homeostasis.', '2010 Oct 15', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110.147603', 'Kopriva']
