Recent work on hormone mediated regulation of the SAM is reviewed, emphasizing how combinations of genetic, molecular and modelling approaches have refined models based on classic experimental and physiological work. Special emphasis is given to newly described mechanisms that modulate the responsiveness of specific tissues to hormones and their potential to direct position dependent determination processes.
