Cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes represent the active sites for both photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport. We used high-resolution atomic force microscopy to visualize the native organization and interactions of photosynthetic complexes within the thylakoid membranes from the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The thylakoid membranes are heterogeneous and assemble photosynthetic complexes into functional domains to enhance their coordination and regulation. Under high light, the chlorophyll-binding proteins IsiA are strongly expressed and associate with Photosystem I (PSI), forming highly variable IsiA-PSI supercomplexes to increase the absorption cross-section of PSI. There are also tight interactions of PSI with Photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>f, ATP synthase and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complexes. The organizational variability of these photosynthetic supercomplexes permits efficient linear and cyclic electron transport as well as bioenergetic regulation. Understanding the organizational landscape and environmental adaptation of cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes may help inform strategies for engineering efficient photosynthetic systems and photo-biofactories.
