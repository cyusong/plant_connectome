['31002461', 'The growth and development of roots in plants depends on the specification and  maintenance of the root apical meristem. Here, we report the identification of  CBL, a gene required for embryo and root development in Arabidopsis, and encodes  cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL), which catalyzes the penultimate step in  methionine (Met) biosynthesis, and which also led to the discovery of a previous  unknown, but crucial, metabolic contribution by the Met biosynthesis pathway. CBL  is expressed in embryos and shows quiescent center (QC)-enriched expression  pattern in the root. cbl mutant has impaired embryo patterning, defective root  stem cell niche, stunted root growth, and reduces accumulation of the root master  regulators PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2. Furthermore, mutation in CBL severely  decreases abundance of several PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins and impairs  auxin-responsive gene expression in the root tip. cbl seedlings also exhibit  global reduction in histone H3 Lys-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and DNA  methylation. Importantly, mutation in CBL reduces the abundance of H3K4me3  modification in PLT1/2 genes and downregulates their expression. Overexpression  of PLT2 partially rescues cbl root meristem defect, suggesting that CBL acts in  part through PLT1/2. Moreover, exogenous supplementation of Met also restores the  impaired QC activity and the root growth defects of cbl. Taken together, our  results highlight the unique role of CBL to maintain the root stem cell niche by  cooperative actions between Met biosynthesis and epigenetic modification of key  developmental regulators.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14343', 'ORCID:']
