Fungi of genus <i>Botrytis</i> are important pathogens of legumes, causing gray mold and chocolate spot diseases. The use of molecular methods to identify pathogens has resulted in the discovery of several new <i>Botrytis</i> species and new associations of pathogens with diseases. Thus, chocolate spot of faba bean is now associated with at least four species: <i>B. fabae</i>, <i>B. cinerea</i>, <i>B. pseudocinerea</i> and <i>B. fabiopsis</i>. Species of <i>Botrytis</i> differ in host plant, pathogenicity, fungicide resistance and other relevant properties that affect disease control. The aim of this study was to identify the species of <i>Botrytis</i> isolated from different legume crops and to evaluate their <i>in vitro</i> pathogenicity. Between 2014 and 2019, 278 isolates of <i>Botrytis</i> were obtained from infected legumes in Latvia. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out by sequencing three nuclear genes, RPB2, HSP60, and G3PDH, considered to be diagnostic for species in this genus. A set of 21 representative isolates was selected for pathogenicity tests on detached leaves of faba bean, field pea, lupin and soybean using 5-mm mycelium-agar plugs. The diameter of the formed lesions under the inoculated plug was measured crosswise each day. The datasets were subjected to analysis of variance with the split-plot design of the experiment and repeated-measures model. Six species were identified: <i>B. cinerea</i>, <i>B. fabae</i>, <i>B. pseudocinerea</i>, <i>B. fabiopsis</i>, <i>B. euroamericana</i> and <i>B. medusae</i>. In addition to the expected combinations of host and pathogen, naturally occurring infections of <i>B. fabiopsis</i> were found on chickpea, <i>B. euroamericana</i> on faba bean and <i>B. medusae</i> in lupin seeds. Species and isolate had significant effects on pathogenicity on all crops tested. Several isolates were pathogenic on two or more host species: two of <i>B. pseudocinerea</i>, two of <i>B. cinerea</i>, two of <i>B. fabiopsis</i> and the one of <i>B. medusae</i>. One isolate of <i>B. pseudocinerea</i> and two of <i>B. fabiopsis</i> caused primary lesions on all five host species. The results show that these <i>Botrytis</i> species have a broad host range that should be borne in mind when planning crop sequences and rotations.
