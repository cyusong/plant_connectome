Plant miRNAs, the critical regulator of gene expression, involve many development processes in vivo. However, the roles of miRNAs in plant cell proliferation and redifferntiation in vitro remain unknown. To determine better the molecular mechanism of these processes, we have recently reported that a set of miRNAs with different expression patterns between cells of totipotent and non-totipotent Arabidopsis calli. Some of these were specifically up- or downregulated during callus formation or shoot regeneration, and other development. Among them, miR160, and one of its target genes, ARF10, regulated Arabidopsis in vitro shoot regeneration via WUS, CLV3 and CUC1/ 2. The miR160-overexpressing, 35S transgenic lines, exhibited reduced shoot regeneration efficiency. The mARF10, a miR160-resistant form of ARF10, showed a high level of shoot regeneration ability. In the transgenic, expression of the above shoot meristem-specific genes was elevated, which is consistent with the improved shoot regeneration. In contrast, the ARF10 deficient knockout mutant produced fewer regenerated shoot. However, overexpressors of ARF10 were only marginally more efficient than the wild type with the respect to shoot regeneration. Our observation strongly supports that proper shoot regeneration from in vitro cultured cells requires the miR160-directed negative influence of ARF10. The enhanced expression of ARF10 is likely to have contributed to the improved regeneration ability.
