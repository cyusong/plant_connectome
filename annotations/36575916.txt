Although significant intraspecific variation in photosynthetic phosphorus (P) use efficiency (PPUE) has been shown in numerous species, we still know little about the biochemical basis for differences in PPUE among genotypes within a species. Here, we grew two high PPUE and two low PPUE chickpea (Cicer arietinum) genotypes with low P supply in a glasshouse to compare their photosynthesis-related traits, total foliar P concentration ([P]) and chemical P fractions (i.e. inorganic P (Pi), metabolite P, lipid P, nucleic acid P, and residual P). Foliar cell-specific nutrient concentrations including P were characterized using elemental X-ray microanalysis. Genotypes with high PPUE showed lower total foliar [P] without slower photosynthetic rates. No consistent differences in cellular [P] between the epidermis and mesophyll cells occurred across the four genotypes. In contrast, high PPUE was associated with lower allocation to Pi and metabolite P, with PPUE being negatively correlated with the percentage of these two fractions. Furthermore, a lower allocation to Pi and metabolite P was correlated with a greater allocation to nucleic acid P, but not to lipid P. Collectively, our results suggest that a different allocation to foliar P fractions, rather than preferential P allocation to specific leaf tissues, underlies the contrasting PPUE among chickpea genotypes.
