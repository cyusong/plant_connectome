['12215504', 'Vascular cell axialization refers to the uniform alignment of vascular strands.  In the Arabidopsis cotyledon vascular pattern1 (cvp1) mutant, vascular cells are  not arranged in parallel files and are misshapen, suggesting that CVP1 has a role  in promoting vascular cell polarity and alignment. Characterization of an allelic  series of cvp1 mutations revealed additional functions of CVP1 in organ expansion  and elongation. We identified CVP1 and found that it encodes STEROL  METHYLTRANSFERASE2 (SMT2), an enzyme in the sterol biosynthetic pathway. SMT2 and  the functionally redundant SMT3 act at a branch point in the pathway that  mediates sterol and brassinosteroid levels. The SMT2 gene is expressed in a  number of developing organs and is regulated by various hormones. As predicted  from SMT2 enzymatic activity, the precursors to brassinosteroid are increased at  the expense of sterols in cvp1 mutants, identifying a role for sterols in  vascular cell polarization and axialization.', '2002 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.003939', 'Nelson']
