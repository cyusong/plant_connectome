Extensive studies have shown that the MBW complex consisting of three kinds of regulatory proteins, MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and a WD40 repeat protein, TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1), acts in concert to promote trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. TTG1 functions as an essential activator in these two biological processes. However, direct downstream targets of the TTG1-dependent MBW complex have not yet been obtained in the two biological processes at the genome-wide level in <i>A. thaliana</i>. In the present study, we found, through RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, that a great number of regulatory and structural genes involved in both trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation are significantly downregulated in the young shoots and expanding true leaves of <i>ttg1-13</i> plants. Post-translational activation of a TTG1-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that these downregulated genes are directly or indirectly targeted by the TTG1-dependent MBW complex in vivo during trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation. These findings further extend our understanding of the role of TTG1-dependent MBW complex in the regulation of trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation in <i>A. thaliana</i>.
