Mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ) describes the movement of CO<sub>2</sub> from the intercellular air spaces below the stomata to the site of initial carboxylation in the mesophyll. In contrast with C<sub>3</sub> -g<sub>m</sub> , little is currently known about the intraspecific variation in C<sub>4</sub> -g<sub>m</sub> or its responsiveness to environmental stimuli. To address these questions, g<sub>m</sub> was measured on five maize (Zea mays) lines in response to CO<sub>2</sub> , employing three different estimates of g<sub>m</sub> . Each of the methods indicated a significant response of g<sub>m</sub> to CO<sub>2</sub> . Estimates of g<sub>m</sub> were similar between methods at ambient and higher CO<sub>2</sub> , but diverged significantly at low partial pressures of CO<sub>2</sub> . These differences are probably driven by incomplete chemical and isotopic equilibrium between CO<sub>2</sub> and bicarbonate under these conditions. Carbonic anhydrase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in vitro activity varied significantly despite similar values of g<sub>m</sub> and leaf anatomical traits. These results provide strong support for a CO<sub>2</sub> response of g<sub>m</sub> in Z. mays, and indicate that g<sub>m</sub> in maize is probably driven by anatomical constraints rather than by biochemical limitations. The CO<sub>2</sub> response of g<sub>m</sub> indicates a potential role for facilitated diffusion in C<sub>4</sub> -g<sub>m</sub> . These results also suggest that water-use efficiency could be enhanced in C<sub>4</sub> species by targeting g<sub>m</sub> .
