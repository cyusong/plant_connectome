Efficient antioxidant enzymatic system contributes to salt tolerance of plants <i>via</i> avoiding ROS over-accumulation. Peroxiredoxins are crucial components of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging machinery in plant cells, but whether they offer salt tolerance with potential for germplasm improvement has not been well addressed in wheat. In this work, we confirmed the role of a wheat 2-Cys peroxiredoxin gene <i>TaBAS1</i> that was identified through the proteomic analysis. <i>TaBAS1</i> overexpression enhanced the salt tolerance of wheat at both germination and seedling stages. <i>TaBAS1</i> overexpression enhanced the tolerance to oxidative stress, promoted the activities of ROS scavenging enzymes, and reduced ROS accumulation under salt stress. <i>TaBAS1</i> overexpression promoted the activity of ROS production associated NADPH oxidase, and the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity abolished the role of <i>TaBAS1</i> in salt and oxidative tolerance. Moreover, the inhibition of NADPH-thioredoxin reductase C activity erased the performance of <i>TaBAS1</i> in the tolerance to salt and oxidative stress. The ectopic expression of <i>TaBAS1</i> in Arabidopsis exhibited the same performance, showing the conserved role of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins in salt tolerance in plants. <i>TaBAS1</i> overexpression enhanced the grain yield of wheat under salt stress but not the control condition, not imposing the trade-offs between yield and tolerance. Thus, <i>TaBAS1</i> could be used for molecular breeding of wheat with superior salt tolerance.
