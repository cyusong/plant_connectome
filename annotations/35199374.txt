Stomatal movement participates in plant immunity by directly affecting the invasion of bacteria, but the genes that regulate stomatal immunity have not been well identified. Here, we characterised the function of the bZIP59 transcription factor from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is constitutively expressed in guard cells. The bzip59 mutant is partially impaired in stomatal closure induced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain (Pst) DC3000 and is more susceptible to Pst DC3000 infection. By contrast, the line overexpressing bZIP59 enhances resistance to Pst DC3000 infection. Furthermore, the bzip59 mutant is also partially impaired in stomatal closure induced by flagellin flg22 derived from Pst DC3000, and epistasis analysis revealed that bZIP59 acts upstream of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) and downstream of salicylic acid signalling in flg22-induced stomatal closure. In addition, the bzip59 mutant showed resistance and sensitivity to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Tobacco mosaic virus that do not invade through stomata, respectively. Collectively, our results demonstrate that bZIP59 plays an important role in the stomatal immunity and reveal that the same transcription factor can positively and negatively regulate disease resistance against different pathogens.
