Although grain size is an important quantitative trait affecting rice yield and quality, there are few studies on gene-by-environment interactions (GEIs) in genome-wide association studies, especially, in main crop (MC) and ratoon rice (RR). To address these issues, the phenotypes for grain width (GW), grain length (GL), and thousand grain weight (TGW) of 159 accessions of MC and RR in two environments were used to associate with 2,017,495 SNPs for detecting quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) and QTN-by-environment interactions (QEIs) using 3VmrMLM. As a result, 64, 71, 67, 72, 63, and 56 QTNs, and 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, and 1 QEIs were found to be significantly associated with GW in MC (GW-MC), GL-MC, TGW-MC, GW-RR, GL-RR, and TGW-RR, respectively. 3, 4, 7, 2, 2, and 4 genes were found to be truly associated with the above traits, respectively, while 2 genes around the above QEIs were found to be truly associated with GL-RR, and one of the two known genes was differentially expressed under two soil moisture conditions. 10, 7, 1, 8, 4, and 3 candidate genes were found by differential expression and GO annotation analysis to be around the QTNs for the above traits, respectively, in which 6, 3, 1, 2, 0, and 2 candidate genes were found to be significant in haplotype analysis. The gene <i>Os03g0737000</i> around one QEI for GL-MC was annotated as salt stress related gene and found to be differentially expressed in two cultivars with different grain sizes. Among all the candidate genes around the QTNs in this study, four were key, in which two were reported to be truly associated with seed development, and two (<i>Os02g0626100</i> for GL-MC and <i>Os02g0538000</i> for GW-MC) were new. Moreover, 1, 2, and 1 known genes, along with 8 additional candidate genes and 2 candidate GEIs, were found to be around QTNs and QEIs for GW, GL, and TGW, respectively in MC and RR joint analysis, in which 3 additional candidate genes were key and new. Our results provided a solid foundation for genetic improvement and molecular breeding in MC and RR.
