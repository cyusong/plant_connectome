Nitrogen is the most important macroelement required for the composition of key molecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins and other organic compounds. As sessile organisms, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to acquire nitrogen for their normal growth and development. Besides the transcriptional and translational regulation of nitrogen uptake, assimilation, remobilization and signal transduction, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are shown to participate in these processes in plants. In addition to alterations in protein abundance, PTMs may dramatically increase the complexity of the proteome without the concomitant changes in gene transcription and have emerged as an important type of protein regulation in terms of protein function, subcellular localization and protein activity and stability. Herein, we briefly summarize recent advances on the posttranslational regulation of nitrogen uptake, assimilation, remobilization and nitrogen signaling and discuss the underlying mechanisms of PTMs as well as the signal output of such PTMs. Understanding these regulation mechanisms will provide novel insights for improving the nitrogen use efficiency of plants.
