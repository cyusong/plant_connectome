['24028869', 'Temperature-induced lipocalins (TIL) have been invoked in the defense from heat,  cold and oxidative stress. Here we document a function of TIL for basal  protection from salinity stress. Heterologous expression of TIL from the salt  resistant poplar Populus euphratica did not rescue growth but prevented  chlorophyll b destruction in salt-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana. The protein was  localized to the plasma membrane but was re-translocated to the symplast under  salt stress. The A. thaliana knock out and knock down lines Attil1-1 and Attil1-2  showed stronger stress symptoms and stronger chlorophyll b degradation than the  wildtype (WT) under excess salinity. They accumulated more chloride and sodium in  chloroplasts than the WT. Chloroplast chloride accumulation was found even in the  absence of salt stress. Since lipocalins are known to bind regulatory fatty acids  of channel proteins as well as iron, we suggest that the salt-induced trafficking  of TIL may be required for protection of chloroplasts by affecting ion  homeostasis.', '2014 Feb 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2013.08.003', 'Polle']
