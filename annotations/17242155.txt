['17242155', 'Epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes is executed by a complex set of signaling  interactions among small RNA species and chromatin marks, including histone  modification and DNA methylation. We identified vim1 (VARIANT IN METHYLATION 1),  an Arabidopsis mutation causing cytosine hypomethylation and decondensation of  centromeres in interphase. VIM1 is a member of a small gene family, encoding  proteins containing PHD, RING, and SRA (SET- and RING-associated) domains, which  are found together in mammalian proteins implicated in regulation of chromatin  modification, transcription, and the cell cycle. VIM1 is an unconventional  methylcytosine-binding protein that interacts in vitro with 5mCpG- and  5mCpHpG-modified DNA (via its SRA domain), as well as recombinant histones (H2B,  H3, H4, and HTR12) in plant extracts. VIM1 associates with methylated genomic  loci in vivo and is enriched in chromocenters. Our findings suggest that VIM1  acts at the DNA methylation-histone interface to maintain centromeric  heterochromatin.', '2007 Feb 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1512007', 'Richards']
