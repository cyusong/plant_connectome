['23023171', 'The soilborne fungal plant pathogen Verticillium longisporum invades the roots of  its Brassicaceae hosts and proliferates in the plant vascular system. Typical  aboveground symptoms of Verticillium infection on Brassica napus and Arabidopsis  thaliana are stunted growth, vein clearing, and leaf chloroses. Here, we provide  evidence that vein clearing is caused by pathogen-induced transdifferentiation of  chloroplast-containing bundle sheath cells to functional xylem elements. In  addition, our findings suggest that reinitiation of cambial activity and  transdifferentiation of xylem parenchyma cells results in xylem hyperplasia  within the vasculature of Arabidopsis leaves, hypocotyls, and roots. The observed  de novo xylem formation correlates with Verticillium-induced expression of the  VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN (VND) transcription factor gene VND7. Transgenic  Arabidopsis plants expressing the chimeric repressor VND7-SRDX under control of a  Verticillium infection-responsive promoter exhibit reduced de novo xylem  formation. Interestingly, infected Arabidopsis wild-type plants show higher  drought stress tolerance compared with noninfected plants, whereas this effect is  attenuated by suppression of VND7 activity. Together, our results suggest that V.  longisporum triggers a tissue-specific developmental plant program that  compensates for compromised water transport and enhances the water storage  capacity of infected Brassicaceae host plants. In conclusion, we provide evidence  that this natural plant-fungus pathosystem has conditionally mutualistic  features.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.103374', 'Teichmann']
