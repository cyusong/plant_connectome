['21220583', 'Successful import of hundreds of nucleus-encoded proteins is essential for  chloroplast biogenesis. The import of cytosolic precursor proteins relies on the  Toc- (translocon at the outer chloroplast membrane) and Tic- (translocon at the  inner chloroplast membrane) complexes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, precursor  recognition is mainly mediated by outer membrane receptors belonging to two gene  families: Toc34/33 and Toc159/132/120/90. The role in import and precursor  selectivity of these receptors has been intensively studied, but the function of  Toc90 still remains unclear. Here, we report the ability of Toc90 to support the  import of Toc159 client proteins. We show that the overexpression of Toc90  partially complements the albino knockout of Toc159 and restores photoautotrophic  growth. Several lines of evidence including proteome profiling demonstrate the  import and accumulation of proteins essential for chloroplast biogenesis and  functionality.', '2011 Mar', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssq071', 'Kessler']
