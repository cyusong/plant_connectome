226 CcCYP450 genes were identified at the genomic level and were classified into 45 clades based on phylogenetic analysis. CcCYP75B165 gene was found that might play important roles in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in pigeon pea, and was significantly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). The cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase (CYP450) superfamily plays a key role in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and resists different kinds of stresses. Several CYP450 genes have been identified to be involved in the biosynthesis of crop protection agents. However, the CcCYP450 genes from pigeon pea have not been identified. Here, 226 CcCYP450 genes were identified at the genomic level by analysing the gene structure, distribution on chromosomes, gene duplication, and conserved motifs and were classified into 45 clades based on phylogenetic analysis. RNA-seq analysis revealed clear details of CcCYP450 genes that varied with time of MeJA (methyl jasmonate) induction. Among them, six CcCYP450 subfamily genes were found that might play important roles in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in pigeon pea. The overexpression of CcCYP75B165 in pigeon pea significantly induced the accumulation of genistin and downregulated the contents of cajaninstilbene acid, apigenin, isovitexin, and genistein and the expression of flavonoid synthase genes. This study provides theoretical guidance and plant genetic resources for cultivating new pigeon pea varieties with high flavonoid contents and exploring the molecular mechanisms of the biosynthesis of flavonoids under MeJA treatment.
