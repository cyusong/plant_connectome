['11161017', 'In the chloroplast psbD light-responsive promoter (LRP), a highly conserved  sequence exists upstream from the bacterial -10/-35 elements. Multiple  sequence-specific DNA binding proteins are predicted to bind to the conserved  sequence as transcription factors. Using yeast one-hybrid screening of an  Arabidopsis cDNA library, a possible DNA binding protein of the psbD LRP upstream  sequence was identified. The protein, designated PTF1, is a novel protein of 355  amino acids (estimated molecular weight of 39.6) that contains a basic  helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif in the predicted N-terminal region of the  mature protein. Transient expression assay of PTF1-GFP fusion protein showed that  PTF1 was localized in chloroplasts. Using the modified DNA sequence in the  one-hybrid system, the ACC repeat was shown to be essential for PTF1 binding. The  rate of psbD LRP mRNA accumulation was reduced in a T-DNA-inserted Arabidopsis  ptf1 mutant. Compared with wild-type plants, the mutant had pale green cotyledons  and its growth was inhibited under short-day conditions. These results suggest  that PTF1 is a trans-acting factor of the psbD LRP.', '2001 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.125.2.595', 'Yoshida']
