['15908591', 'Toc75 (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts, 75 kD) is the  protein translocation channel at the outer envelope membrane of plastids and was  first identified in pea (Pisum sativum) using biochemical approaches. The  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains three Toc75-related sequences,  termed atTOC75-I, atTOC75-III, and atTOC75-IV, which we studied using a range of  molecular, genetic, and biochemical techniques. Expression of atTOC75-III is  strongly regulated and at its highest level in young, rapidly expanding tissues.  By contrast, atTOC75-IV is expressed uniformly throughout development and at a  much lower level than atTOC75-III. The third sequence, atTOC75-I, is a pseudogene  that is not expressed due to a gypsy/Ty3 transposon insertion in exon 1, and  numerous nonsense, frame-shift, and splice-junction mutations. The expressed  genes, atTOC75-III and atTOC75-IV, both encode integral envelope membrane  proteins. Unlike atToc75-III, the smaller atToc75-IV protein is not processed  upon targeting to the envelope, and its insertion does not require ATP at high  concentrations. The atTOC75-III gene is essential for viability, since homozygous  atToc75-III knockout mutants (termed toc75-III) could not be identified, and  aborted seeds were observed at a frequency of approximately 25% in the siliques  of self-pollinated toc75-III heterozygotes. Homozygous toc75-III embryos were  found to abort at the two-cell stage. Homozygous atToc75-IV knockout plants  (termed toc75-IV) displayed no obvious visible phenotypes. However, structural  abnormalities were observed in the etioplasts of toc75-IV seedlings and  atTOC75-IV overexpressing lines, and toc75-IV plants were less efficient at  deetiolation than wild type. These results suggest some role for atToc75-IV  during growth in the dark.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.063289', 'Jarvis']
