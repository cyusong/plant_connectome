Our study quantified the global tree restoration potential and its associated carbon storage potential under existing climate conditions. Skidmore <i>et al</i> dispute our findings, using as reference a yearly estimation of carbon storage that could be reached by 2050. We provide a detailed answer highlighting misunderstandings in their interpretation, notably that we did not consider any time limit for the restoration process.

Tree: !restores! Carbon Storage
Skidmore <i>et al</i>: !disputes! Our Findings
Our Findings: !highlights! Misunderstandings
