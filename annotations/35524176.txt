The plant-specific GRAS transcription factors play pivotal roles in various adverse environmental conditions. Numerous GRAS genes have been explored and characterized in different plants, however, comprehensive survey on GRASs in sweetpotato is lagging. In this study, 72 putative sweetpotato IbGRAS genes with uneven distribution were isolated on 15 chromosomes and classified into 12 subfamilies supported by gene structures and motif compositions. Moreover, both tandem duplication and segmental duplication events played critical roles in the expansion of sweetpotato GRAS genes, and the collinearity between IbGRAS genes and the related orthologs from nine other plants further depicted evolutionary insights into GRAS gene family. RNA-seq analysis under salt stress and qRT-PCR detection of 12 selected IbGRAS genes demonstrated their significant and varying inductions under multiple abiotic stresses (salt, drought, heat and cold) and hormone treatments (ABA, ACC and JA). Consistently, the promoter regions of IbGRAS genes harbored a series of stress- and hormone-associated cis-acting elements. Among them, IbGRAS71, the potential candidate for breeding tolerant plants, was characterized as having transactivation activity in yeasts, while IbGRAS-2/-4/-9 did not. Moreover, a complex interaction relationship between IbGRASs was observed through the interaction network analysis and yeast two-hybrid assays. Our results laid a foundation for further functional identifications of IbGRAS genes, and multiple members may serve as potential regulators for molecular breeding of tolerant sweetpotato.
