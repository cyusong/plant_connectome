During the first days of development, maize roots showed considerable variation in the production of ethylene and the rate of elongation. As endogenous ethylene increases, root elongation decreases. When these roots are treated with the precursor of ethylene aminocyclopropane- 1-carboxylic acid (ACC), or inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis 2-aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG) or cobalt ions, the root elongation is also inhibited. Because of root growth diminishes at high or reduced endogenous ethylene concentrations, it appears that this phytohormone must be maintained in a range of concentrations to support normal root growth. In spite of its known role as inhibitor of ethylene action, silver thiosulphate (STS) does not change significantly the root elongation rate. This suggests that the action of ethylene on root elongation should occur, at least partially, by interaction with other growth regulators.
