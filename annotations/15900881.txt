Geraniol 10-hydroxylase (G10H) is a P450 containing enzyme which is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), including the Catharanthus roseus-anticancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine. It is thought that G10H has a regulatory role in MIA production. In the present paper, we report the characterization of a polyclonal serum raised against the purified G10H polypeptide. Anti-G10H IgG was able to inhibit the G10H activity and also recognized the G10H polypeptide from C. roseus and other plants producing MIAs. These results establish the usefulness of this antiserum as a biochemical tool for the study of G10H regulation.
