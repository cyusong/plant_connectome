Mutations in <i>BIG</i> gene not only produce pleiotropic phenotypes of plant development but also impair plant adaptive responses under various stresses. However, the role of <i>BIG</i> gene in sugar signaling is not known. In this study, we first found that <i>BIG</i> deficiency significantly sensitized the sugar-induced anthocyanin accumulation and the sugar-inhibited primary root growth, suggesting BIG is an important component of the sugar signaling pathway. Then we found that <i>big</i> mutant plants had higher sugar levels compared with the wild type, indicating the involvement of <i>BIG</i> gene in regulating plant sugar homeostasis. Importantly, we also found that the relative ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) was greatly enhanced by <i>BIG</i> deficiency. Overall, our work expands the known functionality of BIG and reveals its role in regulating sugar response and C/N balance. It is likely that BIG connects nutrient, light, and hormone signaling networks for regulating plant development and adaptive responses.
