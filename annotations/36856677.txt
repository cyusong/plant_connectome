Phosphorus (P) is a macronutrient necessary for plant growth and development. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency modulates the signaling pathway of the phytohormone jasmonate in Arabidopsis thaliana, but the underlying molecular mechanism currently remains elusive. Here, we confirmed that jasmonate signaling was enhanced under low Pi conditions, and the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1)-mediated pathway is critical for this process. A mechanistic investigation revealed that several JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) repressors physically interacted with the Pi signaling-related core transcription factors PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1), PHR1-LIKE2 (PHL2), and PHL3. Phenotypic analyses showed that PHR1 and its homologs positively regulated jasmonate-induced anthocyanin accumulation and root growth inhibition. PHR1 stimulated the expression of several jasmonate-responsive genes, whereas JAZ proteins interfered with its transcriptional function. Furthermore, PHR1 physically associated with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4. Genetic analyses and biochemical assays indicated that PHR1 and MYC2 synergistically increased the transcription of downstream jasmonate-responsive genes and enhanced the responses to jasmonate. Collectively, our study reveals the crucial regulatory roles of PHR1 in modulating jasmonate responses, and provides a mechanistic understanding of how PHR1 functions together with JAZ and MYC2 to maintain the appropriate level of jasmonate signaling under conditions of Pi deficiency.
