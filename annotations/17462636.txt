Stomatal complexes consist of pairs of guard cells and the pore they enclose. Reversible changes in guard cell volume alter the aperture of the pore and provide the major regulatory mechanism for control of gas exchange between the plant and the environment. Stomatal movement is facilitated by the activity of ion channels and ion transporters found in the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane of guard cells. Progress in recent years has elucidated the molecular identities of many guard cell transport proteins, and described their modulation by various cellular signal transduction components during stomatal opening and closure prompted by environmental and endogenous stimuli.
