['22631074', 'MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are signalling components highly  conserved among eukaryotes. Their diverse biological functions include cellular  differentiation and responses to different extracellular stress stimuli. Although  some substrates of MAPKs have been identified in plants, no information is  available about whether amino acids in the primary sequence other than  proline-directed phosphorylation (pS-P) contribute to kinase specificity towards  substrates. In the present study, we used a random positional peptide library to  search for consensus phosphorylation sequences for Arabidopsis MAPKs MPK3 and  MPK6. These experiments indicated a preference towards the sequence  L/P-P/X-S-P-R/K for both kinases. After bioinformatic processing, a number of  novel candidate MAPK substrates were predicted and subsequently confirmed by in  vitro kinase assays using bacterially expressed native Arabidopsis proteins as  substrates. MPK3 and MPK6 phosphorylated all proteins tested more efficiently  than did another MAPK, MPK4. These results indicate that the amino acid residues  in the primary sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site of Arabidopsis MAPK  substrates can contribute to MAPK specificity. Further characterization of one of  these new substrates confirmed that At1g80180.1 was phosphorylated in planta in a  MAPK-dependent manner. Phenotypic analyses of Arabidopsis expressing  phosphorylation site mutant forms of At1g80180.1 showed clustered stomata and  higher stomatal index in cotyledons expressing the phosphomimetic form of  At1g80180.1, providing a link between this new MAPK substrate and the defined  role for MPK3 and MPK6 in stomatal patterning.', '2012 Sep 1', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20111809', 'Andreasson']
