Glucose functions as a hormone-like signalling molecule that modulates plant growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the role of glucose in root elongation remains elusive. Our study demonstrates that high concentrations of glucose reduce the size of the root meristem zone by repressing PIN1 accumulation and thereby reducing auxin levels. In addition, we verified the involvement of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) in this process by showing that abi5-1 is less sensitive to glucose than the wild type, whereas glucose induces ABI5 expression and the inducible overexpression of ABI5 reduces the size of the root meristem zone. Furthermore, the inducible overexpression of ABI5 in PIN1::PIN1-GFP plants reduces the level of PIN1-GFP, but glucose reduces the level of PIN1-GFP to a lesser extent in abi5-1 PIN1::PIN1-GFP plants than in the PIN1::PIN1-GFP control, suggesting that ABI5 is involved in glucose-regulated PIN1 accumulation. Taken together, our data suggest that ABI5 functions in the glucose-mediated inhibition of the root meristem zone by repressing PIN1 accumulation, thus leading to reduced auxin levels in roots.
