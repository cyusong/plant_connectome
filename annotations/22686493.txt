Root pressure and plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) availability in the xylem have been recognized to participate in the refilling of embolized conduits, yet integration of the two mechanisms has not been reported in the same plant. In this study, 4-month-old seedlings of a hybrid poplar (Populus alba × Populus glandulosa) clone 84K were subjected to two contrasting soil-water treatments, with the drought treatment involving withholding of water for 17 days to reduce the soil-water content to 10% of the saturated field capacity, followed by a re-watering cycle. The percentage loss of stem hydraulic conductance (PLC) sharply increased, and stomatal conductance and photosynthesis declined in response to drought stress; these processes were gradually restored following the subsequent re-watering. Embolism was most severe in the middle portions of the stem, followed by the basal and top portions of the stems of seedlings subjected to drought stress and subsequent re-watering. Although drought stress eliminated root pressure, re-watering partially restored it in a short period of time. The expression of PIP genes in the xylem was activated by drought stress, and some PIP genes were further stimulated in the top portion after re-watering. The dynamics of root pressure and differential expression of PIP genes along the stem coincided with changes in PLC, suggesting that root pressure and PIPs work together to refill the embolized vessels. On the basis of the recovery dynamics in PLC and g(smax) (maximum stomatal conductance) after re-watering, the stomatal closure and xylem cavitation exhibited fatigue due to drought stress.
