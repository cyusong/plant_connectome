Histone deacetylases (HDAs) play an important role in transcriptional regulation of multiple biological processes. In this study, we investigated the function of HDA15 in abscisic acid (ABA) responses. We used immunopurification coupled with mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify proteins interacting with HDA15 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). HDA15 interacted with the core subunits of the MOS4-associated complex (MAC), MAC3A and MAC3B, with interaction between HDA15 and MAC3B enhanced by ABA. hda15 and mac3a/mac3b mutants were ABA-insensitive during seed germination and hyposensitive to salinity. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that HDA15 and MAC3A/MAC3B co-regulate ABA-responsive intron retention (IR). Furthermore, HDA15 reduced the histone acetylation level of genomic regions near ABA-responsive IR sites and the association of MAC3B with ABA-responsive pre-mRNA was dependent on HDA15. Our results indicate that HDA15 is involved in ABA responses by interacting with MAC3A/MAC3B to mediate splicing of introns.
