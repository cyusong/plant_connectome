['32069796', 'Chloroplast manganese transporter 1 (CMT1) and photosynthesis-affected mutant 71  (PAM71) are two membrane proteins that function sequentially to mediate the  passage of manganese across the chloroplast envelope and the thylakoid membrane.  CMT1 and PAM71 belong to a small five-member protein family in Arabidopsis  thaliana. The other three, photosynthesis-affected mutant 71 like 3 (PML3), PML4  and PML5 are not predicted to reside in chloroplast membranes. In this study, the  subcellular localization of PML3:GFP, PML4:GFP and PML5:GFP was determined using  transient and stable expression assays. PML3:GFP localizes to the Golgi  apparatus, whereas PML4:GFP and PML5:GFP are found in the endoplasmic reticulum.  We also examined patterns of PML3, PML4 and PML5 promoter activity. Although the  precise expression pattern of each promoter was unique, all three genes were  expressed in the leaf vasculature and in roots. Greenhouse grown single mutants  pml3, pml4, pml5 and the pml4/pml5 double mutant did not exhibit growth defects,  however an inspection of the root growth revealed a difference between pml3 and  the other genotypes, including wild-type, in 500 microM manganese growth conditions.  Strikingly, overexpression of PML3 resulted in a stunted growth phenotype.  Putative functions of PML3, PML4 and PML5 are discussed in light of what is known  about PAM71 and CMT1.', '2020 Feb 13', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants9020239', 'ORCID:']
