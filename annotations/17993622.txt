['17993622', 'Fatty acids are essential for membrane biosynthesis in all organisms and serve as  signaling molecules in many animals. Here, we found that saturated  very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs; C20:0 to C30:0) exogenously applied in ovule  culture medium significantly promoted cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fiber cell  elongation, whereas acetochlor  (2-chloro-N-[ethoxymethyl]-N-[2-ethyl-6-methyl-phenyl]-acetamide; ACE), which  inhibits VLCFA biosynthesis, abolished fiber growth. This inhibition was overcome  by lignoceric acid (C24:0). Elongating fibers contained significantly higher  amounts of VLCFAs than those of wild-type or fuzzless-lintless mutant ovules.  Ethylene nullified inhibition by ACE, whereas C24:0 was inactive in the presence  of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor (l-[2-aminoethoxyvinyl]-glycine),  indicating that VLCFAs may act upstream of ethylene. C24:0 induced a rapid and  significant increase in ACO (for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase)  transcript levels that resulted in substantial ethylene production. C24:0 also  promoted Ser palmitoyltransferase expression at a later stage, resulting in  increased sphingolipid biosynthesis. Application of C24:0 not only stimulated  Arabidopsis thaliana root cell growth but also complemented the cut1 phenotype.  Transgenic expression of Gh KCS13/CER6, encoding the cotton 3-ketoacyl-CoA  synthase, in the cut1 background produced similar results. Promotion of  Arabidopsis stem elongation was accompanied by increased ACO transcript levels.  Thus, VLCFAs may be involved in maximizing the extensibility of cotton fibers and  multiple Arabidopsis cell types, possibly by activating ethylene biosynthesis.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054437', 'Zhu']
