Promoter elements that contribute to high light (HL) induction of the Arabidopsis ELIP1 gene were defined using a transgenic promoter-reporter system. Two adjacent SORLIP1 elements (double SORLIP1, dSL) were found to be essential for HL induction of a GUS reporter gene. The dSL element was also found to be essential for HL induction conferred by the ELIP2 promoter. SORLIP1 elements were enriched in ELIP promoters throughout the plant kingdom, and showed a clade-specific pattern of gain or loss that suggested functionality. In addition, two G-box elements were found to redundantly contribute to HL induction conferred by the ELIP1 promoter.
