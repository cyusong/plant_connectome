Harpin HrpZ of plant-pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae elicits a hypersensitive response (HR) in some nonhost plants, but its function in the pathogenesis process is still obscure. HrpZ-interacting proteins were identified by screening a phage-display library of random peptides. HrpZ of the bean pathogen P. syringae pv. phaseolicola (HrpZPph) shows affinity to peptides with a consensus amino acid motif W(L)ARWLL(G/L). To localize the peptide-binding site, the hrpZPph gene was mutagenized with randomly placed 15-bp insertions, and the mutant proteins were screened for the peptide-binding ability. Mutations that inhibited peptide-binding localized to the central region of hrpZPph, which is separate from the previously determined HR-inducing region. Antiserum raised against one of the hrpZPph-binding peptides recognized small proteins in bean, tomato, parsley, and Arabidopsis thaliana but none in tobacco. On native protein blots, hrpZPph bound to a bean protein with similar pI as the protein recognized by the peptide antiserum. The result suggests a protein-protein interaction between the harpin and a host plant protein, possibly involved in the bacterial pathogenesis.
