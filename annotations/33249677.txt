During the sexual reproduction of higher plants, DNA methylation and transcription are broadly changed to reshape a microspore into two sperm cells (SCs) and a vegetative cell (VC). However, when and how the DNA methylation of SCs is established remains not fully understood. Here we investigate the DNA methylation (5 mC) dynamics of SC lineage and the VC in tomato using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We find the asymmetric division of the microspore gives its two daughter cells differential methylome. Compared with the generative cell (GC), the VC is hypomethylated at CG sites while hypermethylated at CHG and CHH sites, with the majority of differentially methylation regions targeted to transposable elements (TEs). SCs have a nearly identical DNA methylome to the GC, suggesting that the methylation landscape in SCs may be pre-established following the asymmetric division or inherited from the GC. The random forest classifier for predicting gene and TE expression shows that methylation within the gene body is a more powerful predictor for gene expression. Among all tested samples, gene and TE expression in the microspore may be more predictable by DNA methylation. Our results depict an intact DNA methylome landscape of SC lineage in higher plants, and reveal that the impact of DNA methylation on transcription is variant in different cell types.
