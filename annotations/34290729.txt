In polyploids, whole genome duplication (WGD) played a significant role in genome expansion, evolution and diversification. Many gene families are expanded following polyploidization, with the duplicated genes functionally diversified by neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization. These mechanisms may support adaptation and have likely contributed plant survival during evolution. Flowering time is an important trait in plants, which affects critical features, such as crop yields. The flowering-time gene family is one of the largest expanded gene families in plants, with its members playing various roles in plant development. Here, we performed genome-wide identification and comparative analysis of flowering-time genes in three palnt families i.e., Malvaceae, Brassicaceae, and Solanaceae, which indicate these genes were expanded following the event/s of polyploidization. Duplicated genes have been retained during evolution, although genome reorganization occurred in their flanking regions. Further investigation of sequence conservation and similarity network analyses provide evidence for functional diversification of duplicated genes during evolution. These functionally diversified genes play important roles in plant development and provide advantages to plants for adaptation and survival in response to environmental changes encountered during evolution. Collectively, we show that flowering-time genes were expanded following polyploidization and retained as large gene family by providing advantages from functional diversification during evolution.
