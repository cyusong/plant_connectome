Ubiquitination is a major mechanism of eukaryotic posttranslational protein turnover that has been implicated in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated drought stress response. Here, we isolated T-DNA insertion mutant lines in which ABA-insensitive RING protein 5 (AtAIRP5) was suppressed, resulting in hyposensitive ABA-mediated germination compared to wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. A homology search revealed that AtAIRP5 is identical to gibberellin (GA) receptor RING E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase (GARU), which downregulates GA signaling by degrading the GA receptor GID1, and thus AtAIRP5 was renamed AtAIRP5/GARU. The atairp5/garu knockout progeny were impaired in ABA-dependent stomatal closure and were markedly more susceptible to drought stress than wild-type plants, indicating a positive role for AtAIRP5/GARU in the ABA-mediated drought stress response. Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, target ubiquitination, and in vitro and in planta degradation assays identified serine carboxypeptidase-like1 (AtSCPL1), which belongs to the clade 1A AtSCPL family, as a ubiquitinated target protein of AtAIRP5/GARU. atscpl1 single and atairp5/garu-1 atscpl1-2 double mutant plants were more tolerant to drought stress than wild-type plants in an ABA-dependent manner, suggesting that AtSCPL1 is genetically downstream of AtAIRP5/GARU. After drought treatment, the endogenous ABA levels in atscpl1 and atairp5/garu-1 atscpl1-2 mutant leaves were higher than those in wild-type and atairp5/garu leaves. Overall, our results suggest that AtAIRP5/GARU RING E3 Ub ligase functions as a positive regulator of the ABA-mediated drought response by promoting the degradation of AtSCPL1.
