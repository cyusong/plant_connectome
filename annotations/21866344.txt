['21866344', 'Ammonium (NH(4)(+)) toxicity is a significant agricultural problem globally,  compromising crop growth and productivity in many areas. However, the molecular  mechanisms of NH(4)(+) toxicity are still poorly understood, in part due to a  lack of valuable genetic resources. Here, a novel Arabidopsis mutant, amos2  (ammonium overly sensitive 2), displaying hypersensitivity to NH(4) (+) in both  shoots and roots, was isolated. The mutant exhibits the hallmarks of NH(4)(+)  toxicity at significantly elevated levels: severely suppressed shoot biomass,  increased leaf chlorosis, and inhibition of lateral root formation. Amos2  hypersensitivity is associated with excessive NH(4)(+) accumulation in shoots and  a reduction in tissue potassium (K(+)), calcium (Ca(2+)), and magnesium (Mg(2+)).  We show that the lesion is specific to the NH(4)(+) ion, is independent of  NH(4)(+) metabolism, and can be partially rescued by elevated external K(+). The  amos2 lesion was mapped to a 16-cM interval on top of chromosome 1, where no  similar mutation has been previously mapped. Our study identifies a novel locus  controlling cation homeostasis under NH(4)(+) stress and provides a tool for the  future identification of critical genes involved in the development of NH(4)(+)  toxicity.', '2012 Feb', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-011-1504-y', 'Shi']
