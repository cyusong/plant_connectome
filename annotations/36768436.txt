This review aims to consider retrospectively the available data on the coding properties of pri-microRNAs and the regulatory functions of their open reading frames (ORFs) and the encoded peptides (miPEPs). Studies identifying miPEPs and analyzing the fine molecular mechanisms of their functional activities are reviewed together with a brief description of the methods to identify pri-miRNA ORFs and the encoded protein products. Generally, miPEPs have been identified in many plant species of several families and in a few animal species. Importantly, molecular mechanisms of the miPEP action are often quite different between flowering plants and metazoan species. Requirement for the additional studies in these directions is highlighted by alternative findings concerning negative or positive regulation of pri-miRNA/miRNA expression by miPEPs in plants and animals. Additionally, the question of how miPEPs are distributed in non-flowering plant taxa is very important for understanding the evolutionary origin of such micropeptides. Evidently, further extensive studies are needed to explore the functions of miPEPs and the corresponding ORFs and to understand the full set of their roles in eukaryotic organisms. Thus, we address the most recent integrative views of different genomic, physiological, and molecular aspects concerning the expression of miPEPs and their possible fine functions.
