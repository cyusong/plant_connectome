Plant seeds and fruits are the main source for tocochromanols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) collectively known as Vitamin E in human nutrition. Seeds are particularly rich in gamma-tocopherol. The reason for the abundance of gamma-tocopherol in seeds is not yet clear. We analysed the influence of endogenous gamma-tocopherols on early development of seedlings from various barley cultivars. For this purpose progression of seedling development was monitored by the mean root length 48 h after imbibition. Our observations suggest that endogenous gamma-tocopherol has a negative impact on seedling development by controlling germination and postgermination events. We propose that gamma-tocopherol exerts its influence on seedling development by controlling the content of nitric oxide (NO) in germinating seeds.
