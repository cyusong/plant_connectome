Polish wheat (Triticum polonicum) is a unique tetraploid wheat species characterized by an elongated outer glume. The genetic control of the long-glume trait by a single semi-dominant locus, P1 (from Polish wheat), was established more than 100 years ago, but the underlying causal gene and molecular nature remain elusive. Here, we report the isolation of VRT-A2, encoding an SVP-clade MADS-box transcription factor, as the P1 candidate gene. Genetic evidence suggests that in T. polonicum, a naturally occurring sequence rearrangement in the intron-1 region of VRT-A2 leads to ectopic expression of VRT-A2 in floral organs where the long-glume phenotype appears. Interestingly, we found that the intron-1 region is a key ON/OFF molecular switch for VRT-A2 expression, not only because it recruits transcriptional repressors, but also because it confers intron-mediated transcriptional enhancement. Genotypic analyses using wheat accessions indicated that the P1 locus is likely derived from a single natural mutation in tetraploid wheat, which was subsequently inherited by hexaploid T. petropavlovskyi. Taken together, our findings highlight the promoter-proximal intron variation as a molecular basis for phenotypic differentiation, and thus species formation in Triticum plants.
