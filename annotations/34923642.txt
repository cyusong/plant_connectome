The genomic diversity underpinning high ecological and species diversity in the green algae (Chlorophyta) remains little known. Here, we aimed to track genome evolution in the Chlorophyta, focusing on loss and gain of homologous genes, and lineage-specific innovations of the core Chlorophyta. We generated a high-quality nuclear genome for pedinophyte YPF701, a sister lineage to others in the core Chlorophyta and incorporated this genome in a comparative analysis with 25 other genomes from diverse Viridiplantae taxa. The nuclear genome of pedinophyte YPF701 has an intermediate size and gene number between those of most prasinophytes and the remainder of the core Chlorophyta. Our results suggest positive selection for genome streamlining in the Pedinophyceae, independent from genome minimisation observed among prasinophyte lineages. Genome expansion was predicted along the branch leading to the UTC clade (classes Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae) after divergence from their last common ancestor with pedinophytes, with genomic novelty implicated in a range of basic biological functions. Results emphasise multiple independent signals of genome minimisation within the Chlorophyta, as well as the genomic novelty arising before diversification in the UTC clade, which may underpin the success of this species-rich clade in a diversity of habitats.
