In a plant, the progression from vegetative growth to reproductive growth is called the floral transition. Over the past several decades, the floral transition has been shown to be determined not by a single gene but by a complicated gene network. This important biological process, however, has not been investigated at a genome-wide network level. We collected Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein-protein interaction data from several public databases and compiled them into a genome-wide Arabidopsis interactome. Then, we integrated gene expression profiles during the Arabidopsis floral transition process into the established protein-protein interaction network to identify two types of anticorrelated modules associated with vegetative and reproductive growth. Generally, the vegetative modules are conserved in plants, while the reproductive modules are more specific to advanced plants. The existence of floral transition switches demonstrates that vegetative and reproductive processes might be coordinated by the interacting interface of these modules. Our work also provides many candidates for mediating the interactions between these modules, which may play important roles during the Arabidopsis vegetative/reproductive switch.
