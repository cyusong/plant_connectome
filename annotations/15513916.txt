The transport of proteins into the plastid is a process that faces changing cellular needs such as the situation found in different plant organs or developing tissues. The plastid translocon must therefore be responsive to the changing cell environment to deliver efficiently different arrays of structurally diverse proteins. Although the Tic40-related envelope proteins appear to be translocon components designed to address the varying needs of protein translocation, details of their involvement remain elusive. This study was thus designed to combine plant-based experiments and yeast mitochondrion-based approaches for unveiling clues related to how the Tic40 components may behave during the protein translocation process. The main findings related to how Tic40 proteins may work are: 1) natural fluctuations are apparent in developing tissues, in different organs of the same plant, and in different species; 2) transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings can tolerate functionally a wide range of variations in Tic40 levels, from partial suppression to excessive production; 3) the Tic40 proteins themselves exhibit configurational changes in their association with yeast mitochondria in response to different carbon sources; 4) the presence of Tic40 proteins in yeast mitochondria influences regulatory aspects of the mitochondrial translocon; and 5) the Tic40 proteins associate with mitochondrial translocon components involved in regulatory-like events. The combined data provide evidence that Tic40 proteins possess modulating capabilities.
