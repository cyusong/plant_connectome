In our recent paper in Plant Cell, we examined the phenomenon of non-cell autonomous RNA silencing through a genetic screen of the requirements for cell-to-cell signal movement.1 We found a requirement for components of the nuclear and trans-acting RNA silencing pathways in blocking or enhancing the spread of silencing and identified a new SNF2 domain-containing protein, CLSY1, in the nuclear RNA silencing pathway. Here we discuss our data from a broader perspective of other recently published papers.
