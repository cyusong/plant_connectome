['27001831', 'A peptide hormone, root meristem growth factor (RGF), regulates root meristem  development through the PLETHORA (PLT) stem cell transcription factor pathway,  but it remains to be uncovered how extracellular RGF signals are transduced to  the nucleus. Here we identified, using a combination of a custom-made receptor  kinase (RK) expression library and exhaustive photoaffinity labeling, three  leucine-rich repeat RKs (LRR-RKs) that directly interact with RGF peptides in  Arabidopsis These three LRR-RKs, which we named RGFR1, RGFR2, and RGFR3, are  expressed in root tissues including the proximal meristem, the elongation zone,  and the differentiation zone. The triple rgfr mutant was insensitive to  externally applied RGF peptide and displayed a short root phenotype accompanied  by a considerable decrease in meristematic cell number. In addition, PLT1 and  PLT2 protein gradients, observed as a gradual gradient decreasing toward the  elongation zone from the stem cell area in wild type, steeply declined at the  root tip in the triple mutant. Because RGF peptides have been shown to create a  diffusion-based concentration gradient extending from the stem cell area, our  results strongly suggest that RGFRs mediate the transformation of an RGF peptide  gradient into a PLT protein gradient in the proximal meristem, thereby acting as  key regulators of root meristem development.', '2016 Apr 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1522639113', 'Matsubayashi']
