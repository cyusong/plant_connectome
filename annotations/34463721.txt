Cryptochromes (crys) are photolyase-like blue-light receptors first discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana and later identified in all major evolutionary lineages. Crys are involved in not only blue light responses but also in temperature responses; however, whether and how cry protein stability is regulated by temperature remains unknown. Here, we show that cry2 protein abundance is modulated by ambient temperature and cry2 protein is degraded under low ambient temperature via the 26S proteasome. Consistent with this, cry2 shows high levels of ubiquitination under low ambient temperatures. Interestingly, cry2 degradation at low ambient temperatures occurs only under blue light and not under red light or dark conditions, indicating blue-light-dependent degradation of cry2 at low ambient temperature. Furthermore, low ambient temperature promotes physical interaction of Light-Response Bric-a-Brack/Tramtrack/Broad (LRB) proteins with cry2 to modulate its ubiquitination and protein stability in response to ambient temperature. LRBs promote high-temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation by modulating the protein stability of cry2 protein. These results indicate that cry2 accumulation is regulated by not only blue light but also ambient temperature, and LRBs are responsible for cry2 degradation at low ambient temperature. The stabilization of cry2 by high temperature makes cry2 a better negative regulator of temperature responses.
