The interaction between exogenous IBA with sucrose, light and ventilation, alters the expression of ARFs and Aux/IAA genes in in vitro grown Carica papaya plantlets. In vitro papaya plantlets normally show low rooting percentages during their ex vitro establishment that eventually leads to high mortality when transferred to field conditions. Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) auxin is normally added to culture medium, to achieve adventitious root formation on in vitro papaya plantlets. However, the molecular mechanisms occurring when IBA is added to the medium under varying external conditions of sugar, light and ventilation have not been studied. Auxin response factors (ARF) are auxin-transcription activators, while auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) are auxin-transcription repressors, that modulate key components involved in auxin signaling in plants. In the present study, we identified 12 CpARF and 18 CpAux/IAA sequences in the papaya genome. The cis-acting regulatory elements associated to those CpARFs and CpAux/IAA gene families were associated with stress and hormone responses. Furthermore, a comprehensive characterization and expression profiling analysis was performed on 6 genes involved in rhizogenesis formation (CpARF5, 6, 7 and CpAux/IAA11, 13, 14) from in vitro papaya plantlets exposed to different rhizogenesis-inducing treatments. In general, intact in vitro plantlets were not able to produce adventitious roots, when IBA (2 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) was added to the culture medium; they became capable to produce roots and increased their ex-vitro survival. However, the best rooting and survival % were obtained when IBA was added in combination with adequate sucrose supply (20 g L<sup>-1</sup>), increased light intensity (750 µmol photon m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and ventilation systems within the culture vessel. Interestingly, it was precisely under those conditions that promoted high rooting and survival %, where the highest expression of CpARFs, but the lowest expression of CpAux/IAAs occurred. One interesting case occurred when in vitro plantlets were exposed to high levels of light in the absence of added IBA, as high rooting and survival occurred, even though no exogenous auxin was added. In fact, plantlets from this treatment showed the right expression profile between auxin activators/repressors genes, in both stem base and root tissues.
