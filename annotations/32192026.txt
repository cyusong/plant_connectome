['32192026', "Chloroplast RNAs are stabilized and processed by a multitude of nuclear-encoded  RNA-binding proteins, often in response to external stimuli like light and  temperature. A particularly interesting RNA-based regulation occurs with the psbA  mRNA, which shows light-dependent translation. Recently, the chloroplast  ribonucleoprotein CP33B was identified as a ligand of the psbA mRNA. We here  characterized the interaction of CP33B with chloroplast RNAs in greater detail  using a combination of RIP-chip, quantitative dot-blot, and RNA-Bind-n-Seq  experiments. We demonstrate that CP33B prefers psbA over all other chloroplast  RNAs and associates with the vast majority of the psbA transcript pool. The RNA  sequence target motif, determined in vitro, does not fully explain CP33B's  preference for psbA, suggesting that there are other determinants of specificity  in vivo.", '2020 Mar 17', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants9030367', 'ORCID:']
