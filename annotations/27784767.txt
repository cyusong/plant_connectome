['27784767', 'Nitrogen-fixation-subunit-U (NFU)-type proteins have been shown to be involved in  the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. We investigated the molecular function of  a chloroplastic NFU-type iron-sulfur scaffold protein, NFU3, in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) using genetics approaches. Loss-of-function mutations in  the NFU3 gene caused yellow pigmentation in leaves, reductions in plant size,  leaf size, and growth rate, delay in flowering and seeding, and decreases in seed  production. Biochemical and physiological analyses indicated that these defects  are due to the substantial reductions in the abundances of 4Fe-4S-containing  photosystem I (PSI) core subunits PsaA (where Psa stands for PSI), PsaB, and PsaC  and a nearly complete loss of PSI activity. In addition to the substantial  decreases in the amounts of PSI core proteins, the content of 3Fe-4S-containing  ferredoxin-dependent glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferases declined  significantly in the nfu3 mutants. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the  recombinant NFU3 protein showed features characteristic of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S  clusters, and the in vitro reconstitution experiment indicated an iron-sulfur  scaffold function of NFU3. These data demonstrate that NFU3 is involved in the  assembly and transfer of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters and that NFU3 is required for  the accumulation of 4Fe-4S- and 3Fe-4S-containing proteins, especially  4Fe-4S-containing PSI core subunits, in the Arabidopsis chloroplast.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.01564', 'ORCID:']
