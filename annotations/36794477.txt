As sessile organisms, plants are particularly affected by climate change and will face more frequent and extreme temperature variations in the future. Plants have developed a diverse range of mechanisms allowing them to perceive and respond to these environmental constraints, which requires sophisticated signalling mechanisms. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in plants exposed to various stress conditions including high temperatures and are presumed to be involved in stress response reactions. The diversity of ROS-generating pathways and the ability of ROS to propagate from cell to cell and to diffuse through cellular compartments and even across membranes between subcellular compartments put them at the centre of signalling pathways. In addition, their capacity to modify the cellular redox status and to modulate functions of target proteins, notably through cysteine oxidation, show their involvement in major stress response transduction pathways. ROS scavenging and thiol reductase systems also participate in the transmission of oxidation-dependent stress signals. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the functions of ROS and oxidoreductase systems in integrating high temperature signals, towards the activation of stress responses and developmental acclimation mechanisms.
