Tomato leaf curl Yunnan virus (TLCYnV)-encoded C4 protein induces the upregulation of the hypersensitive induced reaction 1 (HIR1) gene but interferes with the HIR1-mediated hypersensitive response (HR). HIR1 self-interaction is essential for the HIR1-induced HR. TLCYnV C4 impairs the HIR1 self-interaction and concomitantly increases the amount of Leucine-Rich Repeat protein 1 (LRR1), a modulator of HIR1, which binds to HIR1. LRR1 promotes the degradation of HIR1, compromising the HIR1-mediated HR. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms employed by a viral protein to counter host resistance through the cooption of the host regulatory system.
