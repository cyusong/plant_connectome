['23064408', 'Ammonium (NH(4)(+)) is a ubiquitous intermediate of nitrogen metabolism but is  notorious for its toxic effects on most organisms. Extensive studies of the  underlying mechanisms of NH(4)(+) toxicity have been reported in plants, but it  is poorly understood how plants acclimate to high levels of NH(4)(+). Here, we  identified an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant, ammonium overly  sensitive1 (amos1), that displays severe chlorosis under NH(4)(+) stress.  Map-based cloning shows amos1 to carry a mutation in EGY1 (for  ethylene-dependent, gravitropism-deficient, and yellow-green-like protein1),  which encodes a plastid metalloprotease. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that  among the genes activated in response to NH(4)(+), 90% are regulated dependent on  AMOS1/EGY1. Furthermore, 63% of AMOS1/EGY1-dependent NH(4)(+)-activated genes  contain an ACGTG motif in their promoter region, a core motif of abscisic acid  (ABA)-responsive elements. Consistent with this, our physiological,  pharmacological, transcriptomic, and genetic data show that ABA signaling is a  critical, but not the sole, downstream component of the AMOS1/EGY1-dependent  pathway that regulates the expression of NH(4)(+)-responsive genes and maintains  chloroplast functionality under NH(4)(+) stress. Importantly, abi4 mutants  defective in ABA-dependent and retrograde signaling, but not ABA-deficient  mutants, mimic leaf NH(4)(+) hypersensitivity of amos1. In summary, our findings  suggest that an NH(4)(+)-responsive plastid retrograde pathway, which depends on  AMOS1/EGY1 function and integrates with ABA signaling, is required for the  regulation of expression of NH(4)(+)-responsive genes that maintain chloroplast  integrity in the presence of high NH(4)(+) levels.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.206508', 'Shi']
