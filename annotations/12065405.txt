['12065405', 'Embryo dormancy in flowering plants is an important dispersal mechanism that  promotes survival of the seed through time. The subsequent transition to  germination is a critical control point regulating initiation of vegetative  growth. Here we show that the Arabidopsis COMATOSE (CTS) locus is required for  this transition, and acts, at least in part, by profoundly affecting the  metabolism of stored lipids. CTS encodes a peroxisomal protein of the ATP binding  cassette (ABC) transporter class with significant identity to the human X-linked  adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). Like X-ALD patients, cts mutant embryos and  seedlings exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes associated with perturbation in fatty  acid metabolism. CTS expression transiently increases shortly after imbibition  during germination, but not in imbibed dormant seeds, and genetic analyses show  that CTS is negatively regulated by loci that promote embryo dormancy through  multiple independent pathways. Our results demonstrate that CTS regulates  transport of acyl CoAs into the peroxisome, and indicate that regulation of CTS  function is a major control point for the switch between the opposing  developmental programmes of dormancy and germination.', '2002 Jun 17', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/cdf300', 'Holdsworth']
