The role of NADPH oxidases (NOXs) in pathogenesis and development in the Curvularia leaf spot agent <i>Curvularia lunata</i> remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified <i>C</i>. <i>lunata</i> ClNOX2, which localized to the plasma membrane and was responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Scavenging the ROS production inhibited the conidial germination and appressorial formation. The <i>ClNOX2</i> and <i>ClBRN1</i> deletion mutants were defective in 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin accumulation, appressorial formation, and cellulase synthesis and exhibited lower virulence. However, disruption of the <i>ClNOX2</i> and <i>ClBRN1</i> genes facilitated hyphal growth, enhanced stress adaptation to cell-wall-disrupting agents, and promoted developmental processes such as conidiation, conidial germination, and pseudothecium and ascus formation. Interestingly, loss of <i>ClM1</i>, the cell wall integrity (CWI) mitogen-activated protein kinase gene in <i>C</i>. <i>lunata</i>, led to morphology and pathogenicity phenotypes similar to <i>ClNOX2</i> and <i>ClBRN1</i> deletion mutants such as abnormal conidia, fewer appressoria, less melanin, increased hyphal growth, and enhanced tolerance to Congo red (CR). These results indicated that the <i>ClNOX2</i> gene plays an important role in <i>C. lunata</i> development and virulence via regulating intracellular DHN melanin biosynthesis. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR revealed that the <i>ClNOX2</i>-related ROS signaling pathway and <i>ClM1</i>-mediated CWI signaling pathway are cross-linked in regulating DHN melanin biosynthesis. Our findings provide new insights into how <i>ClNOX2</i> participates in pathogenesis and development in hemibiotrophic plant fungal pathogens.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).
