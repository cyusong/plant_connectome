Despite frequent co-occurrence of drought and heat stress, the molecular mechanisms governing plant responses to these stresses in combination have not often been studied. This is particularly evident in non-model, perennial plants. We conducted large scale physiological and transcriptome analyses to identify genes and pathways associated with grapevine response to drought and/or heat stress during stress progression and recovery. We identified gene clusters with expression correlated to leaf temperature and water stress and five hub genes for the combined stress co-expression network. Several differentially expressed genes were common to the individual and combined stresses, but the majority were unique to the individual or combined stress treatments. These included heat-shock proteins, mitogen-activated kinases, sugar metabolizing enzymes, and transcription factors, while phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and histone modifying genes were unique to the combined stress treatment. Following physiological recovery, differentially expressed genes were found only in plants under heat stress, both alone and combined with drought. Taken collectively, our results suggest that the effect of the combined stress on physiology and gene expression is more severe than that of individual stresses, but not simply additive, and that epigenetic chromatin modifications may play an important role in grapevine responses to combined drought and heat stress.
