In Brassicaceae, the requirement for vernalization is conferred by high expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). The expression of FLC is known to be repressed by prolonged exposure to cold. Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) cultivars can be classified into spring, winter, and semi-winter crop types, depending on their respective vernalization requirements. In addition to two known distinct transposon insertion events, here we identified a 4.422 kb hAT and a 5.625 kb long interspersed nuclear element transposon insertion within BnaFLC.A10, and a 810 bp miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in BnaFLC.A2. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that these insertions lead to distinct gene expression patterns and contribute differentially to the vernalization response. Transgenic and haplotype analysis indicated that the known 621 bp MITE in the promoter region of BnaFLC.A10 is a transcriptional enhancer that appears to be the main determinant of rapeseed vernalization, and has contributed to the adaptation of rapeseed in winter cultivation environments. In the absence of this transposon insertion, the functional allele of BnaFLC.A2 is a major determinant of vernalization demand. Thus, the combination of BnaFLC.A10 carrying the 621 bp MITE insertion and a functional BnaFLC.A2 appears necessary to establish the winter rapeseed crop phenotype.
