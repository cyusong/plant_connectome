Wheat growing regions and seasons are diverse, mandating different varietal adaptation and management practices. Grain yield is the primary target for soft-red winter (SRW) wheat, due to lower protein content requirements. The growing season for SRW wheat in the eastern United States takes up to 9 months under variable environments, highlighting the importance of variety and management. In this study, we present the results of a 2-year field-based investigation of yield response of 30 wheat lines to different nitrogen treatments by dissecting yield to its components. For 5 out of the 30 lines, we performed in-tissue nitrogen analysis. Spring nitrogen (N) treatments were two levels of 0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (low N) and 112 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (high N). On average, application of 112 kg N in the spring, in addition to fall N fertilizer, increased phytomass by 22% at maturity, enhanced fertile tiller numbers by 16%, and increased grain yield by 18% that coincided with a 26% increase in grain number per unit area. N in the grains, or the nitrogen harvest index, was lower (36% of total) in high N than in low N (40% of total) treatment, which indicated plants did not increase the in-grain utilization of N. The 18% higher grain yield with 112 kg N treatment occurred without considerable change in grain N content. However, lines with greater biomass produced greater yields in low N. Therefore, increasing tiller numbers and grain numbers for SRW wheat are the targeted traits for improving grain yield under N management, with less emphasis on the utilization of N in grains because N content is not critically influential for the marketability of soft wheat grains.
