['26178734', 'Vascular tissues are very important for providing both mechanical strength and  long-distance transport. The molecular mechanisms of regulation of vascular  tissue development are still not fully understood. In this study we identified  ANAC005 as a membrane-associated NAC family transcription factor that regulates  vascular tissue development. Reporter gene assays showed that ANAC005 was  expressed mainly in the vascular tissues. Increased expression of ANAC005 protein  in transgenic Arabidopsis caused dwarf phenotype, reduced xylem differentiation,  decreased lignin content, repression of a lignin biosynthetic gene and genes  related to cambium and primary wall, but activation of genes related to the  secondary wall. Expression of a dominant repressor fusion of ANAC005 had overall  the opposite effects on vascular tissue differentiation and lignin synthetic gene  expression. The ANAC005-GFP fusion protein was localized at the plasma membrane,  whereas deletion of the last 20 amino acids, which are mostly basic, caused its  nuclear localization. These results indicate that ANAC005 is a cell  membrane-associated transcription factor that inhibits xylem tissue development  in Arabidopsis.', '2016 May', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12379', 'Zhu']
