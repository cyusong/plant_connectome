Hemoglobin gene expression is upregulated during hypoxia. To determine whether the induction occurs via similar mechanisms that have been proposed for other hypoxically induced proteins, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) aleurone layers were treated with various agents that interfere with known components of signal transduction. Ruthenium red, an organelle calcium channel blocker, inhibited anoxia-induced hemoglobin (Hb) and alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (Adh) gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The divalent ionophore, A23187, combined with EGTA also dramatically reduced anoxia-induced Hb and Adh expression. Normal induction of Hb by anoxia in EGTA-treated cells was restored by adding exogenous Ca2+ but not Mg2+, suggesting that cytosolic calcium is involved in Hb and Adh regulation. W-7, a calmodulin antagonist, did not affect anaerobically induced Hb and Adh expression even though it induced Hb under aerobiosis. A3, a protein kinase inhibitor, did not significantly affect anaerobically induced Hb, but did significantly upregulate the gene under aerobic conditions. The results indicate that calmodulin-independent anaerobic alteration in cytosolic Ca2+ and protein dephosphorylation are factors in Hb induction.
