The accumulation of H2O2 by NaCl was observed in the roots of rice seedlings. Treatment with NaCl caused an increase in the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) and the expression of OsAPX and OsGR in rice roots. Exogenously applied H2O2 also enhanced the activities of APX and GR and the expression of OsAPX and OsGR in rice roots. The accumulation of H2O2 in rice roots in response to NaCl was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). However, DPI, IMD, and dimethylthiourea, a H2O2 trap, did not reduce NaCl-enhanced activities of APX and GR and expression of OsAPX and OsGR. It appears that H2O2 is not involved in the regulation of NaCl-induced APX and GR activities and OsAPX and OsGR expression in rice roots.
