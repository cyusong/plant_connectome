Nine genes that encode proteins of the MAP65 family have been identified in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. In this study, we reported that AtMAP65-2, a member of the AtMAP65 family, could strongly stabilize microtubules (MTs). Bacterially-expressed AtMAP65-2 fusion proteins induced the formation of large MT bundles in vitro. Although AtMAP65-2 showed little effect on MT assembly or nucleation, AtMAP65-2 greatly stabilized MTs that were subjected to low-temperature treatment in vitro. Analyses of truncated versions of AtMAP65-2 indicated that the region that encompassed amino acids 495-578, which formed a flexible extended loop, played a crucial role in the stabilization of MTs. Analysis of suspension-cultured Arabidopsis cells that expressed the AtMAP65-2-GFP fusion protein showed that AtMAP65-2 co-localized with MTs throughout the cell cycle. Cortical MTs that were decorated with AtMAP65-2-GFP were more resistant to the MT-disrupting drug propyzamide and to ice treatment in vivo. The results of this study demonstrate that AtMAP65-2 strongly stabilizes MTs and is involved in the regulation of MT organization and dynamics.
