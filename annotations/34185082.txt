Shoot-tip abortion is a very common phenomenon in some perennial woody plants and it affects the height, architecture, and branch orientation of trees; however, little is currently known about the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we identified a gene in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) encoding a KNAT-like protein (CsKN1) and found high expression in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Overexpression of CsKN1 in transgenic plants prolonged the vegetative growth of SAMs, whilst silencing resulted in either the loss or inhibition of SAMs. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that CsKN1 interacted with another citrus KNAT-like protein (CsKN2), and overexpression of CsKN2 in lemon and tobacco caused an extreme multiple-meristem phenotype. Overexpression of CsKN1 and CsKN2 in transgenic plants resulted in the differential expression of numerous genes related to hormone biosynthesis and signaling. Yeast one-hybrid analysis revealed that the CsKN1-CsKN2 complex can bind to the promoter of citrus floral meristem gene LEAFY (CsLFY) and inhibit its expression. These results indicated that CsKN1 might prolong the vegetative growth period of SAMs by delaying flowering. In addition, an ethylene-responsive factor (CsERF) was found to bind to the CsKN1 promoter and suppresses its transcription. Overexpression of CsERF in Arabidopsis increased the contents of ethylene and reactive oxygen species, which might induce the occurrence of shoot-tip abscission. On the basis of our results, we conclude that CsKN1 and CsKN2 might work cooperatively to regulate the shoot-tip abscission process in spring shoots of sweet orange.
