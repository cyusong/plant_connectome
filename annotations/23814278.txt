Drought is a major environmental stress factor that limits agricultural production worldwide. Plants employ complex mechanisms of gene regulation in response to drought stress. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs that are increasingly being recognized as important modulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Many miRNAs have been shown to be involved in drought stress responses, including ABA response, auxin signalling, osmoprotection, and antioxidant defence, by downregulating the respective target genes encoding regulatory and functional proteins. This review summarizes recent molecular studies on the miRNAs involved in the regulation of drought-responsive genes, with emphasis on miRNA-associated regulatory networks involved in drought stress response.
