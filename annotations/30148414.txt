Tip-growing cells provide a useful model system for studying the underlying mechanisms of plant cell growth. The apical growth of root hairs is dependent on the microfilament skeleton, and auxin is an important regulator of root hair development. We functionally characterized actin bundling proteins AtFIM4 and AtFIM5, which were preferentially expressed in tip-growing cells such as pollen tubes and root hairs. The morphology and length of root hairs in atfim4/atfim5 double mutant line had obvious defects. In addition, we found the growth of root hairs of atfim4/atfim5 double mutant was insensitive to exogenous IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) treatment. So we consider that AtFIM4 and AtFIM5 act together to regulate the growth of root hair in an auxin-insensitive way.

AtFIM4: !regulates! root hair growth
AtFIM5: !regulates! root hair growth
AtFIM4/AtFIM5: !insensitive to! auxin treatment
AtFIM4/AtFIM5: !affects! root hair morphology and length
