Nutrient fluctuations are more a rule rather than an exception in the life of sessile organisms such as plants. Despite this constraint that adds up to abiotic and biotic stresses, plants are able to accomplish their life cycle thanks to an efficient signaling network that reciprocally controls nutrient acquisition and use with growth and development. The majority of nutrients are acquired by the root system where multiple local signaling pathways that rely on nutrient-sensing systems are implemented to direct root growth toward soil resources. Moreover, long-distance signaling plays an essential role in integrating nutrient availability at the whole-plant level and adjusting nutrient acquisition to plant growth requirements. By studying the signaling network for single mineral nutrients, several long-distance signals traveling between roots and shoots and taking a diversity of forms have been identified and are summarized here. However, the nutritional environment is multifactorial, adding a tremendous complexity for our understanding of the nutrient signaling network as a unique system. For instance, long-distance signals are expected to support this nutrient cross-talk in part, but the mechanisms are still largely unknown. Therefore, the involvement of possible long-distance signals as conveyers of nutrient cross-talk is discussed here together with approaches and strategies that are now considered to build a picture from the nutrient signaling puzzle.
