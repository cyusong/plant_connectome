Rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is one of the most important diseases of rice. Elicitors secreted by <i>M. oryzae</i> play important roles in the interaction with rice to facilitate fungal infection and disease development. In recent years, several elicitor proteins have been identified in <i>M. oryzae</i>, and their functions and importance are increasingly appreciated. In this study, we purified a novel elicitor-activity protein from <i>M. oryzae</i>, which was further identified as a vanadium chloroperoxidase (MoVcpo) by MAIDL TOF/TOF MS. The purified MoVcpo induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in host cells, up-regulated the expression of multiple defense-related genes, thus significantly enhancing rice resistance against <i>M. oryzae</i>. These results suggested that MoVcpo functions as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to trigger rice immunity. Furthermore, <i>MoVcpo</i> was highly expressed in the early stage of <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Deletion of <i>MoVcpo</i> affected spore formation, conidia germination, cell wall integrity, and sensitivity to osmotic stress, but not fungal growth. Interestingly, compared with the wild-type, inoculation with <i>MoVcpo</i> deletion mutant on rice led to markedly induced ROS accumulation, increased expression of defense-related genes, but also lower disease severity, suggesting that MoVcpo acts as both an elicitor activating plant immune responses and a virulence factor facilitating fungal infection. These findings reveal a novel role for vanadium chloroperoxidase in fungal pathogenesis and deepen our understanding of <i>M. oryzae</i>-rice interactions.
