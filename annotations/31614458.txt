Small RNAs function to regulate plant defense responses to pathogens. We previously showed that miR825 and miR825* downregulate <i>Bacillus cereus</i> AR156 (AR156)-triggered systemic resistance to <i>Pseudomonassyringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<i>Arabidopsis</i>). Here, Northern blotting revealed that miR825 and miR825* were more strongly downregulated in wild type <i>Arabidopsis</i> Col-0 (Col-0) plants pretreated with AR156 than in nontreated plants upon <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>B. cinerea</i>) B1301 infection. Furthermore, compared with Col-0, transgenic plants with attenuated miR825 and miR825* expression were more resistant to <i>B. cinerea</i> B1301, yet miR825- and miR825*-overexpressing (OE) plants were more susceptible to the pathogen. With AR156 pretreatment, the transcription of four defense-related genes (<i>PR1</i>, <i>PR2</i>, <i>PR5</i>, and <i>PDF1.2</i>) and cellular defense responses (hydrogen peroxide production and callose deposition) were faster and stronger in miR825 and miR825* knockdown lines but weaker in their OE plants than in Col-0 plants upon pathogen attack. Also, AR156 pretreatment caused stronger phosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6 and expression of <i>FRK1</i> and <i>WRKY53</i> genes upon <i>B. cinerea</i> B1301 inoculation in miR825 and miR825* knockdown plants than in Col-0 plants. Additionally, the assay of agrobacterium-mediated transient co-expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> confirmed that <i>AT5G40910</i>, <i>AT5G38850</i>, <i>AT3G04220</i>, and <i>AT5G44940</i> are target genes of miR825 or miR825*. Compared with Col-0, the target mutant lines showed higher susceptibility to <i>B. cinerea</i> B1301, while still expressing AR156-triggered induced systemic resistance (ISR). The two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant (<i>P</i> < 0.01) interactive effect of treatment and genotype on the defense responses. Hence, miR825 and miR825*act as negative regulators of AR156-mediated systemic resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i> B1301 in <i>Arabidopsis.</i>
