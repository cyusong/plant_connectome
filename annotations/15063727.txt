['15063727', 'In a screen for potential mediators of brassinosteroid (BR) effects, the EXORDIUM  (EXO) protein was identified as a regulator of BR-responsive genes. The EXO gene  was characterized as a BR-up-regulated gene. EXO overexpression under the control  of the 35SCaMV promoter resulted in increased transcript levels of the  BR-up-regulated KCS1, Exp5, delta-TIP, and AGP4 genes, which likely are involved  in the mediation of BR-promoted growth. 35S::EXO lines grown in soil or in  synthetic medium showed increased vegetative growth in comparison to wild-type  plants, resembling the growth phenotype of BR-treated plants. Thus, the EXO  protein most likely promotes growth via the modulation of gene expression  patterns.', '2004 Apr 9', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/S0014-5793(04)00255-8', 'Mussig']
