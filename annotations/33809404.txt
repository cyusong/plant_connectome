Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in the elongation of cotton fibers, which are the most important natural fibers in the global textile industry. Here, a high-resolution mapping approach combined with comparative sequencing and a transgenic method revealed that a G65V substitution in the cotton actin Gh_D04G0865 (GhACT17D in the wild-type) is responsible for the <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> Ligon lintless-1 (<i>Li</i><sub>1</sub>) mutant (GhACT17DM). In the mutant GhACT17DM from <i>Li</i><sub>1</sub> plant, Gly65 is substituted with valine on the lip of the nucleotide-binding domain of GhACT17D, which probably affects the polymerization of F-actin. Over-expression of <i>GhACT17DM</i>, but not <i>GhACT17D</i>, driven by either a CaMV35 promoter or a fiber-specific promoter in cotton produced a <i>Li</i><sub>1</sub>-like phenotype. Compared with the wild-type control, actin filaments in <i>Li</i><sub>1</sub> fibers showed higher growth and shrinkage rates, decreased filament skewness and parallelness, and increased filament density. Taken together, our results indicate that the incorporation of GhACT17DM during actin polymerization disrupts the establishment and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in defective fiber elongation and the overall dwarf and twisted phenotype of the <i>Li</i><sub>1</sub> mutant.
