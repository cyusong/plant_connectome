Soil phosphorus (P) availability and its distribution influence plant growth and productivity, but how they affect the growth dynamics and sex-specific P acquisition strategies of dioecious plant species is poorly understood. In this study, the impact of soil P availability and its distribution on dioecious Populus cathayana was characterized. P. cathayana males and females were grown under three levels of P supply, and with homogeneous or heterogeneous P distribution. Females had a greater total root length, specific root length (SRL), biomass and foliar P concentration under high P supply. Under P deficiency, males had a smaller root system than females but a greater exudation of soil acid phosphatase, and a higher colonization rate and arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal biomass, suggesting a better capacity to mine P and a stronger association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to forage P. Heterogeneous P distribution enhanced growth and root length density (RLD) in females. Female root proliferation in P-rich patches was related to increased foliar P assimilation. Localized P application for increasing P availability did not enhance the biomass accumulation and the morphological plasticity of roots in males, but it raised hyphal biomass. The findings herein indicate that sex-specific strategies in P acquisition relate to root morphology, root exudation and mycorrhizal symbioses, and they may contribute to sex-specific resource utilization patterns and niche segregation.
