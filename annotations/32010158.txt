Sulfur (S) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development; however, S supply for crop production is decreasing due to reduced inputs from atmospheric deposition and reduced application of S-containing fertilizers. Sulfur deficiency in soil is therefore becoming a widespread cause of reduced grain yield and quality in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L). We therefore assessed the genotypic variation for tolerance to S deficiency in rice and identified loci associated with improved tolerance. Plants were grown in nutrient solution with either low (0.01 mM) or high (1.0 mM) supply of S. Plants grown under low-S treatment showed a reduction in total biomass, mainly due to a marked reduction in shoot biomass, while root biomass and root-to-shoot ratio increased, relative to plants under high-S treatment. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified loci associated with root length (<i>qSUE2-3, qSUE4,</i> and <i>qSUE9</i>), and root (<i>qSUE1, qSUE2-1, and qSUE3-1 and qSUE3-2</i>) or total dry matter (<i>qSUE2, qSUE3-1,</i> and <i>qSUE11</i>). Candidate genes identified at associated loci coded for enzymes involved in secondary S metabolic pathways (sulfotransferases), wherein the sulfated compounds play several roles in plant responses to abiotic stress; cell wall metabolism including wall loosening and modification (carbohydrate hydrolases: beta-glucosidase and beta-gluconase) important for root growth; and cell detoxification (glutathione S-transferase). This study confirmed the existence of genetic variation conferring tolerance to S deficiency among traditional aus rice varieties. The advantageous haplotypes identified could be exploited through marker assisted breeding to improve tolerance to S-deficiency in modern cultivars in order to achieve sustainable crop production and food security.
