Some of the hormone crosstalk and transcription factors (TFs) involved in wound-induced organ regeneration have been extensively studied in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In previous work, we established <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> "Micro-Tom" explants without the addition of exogenous hormones as a model to investigate wound-induced de novo organ formation. The current working model indicates that cell reprogramming and founder cell activation requires spatial and temporal regulation of auxin-to-cytokinin (CK) gradients in the apical and basal regions of the hypocotyl combined with extensive metabolic reprogramming of some cells in the apical region. In this work, we extended our transcriptomic analysis to identify some of the gene regulatory networks involved in wound-induced organ regeneration in tomato. Our results highlight a functional conservation of key TF modules whose function is conserved during de novo organ formation in plants, which will serve as a valuable resource for future studies.
