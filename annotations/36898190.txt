Verticillium wilt is a soil-borne fungal disease that severely affects cotton fiber yield and quality. Herein, a cotton Trihelix family gene, GhGT-3b_A04, was strongly induced by the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae. Overexpression of the gene in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced the plant's resistance to Verticillium wilt but inhibited the growth of rosette leaves. In addition, the primary root length, root hair number, and root hair length increased in GhGT-3b_A04-overexpressing plants. The density and length of trichomes on the rosette leaves also increased. GhGT-3b_A04 localized to the nucleus, and transcriptome analysis revealed that it induced gene expression for salicylic acid synthesis and signal transduction and activated gene expression for disease resistance. The gene expression for auxin signal transduction and trichome development was reduced in GhGT-3b_A04-overexpressing plants. Our results highlight important regulatory genes for Verticillium wilt resistance and cotton fiber quality improvement. The identification of GhGT-3b_A04 and other important regulatory genes can provide crucial reference information for future research on transgenic cotton breeding.
