['25846941', 'Inositol polyphosphate kinase (IPK2) is a key component of inositol polyphosphate  signaling. There are two highly homologous inositol polyphosphate kinases  (AtIPK2alpha and AtIPK2beta) in Arabidopsis. Previous studies that overexpressed or  reduced the expression of AtIPK2alpha and AtIPK2beta revealed their roles in auxiliary  shoot branching, abiotic stress responses and root growth. Here, we report that  AtIPK2alpha and AtIPK2beta act redundantly during pollen development, pollen tube  guidance and embryogenesis. Single knock-out mutants of atipk2alpha and atipk2beta were  indistinguishable from the wild type, whereas the atipk2alpha atipk2beta double mutant  could not be obtained. Detailed genetic and cytological investigations showed  that the mutation of AtIPK2alpha and AtIPK2beta resulted in severely reduced  transmission of male gametophyte as a result of abnormal pollen development and  defective pollen tube guidance. In addition, the early embryo development of the  atipk2alpha atipk2beta double mutant was also aborted. Expressing either catalytically  inactive or substrate specificity-altered variants of AtIPK2beta could not rescue  the male gametophyte and embryogenesis defects of the atipk2alpha atipk2beta double  mutant, implying that the kinase activity of AtIPK2 is required for pollen  development, pollen tube guidance and embryogenesis. Taken together, our results  provide genetic evidence for the requirement of inositol polyphosphate signaling  in plant sexual reproduction.', '2015 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12846', 'Xia']
