Tracheary elements within the secondary body of a dragon tree shared features characteristic of fibres. Their considerable intrusive growth resulted in a rigid network with a braid-like arrangement which contributes towards the tree-like form of the plant. Monocot cambium gives rise to xylem and phloem which become organized into vascular bundles. The xylem consists entirely of tracheids, and these undergo considerable intrusive elongation during their development, unlike the tracheids of conifers and those of vesselless dicotyledons. Monocot tracheids have not been fully investigated, and our understanding of their structure is incomplete. Therefore, in this study the degree of variation in the structure and arrangement of secondary tracheary elements of monocots were determined, based on the Dracaena draco stem. In addition, its mechanical and physiological implications were discussed. Analysis of series of thin serial sections and macerations of the immature and fully developed tracheids showed that the course of intrusive elongation of tracheids was determined by the spatial relationship that exists between the growing tracheid and surrounding cells, and was not usually parallel to the stem axis. It influenced the shape of tracheids, as well the cross-sectional shape of vascular bundles. Tracheids become twisted or even interwoven and so, their ends do not join with the ends of other tracheids. The complexity of the tracheid network, that functions both in transport and mechanical support, seems to have a major impact on the tree-like growth habit of D. draco.
