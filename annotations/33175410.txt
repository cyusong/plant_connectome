The visual deficiency symptoms developing on plants constitute the ultimate manifestation of suboptimal nutrient supply. In classical plant nutrition, these symptoms have been extensively used as a tool to characterise the nutritional status of plants and to optimise fertilisation. Here we expand this concept by bridging the typical deficiency symptoms for each of the six essential macronutrients to their molecular and physiological functionalities in higher plants. We focus on the most recent insights obtained during the last decade, which now allow us to better understand the links between symptom and function for each element. A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying the visual deficiency symptoms enables us to thoroughly understand how plants react to nutrient limitations and how these disturbances may affect the productivity and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems. A proper interpretation of visual deficiency symptoms will support the potential for sustainable crop intensification through the development of new technologies that facilitate automatised management practices based on imaging technologies, remote sensing and in-field sensors, thereby providing the basis for timely application of nutrients via smart and more efficient fertilisation.
