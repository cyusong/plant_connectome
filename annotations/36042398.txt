Zizania latifolia is a popular aquatic vegetable in China because of its enlarged edible stems resulting from persistent infection by a fungal endophyte, Ustilago esculenta. Fenaminosulf (FM) is a germicide that can be used to improve agricultural crop yields. In Z. latifolia fields, appropriate spraying of FM not just controls diseases, but also promotes an earlier harvest of Z. latifolia. In this study, we show that the timing of gall formation was advanced and the plant's yield was increased significantly under a high concentration treatment of FM. Yet FM had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of U. esculenta in vitro, while the transcript levels of mating-type alleles, cell metabolism-related genes and chitin synthase genes were all substantially downregulated. Through a transcriptome analysis, we investigated changes in gene expression of the host Z. latifolia and fungal endophyte U. esculenta in response to FM. FM directly affected the growth of Z. latifolia by altering the expression level of genes involved in plant-pathogen interactions, plant hormone signal transduction and some metabolism pathways. By contrast, FM had little effect on U. esculenta growing inside of Z. latifolia. Collectively, our results provide a more in-depth understanding of the molecular processes that promote gall formation in Z. latifolia, while also identifying potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve the yield and quality of Z. latifolia, in a safer and more effective way.
