Sulfotransferases (SOTs) (EC 2.8.2.-) play a crucial role in the sulphate conjugation reaction involved in plant growth, vigor, stress resistance and pathogen infection. SOTs in Arabidopsis have been carried out and divided into 8 groups. However, the systematic analysis and functional information of SOT family genes in cotton have rarely been reported. According to the results of BLASTP and HMMER, we isolated 46, 46, 76 and 77 SOT genes in the genome G. arboreum, G. raimondii, G. barbadense and G. hirsutum, respectively. A total of 170 in 245 SOTs were further classified into four groups based on the orthologous relationships comparing with Arabidopsis, and tandem replication primarily contributed to the expansion of SOT gene family in G. hirsutum. Expression profiles of the GhSOT showed that most genes exhibited a high level of expression in the stem, leaf, and the initial stage of fiber development. The localization analysis indicated that GhSOT67 expressed in cytoplasm and located in stem and leaf tissue. Additionally, the expression of GhSOT67 were induced and the length of stem and leaf hairs were shortened after gene silencing mediated by Agrobacterium, compared with the blank and negative control plants. Our findings indicated that SOT genes might be associated with fiber development in cotton and provided valuable information for further studies of SOT genes in Gossypium.
