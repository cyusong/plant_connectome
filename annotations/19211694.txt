['19211694', 'Myb transcription factors have been implicated in a wide variety of  plant-specific processes, including secondary metabolism, cell shape  determination, cell differentiation, and stress responses. Very recently, AtMyb41  from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was described as a gene transcriptionally  regulated in response to salinity, desiccation, cold, and abscisic acid. The  corresponding transcription factor was suggested to control stress responses  linked to cell wall modifications. In this work, we have characterized AtMyb41  further by subjecting independent AtMyb41-overexpressing lines to detailed  transcriptome and metabolome analysis. Our molecular data indicate that AtMyb41  is involved in distinct cellular processes, including control of primary  metabolism and negative regulation of short-term transcriptional responses to  osmotic stress.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.134874', 'Udvardi']
