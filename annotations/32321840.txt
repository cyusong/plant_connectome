Glucosinolates (GSLs) are sulfur-containing defense metabolites produced in the Brassicales, including the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous work suggests that specific GSLs may function as signals to provide direct feedback regulation within the plant to calibrate defense and growth. These GSLs include allyl-GSL, a defense metabolite that is one of the most widespread GSLs in Brassicaceae and has also been associated with growth inhibition. Here we show that at least three separate potential catabolic products of allyl-GSL or closely related compounds affect growth and development by altering different mechanisms influencing plant development. Two of the catabolites, raphanusamic acid and 3-butenoic acid, differentially affect processes downstream of the auxin signaling cascade. Another catabolite, acrylic acid, affects meristem development by influencing the progression of the cell cycle. These independent signaling events propagated by the different catabolites enable the plant to execute a specific response that is optimal to any given environment.
