Different preparations of antibodies against 62 kDa NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) from purified maize leaves cross-react with a 72 kDa protein from diverse tissues in many species. A 72 kDa protein, suggested to be a non-photosynthetic NADP-ME, has been purified from several plant species. However, to date, a cDNA coding for this putative 72 kDa NADP-ME has not been isolated. The screening of maize and tobacco leaf expression libraries using antibodies against purified 62 kDa NADP-ME allowed the identification of a heat shock protein (Hsp70). In addition, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) studies indicate that along with NADP-ME, a 72 kDa protein, identified as an Hsp70 and reacting with the antibodies, is also purified from maize roots. On the other hand, the screening of a maize root cDNA library revealed the existence of a cDNA that encodes a mature 66 kDa NADP-ME. These results suggest that the 72 kDa protein is not actually an NADP-ME but in fact an Hsp70, at least in maize and tobacco. Probably, NADP-ME-Hsp70 association, taking place at least when preparing crude extracts, can lead to a co-purification of the proteins and can thus explain the cross-reaction of the antibodies. In the present work, we analyse and discuss a probable interaction of NADP-ME with Hsp70.
