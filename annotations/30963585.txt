Botanists have long recognised interspecific gene flow as a common occurrence within white oaks (Quercus section Quercus). Historical allele exchange, however, has not been fully characterised and the complex genomic signals resulting from the combination of vertical and horizontal gene transmission may confound phylogenetic inference and obscure our ability to accurately infer the deep evolutionary history of oaks. Using anchored enrichment, we obtained a phylogenomic dataset consisting of hundreds of single-copy nuclear loci. Concatenation, species-tree and network analyses were carried out in an attempt to uncover the genomic signal of ancient introgression and infer the divergent phylogenetic topology for the white oak clade. Locus and site-level likelihood comparisons were then conducted to further explore the introgressed signal within our dataset. Historical, intersectional gene flow is suggested to have occurred between an ancestor of the Eurasian Roburoid lineage and Quercus pontica and North American Dumosae and Prinoideae lineages. Despite extensive time past, our approach proved successful in detecting the genomic signature of ancient introgression. Our results, however, highlight the importance of sampling and the use of a plurality of analytical tools and methods to sufficiently explore genomic datasets, uncover this signal, and accurately infer evolutionary history.
