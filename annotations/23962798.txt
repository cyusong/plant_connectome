Nitric oxide (NO ) is a gaseous signaling molecule which plays both regulatory and defense roles in animals and plants. In the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia, NO has been shown to be involved in bacterial infection and nodule development steps as well as in mature nodule functioning. We recently showed that an increase in NO level inside Medicago truncatula root nodules also could trigger premature nodule senescence. Here we discuss the importance of the bacterial Sinorhizobium meliloti flavohemoglobin to finely tune the NO level inside nodules and further, we demonstrate that S. meliloti possesses at least two non redundant ways to control NO and that both systems are necessary to maintain efficient nitrogen fixing activity.

NO: !plays role in! symbiosis 
NO: !triggers! premature nodule senescence 
flavohemoglobin: !finely tunes! NO level 
S. meliloti: !controls! NO 
S. meliloti: !possesses! two non redundant ways to control NO 
two systems: !necessary to maintain! efficient nitrogen fixing activity
