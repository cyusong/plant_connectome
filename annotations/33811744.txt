In plants, clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2CAs) have emerged as major players in abscisic acid (ABA)-regulated stress responses by inhibiting protein kinase activity. However, how different internal and external environmental signals modulate the activity of PP2CAs are not well known. The transmembrane kinase (TMK) protein 4 (TMK4), one member of a previously identified receptor kinase subfamily on the plasma membrane that plays vital roles in plant cell growth, directly interacts with PP2CAs member (ABA-Insensitive 2, ABI2). tmk4 mutant is hypersensitive to ABA in both ABA-inhibited seed germination and primary root growth, indicating that TMK4 is a negative regulator in ABA signaling pathway. Further analyses indicate that TMK4 phosphorylates ABI2 at three conserved Ser residues, thus enhancing the activity of ABI2. The phosphorylation-mimic ABI2<sup>S139DS140DS266D</sup> can complement but non-phosphorylated form ABI2<sup>S139AS140AS266A</sup> cannot complement ABA hypersensitive phenotype of the loss-of-function mutant abi1-2abi2-2. This study provides a previously unidentified mechanism for positively regulating ABI2 by a plasma membrane protein kinase.
