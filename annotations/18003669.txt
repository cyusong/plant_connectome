Tolerance to boron (B) toxicity in cereals is known to be associated with reduced tissue accumulation of B. Genes from roots of B-tolerant cultivars of wheat and barley with high similarities to previously reported B efflux transporters from Arabidopsis and rice were cloned. Expression of these genes was strongly correlated with the ability of tolerant genotypes to lower the concentration of B in roots. The gene from barley located to chromosome 4. Backcross lines containing a B tolerance locus on chromosome 4 showed tolerance in proportion to the level of expression of the transporter gene, whereas those lacking the locus were sensitive to B and had very low levels of gene expression. The results are consistent with a widespread mechanism of tolerance to high B based on efflux of B from root cells.
