Abscission is a process in which plants shed their parts, and is mediated by a particular set of cells, the abscission zone (AZ). In grasses (Poaceae), the position of the AZ differs among species, raising the question of whether its anatomical structure and genetic control are conserved. The ancestral position of the AZ was reconstructed. A combination of light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, RNA-Seq analyses and RNA in situ hybridisation were used to compare three species, two (weedy rice and Brachypodium distachyon) with the AZ in the ancestral position and one (Setaria viridis) with the AZ in a derived position below a cluster of flowers (spikelet). Rice and Brachypodium are more similar anatomically than Setaria. However, the cell wall properties and the transcriptome of rice and Brachypodium are no more similar to each other than either is to Setaria. The set of genes expressed in the studied tissues is generally conserved across species, but the precise developmental and positional patterns of expression and gene networks are almost entirely different. Transcriptional regulation of AZ development appears to be extensively rewired among the three species, leading to distinct anatomical and morphological outcomes.
