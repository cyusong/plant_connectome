Plants need to respond quickly and appropriately to various types of light signals from the environment to optimize growth and development. The immediate response to shading, reduced photon flux (low light), and changes in spectral quality involves changes in gene regulation. In the case of more persistent shade, the plant shows a dramatic change in the organization of chromatin. Both plant responses are controlled via photoreceptor signaling proteins. Recently, several studies have revealed similar features of chromatin reorganization in response to various abiotic and biotic signals, while others have unveiled intricate molecular networks of light signaling towards gene regulation. This opinion paper briefly describes the chromatin (de)compaction response from a light-signaling perspective to provide a link between chromatin and the molecular network of photoreceptors and E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.
