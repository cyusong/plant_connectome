['11805067', 'In plants, the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway provides a number of important  secondary metabolites including the growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)  and indole glucosinolate defense compounds. Genes encoding tryptophan pathway  enzymes are transcriptionally induced by a variety of stress signals, presumably  to increase the production of both tryptophan and secondary metabolites during  defense responses. To understand the mechanism of transcriptional induction, we  isolated altered tryptophan regulation (atr) mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana with  activated transcription of tryptophan genes. One atr complementation group  consisted of mutations in the cytochrome P450 gene CYP83B1. Mutant plants had  constitutively activated expression of the ATR1 Myb factor gene, which was  identified as a positive regulator of tryptophan genes via the atr mutant screen.  cyp83B1 mutants were previously characterized as having defects in IAA  homeostasis due to perturbation of secondary tryptophan metabolism. Our findings  indicate that the upregulation of tryptophan pathway genes might also contribute  to the overaccumulation of IAA in mutant plants. Moreover, we show that cyp83B1  mutants have lesion-mimic phenotypes, suggesting that multiple stress pathways  are activated by loss of CYP83B1 function.', '2002 Jan', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/160.1.323', 'Bender']
