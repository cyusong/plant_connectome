New imaging methodologies with high contrast and molecular specificity allow researchers to analyze dynamic processes in plant cells at multiple scales, from single protein and RNA molecules to organelles and cells, to whole organs and tissues. These techniques produce informative images and quantitative data on molecular dynamics to address questions that cannot be answered by conventional biochemical assays. Here, we review selected microscopy techniques, focusing on their basic principles and applications in plant science, discussing the pros and cons of each technique, and introducing methods for quantitative analysis. This review thus provides guidance for plant scientists in selecting the most appropriate techniques to decipher structures and dynamic processes at different levels, from protein dynamics to morphogenesis.
