Transition metal transporters are of central importance in the plant metal homeostasis network which maintains internal metal concentrations within physiological limits. An overview is given of the functions of known transition metal transporters in the context of the unique chemical properties of their substrates. The modifications of the metal homeostasis network associated with the adaptation to an extreme metalliferous environment are illustrated in two Brassicaceae metal hyperaccumulator model plants based on cross-species transcriptomics studies. In a comparison between higher plants and unicellular algae, hypotheses are generated for evolutionary changes in metal transporter complements associated with the transition to multicellularity.
