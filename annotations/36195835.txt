To adapt the periodic fluctuation of environmental factors, plants are subtle to monitor the natural variation for the growth and development. The daily activities and physiological functions in coordination with the natural variation are regulated by circadian clock genes. The circadian emission of floral scents is one of the rhythmic physiological activities controlled by circadian clock genes. Here, we study the molecular mechanism of circadian emission pattern of ocimene and linalool compounds in Oncidium Sharry Baby (Onc. SB) orchid. GC-Mass analysis revealed that Onc. SB periodically emitted ocimene and linalool during 6 to 14 o'clock daily. Terpene synthase, one of the key gene in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway is expressed in coordination with scent emission. The promoter structure of terpene synthase revealed a circadian binding sequence (CBS), 5'-AGATTTTT-3' for CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) transcription factor. EMSA data confirms the binding affinity of CCA1. Transactivation assay further verified that TPS expression is regulated by CCA1. It suggests that the emission of floral scents is controlled by CCA1. The work validates that the mechanism of circadian emission of floral scents in Onc. Sharry Baby is controlled by the oscillator gene, CCA1(CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1) under light condition. CCA1 transcription factor up-regulates terpene synthase (TPS) by binding on CBS motif, 5'-AGATTTTT-3' of promoter region to affect the circadian emission of floral scents in Onc. SB.
