Wheat powdery mildew, caused by the obligate biotrophic ascomycete fungal pathogen <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Bgt</i>), is a major threat to wheat production worldwide. It is known that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana glucan synthase-like 5</i> (<i>AtGSL5</i>) improves the resistance of wheat to powdery mildew by increasing its anti-penetration abilities. However, the function of glucan synthase-like (<i>GSL</i>) orthologs in crop species remains largely unknown. In this study, <i>TaGSL22</i>, a novel functional ortholog of <i>AtGSL5</i>, was isolated as the only <i>Bgt</i>-induced <i>GSL</i> gene in wheat. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>TaGSL22</i> was conserved within the group of Gramineae and showed a closer relationship to <i>GSL</i> orthologs from monocots than to those from dicots. The <i>TaGSL22</i> transcript was highest in the wheat leaves, followed by stems then roots. <i>TaGSL22</i> was localized in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of wheat protoplasts, as predicted by transmembrane structure analysis. In addition, expression of <i>TaGSL22</i> was induced by the plant hormones ethylene (ETH) and salicylic acid (SA), but down-regulated by jasmonate (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). The transcript level of <i>TaGSL22</i> was up-regulated in the incompatible interaction between <i>Bgt</i> and wheat, whereas it remained relatively unchanged in the compatible interaction. Knocking down of <i>TaGSL22</i> by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) induced a higher infection type in the wheat-<i>Bgt</i> interaction. The <i>TaGSL22</i>-silenced plants exhibited reduced resistance to <i>Bgt</i>, accompanied by decreased callose accumulation. Our study shows a conserved function of <i>GSL</i> genes in plant immunity associated with penetration resistance, and it indicates that <i>TaGSL22</i> can be used to improve papilla composition and enhance resistance to wheat powdery mildew.
