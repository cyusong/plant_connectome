A "smart canopy" ideotype has been proposed with leaves being upright at the top and more horizontal toward the bottom of the plant to maximize light interception and conversion efficiencies, and thus increasing yield. The genetic control of leaf angle has, to date, been studied on one or two leaves, or data have been merged from multiple leaves to generate average values. This approach has limited our understanding of the diversity of leaf angles across layers and their genetic control. Genome-wide association studies and quantitative trait loci mapping studies in sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) were performed using layer-specific angle data collected manually and via high-throughput phenotyping strategies. The observed distribution of angles in indoor and field settings is opposite to the ideotype. Several genomic regions were associated with leaf angle within layers or across the canopy. The expression of the brassinosteroid-related transcription factor <i>BZR1</i>/<i>BES1</i> and the auxin-transporter <i>Dwarf3</i> were found to be highly correlated with the distribution of angles at different layers. The application of a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor could not revert the undesirable overall angle distribution. These discoveries demonstrate that the exploitation of layer-specific quantitative trait loci/genes will be instrumental to reversing the natural angle distribution in sorghum according to the "smart canopy" ideotype.
