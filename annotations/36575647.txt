Knowledge concerning the integration of genetic pathways mediating the responses to environmental cues controlling flowering initiation in crops is scarce. Here, we reveal the diversity in oilseed rape (OSR) flowering response to high ambient temperature. Using a set of different spring OSR varieties, we found a consistent flowering delay at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, one of the varieties assayed exhibited the opposite behaviour. Several FT-like paralogs are plausible candidates to be part of the florigen in OSR. We revealed that BnaFTA2 plays a major role in temperature-dependent flowering initiation. Analysis of the H2A.Z histone variant occupancy at this locus in different Brassica napus varieties produced contrasting results, suggesting the involvement of additional molecular mechanisms in BnaFTA2 repression at high ambient temperature. Moreover, BnARP6 RNAi plants showed little accumulation of H2A.Z at high temperature while maintaining temperature sensitivity and delayed flowering. Furthermore, we found that H3K4me3 present in BnaFTA2 under inductive flowering conditions is reduced at high temperature, suggesting a role for this hallmark of transcriptionally active chromatin in the OSR flowering response to warming. Our work emphasises the plasticity of flowering responses in B. napus and offers venues to optimise this process in crop species grown under suboptimal environmental conditions.
