Interactions between trees and microorganisms are tremendously complex and the multispecies networks resulting from these associations have consequences for plant growth and productivity. However, a more holistic view is needed to better understand trees as ecosystems and superorganisms, where many interacting species contribute to the overall stability of the system. While much progress has been made on microbial communities associated with individual tree niches and the molecular interactions between model symbiotic partners, there is still a lack of knowledge of the multi-component interactions necessary for holistic ecosystem-level understanding. We review recent studies in Populus to emphasize the importance of such holistic efforts across the leaf, stem and rooting zones, and discuss prospects for future research in these important ecosystems.
