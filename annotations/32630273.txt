Jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in various biological processes including development, signal transduction and stress response. Allene oxide synthase (AOS) catalyzing (13S)-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid (13-HPOT) to an unstable allene oxide is involved in the first step of JA biosynthesis. Here, we isolated the PtAOS1 gene and its promoter from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>). PtAOS1 contains a putative chloroplast targeting sequence in N-terminal and shows relative to pistachio (<i>Pistacia vera</i>) AOS. A number of stress-, light- and hormone-related cis-elements were found in the <i>PtAOS1</i> promoter which may be responsible for the up-regulation of <i>PtAOS1</i> under drought and JA treatments. Transient expression in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) demonstrated that the P<sub>-532</sub> (-532 to +1) fragment conferring drive activity was a core region in the <i>PtAOS1</i> promoter. Using yeast one-hybrid, three novel proteins, PtDUF886, PtDUF1685 and PtRAP2.4, binding to P<sub>-532</sub> were identified. The dual luciferase assay in tobacco illustrated that all three transcription factors could enhance <i>PtAOS1</i> promoter activity. Genes <i>PtDUF1685</i> and <i>PtRAP2.4</i> shared an expression pattern which was induced significantly by drought stress. These findings should be available evidence for trifoliate orange responding to drought through JA modulation.
