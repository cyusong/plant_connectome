Transcript profiles in aphid (Aphis glycines)-resistant (cv. Dowling) and -susceptible (cv. Williams 82) soybean (Glycine max) cultivars using soybean cDNA microarrays were investigated. Large-scale soybean cDNA microarrays representing approx. 18 000 genes or c. 30% of the soybean genome were compared at 6 and 12 h post-application of aphids. In a separate experiment utilizing clip cages, expression of three defense-related genes were examined at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h in both cultivars by quantitative real-time PCR. One hundred and forty genes showed specific responses for resistance; these included genes related to cell wall, defense, DNA/RNA, secondary metabolism, signaling and other processes. When an extended time period of sampling was investigated, earlier and greater induction of three defense-related genes was observed in the resistant cultivar; however, the induction declined after 24 or 48 h in the resistant cultivar but continued to increase in the susceptible cultivar after 24 h. Aphid-challenged resistant plants showed rapid differential gene expression patterns similar to the incompatible response induced by avirulent Pseudomonas syringae. Five genes were identified as differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the absence of aphids.
