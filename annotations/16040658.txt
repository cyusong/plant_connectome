['16040658', 'Homologs of peroxin 16 genes (PEX16) have been identified only in Yarrowia  lipolytica, humans (Homo sapiens), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The  Arabidopsis gene (AtPEX16), previously reported as the SSE1 gene, codes for a  predicted 42-kD membrane peroxin protein (AtPex16p). Lin et al. (Y. Lin, J.E.  Cluette-Brown, H.M. Goodman [2004] Plant Physiol 135: 814-827) reported that  SSE1/AtPEX16 was essential for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-dependent oil and  protein body biogenesis in peroxisome-deficient maturing seeds and likely also  was involved in peroxisomal biogenesis based on localization of stably expressed  green fluorescent protein::AtPex16p in peroxisomes of Arabidopsis plants. In this  study with Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, combined in vivo and in vitro  experiments revealed a novel dual organelle localization and corresponding  membrane association/topology of endogenous AtPex16p. Immunofluorescence  microscopy with antigen affinity-purified IgGs showed an unambiguous,  steady-state coexistence of AtPex16p in suspension cell peroxisomes and ER.  AtPex16p also was observed in peroxisomes and ER of root and leaf cells. Cell  fractionation experiments surprisingly revealed two immunorelated polypeptides,  42 kD (expected) and 52 kD (unexpected), in homogenates and microsome membrane  pellets derived from roots, inflorescence, and suspension cells. Suc-gradient  purifications confirmed the presence of both 42-kD and 52-kD polypeptides in  isolated peroxisomes (isopycnic separation) and in rough ER vesicles (Mg2+  shifted). They were found peripherally associated with peroxisome and ER  membranes but not as covalently bound subunits of AtPex16p. Both were mostly on  the matrix side of peroxisomal membranes and unexpectedly mostly on the cytosolic  side of ER membranes. In summary, AtPex16p is the only authentic plant peroxin  homolog known to coexist at steady state within peroxisomes and ER; these data  provide new insights in support of its ER-related, multifunctional roles in  organelle biogenesis.', '2005 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.061291', 'Trelease']
