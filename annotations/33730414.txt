Genome-editing technologies consisting of targeted mutagenesis and gene targeting enable us to modify genes of interest rapidly and precisely. The discovery in 2012 of CRISPR/Cas9 systems and their development as sequence-specific nucleases has brought about a paradigm shift in biology. Initially, CRISPR/Cas9 was applied in targeted mutagenesis to knock out a target gene. Thereafter, advances in genome-editing technologies using CRISPR/Cas9 developed rapidly, with base editing systems for transition substitution using a combination of Cas9 nickase and either cytidine or adenosine deaminase being reported in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and later in 2021 bringing reports of transversion substitution using Cas9 nickase, cytidine deaminase and uracil DNA glycosylase. Moreover, technologies for gene targeting and prime editing systems using DNA or RNA as donors have also been developed in recent years. Besides these precise genome-editing strategies, reports of successful chromosome engineering using CRISPR/Cas9 have been published recently. The application of genome editing to crop breeding has advanced in parallel with the development of these technologies. Genome-editing enzymes can be introduced into plant cells, and there are now many examples of crop breeding using genome-editing technologies. At present, it is no exaggeration to say that we are now in a position to be able to modify a gene precisely and rearrange genomes and chromosomes in a predicted way. In this review, we introduce and discuss recent highlights in the field of precise gene editing, chromosome engineering and genome engineering technology in plants.
