Cutting is a frequently used model to study the process of adventitious root formation, and excision of cuttings leads to rapid wound response signaling. We recently showed that as a wound signal, reactive oxygen species (ROS, mainly hydrogen peroxide) participate in adventitious root induction of hypocotyl cuttings through regulation of auxin biosynthesis and transport. Here, superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup>), an early type of ROS, exhibited rapid burst at the cutting site immediately in response to wounding in Arabidopsis hypocotyl cuttings. Diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI, inhibitor of NADPH oxidase) overwhelmingly suppressed O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup> propagation through the hypocotyl. Compared to wild type, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup> burst only occur in cut base, and upward transduction were inhibited completely in NADPH oxidase mutant <i>AtRbohD</i>. These results indicate O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup> generation and propagation in response to wound and via NADPH oxidase in adventitious root induction of hypocotyl cuttings.

Wound: !generates! O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup> 
NADPH oxidase: !mediates! O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup> propagation 
O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup>: !propagates! through hypocotyl 
DPI: !inhibits! O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup> propagation 
AtRbohD: !inhibits! upward transduction of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup>
