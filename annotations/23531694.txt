Despite many studies on the high aluminum (Al) tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa), its exact mechanisms remain largely unknown. It is also unclear why Al improves growth of some plants. Our research on interactions between nitrogen (N) and Al may help to understand these phenomena. Previously, we found that ammonium-supplemented rice was more Al tolerant than nitrate-supplemented rice. Furthermore, Al-tolerant rice varieties preferred ammonium, while Al-sensitive ones preferred nitrate; in fact, Al tolerance was significantly correlated with the ammonium/nitrate preference among rice varieties. Al even enhanced growth of ammonium-supplemented rice, while it inhibited growth of nitrate-supplemented rice. Based on our own and other reports on N-Al interactions, we propose that intermediate products of N metabolism may play a role in rice Al tolerance. Al-enhanced ammonium utilization may explain why Al promotes growth of some plants, since Al often coexists with higher levels of ammonium than nitrate in acid soils.
