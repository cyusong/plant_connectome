['19357199', 'Genome integrity in eukaryotes depends on licensing mechanisms that prevent  loading of the minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM2-7) onto replicated DNA  during S phase. Although the principle of licensing appears to be conserved  across all eukaryotes, the mechanisms that control it vary, and it is not clear  how licensing is regulated in plants. In this work, we demonstrate that subunits  of the MCM2-7 complex are coordinately expressed during Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) development and are abundant in proliferating and endocycling tissues,  indicative of a role in DNA replication. We show that endogenous MCM5 and MCM7  proteins are localized in the nucleus during G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell  cycle and are released into the cytoplasmic compartment during mitosis. We also  show that MCM5 and MCM7 are topologically constrained on DNA and that the MCM  complex is stable under high-salt conditions. Our results are consistent with a  conserved replicative helicase function for the MCM complex in plants but not  with the idea that plants resemble budding yeast by actively exporting the MCM  complex from the nucleus to prevent unauthorized origin licensing and  rereplication during S phase. Instead, our data show that, like other higher  eukaryotes, the MCM complex in plants remains in the nucleus throughout most of  the cell cycle and is only dispersed in mitotic cells.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.136614', 'Hanley-Bowdoin']
