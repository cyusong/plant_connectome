['22507233', 'Flower primordia are partitioned by boundaries during their early development.  Such boundaries occur between whorls of organs, and also between organs within  whorls. PETAL LOSS (PTL) is a trihelix transcription factor gene that is  expressed in boundaries between sepal primordia in the outer whorl.  Over-expression of PTL results in growth suppression suggesting that PTL normally  inhibits growth between newly arising sepals. We have tested this by examining  the consequences of loss of PTL function using confocal imaging. The size of the  inter-sepal zone in stage 4 buds expands radially by 35-40% in ptl-1 mutants as a  consequence of additional cell proliferation. There is no change in the size of  PTL-expressing cells. PTL expression does not overlap with the sites of petal  initiation identified using the DR5 auxin response reporter. The latter are  closer to the centre of the flower. Thus the consequence of loss of PTL function  on petal initiation is indirect, perhaps through interference with a mobile  petal-initiation signal or movement of the PTL protein. CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON  (CUC) genes are also involved in defining inter-sepal boundaries. However,  genetic studies combining ptl with loss of cuc1 function, and gain of CUC  function in extra early petals-1 (miR164c) mutants, have revealed that CUC and  PTL act differently. CUC suppresses growth of sepal tissues from the boundary  region whereas PTL acts to keep the size of the boundary in check.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05023.x', 'Smyth']
