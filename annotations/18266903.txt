The impact of aquaporin function on plant water balance is discussed. The significance of these proteins for root water uptake, water conductance in the xylem, including embolism refilling and the role of plant aquaporins in leaf physiology, is described. Emphasis is placed on certain aspects of water stress reactions and the correlation of aquaporins to abscisic acid as well as on the relation of water and CO2 permeability in leaves.
