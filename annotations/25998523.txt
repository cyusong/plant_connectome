A comparative study of isolated vs. lichenized Trebouxia sp. showed that lichenization does not influence the survival capability of the alga to the photo-oxidative stress derived from prolonged desiccation. Coccoid algae in the Trebouxia genus are the most common photobionts of chlorolichens but are only sporadically found in soil or bark outside of a lichen. They all appear to be desiccation tolerant, i.e. they can survive drying to water contents of below 10%. However, little is known about their longevity in the dry state and to which extent lichenization can influence it. Here, we studied the longevity in the dry state of the lichenized alga (LT) Trebouxia sp. in the lichen Parmotrema perlatum, in comparison with axenically grown cultures (CT) isolated from the same lichen. We report on chlorophyll fluorescence emission and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production before desiccation, after 15-45 days in the dry state under different combinations of light and air humidity and after recovery for 1 or 3 days in fully hydrated conditions. Both the CT and the LT were able to withstand desiccation under high light (120 µmol photons m(-2) s(-1) for 14 h per day), but upon recovery after 45 days in the dry state the performance of the CT was better than that of the LT. By contrast, the quenching of excess light energy was more efficient in the LT, at high relative humidities especially. ROS production in the LT was influenced mostly by light exposure, whereas the CT showed an oxidative burst independent of the light conditions. Although lichenization provides benefits that are essential for the survival of the photobiont in high-light habitats, Trebouxia sp. can withstand protracted periods of photo-oxidative stress even outside of a lichen thallus.
