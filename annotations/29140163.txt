A destructive pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, secretes hundreds of effectors for successful survival in its host plants. The effectors modulate the plant defense system at diverse cellular compartments to take an advantage of pathogen survivals. A few research studies have shown the mode of action of each effector and their interacting proteins in plant cells. Here, we investigated the mode of action of a P. infestans effector, Pi23226, which induces cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. To identify its host factors, we performed coimmunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and selected members of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70s) as candidates. These HSP70s, known to function as chaperones, were associated with Pi23226 in planta and accelerated Pi23226-induced cell death. Additionally, they were found to be involved in plant basal defense by suppressing the growth of P. infestans. We also found that specific components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade were involved in Pi23226-induced cell death. Our findings show that HSP70s functions in defense systems by regulating effector-triggered cell death and by suppressing the growth of the pathogen. This suggests that host plants manipulate the ubiquitous proteins to detect pathogen effectors for functioning in the defense system.
