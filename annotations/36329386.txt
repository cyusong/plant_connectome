Grazing disturbance usually affects floral display and pollination efficiency in the desert steppe, which may cause pollen limitation in insect-pollinated plants. Effective pollination is essential for the reproductive success of insect-pollinated plants and insufficient pollen transfer may result in pollen limitation. Caragana microphylla Lam is an arid region shrub with ecological importance. Few studies have been conducted on how grazing disturbance influences pollen limitation and pollination efficiency of C. microphylla. Here, we quantify the effect of different grazing intensities on floral display, pollinator visitation frequency and seed production in the Urat desert steppe. In C. microphylla, supplemental hand pollination increased the seed set, and pollen limitation was the predominant limiting factor. As the heavy grazing significantly reduced the seed set in plants that underwent open-pollination, but there was no significant difference in the seed set between plants in the control plots and plants in the moderate grazing plots. Furthermore, there was a higher pollinator visitation frequency in plants in the control plots than in plants in the heavy grazing plots. We found that pollinator visitation frequency was significantly associated with the number of open flowers. Our findings also demonstrated that seed production is associated with pollinator visitation frequency, as indicated by increased seed production in flowers with higher pollinator visitation frequency. Therefore, this study provides insight into the effect of different grazing intensities on floral display that are important for influencing pollinator visitation frequency and pollination efficiency in desert steppes.
