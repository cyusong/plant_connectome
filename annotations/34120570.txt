Fungal plant pathogens deploy a suite of secreted proteins, called effectors, to facilitate successful infection. Several fungal pathogens have been reported to secrete and accumulate their effector proteins in the host-pathogen interfacial spaces. Previously, we reported that the strain 104-T of the cucurbit anthracnose pathogen <i>Colletotrichum orbiculare</i> secretes and accumulates mCherry-tagged effectors along with the formation of ring-shaped fluorescence signals beneath the appressoria. However, it was unclear whether these effector accumulation patterns occur in other <i>C. orbiculare</i> isolates and other species belonging to the <i>Colletotrichum</i> genus. Here, we investigated the effector localization during host infection of <i>C. orbiculare</i> MAFF306589, <i>C. trifolii</i> MAFF305078, which infects alfalfa, and <i>C. higginsianum</i> MAFF305635, which infects Brassicaceae plants. We generated effector-reporter lines of each species, which constitutively expressed mCherry-tagged CoDN3 effector (CoDN3:mCherry). Immunoblotting analysis of the liquid culture fluids of the generated lines detected CoDN3:mCherry, which confirmed secretion of CoDN3:mCherry by fungal cells. Via inoculation assays in the corresponding host plants, we detected ring-shaped CoDN3:mCherry fluorescence around the appressorial invasion sites in all tested reporter lines. These results suggest that pathogens in the <i>Colletotrichum</i> genus have evolutionarily conserved the trait of effector secretion in the infection stage irrespective of differences in their hosts.
