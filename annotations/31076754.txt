The19th edition of the International Symposium on Iron Nutrition and Interactions in Plants, a biannual meeting initiated in 1981, took place in Taiwan for the first time. The five-day event was held at the Academia Sinica campus in the Southeast of Taiwan's capital city Taipei, and hosted around 200 scientists from around the world. The meeting covered a diverse array of topics centered around iron nutrition, including but not limited to soil processes, biofortification, transport, signaling and molecular processes regulating the cellular homeostasis of iron. Here, I review the research foci highlighted during the meeting by oral and poster presentations.
