Understanding gene expression and regulation requires insights into RNA transcription, processing, modification, and translation. However, the relationship between the epitranscriptome and the proteome under drought stress remains undetermined in poplar (Populus trichocarpa). In this study, we used Nanopore direct RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag-based proteomic analysis to examine epitranscriptomic and proteomic regulation induced by drought treatment in stem-differentiating xylem (SDX). Our results revealed a decreased full-length read ratio under drought treatment and, especially, a decreased association between transcriptome and proteome changes in response to drought. Epitranscriptome analysis of cellulose- and lignin-related genes revealed an increased N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) ratio, which was accompanied by decreased RNA abundance and translation, under drought stress. Interestingly, usage of the distal poly(A) site increased during drought stress. Finally, we found that transcripts of highly expressed genes tend to have shorter poly(A) tail length (PAL), and drought stress increased the percentage of transcripts with long PAL. These findings provide insights into the interplay among m6A, polyadenylation, PAL, and translation under drought stress in P. trichocarpa SDX.
