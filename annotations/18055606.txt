['18055606', 'The pseudoresponse regulators (PRRs) participate in the progression of the  circadian clock in Arabidopsis thaliana. The founding member of the family,  TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), is an essential component of the  transcriptional network that constitutes the core mechanism of the circadian  oscillator. Recent data suggest a role in circadian regulation for all five  members of the PRR family; however, the molecular function of TOC1 or any other  PRRs remains unknown. In this work, we present evidence for the involvement of  PRR3 in the regulation of TOC1 protein stability. PRR3 was temporally coexpressed  with TOC1 under different photoperiods, yet its tissue expression was only  partially overlapping with that of TOC1, as PRR3 appeared restricted to the  vasculature. Decreased expression of PRR3 resulted in reduced levels of TOC1  protein, while overexpression of PRR3 caused an increase in the levels of TOC1,  all without affecting the amount of TOC1 transcript. PRR3 was able to bind to  TOC1 in yeast and in plants and to perturb TOC1 interaction with ZEITLUPE (ZTL),  which targets TOC1 for proteasome-dependent degradation. Together, our results  indicate that PRR3 might function to modulate TOC1 stability by hindering  ZTL-dependent TOC1 degradation, suggesting the existence of local regulators of  clock activity and adding to the growing importance of posttranslational  regulation in the design of circadian timing mechanisms in plants.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054775', 'Kay']
