The frequent occurrence of chalky rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains becomes a serious problem as a result of climate change. The molecular mechanism underlying chalkiness is largely unknown, however. In this study, the temperature-sensitive floury endosperm11-2 (flo11-2) mutant was isolated from ion beam-irradiated rice of 1116 lines. The flo11-2 mutant showed significantly higher chalkiness than the wild type grown under a mean temperature of 28°C, but similar levels of chalkiness to the wild type grown under a mean temperature of 24°C. Whole-exome sequencing of the flo11-2 mutant showed three causal gene candidates, including Os12g0244100, which encodes the plastid-localized 70-kDa heat shock protein 2 (cpHSP70-2). The cpHSP70-2 of the flo11-2 mutant has an amino acid substitution on the 259th aspartic acid with valine (D259V) in the conserved Motif 5 of the ATPase domain. Transgenic flo11-2 mutants that express the wild-type cpHSP70-2 showed significantly lower chalkiness than the flo11-2 mutant. Moreover, the accumulation level of cpHSP70-2 was negatively correlated with the chalky ratio, indicating that cpHSP70-2 is a causal gene for the chalkiness of the flo11-2 mutant. The intrinsic ATPase activity of recombinant cpHSP70-2 was lower by 23% at V<sub>max</sub> for the flo11-2 mutant than for the wild type. The growth of DnaK-defective Escherichia coli cells complemented with DnaK with the D201V mutation (equivalent to the D259V mutation) was severely reduced at 37°C, but not in the wild-type DnaK. The results indicate that the lowered cpHSP70-2 function is involved with the chalkiness of the flo11-2 mutant.
