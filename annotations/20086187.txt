['20086187', 'The ubiquitin (Ub)/26S proteasome system (UPS) directs the turnover of numerous  regulatory proteins, thereby exerting control over many aspects of plant growth,  development, and survival. The UPS is directed in part by a group of  Ub-like/Ub-associated (UBL/UBA) proteins that help shuttle ubiquitylated proteins  to the 26S proteasome for breakdown. Here, we describe the collection of UBL/UBA  proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, including four isoforms that comprise the  RADIATION SENSITIVE23 (RAD23) family. The nuclear-enriched RAD23 proteins bind Ub  conjugates, especially those linked internally through Lys-48, via their UBA  domains, and associate with the 26S proteasome Ub receptor RPN10 via their  N-terminal UBL domains. Whereas homozygous mutants individually affecting the  four RAD23 genes are without phenotypic consequences (rad23a, rad23c, and rad23d)  or induce mild phyllotaxy and sterility defects (rad23b), higher-order mutant  combinations generate severely dwarfed plants, with the quadruple mutant  displaying reproductive lethality. Both the synergistic effects of a rad23b-1  rpn10-1 combination and the response of rad23b plants to mitomycin C suggest that  RAD23b regulates cell division. Taken together, RAD23 proteins appear to play an  essential role in the cell cycle, morphology, and fertility of plants through  their delivery of UPS substrates to the 26S proteasome.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.072660', 'Vierstra']
