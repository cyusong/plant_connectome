In plants, phytochromobilin synthase (HY2) synthesize the open chain tetrapyrrole chromophore for light-sensing phytochromes. It catalyzes the double bond reduction of a heme-derived tetrapyrrole intermediate biliverdin IXalpha (BV) at the A-ring diene system. HY2 is a member of ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs), which require ferredoxins (Fds) as the electron donors for double bond reductions. In this study, we investigated the interaction mechanism of FDBRs and Fds by using HY2 and Fd from Arabidopsis thaliana as model proteins. We found that one of the six Arabidopsis Fds, AtFd2, was the preferred electron donor for HY2. HY2 and AtFd2 formed a heterodimeric complex that was stabilized by chemical cross-linking. Surface-charged residues on HY2 and AtFd2 were important in the protein-protein interaction as well as BV reduction activity of HY2. These surface residues are close to the iron-sulfur center of Fd and the HY2 active site, implying that the interaction promotes direct electron transfer from the Fd to HY2-bound BV. In addition, the C12 propionate group of BV is important for HY2-catalyzed BV reduction. A possible role for this functional group is to mediate the electron transfer by interacting directly with AtFd2. Together, our biochemical data suggest a docking mechanism for HY2:BV and AtFd2.
