Temperate and boreal plants show natural low temperature acclimation during autumn. This cold acclimation process results in increased freezing tolerance. Global climate change is leading to increasing spring and autumn temperatures that can trigger deacclimation and loss of freezing tolerance, making plants susceptible to both late-autumn and late-spring freezing events. In particular, spring frosts can have devastating effects on whole ecosystems and can significantly reduce the yield of crop plants. Although the timing and speed of deacclimation are clearly of crucial importance for plant winter survival, the molecular basis of this process is still largely unknown. The regulation of deacclimation is, however, not only related to freezing tolerance, but also to the termination of dormancy, and the initiation of growth and development. In this paper, we provide an overview of what is known about deacclimation in both woody and herbaceous plants. We use publicly available transcriptome data to identify a core set of deacclimation-related genes in Arabidopsis thaliana that highlight physiological determinants of deacclimation, and suggest important directions for future research in this area.
