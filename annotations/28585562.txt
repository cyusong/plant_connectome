['28585562', 'Sperm cells of seed plants have lost their motility and are transported by the  vegetative pollen tube cell for fertilization, but the extent to which they  regulate their own transportation is a long-standing debate. Here we show that  Arabidopsis lacking two bHLH transcription factors produces pollen without sperm  cells. This abnormal pollen mostly behaves like the wild type and demonstrates  that sperm cells are dispensable for normal pollen tube development.', '2017 Jun 6', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/nplants.2017.79', 'Qu']
