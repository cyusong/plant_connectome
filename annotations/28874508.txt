['28874508', 'Stomatal pores are formed between a pair of guard cells and allow plant uptake of  CO(2) and water evaporation. Their aperture depends on changes in osmolyte  concentration of guard cell vacuoles, specifically of K(+) and Mal(2-) Efflux of  Mal(2-) from the vacuole is required for stomatal closure; however, it is not  clear how the anion is released. Here, we report the identification of ALMT4  (ALUMINUM ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER4) as an Arabidopsis thaliana ion channel  that can mediate Mal(2-) release from the vacuole and is required for stomatal  closure in response to abscisic acid (ABA). Knockout mutants showed impaired  stomatal closure in response to the drought stress hormone ABA and increased  whole-plant wilting in response to drought and ABA. Electrophysiological data  show that ALMT4 can mediate Mal(2-) efflux and that the channel activity is  dependent on a phosphorylatable C-terminal serine. Dephosphomimetic mutants of  ALMT4 S382 showed increased channel activity and Mal(2-) efflux. Reconstituting  the active channel in almt4 mutants impaired growth and stomatal opening.  Phosphomimetic mutants were electrically inactive and phenocopied the almt4  mutants. Surprisingly, S382 can be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein  kinases in vitro. In brief, ALMT4 likely mediates Mal(2-) efflux during  ABA-induced stomatal closure and its activity depends on phosphorylation.', '2017 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00452', 'ORCID:']
