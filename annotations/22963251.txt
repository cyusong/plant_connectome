Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of naturally-occurring steroidal phytohormones playing fundamental roles during normal plant growth and development. Using a combination of experimental approaches, including analytical chemistry, genetics, and biochemistry, the major BR biosynthetic pathway has been largely elucidated. The least-understood knowledge in the BR research field is probably the molecular mechanisms controlling the bioactive levels of BRs in response to various developmental and environmental cues. In this review, we focus our discussion on a recently-proposed, 8-step predominant BR biosynthetic pathway, several newly-identified transcription factors regulating the expression of key enzymes that catalyze BR biosynthesis, and up-to-date information about the mechanisms that plants use to inactivate unnecessary BRs.
