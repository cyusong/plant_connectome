Polyploidy varieties have been reported to exhibit higher stress tolerance relative to their diploid relatives, however, the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, a batch of autotetraploid <i>Citrus wilsonii</i> were identified from a natural seedling population, and these tetraploid seedlings exhibited greater tolerance to drought stress than their diploids siblings. A global transcriptome analysis revealed that a large number of genes involved in photosynthesis response were enriched in tetraploids under drought stress, which was consistent with the changes in photosynthetic indices including P<sub>n</sub>, gs, T<sub>r</sub>, C<sub>i</sub>, and chlorophyll contents. Compared with diploids, phosphorylation was also modified in the tetraploids after drought stress, as detected through tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled proteomics. Additionally, tetraploids prioritized the regulation of plant hormone signal transduction at the transcriptional level after drought stress, which was also demonstrated by increased levels of IAA, ABA, and SA and reduced levels of GA3 and JA. Collectively, our results confirmed that the synergistic regulation of photosynthesis response, phosphorylation modification and plant hormone signaling resulted in drought tolerance of autotetraploid <i>C. wilsonii</i> germplasm.
