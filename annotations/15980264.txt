['15980264', 'Forward genetic screens have led to the isolation of several genes involved in  secondary cell wall formation. A variety of evidence, however, suggests that the  list of genes identified is not exhaustive. To address this problem, microarray  data have been generated from tissue undergoing secondary cell wall formation and  used to identify genes that exhibit a similar expression pattern to the secondary  cell wall-specific cellulose synthase genes IRREGULAR XYLEM1 (IRX1) and IRX3.  Cross-referencing this analysis with publicly available microarray data resulted  in the selection of 16 genes for reverse genetic analysis. Lines containing an  insertion in seven of these genes exhibited a clear irx phenotype characteristic  of a secondary cell wall defect. Only one line, containing an insertion in a  member of the COBRA gene family, exhibited a large decrease in cellulose content.  Five of the genes identified as being essential for secondary cell wall  biosynthesis have not been previously characterized. These genes are likely to  define entirely novel processes in secondary cell wall formation and illustrate  the success of combining expression data with reverse genetics to address gene  function.', '2005 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.031542', 'Turner']
