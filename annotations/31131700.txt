Fertilization-related kinase (FRK) is a group of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K or MEKK) that has proliferated in <i>Solanaceae</i> species. Studies on the wild potato <i>Solanum chacoense</i> have shown that three ScFRKs are directly involved in female gametophyte development. Decreasing the expression of <i>ScFRK1</i> and <i>ScFRK3</i> by RNA interference lead to embryonic sac development arrest at the functional megaspore (FM) stage. As for <i>ScFRK2</i>, the first FRK studied, antisense and co-suppression lines showed no abnormality, while overexpression lines lead to a drastic decrease in seed numbers, presumably caused by a conversion of the ovule into a carpel-like structure. Here we show that in <i>ScFRK2</i> overexpression lines, carpel-like structures from the ovule cannot explain the drastic decrease in seeds considering the low percentage of these carpel-like structures but occurs in early ovule development as observed in <i>Scfrk1</i> and <i>Scfrk3</i> knockdown mutants were most ovules are arrested at the FM stage. The highly similar phenotype from knockdown mutants (<i>Scfrk1</i> and <i>Scfrk3</i>) and <i>ScFRK2</i> overexpression lines suggests that these MAP kinases could operate antagonistically through a balance between <i>ScFRK1</i> and <i>3</i> on one side and <i>ScFRK2</i> on the other. This study strongly suggests the importance of the FRK family expression levels during early stages of ovule development in <i>Solanum chacoense</i> embryo sac.
