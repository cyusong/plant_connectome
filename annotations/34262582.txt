With background concentrations having reached phytotoxic levels during the last century, tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) has become a key climate change agent, counteracting carbon sequestration by forest ecosystems. One of the main knowledge gaps for implementing the recent O<sub>3</sub> flux-based critical levels (CLs) concerns the assessment of effective O<sub>3</sub> dose leading to adverse effects in plants. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of physiological, structural, and morphological responses induced by two levels of O<sub>3</sub> exposure (80 and 100 ppb) in the foliage of hybrid poplar, as a function of phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> dose (POD<sub>0</sub>) and foliar developmental stage. After a latency period driven by foliar ontological development, the gas exchanges and chlorophyll content decreased with higher POD<sub>0</sub> monotonically. Hypersensitive response-like lesions appeared early during exposure and showed sigmoidal-like dynamics, varying according to leaf age. At current POD<sub>1_SPEC</sub> CL, notwithstanding the aforementioned reactions and initial visible injury to foliage, the treated poplars had still not shown any growth or biomass reduction. Hence, this study demonstrates the development of a complex syndrome of early reactions below the flux-based CL, with response dynamics closely determined by the foliar ontological stage and environmental conditions. General agreement with patterns observed in the field appears indicative of early O<sub>3</sub> impacts on processes relevant, e.g., biodiversity ecosystem services before those of economic significance - i.e., wood production, as targeted by flux-based CL.
