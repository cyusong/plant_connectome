Diverse proteolytic pathways regulate chloroplasts. Recent work has revealed significant new roles for chloroplast ubiquitination in stress adaptation, involving targeted protein removal through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, or selective, whole-chloroplast degradation.

Chloroplast: !regulated by! Proteolytic pathways
Ubiquitination: !targets! Protein removal
