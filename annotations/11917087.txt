['11917087', 'A dominant mutant line characterized by abnormal leaf venation pattern was  isolated from a transgenic Arabidopsis plant pool that was generated with  Agrobacterium culture harboring an Arabidopsis antisense cDNA library. In the  mutant line, the phenotype was due to antisense suppression of a gene we named  VEP1 (Vein Patterning). The predicted amino acid sequence of the gene contained a  motif related to the mammalian death domain that is found in the apoptotic  machinery. Reduced expression of the VEP1 gene resulted in the reduced complexity  of the venation pattern of the cotyledons and foliar leaves, which was mainly due  to the reduced number of the minor veins and their incomplete connection. The  analysis of mutant embryos indicated that the phenotype was originated, at least  in part, from a defect in the procambium patterning. In the mutant, the stem and  root were thinner than those in wild type. This phenotype was associated with  reduced vascular development. The promoter activity of the VEP1 gene was detected  preferentially in the vascular regions. We propose that the death  domain-containing protein VEP1 functions as a positive element required for  vascular strand development in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2002 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcf042', 'Nam']
