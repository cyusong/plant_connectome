['16517762', 'In plant meristems, each cell divides and differentiates in a spatially and  temporally regulated manner, and continuous organogenesis occurs using cells  derived from the meristem. We report the identification of the Arabidopsis  thaliana TEBICHI (TEB) gene, which is required for regulated cell division and  differentiation in meristems. The teb mutants show morphological defects, such as  short roots, serrated leaves, and fasciation, as well as defective patterns of  cell division and differentiation in the meristem. The TEB gene encodes a homolog  of Drosophila MUS308 and mammalian DNA polymerase theta, which prevent  spontaneous or DNA damage-induced production of DNA double strand breaks. As  expected from the function of animal homologs, teb mutants show constitutively  activated DNA damage responses. Unlike other fasciation mutants with activated  DNA damage responses, however, teb mutants do not activate transcriptionally  silenced genes. teb shows an accumulation of cells expressing cyclinB1;1:GUS in  meristems, suggesting that constitutively activated DNA damage responses in teb  lead to a defect in G2/M cell cycle progression. Furthermore, other fasciation  mutants, such as fasciata2 and tonsoku/mgoun3/brushy1, also show an accumulation  of cells expressing cyclinB1;1:GUS in meristems. These results suggest that cell  cycle progression at G2/M is important for the regulation of the pattern of cell  division and of differentiation during plant development.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.036798', 'Morikami']
