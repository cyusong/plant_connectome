Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) is a highly effective medicinal plant containing ginsenosides with various pharmacological activities, whose roots are produced commercially for crude drugs. Here, we used the Illumina platform to generate over 232 million RNA sequencing reads from four root samples, including whole roots from one-year-old plants and three types of root tissue from six-year-old plants (i.e., main root bodies, rhizomes, and lateral roots). Through de novo assembly and reference-assisted selection, we obtained a non-redundant unigene set consisting of 55,949 transcripts with an average length of 1,250 bp. Among transcripts in the unigene set, 94 % were functionally annotated via similarity searches against protein databases. Approximately 28.6 % of the transcripts represent novel gene sequences that have not previously been reported for P. ginseng. Digital expression profiling revealed 364 genes showing differential expression patterns among the four root samples. Additionally, 32 were uniquely expressed in one-year-old roots, while seven were uniquely expressed in six-year-old root tissues. We identified 38 transcripts encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis pathways and 189 encoding UDP-glycosyltransferases. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of the root transcriptome in development and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in P. ginseng.
