['32747760', 'Switch defective/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodelling  complexes are multi-protein machineries that control gene expression by  regulating chromatin structure in eukaryotes. However, the full subunit  composition of SWI/SNF complexes in plants remains unclear. Here we report that  in Arabidopsis thaliana, two homologous glioma tumour suppressor candidate region  domain-containing proteins, named BRAHMA-interacting proteins 1 (BRIP1) and  BRIP2, are core subunits of plant SWI/SNF complexes. brip1 brip2 double mutants  exhibit developmental phenotypes and a transcriptome remarkably similar to those  of BRAHMA (BRM) mutants. Genetic interaction tests indicated that BRIP1 and BRIP2  act together with BRM to regulate gene expression. Furthermore, BRIP1 and BRIP2  physically interact with BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes and extensively  co-localize with BRM on chromatin. Simultaneous mutation of BRIP1 and BRIP2  results in decreased BRM occupancy at almost all BRM target loci and  substantially reduced abundance of the SWI/SNF assemblies. Together, our work  identifies new core subunits of BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes in plants and  uncovers the essential role of these subunits in maintaining the abundance of  SWI/SNF complexes in plants.', '2020 Aug', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-020-0734-z', 'ORCID:']
