Portulacaceae is a family that has considerable diversity in photosynthetic phenotypes. It is one of 19 families of terrestrial plants where species having C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis have been found. Most species in Portulaca are in the alternate-leaved (AL) lineage, which includes one clade (Cryptopetala) with taxa lacking C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis and three clades having C<sub>4</sub> species (Oleracea, Umbraticola and Pilosa). All three species in the Cryptopetala clade lack Kranz anatomy, the leaves have C<sub>3</sub>-like carbon isotope composition and they have low levels of C<sub>4</sub> cycle enzymes. Anatomical, biochemical and physiological analyses show they are all C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediates. They have intermediate CO<sub>2</sub> compensation points, enrichment of organelles in the centripetal position in bundle sheath (BS) cells, with selective localization of glycine decarboxylase in BS mitochondria. In the three C<sub>4</sub> clades there are differences in Kranz anatomy types and form of malic enzyme (ME) reported to function in C<sub>4</sub> (NAD-ME versus NADP-ME): Oleracea (Atriplicoid, NAD-ME), Umbraticola (Atriplicoid, NADP-ME) and Pilosa (Pilosoid, NADP-ME). Structural and biochemical analyses were performed on Pilosa clade representatives having Pilosoid-type leaf anatomy with Kranz tissue enclosing individual peripheral vascular bundles and water storage in the center of the leaf. In this clade, all species except P. elatior are NADP-ME-type C<sub>4</sub> species with grana-deficient BS chloroplasts and grana-enriched M chloroplasts. Surprisingly, P. elatior has BS chloroplasts enriched in grana and NAD-ME-type photosynthesis. The results suggest photosynthetic phenotypes were probably derived from an ancestor with NADP-ME-type C<sub>4</sub>, with two independent switches to NAD-ME type.
