Glandular secreting trichomes of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and close relatives produce a variety of structurally diverse volatile and non-volatile specialized ('secondary') metabolites, including terpenes, flavonoids and acyl sugars. A genetic screen is described here to profile leaf trichome and surface metabolite extracts of nearly isogenic chromosomal substitution lines covering the tomato genome. These lines contain specific regions of the Solanum pennellii LA0716 genome in an otherwise 'wild-type' M82 tomato genetic background. Regions that have an impact on the total amount of extractable mono- and sesquiterpenes (IL2-2) or only sesquiterpenes (IL10-3) or specifically influence accumulation of the monoterpene alpha-thujene (IL1-3 and IL1-4) were identified using GC-MS. A rapid LC-TOF-MS method was developed and used to identify changes in non-volatile metabolites through non-targeted analysis. Metabolite profiles generated using this approach led to the discovery of introgression lines producing different acyl chain substitutions on acyl sugar metabolites (IL1-3/1-4 and IL8-1/8-1-1), as well as two regions that influence the quantity of acyl sugars (IL5-3 and IL11-3). Chromosomal region 1-1/1-1-3 was found to influence the types of glycoalkaloids that are detected in leaf surface extracts. These results show that direct chemical screening is a powerful way to characterize genetic diversity in trichome specialized metabolism.
