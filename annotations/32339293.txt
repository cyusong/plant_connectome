Nitric oxide (NO) is perfectly suited for the role of a redox signalling molecule. A key route for NO bioactivity occurs via protein S-nitrosation, and involves the addition of a NO moiety to a protein cysteine (Cys) thiol (-SH) to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). This process is thought to underpin a myriad of cellular processes in plants that are linked to development, environmental responses and immune function. Here we collate emerging evidence showing that NO bioactivity regulates a growing number of diverse post-translational modifications including SUMOylation, phosphorylation, persulfidation and acetylation. We provide examples of how NO orchestrates these processes to mediate plant adaptation to a variety of cellular cues.
