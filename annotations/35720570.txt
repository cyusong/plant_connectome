Alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) is a perennial forage crop known as the "Queen of Forages." To dissect the genetic mechanism of flowering time (FT) in alfalfa, high-density linkage maps were constructed for both parents of an F1 mapping population derived from a cross between Cangzhou (P1) and ZhongmuNO.1 (P2), consisting of 150 progenies. The FT showed a transgressive segregation pattern in the mapping population. A total of 13,773 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers was obtained by using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and distributed on 64 linkage groups, with a total length of 3,780.49 and 4,113.45 cM and an average marker interval of 0.58 and 0.59 cM for P1 and P2 parent, respectively. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses were performed using the least square means of each year as well as the best linear unbiased prediction values across 4 years. Sixteen QTLs for FT were detected for P1 and 22 QTLs for P2, accounting for 1.40-16.04% of FT variation. RNA-Seq analysis at three flowering stages identified 5,039, 7,058, and 7,996 genes that were differentially expressed between two parents, respectively. Based on QTL mapping, DEGs analysis, and functional annotation, seven candidate genes associated with flowering time were finally detected. This study discovered QTLs and candidate genes for alfalfa FT, making it a useful resource for breeding studies on this essential crop.
