['26973252', 'The bHLH109 gene of the bHLH family was identified among the transcription factor  encoding genes that were differentially expressed in an embryogenic culture of  Arabidopsis. A strong activation of bHLH109 expression was found to be associated  with somatic embryogenesis (SE) induction. Several pieces of evidence suggested  the involvement of bHLH109 in SE, including the high stimulation of the gene  expression in SE-induced explants, which contrasts to the drastically lower level  of the gene transcripts in the non-embryogenic callus and in tissue that is  induced towards shoot regeneration via organogenesis. Moreover, in contrast to  the overexpression of bHLH109, which has been indicated to enhance SE induction  in a culture, the bhlh109 knock-out mutation was found to impair the embryogenic  potential of explants. In order to identify the genes interacting with the  bHLH109, the candidate co-expressed genes were identified in a yeast one hybrid  assay. The in vitro regulatory interactions that were identified were verified  through mutant and expression analysis. The results suggest that in SE bHLH109  acts as an activator of ECP63, a member of the LEA (LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT)  family. Among the potential regulators of bHLH109, three candidates (At5g61620,  bZIP4 and bZIP43) were indicated to possibly control bHLH109. The functions of  all of the genes that are assumed to interact with bHLH109 are annotated to  stress responses. Collectively, the results of the study provide new evidence  that cell responses to stress that is imposed under in vitro conditions underlies  the promotion of SE. bHLH109 may play a central role in the stress-related  mechanism of SE induction via an increased accumulation of the LEA protein  (ECP63), which results in the enhanced tolerance of the cells to stress.', '2016 Apr 1', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2016.02.012', 'Gaj']
