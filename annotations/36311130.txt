Although mungbean (<i>Vigna radiata</i> (L.) R. Wilczek) is an important legume crop, its seed yield is relatively low. To address this issue, here 196 accessions with 3,607,508 SNP markers were used to identify quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs), QTN-by-environment interactions (QEIs), and their candidate genes for seed length (SL), seed width, and 100-seed weight (HSW) in two environments. As a result, 98 QTNs and 20 QEIs were identified using 3VmrMLM, while 95, >10,000, and 15 QTNs were identified using EMMAX, GEMMA, and CMLM, respectively. Among 809 genes around these QTNs, 12 were homologous to known seed-development genes in rice and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, in which 10, 2, 1, and 0 genes were found, respectively, by the above four methods to be associated with the three traits, such as <i>VrEmp24/25</i> for SL and <i>VrKIX8</i> for HSW. Eight of the 12 genes were significantly differentially expressed between two large-seed and two small-seed accessions, and <i>VrKIX8</i>, <i>VrPAT14</i>, <i>VrEmp24/25</i>, <i>VrIAR1</i>, <i>VrBEE3</i>, <i>VrSUC4</i>, and <i>Vrflo2</i> were further verified by RT-qPCR. Among 65 genes around these QEIs, <i>VrFATB</i>, <i>VrGSO1</i>, <i>VrLACS2</i>, and <i>VrPAT14</i> were homologous to known seed-development genes in <i>A. thaliana</i>, although new experiments are necessary to explore these novel GEI-trait associations. In addition, 54 genes were identified in comparative genomics analysis to be associated with seed development pathway, in which <i>VrKIX8</i>, <i>VrABA2</i>, <i>VrABI5</i>, <i>VrSHB1</i>, and <i>VrIKU2</i> were also identified in genome-wide association studies. This result provided a reliable approach for identifying seed-size-related genes in mungbean and a solid foundation for further molecular biology research on seed-size-related genes.
