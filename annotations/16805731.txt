Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue-light photoreceptors that mediate various light responses, such as inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, enhancement of cotyledon expansion, anthocyanin accumulation and stomatal opening in Arabidopsis. The signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through direct interaction with COP1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. CRY has now been characterized in tomato, pea, moss and fern, but its function in monocots is largely unknown. Here we report the function and basic signaling mechanism of rice cryptochrome 1 (OsCRY1). Overexpresion of OsCRY1b resulted in a blue light-dependent short hypcotyl phenotype in Arabidopsis, and a short coleoptile, leaf sheath and leaf blade phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa). On fusion with beta-glucuronidase (GUS), the C-terminal domain of either OsCRY1a (OsCCT1a) or OsCRY1b (OsCCT1b) mediated a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype in both Arabidopsis and rice, whereas OsCCT1b mutants corresponding to missense mutations in previously described Arabidopsis cry1 alleles failed to confer a COP phenotype. Yeast two-hybrid and subcellular co-localization studies demonstrated that OsCRY1b interacted physically with rice COP1 (OsCOP1). From these results, we conclude that OsCRY1 is implicated in blue-light inhibition of coleoptile and leaf elongation during early seedling development in rice, and that the signaling mechanism of OsCRY1 involves direct interaction with OsCOP1.
