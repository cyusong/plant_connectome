Specific domain of the Mal d 1 was identified to be mainly involved in higher accumulation level in vegetative tissues of transgenic rice than the Bet v 1. Apple food allergen Mal d 1 and birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 belong to the same pathogen related protein 10 (PR10) family. When green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to either of these allergens was expressed as a secretory protein in transgenic rice by ligating an N terminal signal peptide and a C terminal KDEL ER retention signal under the control of the maize ubiquitin constitutive promoter, the GFP:Mald1 highly accumulated in various tissues, whereas accumulation level of the GFP:Betv1 was remarkably reduced in vegetative tissues except for seed. Analysis by RT-PCR exhibited that there was little difference in their transcript levels, indicating the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation. To investigate the cause of such difference in accumulation levels, deletion analysis of the Mal d 1 and domain swapping between them were carried out in transgenic rice. The results showed that the region between positions 41-90 in the Mal d 1 is predominantly implicated in higher level accumulation in vegetative tissues as well as seed as compared with the Bet v 1. The GFP:Mald1 was localized in oligomeric form within ER lumen or ER-derived particles in vegetative tissues, whereas in seed mainly deposited into novel huge ER-derived protein bodies with the size of 5-10 µm in aleurone cells.
