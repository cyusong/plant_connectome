Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved in cyanobacteria, primary producers of striking ecological importance. Like plants, cyanobacteria use the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, fuelled by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). In a competitive reaction this enzyme also fixes O<sub>2</sub> which makes it rather ineffective. To mitigate this problem, cyanobacteria evolved a CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism (CCM) to pool CO<sub>2</sub> in the vicinity of RuBisCO. However, the regulation of these carbon (C) assimilatory systems is understood only partially. Using the model Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 we characterized an essential LysR-type transcriptional regulator encoded by gene sll0998. Transcript profiling of a knockdown mutant revealed diminished expression of several genes involved in C acquisition, including rbcLXS, sbtA and ccmKL encoding RuBisCO and parts of the CCM, respectively. We demonstrate that the Sll0998 protein binds the rbcL promoter and acts as a RuBisCO regulator (RbcR). We propose ATTA(G/A)-N<sub>5</sub> -(C/T)TAAT as the binding motif consensus. Our data validate RbcR as a regulator of inorganic C assimilation and define the regulon controlled by it. Biological CO<sub>2</sub> fixation can sustain efforts to reduce its atmospheric concentrations and is fundamental for the light-driven production of chemicals directly from CO<sub>2</sub> . Information about the involved regulatory and physiological processes is crucial to engineer cyanobacterial cell factories.
