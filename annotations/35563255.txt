The remobilization of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in the stem is essential for rice grain filling so as to improve grain yield. We conducted a two-year field experiment to deeply investigate their relationship. Two large-panicle rice varieties with similar spikelet size, CJ03 and W1844, were used to conduct two treatments (removing-spikelet group and control group). Compared to CJ03, W1844 had higher 1000-grain weight, especially for the grain growth of inferior spikelets (IS) after removing the spikelet. These results were mainly ascribed to the stronger sink strength of W1844 than that of CJ03 contrasting in the same group. The remobilization efficiency of NSC in the stem decreased significantly after removing the spikelet for both CJ03 and W1844, and the level of sugar signaling in the T6P-SnRK1 pathway was also significantly changed. However, W1844 outperformed CJ03 in terms of the efficiency of carbon reserve remobilization under the same treatments. More precisely, there was a significant difference during the early grain-filling stage in terms of the conversion of sucrose and starch. Interestingly, the sugar signaling of the T6P and SnRK1 pathways also represented an obvious change. Hence, sugar signaling may be promoted by sink strength to remobilize the NSCs of the rice stem during grain filling to further advance crop yield.
