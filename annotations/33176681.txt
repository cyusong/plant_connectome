As global warming becomes increasingly severe, it is urgent that we enhance the heat tolerance of crops. We previously reported that Arabidopsis thaliana PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-SPECIFIC PHOSPHOLIPASE C9 (AtPLC9) promotes heat tolerance. In this study, we ectopically expressed AtPLC9 in rice to examine its potential to improve heat tolerance in this important crop. Whereas AtPLC9 did not improve rice tolerance to salt, drought or cold, transgenic rice did exhibit greater heat tolerance than the wild type. High-throughput RNA-seq revealed extensive and dynamic transcriptome reprofiling in transgenic plants after heat stress. Moreover, the expression of some transcription factors and calcium ion-related genes showed specific upregulation in transgenic rice after heat stress, which might contribute to the enhanced heat tolerance. This study provides preliminary guidance for using AtPLC9 to improve heat tolerance in cereal crops and, more broadly, highlights that heterologous transformation can assist with molecular breeding.
