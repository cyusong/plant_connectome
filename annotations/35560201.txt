Triacylglycerol (TAG), a major energy reserve in lipid form, accumulates mainly in seeds. Although TAG concentrations are usually low in vegetative tissues because of the repression of seed maturation programs, these programs are derepressed upon the exposure of vegetative tissues to environmental stresses. Metabolic reprogramming of TAG accumulation is driven primarily by transcriptional regulation. A substantial proportion of transcription factors regulating seed TAG biosynthesis also participates in stress-induced TAG accumulation in vegetative tissues. TAG accumulation leads to the formation of lipid droplets and plastoglobules, which play important roles in plant tolerance to environmental stresses. Toxic lipid intermediates generated from environmental-stress-induced lipid membrane degradation are captured by TAG-containing lipid droplets and plastoglobules. This review summarizes recent advances in the transcriptional control of metabolic reprogramming underlying stress-induced TAG accumulation, and provides biological insight into the plant adaptive strategy, linking TAG biosynthesis with plant survival.
