Various regulatory genes encoding transcription factors and miRNAs regulate carpel number. Multicarpelly is normally associated with increased size of the floral meristem, and several genetic factors have been discovered that influence this characteristic. A fundamental understanding of the regulatory genes affecting carpel number can facilitate strategies for agricultural yield improvement, which is crucial, given that the global population is growing rapidly. A multicarpellate plant may provide a significantly higher yield than a plant bearing fewer carpels. Higher yields can be achieved via various means; in this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the various regulatory factors that contribute to multicarpelly and the potential of increasing carpel number to achieve an increased yield.
