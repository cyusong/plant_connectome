['19196655', 'The gaseous plant hormone ethylene can trigger myriad physiological and  morphological responses in plants. While many ethylene signaling pathway  components have been identified and characterized, little is known about the  function of the integral membrane protein ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2), a central  regulator of all ethylene responses. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis  thaliana EIN2 is a protein with a short half-life that undergoes rapid  proteasome-mediated protein turnover. Moreover, EIN2 protein accumulation is  positively regulated by ethylene. We identified two F-box proteins, EIN2  TARGETING PROTEIN1 (ETP1) and EIN2 TARGETING PROTEIN2 (ETP2), that interact with  the EIN2 C-terminal domain (EIN2-CEND), which is highly conserved and sufficient  to activate most ethylene responses. Overexpression of ETP1 or ETP2 disrupts EIN2  protein accumulation, and these plants manifest a strong ethylene-insensitive  phenotype. Furthermore, knocking down the levels of both ETP1 and ETP2 mRNAs  using an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) leads to accumulation of EIN2 protein,  resulting in plants that display constitutive ethylene response phenotypes.  Finally, ethylene down-regulates ETP1 and ETP2 proteins, impairing their ability  to interact with EIN2. Thus, these studies reveal that a complex interplay  between ethylene, the regulation of ETP1/ETP2 F-box proteins, and subsequent  targeting and degradation of EIN2 is essential for triggering ethylene responses  in plants.', '2009 Feb 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1765709', 'Ecker']
