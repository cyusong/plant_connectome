Plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) perceive the activity of pathogen-secreted effector molecules that, when undetected, promote colonisation of hosts. Signalling from activated NLRs converges with and potentiates downstream responses from activated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense microbial signatures at the cell surface. Efficient signalling of both receptor branches relies on the host cell nucleus as an integration point for transcriptional reprogramming, and on the macromolecular transport processes that mediate the communication between cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Studies on nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), the nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) that compose NPCs, and nuclear transport machinery constituents that control nucleocytoplasmic transport, have revealed that they play important roles in regulating plant immune responses. Here, we discuss the contributions of nucleoporins and nuclear transport receptor (NTR)-mediated signal transduction in plant immunity with an emphasis on NLR immune signalling across the nuclear compartment boundary and within the nucleus. We also highlight and discuss cytoplasmic and nuclear functions of NLRs and their signalling partners and further consider the potential implications of NLR activation and resistosome formation in both cellular compartments for mediating plant pathogen resistance and programmed host cell death.
