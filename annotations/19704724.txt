The process of photosynthesis is under the control by several internal factors. Apart from the effect of abscisic acid on stomatal conductance, little is known about the interaction between hormonal signals and photosynthesis in fully-developed, nonsenescing leaves. Recently, we found that the ethylene transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of photosynthesis. Using an ethylene-insensitive tobacco genotype we showed that the absence of a functional ethylene receptor leads to a reduction in Rubisco content and photosynthetic capacity. In this addendum, we present some additional data indicating that photosynthetic capacity is also reduced in ethylene-insensitive Arabidopsis mutants.
