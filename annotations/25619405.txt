['25619405', 'Ceramidases hydrolyze ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acids. In mammals,  ceramidases function as key regulators of sphingolipid homeostasis, but little is  known about their roles in plants. Here we characterize the Arabidopsis  ceramidase AtACER, a homolog of human alkaline ceramidases. The acer-1 T-DNA  insertion mutant has pleiotropic phenotypes, including reduction of leaf size,  dwarfing and an irregular wax layer, compared with wild-type plants. Quantitative  sphingolipid profiling showed that acer-1 mutants and the artificial  microRNA-mediated silenced line amiR-ACER-1 have high ceramide levels and  decreased long chain bases. AtACER localizes predominantly to the endoplasmic  reticulum, and partially to the Golgi complex. Furthermore, we found that acer-1  mutants and AtACER RNAi lines showed increased sensitivity to salt stress, and  lines overexpressing AtACER showed increased tolerance to salt stress. Reduction  of AtACER also increased plant susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae. Our data  highlight the key biological functions of ceramidases in biotic and abiotic  stresses in plants.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12769', 'Yao']
