Sugars, the main growth substrates of plants, act as physiological signals in the complex regulatory network of sugar metabolism. To investigate the function of different glycolytic steps in sugar sensing and signaling we compared the effects of carbon starvation with those of glucose, glycerol and dihydroxyacetone on carbon metabolism, proteolysis, and protease expression in excised maize (Zea mays L.) root tips. Respiration, soluble proteins, protein turnover and proteolytic activities were monitored as a function of time, along with in vitro and in vivo analysis of a variety of metabolites (sugars, amino and organic acids, phosphoesters, adenine nucleotides...) using (13)C, (31)P and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Our results indicate that, in maize root tips, endopeptidase activities and protease expression are induced in response to a decrease in carbon supply to the upper part of the glycolytic pathway, i.e. at the hexokinase step. Proteolysis would be controlled downstream glycolysis, probably at the level of the respiratory substrate supply to mitochondria.
