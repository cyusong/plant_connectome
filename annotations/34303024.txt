Leaf senescence, the final stage of leaf development, is influenced by numerous internal and environmental signals. However, how biotic stresses such as pathogen infection regulate leaf senescence remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that the premature leaf senescence in Arabidopsis caused by the soil-borne vascular fungus Verticillium dahliae was impaired by disruption of a protein elicitor from V. dahliae 1 named PevD1. Constitutive or inducible overexpression of PevD1 accelerated Arabidopsis leaf senescence. Interestingly, a senescence-associated NAC transcription factor, ORE1, was targeted by PevD1. PevD1 could interact with and stabilize ORE1 protein by disrupting its interaction with the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase NLA. Mutation of ORE1 suppressed the premature senescence caused by overexpressing PevD1, whereas overexpression of ORE1 or PevD1 led to enhanced ethylene production and thereby leaf senescence. We showed that ORE1 directly binds the promoter of ACS6 and promotes its expression for mediating PevD1-induced ethylene biosynthesis. Loss-of-function of ACSs could suppress V. dahliae-induced leaf senescence in ORE1-overexpressing plants. Furthermore, we found thatPevD1 also interacts with Gossypium hirsutum ORE1 (GhORE1) and that virus-induced gene silencing of GhORE1 delays V. dahliae-triggered leaf senescence in cotton, indicating a possibly conserved mechanism in plants. Taken together, these results suggest that V. dahliae induces leaf senescence by secreting the effector PevD1 to manipulate the ORE1-ACS6 cascade, providing new insights into biotic stress-induced senescence in plants.
