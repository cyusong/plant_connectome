Polyamines (PAs) play important roles in plant defense against pathogens, but the regulation of PA metabolism by hormone-mediated defense signaling pathways has not been studied in depth. In this study, the modulation of PA metabolism by salicylic acid (SA) was analyzed in Arabidopsis by combining the exogenous application of this hormone with PA biosynthesis and SA synthesis/signaling mutants. SA induced notable modifications of PA metabolism, mainly consisting in putrescine (Put) accumulation both in whole-plant extracts and apoplastic fluids. Put was accumulated at the expense of increased biosynthesis by ARGININE DECARBOXYLASE 2 and decreased oxidation by copper amine oxidase. Enhancement of Put levels by SA was independent of the regulatory protein NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and the signaling kinases MKK4 and MPK3, but depended on MPK6. However, plant infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 elicited Put accumulation in an SA-dependent way. The present study demonstrates a clear connection between SA signaling and plant PA metabolism in Arabidopsis and contributes to understanding the mechanisms by which SA modulates PA levels during plant-pathogen interactions.
