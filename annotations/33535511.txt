There is no argument to the fact that insect herbivores cause significant losses to plant productivity in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. To counter this continuous onslaught, plants have evolved a suite of direct and indirect, constitutive and induced, chemical and physical defenses, and secondary metabolites are a key group that facilitates these defenses. Polyphenols-widely distributed in flowering plants-are the major group of such biologically active secondary metabolites. Recent advances in analytical chemistry and metabolomics have provided an opportunity to dig deep into extraction and quantification of plant-based natural products with insecticidal/insect deterrent activity, a potential sustainable pest management strategy. However, we currently lack an updated review of their multifunctional roles in insect-plant interactions, especially focusing on their insect deterrent or antifeedant properties. This review focuses on the role of polyphenols in plant-insect interactions and plant defenses including their structure, induction, regulation, and their anti-feeding and toxicity effects. Details on mechanisms underlying these interactions and localization of these compounds are discussed in the context of insect-plant interactions, current findings, and potential avenues for future research in this area.
