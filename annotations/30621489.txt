Effector proteins play important roles in the infection by pathogenic oomycetes and fungi or the colonization by endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi. They are either translocated into the host plant cells via specific translocation mechanisms and function in the host's cytoplasm or nucleus, or they reside in the apoplast of the plant cells and act at the extracellular host-microbe interface. Many effector proteins possess conserved motifs (such as the RXLR, CRN, LysM, RGD, DELD, EAR, RYWT, Y/F/WXC or CFEM motifs) localized in their N- or C-terminal regions. Analysis of the functions of effector proteins, especially so-called "core effectors", is crucial for the understanding of pathogenicity/symbiosis mechanisms and plant defense strategies, and helps to develop breeding strategies for pathogen-resistant cultivars, and to increase crop yield and quality as well as abiotic stress resistance. This review summarizes current knowledge about these effector proteins with the conversed motifs and their involvement in pathogenic or mutualistic plant/fungal interactions.
