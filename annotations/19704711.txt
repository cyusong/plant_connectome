We recently reported that the DELLA factor RGL2 represses testa rupture in response to changes in ABA and GA levels. Here, we provide genetic evidence that this observation extends to RGL3, another DELLA factor whose function was not previously characterized. However, RGL3's repressive activity was seen only in an rgl2 genetic background. This may be explained by the observation that RGL3's mRNA levels are positively regulated by ABA and low GA but to a lesser extent than those of RGL2. This could ensure that RGL2's repressive activity dominates relative to that of RGL3 under most germination conditions.

RGL2: !represses! testa rupture
RGL3: !represses! testa rupture
RGL2: !positively regulated by! ABA, GA
RGL3: !positively regulated by! ABA, GA
RGL2: !dominates! RGL3
