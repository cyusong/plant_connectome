Flooding is an environmental stress that leads to a shortage of O2 that can be detrimental for plants. When flooded, deepwater rice grow floating adventitious roots to replace the dysfunctional soil-borne root system, but the features that ensure O2 supply and hence growth of aquatic roots have not been explored. We investigate the sources of O2 in aquatic adventitious roots and relate aerenchyma and barriers for gas diffusion to local O2 gradients, as measured by microsensor technology, to link O2 distribution in distinct root zones to their anatomical features. The mature root part receives O2 exclusively from the stem. It has aerenchyma that, together with suberin and lignin depositions at the water-root and cortex-stele interfaces, provides a path for longitudinal O2 movement toward the tip. The root tip has no diffusion barriers and receives O2 from the stem and floodwater, resulting in improved aeration of the root tip over mature tissues. Local formation of aerenchyma and diffusion barriers in the mature root channel O2 towards the tip which also obtains O2 from the floodwater. These features explain aeration of floating roots and their ability to grow under water.
