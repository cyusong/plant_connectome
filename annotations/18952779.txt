['18952779', 'The role of the unique plant calpain Defective Kernel 1 (DEK1) in development has  remained unclear due to the severity of mutant phenotypes. Here, we used  complementation studies of the embryo-lethal mutant to dissect DEK1 protein  behavior and to show that DEK1 plays a key role in growth regulation in  Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that although full-length DEK1 protein localizes to  membranes, it undergoes intramolecular autolytic cleavage events that release the  calpain domain into the cytoplasm. The active calpain domain alone is not only  necessary for DEK1 function but is sufficient for full complementation of dek1  mutants. A novel set of phenotypes, including leaf ruffling, increased leaf  thickness, and abnormalities of epidermal cell interdigitation, was caused by  expression of the constitutively active calpain domain. This analysis of the  novel phenotypes produced by DEK1 under- and overexpression, as well as DEK1  subcellular localization and protein processing, has revealed a fundamental role  for DEK1-mediated signaling in growth regulation.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.059964', 'Ingram']
