Across plant species and biomes, a conserved set of leaf traits govern the economic strategy used to assimilate and invest carbon. As plants age, they face new challenges that may require shifts in this leaf economic strategy. In this study, we investigate the role of the developmental transition, vegetative phase change (VPC), in altering carbon economics as plants age. We used overexpression of microRNA 156 (miR156), the master regulator of VPC, to modulate the timing of VPC in Populus tremula x alba, Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays to understand the impact of this transition on leaf economic traits, including construction cost, payback time and return on investment. Here, we find that VPC causes a shift from a low-cost, quick return juvenile strategy to a high-cost, high-return adult strategy. The juvenile strategy is advantageous in light-limited conditions, whereas the adult strategy provides greater returns in high light. The transition between these strategies is correlated with the developmental decline in the level of miR156, suggesting that is regulated by the miR156/SPL pathway. Our results provide an ecophysiological explanation for the existence of juvenile and adult leaf types and suggest that natural selection for these alternative economic strategies could be an important factor in plant evolution.
