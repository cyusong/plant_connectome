Betalains are the nitrogenous pigments that replace anthocyanins in the plant order Caryophyllales. Here, we describe unconventional decarboxylated betalains in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) grains. Decarboxylated betalains are derived from a previously unconsidered activity of the 4,5-DOPA-extradiol-dioxygenase enzyme (DODA), which has been identified as the key enzymatic step in the established biosynthetic pathway of betalains. Here, dopamine is fully characterized as an alternative substrate of the DODA enzyme able to yield an intermediate and structural unit of plant pigments: 6-decarboxy-betalamic acid, which is proposed and described. To characterize this activity, quinoa grains of different colors were analyzed in depth by chromatography, time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and reactions were performed in enzymatic assays and bioreactors. The enzymatic-chemical scheme proposed leads to an uncharacterized family of 6-decarboxylated betalains produced by a hitherto unknown enzymatic activity. All intermediate compounds as well as the final products of the dopamine-based biosynthetic pathway of pigments have been unambiguously determined and the reactions have been characterized from the enzymatic and functional perspectives. Results evidence a palette of molecules in quinoa grains of physiological relevance and which explain minor betalains described in plants of the Caryophyllales order. An entire family of betalains is anticipated.
