Herbaceous peony is an important cut-flower plant cultivated worldwide, but its short vase life substantially restricts its economic value. It is well established that endogenous hormones regulate the senescence process, but their molecular mechanism in flower senescence remains unclear. Here, we isolated a MYB transcription factor gene, <i>PlMYB308</i>, from herbaceous peony flowers, based on transcriptome data. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that <i>PlMYB308</i> is strongly up-regulated in senescing petals, and its expression was induced by abscisic acid or ethylene and reduced by gibberellin in petals. Treatment with abscisic acid or ethylene accelerated herbaceous peony petal senescence, and gibberellin delayed the process. <i>PlMYB308</i> silencing delayed peony flower senescence and dramatically increased gibberellin, but reduced ethylene and abscisic acid levels in petals. <i>PlMYB308</i> ectopic overexpression in tobacco accelerated flower senescence and reduced gibberellin, but increased ethylene and abscisic acid accumulation. Correspondingly, five endogenous hormone biosynthetic genes showed variable expression levels in petals after <i>PlMYB308</i> silencing or overexpression. A dual-luciferase assay and yeast one-hybrid analysis showed that PlMYB308 specifically binds the <i>PlACO1</i> promoter. Moreover, treatment with ethylene and 1-MCP can accelerate <i>PlMYB308</i> silencing-reduced senescence and delay <i>PlMYB308</i>- overexpression-induced senescence. We also found that <i>PlACO1</i> silencing delayed senescence in herbaceous peony petals. Taken together, our results suggest that the PlMYB308-<i>PlACO1</i> regulatory checkpoints positively mediate the production of ethylene, and thus contribute to senescence in herbaceous peony flowers.
