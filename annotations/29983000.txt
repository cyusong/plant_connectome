The RNA helicase UP-FRAMESHIFT (UPF1) is a key factor of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a mRNA decay pathway involved in RNA quality control and in the fine-tuning of gene expression. UPF1 recruits UPF2 and UPF3 to constitute the NMD core complex, which is conserved across eukaryotes. No other components of UPF1-containing ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are known in plants, despite its key role in regulating gene expression. Here, we report the identification of a large set of proteins that co-purify with the Arabidopsis UPF1, either in an RNA-dependent or RNA-independent manner. We found that like UPF1, several of its co-purifying proteins have a dual localization in the cytosol and in P-bodies, which are dynamic structures formed by the condensation of translationally repressed mRNPs. Interestingly, more than half of the proteins of the UPF1 interactome also co-purify with DCP5, a conserved translation repressor also involved in P-body formation. We identified a terminal nucleotidyltransferase, ribonucleases and several RNA helicases among the most significantly enriched proteins co-purifying with both UPF1 and DCP5. Among these, RNA helicases are the homologs of DDX6/Dhh1, known as translation repressors in humans and yeast, respectively. Overall, this study reports a large set of proteins associated with the Arabidopsis UPF1 and DCP5, two components of P-bodies, and reveals an extensive interaction network between RNA degradation and translation repression factors. Using this resource, we identified five hitherto unknown components of P-bodies in plants, pointing out the value of this dataset for the identification of proteins potentially involved in translation repression and/or RNA degradation.
