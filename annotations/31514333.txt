Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as vital regulators of many biological processes in animals and plants. However, to our knowledge no investigations on plant lncRNAs which respond to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have been reported thus far. In this study, maize roots colonized with AM fungus were analyzed by strand-specific RNA-Seq to identify AM fungi-responsive lncRNAs and construct an associated regulatory network. A total of 1837 differentially expressed protein coding genes (DEGs) were identified from maize roots with <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> inoculation. Many AM fungi-responsive genes were homologs to <i>MtPt4</i>, <i>STR</i>, <i>STR2</i>, <i>MtFatM</i>, and enriched pathways such as fatty acid biosynthesis, response to phosphate starvation, and nitrogen metabolism are consistent with previous studies. In total, 5941 lncRNAs were identified, of which more than 3000 were new. Of those, 63 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. The putative target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were mainly related to phosphate ion transmembrane transport, cellular response to potassium ion starvation, and lipid catabolic processes. Regulatory network analysis showed that DELs might be involved in the regulation of bidirectional nutrient exchange between plant and AM fungi as mimicry of microRNA targets. The results of this study can broaden our knowledge on the interaction between plant and AM fungi.
