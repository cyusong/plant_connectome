['9390433', 'Two recessive mutant alleles at CAN OF WORMS1 (COW1), a new locus involved in  root hair morphogenesis, have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh.  Root hairs on Cow1- mutants are short and wide and occasionally formed as pairs  at a single site of hair formation. The COW1 locus maps to chromosome 4. Root  hairs on Cow1- plants form in the usual positions, suggesting that the phenotype  is not the result of abnormal positional signals. Root hairs on Cow1- roots begin  hair formation normally, forming a small bulge, or root hair initiation site, of  normal size and shape and in the usual position on the hair-forming cell.  However, when Cow1- root hairs start to elongate by tip growth, abnormalities in  the shape and elongation rate of the hairs become apparent. Genetic evidence from  double-mutant analysis of cow1-1 and other loci involved in root hair development  supports our conclusion that COW1 is required during root hair elongation.', '1997 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.115.3.981', 'Dolan']
