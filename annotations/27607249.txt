Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are a major group of flavonoids synthesized via the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, however the pathway has not been fully characterized in buckwheat. Anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) are involved in the last steps of PA biosynthesis. To isolate the genes for these enzymes from buckwheat we performed PCR using degenerate primers and obtained cDNAs of ANR and LAR, which we designated FeANR and FeLAR1. A search for homologs in a buckwheat genome database with both sequences returned two more LAR sequences, designated FeLAR2 and FeLAR3. Linkage analysis with an F<sub>2</sub> segregating population indicated that the three LAR loci were not genetically linked. We detected high levels of PAs in roots and cotyledons of buckwheat seedlings and in buds and flowers of mature plants. FeANR and FeLAR1-3 were expressed in most organs but had different expression patterns. Our findings would be useful for breeding and further analysis of PA synthesis and its regulation in buckwheat.
