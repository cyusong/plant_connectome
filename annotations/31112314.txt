Seed germination is a fundamental process in the plant life cycle and is regulated by functionally opposing internal and external inputs. Here we explored the role of a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, a B-box-containing protein (BBX19), as a molecular link between the inhibitory action of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) and the promoting role of light in germination. We show that seeds of BBX19-overexpressing lines, in contrast to those of BBX19 RNA interference lines, display ABA hypersensitivity, albeit independently of elongated hypocotyl 5 (HY5). Moreover, we establish that BBX19 functions neither via perturbation of GA signaling, the ABA antagonistic phytohormone, nor through interference with the DELLA protein germination repressors. Rather, BBX19 functions as an inducer of ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) by binding to the light-responsive GT1 motifs in the gene promoter. In summary, we identify BBX19 as a regulatory checkpoint, directing diverse developmental processes and tailoring adaptive responses to distinct endogenous and exogenous signals.
