Cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs) that are regulated by calmodulin (CaM) have been shown to play essential roles in signal transduction, metabolism, and growth in animals. By contrast, very little is known about the subcellular location and the function of these channels in plants. Here we report on the effects of antisense suppression of the expression of AtCNGC10, a putative K+ channel, and the immunolocalization of the protein using an AtCNGC10-specific antiserum. In Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, AtCNGC10 was localized to the plasma membrane of mesophyll and parenchyma cells. Antisense AtCNGC10 plants had 40% of the AtCNGC10 mRNA levels and virtually undetectable protein levels relative to wild type plants. Antisense expression of AtCNGC10 did not affect the mRNA levels of AtCNGC13, the most closely related CNGC family member in the genome. Relative to wild type Columbia, antisense AtCNGC10 plants flowered 10 days earlier, and had a 25% reduction in leaf surface area, thickness and palisade parenchyma cell length. Their roots responded more slowly to gravitropic changes and the chloroplasts accumulated more starch. We propose that AtCNGC10, through interactions with CaM and cGMP, modulates cellular K+ balance across the plasma membrane, and that perturbations of this K+ gradient affect numerous growth and developmental processes.
