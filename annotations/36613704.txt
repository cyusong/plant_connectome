Cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i> L.) is a crop plant being the third most-produced vegetable developed as a new model plant. Heavy metal pollution is a serious global problem that affects crop production. An industrial activity has led to high emissions of Cd into the environment. Plants realize adaptive strategies to diminish the toxic effects of Cd. They can remove excess toxic ions of heavy metals from the cytoplasm to the outside of cells using the metal/proton antiport. The proton gradient needed for the action of the antiporter is generated by the plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (EC 3.6.3.14). We have shown that treatment of cucumber plants with Cd stimulated the diamine oxidase (DAO, EC 1.4.3.6) activity in roots. Under cadmium stress, the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity also increased in cucumber seedlings. The stimulating effect of Cd on the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and expression of three genes encoding this enzyme (<i>CsHA2</i>, <i>CsHA4</i>, <i>CsHA8</i>) was reduced by aminoguanidine (AG, a DAO inhibitor). Moreover, we have observed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by DAO promotes the formation of NO in the roots of seedlings. The results presented in this work showed that DAO may be an element of the signal transduction pathway, leading to enhanced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity under cadmium stress.
