The development of a series of elite maize hybrids has greatly increased crop yield in the past decades. Parental lines of these hybrids usually come from different heterotic groups and contain many genetic differences. Identifications of important quantitative trait genes in the elite hybrids can extend our understanding of heterosis and also help to guide genetic improvement. Here, we mapped a major quantitative trait locus using a linkage population from an elite maize hybrid Zhengdan958 and identified ZmLNG1 as the causative gene controlling multiple morphologic traits in maize. A 6-kb deletion in one parental line of the hybrid leads to the fusion of ZmLNG1 with its nearby gene. The fusion event prevents the C-terminal of ZmLNG1 from interacting with ZmTON1, which resulted in the change of plant architecture. Further experiments demonstrated that ZmLNG1 could act as a mediator to connect ZmTON1 and ZmOFPs, which belong to another type of plant morphological regulatory proteins, thereby affecting the phosphorylation level of ZmOFPs. These results demonstrate the importance of ZmLNG1 in forming the TON1-TRM-PP2A complex and provide a model for the regulation of plant organ morphology by TON1-recruiting motifs (TRMs) and Ovate family proteins (OFPs).
