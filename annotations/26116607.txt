['26116607', 'The glycosylation of nicotinate (NA), a key intermediate of the NAD salvage  pathway, occurs widely in land plants. However, the physiological function of NA  glycosylation is not well understood in planta, and no gene encoding NA  glycosyltransferase has been reported to date. NA glycosylation in Arabidopsis  thaliana occurs at either the N- or the O-position of the NA molecule, and  O-glucosylation appears to be unique to the Brassicaceae. Using gene-enzyme  correlations focused on Family 1 glycosyltransferases (GTs; EC 2.4), we  identified and characterized three Arabidopsis GTs, which are likely involved in  NA glycosylation. These include one NAOGT (UGT74F2; previously identified as a  salicylic acid glycosyltransferases) and two NANGTs (UGT76C4 and UGT76C5).  Arabidopsis mutants of UGT74F2 accumulate higher levels of free NA, but not  salicylic acid, than that of the wild type, and this inversely correlated with  seed germination rates under various abiotic stresses. The germination defect of  the ugt74f2-1 mutant could be fully complemented by overexpression of UGT74F2.  These observations, together with comprehensive chemical analysis, suggest that  NA glycosylation may function to protect plant cells from the toxicity of NA  overaccumulation during seed germination. Combined with phylogenetic analysis,  our results suggest that NAOGTs arose recently in the Brassicaceae family and may  provide a fitness benefit. The multifunctionality of UGT74F2 in Arabidopsis is  also investigated and discussed.', '2015 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00223', 'ORCID:']
