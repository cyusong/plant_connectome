Iridoid monoterpenes, widely distributed in plants and insects, have many ecological functions. While the biosynthesis of iridoids has been extensively studied in plants, little is known about how insects synthesize these natural products. Here, we elucidated the biosynthesis of the iridoids <i>cis</i>-<i>trans-</i>nepetalactol and <i>cis</i>-<i>trans-</i>nepetalactone in the pea aphid <i>Acyrthosiphon pisum</i> (Harris), where they act as sex pheromones. The exclusive production of iridoids in hind legs of sexual female aphids allowed us to identify iridoid genes by searching for genes specifically expressed in this tissue. Biochemical characterization of candidate enzymes revealed that the iridoid pathway in aphids proceeds through the same sequence of intermediates as described for plants. The six identified aphid enzymes are unrelated to their counterparts in plants, conclusively demonstrating an independent evolution of the entire iridoid pathway in plants and insects. In contrast to the plant pathway, at least three of the aphid iridoid enzymes are likely membrane bound. We demonstrated that a lipid environment facilitates the cyclization of a reactive enol intermediate to the iridoid cyclopentanoid-pyran scaffold in vitro, suggesting that membranes are an essential component of the aphid iridoid pathway. Altogether, our discovery of this complex insect metabolic pathway establishes the genetic and biochemical basis for the formation of iridoid sex pheromones in aphids, and this discovery also serves as a foundation for understanding the convergent evolution of complex metabolic pathways between kingdoms.
