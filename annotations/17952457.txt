In the present study, we investigated the role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in regulating the levels of reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to the tolerance of calli from two reed ecotypes, Phragmites communis Trin. dune reed (DR) and swamp reed (SR), in a long-term salt stress. G6PDH activity was higher in SR callus than that of DR callus under 50-150 mM NaCl treatments. In contrast, at higher NaCl concentrations (300-600 mM), G6PDH activity was lower in SR callus. A similar profile was observed in GSH contents, glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities in both salt-stressed calli. After G6PDH activity and expression were reduced in glycerol treatments, GSH contents and GR and GPX activity decreased strongly in both calli. Simultaneously, NaCl-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation was also abolished. Exogenous application of H2O2 increased G6PDH, GR, and GPX activities and GSH contents in the control conditions and glycerol treatment. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a plasma membrane (PM) NADPH oxidase inhibitor, which counteracted NaCl-induced H(2)O(2) accumulation, decreased these enzymes activities and GSH contents. Furthermore, exogenous application of H2O2 abolished the N-acetyl-L: -cysteine (NAC)-induced decrease in G6PDH activity, and DPI suppressed the effect of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) on induction of G6PDH activity. Western-blot analyses showed that G6PDH expression was stimulated by NaCl and H2O2, and blocked by DPI in DR callus. Taken together, G6PDH activity involved in GSH maintenance and H2O2 accumulation under salt stress. And H2O2 regulated G6PDH, GR, and GPX activities to maintain GSH levels. In the process, G6PDH plays a central role.
