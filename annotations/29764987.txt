['29764987', 'Plants have adapted to tolerate and survive constantly changing environmental  conditions by reprogramming gene expression The dynamics of the contribution of  alternative splicing (AS) to stress responses are unknown. RNA-sequencing of a  time-series of Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to cold determines the timing  of significant AS changes. This shows a massive and rapid AS response with  coincident waves of transcriptional and AS activity occurring in the first few  hours of temperature reduction and further AS throughout the cold. In particular,  hundreds of genes showed changes in expression due to rapidly occurring AS in  response to cold ("early AS" genes); these included numerous novel  cold-responsive transcription factors and splicing factors/RNA binding proteins  regulated only by AS. The speed and sensitivity to small temperature changes of  AS of some of these genes suggest that fine-tuning expression via AS pathways  contributes to the thermo-plasticity of expression. Four early AS splicing  regulatory genes have been shown previously to be required for freezing tolerance  and acclimation; we provide evidence of a fifth gene, U2B"-LIKE Such factors  likely drive cascades of AS of downstream genes that, alongside transcription,  modulate transcriptome reprogramming that together govern the physiological and  survival responses of plants to low temperature.', '2018 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00177', 'ORCID:']
