Microbes, especially abundant microbes in bulk soils, form multiple ecosystem functions, which is relatively well studied. However, the role of rhizosphere microbes, especially rhizosphere rare taxa vs. rhizosphere abundant taxa in regulating the element circling, multifunctionality, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and the trade-offs of multiple functions remains largely unknown. Here, we compared the multiple ecosystem functions, the structure and function of rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal subcommunities (locally rare, locally abundant, regionally rare, regionally abundant, and entire), and the role of subcommunities in the <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>Sophora davidii</i> sole and <i>Z. mays/S. davidii</i> intercropping ecosystems in subtropical China. Results showed that intercropping altered multiple ecosystem functions individually and simultaneously. Intercropped <i>Z. mays</i> significantly decreased the trade-off intensity compared to sole <i>Z. mays</i>, the trade-off intensity under intercropped <i>S. davidii</i> was significantly higher than under intercropped <i>Z. mays</i>. The beta diversities of bacterial and fungal communities, and fungal functions in each subcommunity significantly differed among groups. Network analysis showed intercropping increased the complexity and positive links of rare bacteria in <i>Z. mays</i> rhizosphere, but decreased the complexity and positive links of rare bacteria in <i>S. davidii</i> rhizosphere and the complexity and positive links of fungi in both intercropped plants rhizosphere. Mantel test showed significant changes in species of locally rare bacteria were most strongly related to nitrogen-cycling multifunctionality, ANPP and trade-offs intensity, significant changes in species of locally rare fungus were most strongly related to carbon-cycling multifunctionality, phosphorus-cycling multifunctionality, and average ecosystem multifunctionality. This research highlights the potential and role of rare rhizosphere microorganisms in predicting and regulating system functions, productivity, and trade-offs.
