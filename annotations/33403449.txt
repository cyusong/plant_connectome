Previous studies on engineering osmoprotectant metabolic pathway genes focused on the performance of transgenic plants under salt stress conditions rather than elucidating the underlying mechanism(s), and hence, the mechanism(s) remain(s) unclear. Salt stress negatively impacts agricultural crop yields. Hence, to meet future food demands, it is essential to generate salt stress-resistant varieties. Although traditional breeding has improved salt tolerance in several crops, this approach remains inadequate due to the low genetic diversity of certain important crop cultivars. Genetic engineering is used to introduce preferred gene(s) from any genetic reserve or to modify the expression of the existing gene(s) responsible for salt stress response or tolerance, thereby leading to improved salt tolerance in plants. Although plants naturally produce osmoprotectants as an adaptive mechanism for salt stress tolerance, they offer only partial protection. Recently, progress has been made in the identification and characterization of genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of osmoprotectants. Exogenous application of these osmoprotectants, and genetic engineering of enzymes in their biosynthetic pathways, have been reported to enhance salt tolerance in different plants. However, no clear mechanistic model exists to explain how osmoprotectant accumulation in transgenic plants confers salt tolerance. This review critically examines the results obtained thus far for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of osmoprotectants for improved salt tolerance, and thus, crop yield stability under salt stress conditions, through the genetic engineering of trehalose, glycinebetaine, and proline metabolic pathway genes.
