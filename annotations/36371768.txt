Flower color is a trait that affects the ornamental value of a plant. Camellia sasanqua is a horticultural plant with rich flower color, but little is known about the regulatory mechanism of color diversity in this plant. Here, the anthocyanin profile of 20 C. sasanqua cultivars revealed and quantified 11 anthocyanin derivatives (five delphinidin-based and six cyanidin-based anthocyanins) for the first time. Cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside was the main contributor to flower base color, and the accumulation of cyanidin and delphinidin derivatives differed in the petals. To further explore the molecular mechanism of color divergence, a transcriptome analysis was performed using C. sasanqua cultivars 'YingYueYe', 'WanXia', 'XueYueHua', and'XiaoMeiGui'. The co-expression network related to differences in delphinidin and cyanidin derivatives accumulation was identified. Eleven candidate genes encoding key enzymes (e.g., F3H, F3'H, and ANS) were involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Moreover, 27 transcription factors were screened as regulators of the two types of accumulating anthocyanins. The association was suggested by correlation analysis between the expression levels of the candidate genes and the different camellia cultivars. We concluded that cyanidin and delphinidin derivatives are the major drivers of color diversity in C. sasanqua. This finding provides valuable resources for the study of flower color in C. sasanqua and lays a foundation for genetic modification of anthocyanin biosynthesis.
