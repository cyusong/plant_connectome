DNA copy number variation (CNV) occurs due to deletion or duplication of DNA segments resulting in a different number of copies of a specific DNA-stretch on homologous chromosomes. Implications of CNVs in evolution and development of different diseases have been demonstrated although contribution of environmental factors, such as mutagens, in the origin of CNVs, is poorly understood. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about mutagen-induced CNVs in human, animal and plant cells. Differences in CNV frequencies induced by radiation and chemical mutagens, distribution of CNVs in the genome, as well as adaptive effects in plants, are discussed. Currently available information concerning impact of mutagens in induction of CNVs in germ cells is presented. Moreover, the potential of CNVs as a new endpoint in mutagenicity test-systems is discussed.
