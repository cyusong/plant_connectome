FtsHs are a well-characterized family of membrane bound proteases containing an AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) and a Zn(2+) metalloprotease domain. FtsH proteases are found in eubacteria, animals and plants and are known to have a crucial role in housekeeping proteolysis of membrane proteins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 12 FtsH family members are present (FtsH 1-12) and their subcellular localization is restricted to mitochondria and chloroplasts. In addition, five genes coding for proteins homologous to FtsH (FtsHi 1-5) have been detected in the genome, lacking the conserved zinc-binding motif HEXXH, which presumably renders them inactive for proteolysis. These inactive FtsHs as well as nine of the active FtsHs are thought to be localized in the chloroplast. In this article, we shortly summarize the recent findings on plastidic FtsH proteases in text and figures. We will mainly focus on FtsH 1, 2, 5 and 8 localized in the thylakoid membrane and known for their importance in photosynthesis.
