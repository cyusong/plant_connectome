The photosynthetic rate may be strongly limited by internal conductance from the intercellular airspace to the chloroplast stroma (g(i)). However, the effects of growth and leaf temperature on g(i) are still unclarified. In this work, we determined the temperature dependence of g(i) in spinach leaves grown at 30/25 degrees C (high temperature; HT) and 15/10 degrees C (low temperature; LT), using the concurrent measurements of the gas exchange rate and stable carbon isotope ratio. Moreover, we quantified the effects of g(i) on the temperature dependence of the photosynthetic rate. We measured g(i) and the photosynthetic rate at a CO(2) concentration of 360 microl l(-1) under saturating light (A(360)) at different leaf temperatures. The optimum temperature for A(360) was 28.5 degrees C in HT leaves and 22.9 degrees C in LT leaves. The optimum temperatures for g(i) were almost similar to those of A(360) in both HT and LT leaves. There was a strong linear relationship between A(360) and g(i). The photosynthetic rates predicted from the C(3) photosynthesis model taking account of g(i) agreed well with A(360) in both HT and LT leaves. The temperature coefficients (Q(10)) of g(i) between 10 and 20 degrees C were 2.0 and 1.8 in HT and LT leaves, respectively. This suggests that g(i) was determined not only by physical diffusion but by processes facilitated by protein(s). The limitation of the photosynthetic rate imposed by g(i) increased with leaf temperature and was greater than the limitation of the stomatal conductance at any temperature, in both HT and LT leaves. This study suggests that g(i) substantially limits the photosynthetic rate, especially at higher temperatures.
