The threshold of tolerance for nitrate of the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth and the host plant Sorghum bicolor L. was determined by estimating the impact of increasing nitrate loads on plant growth and various parameters of C and N assimilation. Nitrate supply improved chlorophyll (Chl) content and photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry of infected S. bicolor that, in comparison to S. hermonthica, displayed a low imbalance between C and N assimilation when nitrate was supplied up to 1500 mg N per plant. Indeed, nitrate supplies increased strongly the leaf N:C ratio of the parasite. The higher nitrate load induced strong accumulation of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium, and consequently the death of S. hermonthica. Nevertheless, lower nitrate loads (up to 500 mg N per S. bicolor in this study) promoted leaf expansion, PSII photochemistry and N metabolism of S. hermonthica mature (M) plants, as attested by the significant rise in soluble protein and free amino-acid contents. Following these N supplies, the nitrate tolerance of S. hermonthica was correlated with an increase in PSII activity and a high incorporation of N excess into asparagine. This confirmed the central role of asparagine in the N metabolism of S. hermonthica, although this detoxification pathway was insufficient to limit ammonium accumulation under higher nitrate loads.
