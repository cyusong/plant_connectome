Perception and transduction of salt stress signals are critical for plant survival, growth, and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the salt stress-signaling pathway is important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) molecular breeding of salt stress resistance. Here, we report the identification of an apetala2/ethylene response factor transcription factor INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of rice salt tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of salt tolerance in rice. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR assays and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-box-containing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic stress-responsive genes, including <i>LEA1</i> (<i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN1</i>) and <i>SOS1</i> (<i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i>), which are key genes regulating rice salt tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor topless-related 1 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> further defined the molecular foundation of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates salt stress signaling as well as salt tolerance in rice.
