Aquaporins such as the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) allow water to move through cell membranes and are vital for stomatal movement in plants. Despite their importance, the dynamic changes in aquaporins during water efflux and influx have not been directly observed in real time in vivo. Here, to determine which factors regulate these changes during the bidirectional translocation of water, we examined aquaporin dynamics during the stomatal immune response to the bacterial flagellin-derived peptide flg22. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) aquaporin mutant pip2;1 showed defects in the flg22-induced stomatal response. Variable-angle total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed that the movement dynamics and dwell times of AQ6]GFP-AtPIP2;1 in guard cells and subsidiary cells exhibited cell type-specific dependencies on flg22. The cytoskeleton, rather than the cell wall, was the major factor regulating AtPIP2;1 dynamics, although both the cytoskeleton and cell wall might form bounded domains that restrict the diffusion of AtPIP2;1 in guard cells and subsidiary cells. Finally, our analysis revealed the different roles of cortical actin and microtubules in regulating AtPIP2;1 dynamics in guard cells, as well as subsidiary cells, under various conditions. Our observations shed light on the heterogeneous mechanisms that regulate membrane protein dynamics in plants in response to pathogens.
