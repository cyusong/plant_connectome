Some of trees in cool and temperate regions regulate bud burst by perceiving photoperiod. However, it is not clear whether the difference in bud burst timing between the two photoperiod conditions is due to differences in perception of day length or the daily light integral (DLI) because majority of studies concerning the photoperiodic regulation of bud burst make use of an experimental design that compares the differential timing of bud burst between long and shortday length. We conducted night and day interrupt experiments using twig cuttings of Japanese beech, <i>Fagus crenata</i>, to investigate the effect of photoperiod on bud burst. Twigs with leaf buds were collected in winter (February 2020) and maintained in four conditions: 1) long day length (16L8D; LD), 2) short day length (8L16D; SD), 3) day interruption for 2-h in the middle of the 16-h light period and a 6-h dark period (DI; total time of light period is the same as LD), and 4) night interruption with 2-h of light in the middle of the dark period and a 6-h light period (NI; total time of light period is the same as SD) for a duration of 40 d. We then measured the number of days until burst for each bud. Timing of bud burst was delayed in the SD treatment compared to the LD, DI, and NI treatments. These results demonstrate that the difference in bud burst phenology observed between SD and LD conditions is mainly due to day length perception rather than DLI, and an uninterrupted night period plays a major role in the perception of photoperiod. Our results provide the experimental evidence of perception of photoperiod regulating bud burst in spring.
