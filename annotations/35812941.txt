Soybean frogeye leaf spot (FLS) is a worldwide fungal disease. Its higher occurrence frequency and wider distribution range always led to severe yield losses of soybean, therefore, breeding new cultivars with FLS resistance has been an important breeding goal for soybean breeders. In this study, an association panel of 183 representative soybean accessions was used to evaluate their resistance to FLS race 1, and to identify quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) and candidate genes based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) and high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A total of 23,156 high-quality SNPs were developed using the specific locus-amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) approach. Finally, 13 novel association signals associated with FLS race 1 resistance were identified by the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM). In addition, 119 candidate genes were found within the 200-kb flanking genomic region of these 13 peak SNPs. Based on the gene-based association analysis, haplotype analysis, expression pattern analysis, and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) systems, four genes (<i>Glyma.05G121100</i>, <i>Glyma.17G228300</i>, <i>Glyma.19G006900</i>, and <i>Glyma.19G008700</i>) were preliminarily proved to play an important role in the soybean resistance to FLS race 1.
