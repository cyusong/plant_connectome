The monogenic recessive maize (Zea mays) mutant rootless with undetectable meristems 1 (rum1) is deficient in the initiation of the embryonic seminal roots and the postembryonic lateral roots at the primary root. Lateral root initiation at the shoot-borne roots and development of the aerial parts of the mutant rum1 are not affected. The mutant rum1 displays severely reduced auxin transport in the primary root and a delayed gravitropic response. Exogenously applied auxin does not induce lateral roots in the primary root of rum1. Lateral roots are initiated in a specific cell type, the pericycle. Cell-type-specific transcriptome profiling of the primary root pericycle 64 h after germination, thus before lateral root initiation, via a combination of laser capture microdissection and subsequent microarray analyses of 12k maize microarray chips revealed 90 genes preferentially expressed in the wild-type pericycle and 73 genes preferentially expressed in the rum1 pericycle (fold change >2; P-value <0.01; estimated false discovery rate of 13.8%). Among the 51 annotated genes predominately expressed in the wild-type pericycle, 19 genes are involved in signal transduction, transcription, and the cell cycle. This analysis defines an array of genes that is active before lateral root initiation and will contribute to the identification of checkpoints involved in lateral root formation downstream of rum1.
