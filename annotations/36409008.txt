Nitrate is a major nutrient and osmoticum for plants. To deal with fluctuating nitrate availability in soils, plants store this nutrient in their vacuoles. Chloride channel a (CLCa), a 2NO3-/1H+ exchanger localized to the vacuole in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ensures this storage process. CLCa belongs to the CLC family, which includes anion/proton exchangers and anion channels. A mutation in a glutamate residue conserved across CLC exchangers is likely responsible for the conversion of exchangers to channels. Here, we show that CLCa with a mutation in glutamate 203 (E203) behaves as an anion channel in its native membrane. We introduced the CLCaE203A point mutation to investigate its physiological importance into the Arabidopsis clca knockout mutant. These CLCaE203A mutants displayed a growth deficit linked to the disruption of water homeostasis. Additionally, CLCaE203A expression failed to complement the defect in nitrate accumulation of clca and favored higher N-assimilation at the vegetative stage. Further analyses at the post-flowering stages indicated that CLCaE203A expression results in an increase in N uptake allocation to seeds, leading to a higher nitrogen use efficiency compared to the wild-type. Altogether, these results point to the critical function of the CLCa exchanger on the vacuole for plant metabolism and development.
