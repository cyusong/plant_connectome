Dynamic reorganization of photosystems I and II is suggested to occur in chloroplast thylakoid membranes to maintain the efficiency of photosynthesis under fluctuating light conditions. To directly observe the process in action, live-cell imaging techniques are necessary. Using live-cell imaging, we have shown that the fine thylakoid structures in the moss Physcomitrella patens are flexible in time. However, the spatiotemporal resolution of a conventional confocal microscopy limits more precise visualization of entire thylakoid structures and understanding of the structural dynamics. Here, we discuss the issues related to observing chlorophyll fluorescence at multiple spatiotemporal scales in vivo and in vitro.
