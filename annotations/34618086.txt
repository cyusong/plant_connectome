Rho family proteins are central to the regulation of cell polarity in eukaryotes. Rho of Plants-Guanyl nucleotide Exchange Factor (ROPGEF) can form self-organizing polar domains following co-expression with an Rho of Plants (ROP) and an ROP GTPase-Activating Protein (ROPGAP). Localization of ROPs in these domains has not been demonstrated, and the mechanisms underlying domain formation and function are not well understood. Here we show that six different ROPs form self-organizing domains when co-expressed with ROPGEF3 and GAP1 in Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Domain formation was associated with ROP-ROPGEF3 association, reduced ROP mobility, as revealed by time-lapse imaging and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching beam size analysis, and was independent of Rho GTP Dissociation Inhibitor mediated recycling. The domain formation depended on the ROPs' activation/inactivation cycles and interaction with anionic lipids via a C-terminal polybasic domain. Coexpression with the microtubule-associated protein ROP effector INTERACTOR OF CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE ROP 1 (ICR1) revealed differential function of the ROP domains in the ability to recruit ICR1. Taken together, the results reveal mechanisms underlying self-organizing ROP domain formation and function.
