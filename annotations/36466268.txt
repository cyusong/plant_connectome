Over the course of evolution, plants have developed plasticity to acclimate to environmental stresses such as drought and salt stress. These plant adaptation measures involve the activation of cascades of molecular networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction and the expression of stress related genes. Here, we investigated the role of the plasma membrane-localized transporter of auxin PINFORMED1 (PIN1) in the regulation of pavement cells (PCs) and guard cells (GCs) development under drought and salt stress conditions. The results showed that drought and salt stress treatment affected the development of PCs and GCs. Further analysis identified the different regulation mechanisms of PIN1 in regulating the developmental patterns of PCs and GCs under drought and salt stress conditions. Drought and salt stress also regulated the expression dynamics of PIN1 in <i>pif1/3/4/5</i> quadruple mutants. Collectively, we revealed that PIN1 plays a crucial role in regulating plant epidermal cells development under drought and salt stress conditions, thus contributing to developmental rebustness and plasticity.
