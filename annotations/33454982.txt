The DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1) family genes (DFGs) in Arabidopsis thaliana are involved in seed dormancy, reserve accumulation, and desiccation tolerance. Decoding the molecular evolution of DFGs is key to understanding how these seed programs evolved. This article demonstrates that DFGs have diverged in the four lineages DOG1, DOG1-LIKE4 (DOGL4), DOGL5 and DOGL6, whereas DOGL1, DOGL2 and DOGL3 arose separately within the DOG1 lineage. The systematic DFG nomenclature proposed in this article addresses the current issues of inconsistent DFG annotation and highlights DFG genomic synteny in angiosperms. DFG pseudogenes, or collapsed coding sequences, hidden in the genomes of early-diverging angiosperms are documented here. They suggest ancient birth and loss of DFGs over the course of angiosperm evolution. The proposed models suggest that the origin of DFG diversification dates back to the most recent common ancestor of living angiosperms. The presence of a single form of DFG in nonflowering plants is discussed. Phylogenetic analysis of gymnosperm, lycophyte, and liverwort DFGs and similar genes found in mosses and algae suggests that DFGs diverged from the TGACG motif-binding transcription factor genes before the divergence of the bryophyte lineage.
