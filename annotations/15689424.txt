We developed an adequate method for the in vivo analysis of organelle dynamics in the gravity-perceptive cell (endodermis) of the Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence stem, revealing behavior of amyloplasts and vacuolar membranes in those cells. Amyloplasts in the endodermis showed saltatory movements even before gravistimulation by reorientation, and these movements were confirmed as microfilament dependent. From our quantitative analysis in the wild type, the gravity-oriented movement of amyloplasts mainly occurred during 0 to 3 min after gravistimulation by reorientation, supporting findings from our previous physiological study. Even after microfilament disruption, the gravity-oriented movement of amyloplasts remained. By contrast, in zig/sgr4 mutants, where a SNARE molecule functioning in vacuole biogenesis has been disrupted, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis is severely restricted both before and after gravistimulation by reorientation. Here, we describe vacuolar membrane behavior in these cells in the wild-type, actin filament-disrupted, and zig/sgr4 mutants and discuss its putatively important features for the perception of gravity. We also discuss the data on the two kinds of movements of amyloplasts that may play an important role in gravitropism: (1) the leading edge amyloplasts and (2) the en mass movement of amyloplasts.
