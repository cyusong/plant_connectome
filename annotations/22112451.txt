Photosynthetic pigment accumulation and cellular and filament morphology are regulated reversibly by green light (GL) and red light (RL) in the cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon during complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA). The photoreceptor RcaE (regulator of chromatic adaptation), which appears to function as a light-responsive sensor kinase, controls both of these responses. Recent findings indicate that downstream of RcaE, the signaling pathways leading to light-dependent changes in morphology or pigment synthesis and/or accumulation branch, and utilize distinct molecular components. We recently reported that the regulation of the accumulation of the GL-absorbing photosynthetic accessory protein phycoerythrin (PE) and photoregulation of cellular morphology are largely independent, as many mutants with severe PE accumulation defects do not have major disruptions in the regulation of cellular morphology. Furthermore, morphology can be disrupted under GL without impacting GL-dependent PE accumulation. Most recently, however, we determined that the disruption of the cpeR gene, which encodes a protein that is known to function as an activator of PE synthesis under GL, results in disruption of cellular morphology under GL and RL. Thus, apart from RcaE, CpeR is only the second known regulator to impact morphology under both light conditions in F. diplosiphon.
