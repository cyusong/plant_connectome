['21278126', 'The phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) superfamily of lipolytic enzymes is involved in a  number of essential biological processes, such as inflammation, development, host  defense, and signal transduction. Despite the proven involvement of plant PLA(2)s  in many biological functions, including senescence, wounding, elicitor and stress  responses, and pathogen defense, relatively little is known about plant PLA(2)s,  and their genes essentially remain uncharacterized. We characterized three of  four Arabidopsis thaliana PLA(2) paralogs (PLA(2)-beta, -gamma, and -delta) and found that  they (1) are expressed during pollen development, (2) localize to the endoplasmic  reticulum and/or Golgi, and (3) play critical roles in pollen development and  germination and tube growth. The suppression of PLA(2) using the RNA interference  approach resulted in pollen lethality. The inhibition of pollen germination by  pharmacological PLA(2) inhibitors was rescued by a lipid signal molecule,  lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine. Based on these results, we propose that plant  reproduction, in particular, male gametophyte development, requires the  activities of the lipid-modifying PLA(2)s that are conserved in other organisms.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074799', 'Shin']
