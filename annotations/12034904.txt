['12034904', 'Although a large number of embryo mutants have been studied, mostly at the  morphological level, the critical molecular and cellular events responsible for  embryogenesis are unknown. Here, we report that using an enhancer-trap embryo  mutant of Arabidopsis, we identified a gene, ROOT-SHOOT-HYPOCOTYL-DEFECTIVE  (RSH), that is essential for the correct positioning of the cell plate during  cytokinesis in cells of the developing embryo. We traced the earliest point of  influence of RSH to the first asymmetrical division of the zygote. Homozygous rsh  embryos were defective morphologically, had irregular cell shape and size, and  germinated to form agravitropic-defective seedlings incapable of further  development. The RSH gene encodes a Hyp-rich glycoprotein-type cell wall protein.  RSH localized to the cell wall throughout the embryo and to a few well-defined  postembryonic sites. Although several lines of evidence from previous work  suggest that the cell wall is involved in development, the protein(s) involved  remained elusive.', '2002 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010477', 'Cannon']
