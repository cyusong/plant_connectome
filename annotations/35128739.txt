The repression of transcription from transposable elements (TEs) by DNA methylation is necessary to maintain genome integrity and prevent harmful mutations. However, under certain circumstances, TEs may escape from the host defense system and reactivate their transcription. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), DNA demethylases target the sequences derived from TEs in the central cell, the progenitor cell for the endosperm in the female gametophyte. Genome-wide DNA demethylation is also observed in the endosperm after fertilization. In the present study, we used a custom microarray to survey the transcripts generated from TEs during rice endosperm development and at selected time points in the embryo as a control. The expression patterns of TE transcripts are dynamically up- and downregulated during endosperm development, especially those of miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs). Some TE transcripts were directionally controlled, whereas the other DNA transposons and retrotransposons were not. We also discovered the NUCLEAR FACTOR Y binding motif, CCAAT, in the region near the 5' terminal inverted repeat of Youren, one of the transcribed MITEs in the endosperm. Our results uncover dynamic changes in TE activity during endosperm development in rice.
