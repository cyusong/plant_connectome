The mainly Australian grass genus <i>Austrostipa</i> (tribe Stipeae) comprising approximately 64 species represents a remarkable example of an evolutionary radiation. To investigate aspects of diversification, macro- and micromorphological variation in this genus, we conducted molecular phylogenetic and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses including representatives from most of <i>Austrostipa</i>'s currently accepted subgenera. Because of its taxonomic significance in Stipeae, we studied the lemma epidermal pattern (LEP) in 34 representatives of <i>Austrostipa.</i> Plastid DNA variation within <i>Austrostipa</i> was low and only few lineages were resolved. Nuclear ITS and <i>Acc1</i> yielded comparable groupings of taxa and resolved subgenera <i>Arbuscula</i>, <i>Petaurista</i>, and <i>Bambusina</i> in a common clade and as monophyletic. In most of the <i>Austrostipa</i> species studied, the LEP was relatively uniform (typical maize-like), but six species had a modified cellular structure. The species representing subgenera <i>Lobatae</i>, <i>Petaurista</i>, <i>Bambusina</i> as well as <i>A. muelleri</i> from subg. <i>Tuberculatae</i> were well-separated from all the other species included in the analysis. We suggest recognizing nine subgenera in <i>Austrostipa</i> (with number of species): <i>Arbuscula</i> (4), <i>Aulax</i> (2), <i>Austrostipa</i> (36), <i>Bambusina</i> (2), <i>Falcatae</i> (10), <i>Lobatae</i> (5), <i>Longiaristatae</i> (2), <i>Petaurista</i> (2) and the new subgenus <i>Paucispiculatae</i> (1) encompassing <i>A. muelleri</i>. Two paralogous sequence copies of <i>Acc1</i>, forming two distinct clades, were found in polyploid <i>Austrostipa</i> and <i>Anemanthele</i>. We found analogous patterns for our samples of <i>Stipa</i> s.str. with their <i>Acc1</i> clades strongly separated from those of <i>Austrostipa</i> and <i>Anemanthele</i>. This underlines a previous hypothesis of Tzvelev (1977) that most extant Stipeae are of hybrid origin. We also prepared an up-to-date survey and reviewed the chromosome number variation for our molecularly studied taxa and the whole tribe Stipeae. The chromosome base number patterns as well as dysploidy and whole-genome duplication events were interpreted in a phylogenetic framework. The rather coherent picture of chromosome number variation underlines the enormous phylogenetic and evolutionary significance of this frequently ignored character.
