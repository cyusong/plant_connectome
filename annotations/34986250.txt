Leaf imaging via microscopy has provided critical insights into research on photosynthesis at multiple junctures, from the early understanding of the role of stomata, through elucidating C4 photosynthesis via Kranz anatomy and chloroplast arrangement in single cells, to detailed explorations of diffusion pathways and light utilization gradients within leaves. In recent decades, the original two-dimensional (2D) explorations have begun to be visualized in three-dimensional (3D) space, revising our understanding of structure-function relationships between internal leaf anatomy and photosynthesis. In particular, advancing new technologies and analyses are providing fresh insight into the relationship between leaf cellular components and improving the ability to model net carbon fixation, water use efficiency, and metabolite turnover rate in leaves. While ground-breaking developments in imaging tools and techniques have expanded our knowledge of leaf 3D structure via high-resolution 3D and time-series images, there is a growing need for more in vivo imaging as well as metabolite imaging. However, these advances necessitate further improvement in microscopy sciences to overcome the unique challenges a green leaf poses. In this review, we discuss the available tools, techniques, challenges, and gaps for efficient in vivo leaf 3D imaging, as well as innovations to overcome these difficulties.
