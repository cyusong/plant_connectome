Legume plants, due to their distinctive botanical characteristics, such as leaf movements, physiological characteristics, such as nitrogen fixation, and their abilities to endure environmental stresses, have important roles in sustainable pastures development. Leaf movement of legume plants is turgor regulated and osmotically active fluxes of ions between extensor and flexor of pulvinus cause this movement. To determine the role of calcium ions in circadian leaf movements of Phaseolus vulgaris L., a radiotracer technique experiment using 45Ca ions were employed. Measurements were taken during circadian leaf movements, and samples were taken from different parts of the leaflet. The 45Ca beta-particle activity reduced from leaflet base pulvinus to leaf tip. The pulvinus had the highest activity, while the leaf tip had the lowest. By increase of the ratio of 45Ca beta-particle activity within flexor to extensor (Fl/Ex) the midrib-petiole angle, as an indicator of leaf movement, increased linearly during circadian leaf movement (r = 0.86). The 45Ca beta-particle activity of Flex/Ext ratio reduced linearly (r = -0.88) toward midnight. In conclusion, it was found that calcium ions accumulation is opposite to the fluxes of osmatically active ions and water movement. Calcium ions accumulate at less negative water potential side of the pulivnus.
