['18208520', 'Phylloquinone is the one-electron carrier at the A(1) site of photosystem I, and  is essential for photosynthesis. Arabidopsis mutants deficient in early steps of  phylloquinone synthesis do not become autotrophic and are seedling lethals, even  when grown on sucrose-supplemented media. Here, we identify acyl-activating  enzyme 14 (AAE14, At1g30520) as the o-succinylbenzoyl-coenzyme A (OSB-CoA) ligase  acting in phylloquinone synthesis. Three aae14 mutant alleles, identified by  reverse genetics, were found to be seedling lethal, to contain no detectable  phylloquinone (< 0.1 pmol mg(-1) fresh weight) compared with 10 pmol mg(-1) fresh  weight in wild-type leaves, and to accumulate OSB. AAE14 was able to restore  menaquinone biosynthesis when expressed in an Escherichia coli mutant disrupted  in the menE gene that encodes the bacterial OSB-CoA ligase. Weak expression of an  AAE14 transgene in mutant plants (controlled by the uninduced XVE promoter)  resulted in chlorotic, slow-growing plants that accumulated an average of 4.7  pmol mg(-1) fresh weight of phylloquinone. Inducing the XVE promoter in these  plants, or expressing an AAE14 transgene under the control of the CaMV 35S  promoter, led to full complementation of the mutant phenotype. aae14-mutant  plants were also able to synthesize phylloquinone when provided with  1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate, an intermediate in phylloquinone synthesis downstream  of the OSB-CoA ligase reaction. Expression of an AAE14:GFP reporter construct  indicated that the protein accumulated in discrete foci within the chloroplasts.  This and other evidence suggests that the enzymes of phylloquinone synthesis from  isochorismate may form a complex in the chloroplast stroma to facilitate the  efficient channeling of intermediates through the pathway.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03416.x', 'Browse']
