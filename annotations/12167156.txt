['12167156', 'BACKGROUND: A leaf-variegated mutation var1 of Arabidopsis results in the  development of abnormal plastids and the formation of a green/white sector.  Genetic analysis of the var1 mutant indicated that it acts synergistically with  another mutation var2, suggesting that the two genes are relevant. The VAR2 locus  has been shown to encode a chloroplastic FtsH, an ATP-dependent protease which is  possibly involved in the degradation of thylakoid proteins and plastid  development. RESULTS: In this study we show that the VAR1 locus encodes a  chloroplastic FtsH protein homologous to VAR2. VAR1 contains a conserved motif  for ATPase and a metalloprotease characteristic to FtsH proteins, and is targeted  into chloroplasts. A VAR1-fusion protein synthesized in vitro exhibited ATPase  activity and partial metalloprotease activity. The maximum yield of  photochemistry, measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, showed that the var1  mutants were sensitive to photoinhibitory light exposure at 800 micro mol/m2/s.  CONCLUSION: VAR1 and VAR2 comprise an FtsH small gene family together with other  FtsH genes in Arabidopsis. VAR1 as well as VAR2 may play an important role in  degrading photodamaged subunits in photosystem II. Loss of VAR1 and VAR2 perhaps  impairs the photoprotection mechanism and thylakoid development, causing leaf  variegation as a consequence.', '2002 Aug', 'Genes Cells', '10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00558.x', 'Murata']
