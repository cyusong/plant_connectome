Commercial cultivation of the medicinal plant <i>Atractylodes lancea</i> is significantly restricted by low survival rates and reduced yields. Intercropping can reasonably coordinate interspecific interactions, effectively utilize environmental resources, and increase survival and yield. We conducted a field experiment from 2014 to 2016 to analyze the advantages and effects of intercropping on <i>A. lancea</i> survival, growth traits, individual volatile oil content, and total volatile oil content. In addition to <i>A. lancea</i> monoculture (AL), five intercropping combinations were planted: <i>Zea mays</i> L. (ZM) + <i>A. lancea</i>, <i>Tagetes erecta</i> L. (TE) + <i>A. lancea</i>, <i>Calendula officinalis</i> L. (CO) + <i>A. lancea</i>, <i>Glycine max</i> (Linn.) Merr. (GM) + <i>A. lancea</i>, and <i>Polygonum hydropiper</i> L. (PH) + <i>A. lancea</i>. The survival and average rhizome weight of <i>A. lancea</i> was higher in the ZM, CO, and TE treatments than in the monoculture treatment, and the average plant height was higher in all intercropping treatments than in the monoculture. The volatile oil content of <i>A. lancea</i> from the ZM and CO treatments was significantly improved relative to that of monoculture plants. The volatile oil harvest was higher in the ZM, CO, and TE treatments than in the monoculture. We conclude that intercropping is an effective way to increase the survival and yield of <i>A. lancea</i>. Furthermore, intercropping with ZM, CO, and TE increases the harvest of four volatile oils from <i>A. lancea</i>.

Intercropping: !increases! survival and yield of A. lancea
ZM: !improves! volatile oil content of A. lancea
CO: !improves! volatile oil content of A. lancea
TE: !improves! volatile oil content of A. lancea
ZM, CO, TE: !increase! harvest of four volatile oils from A. lancea
