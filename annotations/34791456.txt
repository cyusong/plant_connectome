SAMBA has been identified as a plant-specific regulator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) that controls unidirectional cell cycle progression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but so far its role has not been studied in monocots. Here, we show the association of SAMBA with the APC/C is conserved in maize (Zea mays). Two samba genome edited mutants showed growth defects, such as reduced internode length, shortened upper leaves with erect leaf architecture, and reduced leaf size due to an altered cell division rate and cell expansion, which aggravated with plant age. The two mutants differed in the severity and developmental onset of the phenotypes, because samba-1 represented a knockout allele, while translation re-initiation in samba-3 resulted in a truncated protein that was still able to interact with the APC/C and regulate its function, albeit with altered APC/C activity and efficiency. Our data are consistent with a dosage-dependent role for SAMBA to control developmental processes for which a change in growth rate is pivotal.
