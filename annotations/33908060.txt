Light induces anthocyanin accumulation and hence decides the coloration of apple fruit. It also plays a key role in regulating the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. However, the crosstalk between anthocyanin and lignin metabolism during light induction, which affects the edible quality and visual quality of apple fruit, respectively, have rarely been characterized. In this study, we identified and functionally elucidated the roles of miR7125 and its target, cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase gene (CCR), in regulating the homeostasis between anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis during light induction. Overexpressing miR7125 or inhibiting CCR transiently in apple fruit promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis but reduced lignin production under light-induced conditions. Consistently, opposite results were observed under the background of repressed miR7125 or overexpressed CCR. We found that the repressor MdMYB16 and the activator MdMYB1 bound to the miR7125 promoter. Transient repression of MdMYB16 upregulated miR7125 expression significantly, accompanied by decreased levels of MdCCR transcript, resulting in a reduction in the lignin biosynthesis and an increase in anthocyanin accumulation. However, transient overexpression of MdMYB16 produced the opposite effects to MdMYB16-RNAi. The results reveal a novel mechanism by which the MdMYB16/MdMYB1-miR7125-MdCCR module collaboratively regulates homeostasis between anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis under light induction in apple.
