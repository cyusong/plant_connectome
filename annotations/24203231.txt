['24203231', 'A functional relationship between monothiol glutaredoxins and BolAs has been  unraveled by genomic analyses and in several high-throughput studies.  Phylogenetic analyses coupled to transient expression of green fluorescent  protein (GFP) fusions indicated that, in addition to the sulfurtransferase SufE1,  which contains a C-terminal BolA domain, three BolA isoforms exist in Arabidopsis  thaliana, BolA1 being plastidial, BolA2 nucleo-cytoplasmic, and BolA4  dual-targeted to mitochondria and plastids. Binary yeast two-hybrid experiments  demonstrated that all BolAs and SufE1, via its BolA domain, can interact with all  monothiol glutaredoxins. Most interactions between protein couples of the same  subcellular compartment have been confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence  complementation. In vitro experiments indicated that monothiol glutaredoxins  could regulate the redox state of BolA2 and SufE1, both proteins possessing a  single conserved reactive cysteine. Indeed, a glutathionylated form of SufE1 lost  its capacity to activate the cysteine desulfurase, Nfs2, but it is reactivated by  plastidial glutaredoxins. Besides, a monomeric glutathionylated form and a  dimeric disulfide-bridged form of BolA2 can be preferentially reduced by the  nucleo-cytoplasmic GrxS17. These results indicate that the glutaredoxin-BolA  interaction occurs in several subcellular compartments and suggest that a redox  regulation mechanism, disconnected from their capacity to form iron-sulfur  cluster-bridged heterodimers, may be physiologically relevant for BolA2 and  SufE1.', '2014 Jan', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sst156', 'Rouhier']
