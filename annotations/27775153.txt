Nitric oxide (NO) and ethylene respond to biotic and abiotic stresses through either similar or independent processes. This study examines the mechanism underlying the effects of NO and ethylene on promoting root hair development in Arabidopsis under magnesium (Mg) deficiency. The interaction between NO and ethylene in the regulation of Mg deficiency-induced root hair development was investigated using NO- and ethylene-related mutants and pharmacological methods. Mg deficiency triggered a burst of NO and ethylene, accompanied by a stimulated development of root hairs. Interestingly, ethylene facilitated NO generation by activation of both nitrate reductase and nitric oxide synthase-like (NOS-L) in the roots of Mg-deficient plants. In turn, NO enhanced ethylene synthesis through stimulating the activities of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase and ACC synthase (ACS). These two processes constituted an NO-ethylene feedback loop. Blocking either of these two processes inhibited the stimulation of root hair development under Mg deficiency. In conclusion, we suggest that Mg deficiency increases the production of NO and ethylene in roots, each influencing the accumulation and role of the other, and thus these two signals interactively regulate Mg deficiency-induced root hair morphogenesis.
