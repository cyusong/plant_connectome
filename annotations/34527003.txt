Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) plays pivotal roles in the carbon fixation of photosynthesis and a variety of metabolic and stress pathways. <i>Suaeda aralocaspica</i> belongs to a single-cellular C<sub>4</sub> species and carries out a photosynthetic pathway in an unusually elongated chlorenchyma cell, which is expected to have PEPCs with different characteristics. To identify the different isoforms of <i>PEPC</i> genes in <i>S. aralocaspica</i> and comparatively analyze their expression and regulation patterns as well as the biochemical and enzymatic properties in this study, we characterized a bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC; SaPEPC-4) in addition to the two plant-type PEPCs (PTPCs; SaPEPC-1 and SaPEPC-2) using a genome-wide identification. <i>SaPEPC-4</i> presented a lower expression level in all test combinations with an unknown function; two SaPTPCs showed distinct subcellular localizations and different spatiotemporal expression patterns but positively responded to abiotic stresses. Compared to <i>SaPEPC-2</i>, the expression of <i>SaPEPC-1</i> specifically in chlorenchyma cell tissues was much more active with the progression of development and under various stresses, particularly sensitive to light, implying the involvement of <i>SaPEPC-1</i> in a C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. In contrast, <i>SaPEPC-2</i> was more like a non-photosynthetic PEPC. The expression trends of two SaPTPCs in response to light, development, and abiotic stresses were also matched with the changes in PEPC activity <i>in vivo</i> (native) or <i>in vitro</i> (recombinant), and the biochemical properties of the two recombinant SaPTPCs were similar in response to various effectors while the catalytic efficiency, substrate affinity, and enzyme activity of SaPEPC-2 were higher than that of SaPEPC-1 <i>in vitro.</i> All the different properties between these two SaPTPCs might be involved in transcriptional (e.g., specific <i>cis</i>-elements), posttranscriptional [e.g., 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) secondary structure], or translational (e.g., PEPC phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) regulatory events. The comparative studies on the different isoforms of the PEPC gene family in <i>S. aralocaspica</i> may help to decipher their exact role in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, plant growth/development, and stress resistance.
