Six cultivated rice genotypes showing different stomatal conductance (<i>g</i> <sub>s</sub>) values were used to investigate the influence of leaf vein traits on leaf gas exchange and leaf hydraulics. The results showed that <i>g</i> <sub>s</sub> was the main determinant of the varietal difference in the net photosynthetic rate (<i>P</i> <sub>N</sub>), whereas the area-based leaf nitrogen content (N<sub>area</sub>) and mesophyll conductance (<i>g</i> <sub>m</sub>) were not main factors. <i>g</i> <sub>s</sub> and <i>P</i> <sub>N</sub> were both positively correlated with leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i> <sub>leaf</sub>). A high density of leaf veins (vein length per leaf area, VLA), especially minor leaf veins (VLA<sub>minor</sub>), was of benefit for improving the <i>K</i> <sub>leaf</sub>. The proportion of the minor leaf vein length to the total leaf vein length did not impact the leaf hydraulics or leaf gas exchange. Overall, these findings suggested that a high density of leaf veins, especially minor leaf veins, enhances <i>K</i> <sub>leaf</sub> and promotes <i>g</i> <sub>s</sub> and <i>P</i> <sub>N</sub> in cultivated rice genotypes and a high VLA can be regarded as a high photosynthetic capacity trait in rice plants.
