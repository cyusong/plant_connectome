['23496207', 'Arabidopsis thaliana brassinosteroid signaling kinases (BSKs) constitute a  receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase sub-family (RLCK-XII) with 12 members. Previous  analysis demonstrated a positive role for BSK1 and BSK3 in the initial steps of  brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction. To investigate the function of BSKs in  plant growth and BR signaling, we characterized T-DNA insertion lines for eight  BSK genes (BSK1-BSK8) and multiple mutant combinations. Simultaneous elimination  of three BSK genes caused alterations in growth and the BR response, and the most  severe phenotypes were observed in the bsk3,4,7,8 quadruple and bsk3,4,6,7,8  pentuple mutants, which displayed reduced rosette size, leaf curling and enhanced  leaf inclination. In addition, upon treatment with 24-epibrassinolide, these  mutants showed reduced hypocotyl elongation, enhanced root growth and alteration  in the expression of BR-responsive genes. Some mutant combinations also showed  antagonistic interactions. In support of a redundant function in BR signaling,  multiple BSKs interacted in vivo with the BR receptor BRI1, and served as its  phosphorylation substrates in vitro. The BIN2 and BIL2 GSK3-like kinases, which  are negative regulators of BR signaling, interacted in vivo with BSKs and  phosphorylated them in vitro, probably at different sites to BRI1. This study  demonstrates redundant biological functions for BSKs, and suggests the existence  of a regulatory link between BSKs and GSK3-like kinases.', '2013 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12175', 'Sessa']
