['16021341', 'ERFs (ethylene-responsive element binding factors) belong to a large family of  plant transcription factors that are found exclusively in plants. A small  subfamily of ERF proteins can act as transcriptional repressors. The Arabidopsis  genome contains eight ERF repressors, namely AtERF3, AtERF4, and AtERF7 to  AtERF12. Members of ERF repressors show differential expression, suggesting that  they may have different function. Using a transient expression system, we  demonstrated that AtERF4, AtERF7, AtERF10, AtERF11 and AtERF12 can function as  transcriptional repressors. The expression of AtERF4 can be induced by ethylene,  jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid (ABA). By using green fluorescent protein  fusion, we demonstrated that AtEFR4 accumulated in the nuclear bodies of  Arabidopsis cells. Expression of 35S:AtERF4-GFP in transgenic Arabidopsis plants  conferred an ethylene-insensitive phenotype and repressed the expression of Basic  Chitinase and beta-1,3-Glucanase, the GCC-box-containing genes. In comparison  with wild-type plants, 35S:AtERF4-GFP transgenic plants had decreased sensitivity  to ABA and were hypersensitive to sodium chloride. The expression of the ABA  responsive genes, ABI2, rd29B and rab18, was decreased in the 35S:AtERF4-GFP  transgenic plants. Our study provides evidence that AtERF4 is a negative  regulator capable of modulating ethylene and abscisic acid responses.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-7294-5', 'Wu']
