['16297850', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains at least 32 terpenoid synthase (AtTPS)  genes [Aubourg et al., Mol. Genet. Genom. 267 (2002) 730] a few of which have  recently been characterized. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis of AtTPS gene  expression, measured by microarray profiling and validated with published  expression data, we identified two groups of predominantly root expressed AtTPS  genes containing five members with previously unknown biochemical functions  (At4g13280, At4g13300, At5g48110, At1g33750, and At3g29410). Among the root  expressed AtTPS genes, a pair of tandem-organized genes, At4g13280 (AtTPS12) and  At4g13300 (AtTPS13), shares 91% predicted amino acid identity indicating recent  gene duplication. Bacterial expression of cDNAs and enzyme assays showed that  both At4g13280 and At4g13300 encode sesquiterpene synthases catalyzing the  conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to (Z)-gamma-bisabolene and the additional  minor products E-nerolidol and alpha-bisabolol. Expression of beta-glucuronidase  (GUS) reporter gene fused to upstream genomic regions of At4g13280 or At4g13300  showed constitutive promoter activities in the cortex and sub-epidermal layers of  Arabidopsis roots. In addition, highly localized promoter activities were found  in leaf hydathodes and flower stigmata. Mechanical wounding of Arabidopsis leaves  induced local expression of At4g13280 and At4g13300. The functional  characterization of At4g13280 gene product AtTPS12 and At4g13230 gene product  AtTPS13 as (Z)-gamma-bisabolene synthases, together with the recent  characterization of two flower-specific AtTPS [At5g23960 and At5g44630; Tholl et  al., Plant J. 42 (2005) 757], concludes the biochemical functional annotation of  all four predicted Arabidopsis sesquiterpene synthase genes. Our data suggest  biological functions for At4g13280 and At4g13300 in the rhizosphere with  additional roles in aerial plant tissues.', '2006 Apr 15', 'Arch Biochem Biophys', '10.1016/j.abb.2005.09.019', 'Bohlmann']
