When grafting or wounding disconnects stem tissues, new tissues are generated to restore the lost connection. In this study, the molecular mechanism of such healing was elucidated in injured stems of Arabidopsis. Soon after the inflorescence stems were incised, the pith cells started to divide. This process was strongly inhibited by the elimination of cauline leaves, shoot apices, or lateral buds that reduced the indole-3-acetic acid supply. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that genes related to cell division, phytohormones, and transcription factors were expressed because of incision. Among them, two plant-specific transcription factor genes, ANAC071 and RAP2.6L, were abundantly expressed. ANAC071 was expressed at 1-3 d after cutting exclusively in the upper region of the cut gap, with concomitant accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid. In contrast, RAP2.6L was expressed at 1 d after cutting exclusively in the lower region, with concomitant deprivation of indole-3-acetic acid. The expression of ANAC071 and RAP2.6L were also promoted by ethylene and jasmonic acid, respectively. In transformants suppressing the function of RAP2.6L or ANAC071, the division of pith cells was inhibited. Furthermore, the ethylene signaling-defective ein2 mutant showed incomplete healing. Hence, plant-specific transcription factors differentially expressed around the cut position were essential for tissue reunion of Arabidopsis wounded flowering stems and were under opposite control by polar-transported auxin, with modification by the ethylene and jasmonic acid wound-inducible hormones.
