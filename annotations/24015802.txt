['24015802', 'Studies of Iron (Fe) uptake mechanisms by plant roots have focussed on  Fe(III)-siderophores or Fe(II) transport systems. Iron deficency also enhances  root secretion of flavins and phenolics. However, the nature of these compounds,  their transport outside the roots and their role in Fe nutrition are largely  unknown. We used HPLC/ESI-MS (TOF) and HPLC/ESI-MS/MS (ion trap) to characterize  fluorescent phenolic-type compounds accumulated in roots or exported to the  culture medium of Arabidopsis plants in response to Fe deficiency. Wild-type and  mutant plants altered either in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis or in the ABCG37  (PDR9) ABC transporter were grown under standard or Fe-deficient nutrition  conditions and compared. Fe deficiency upregulates the expression of genes  encoding enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and leads to the synthesis and  secretion of phenolic compounds belonging to the coumarin family. The ABCG37 gene  is also upregulated in response to Fe deficiency and coumarin export is impaired  in pdr9 mutant plants. Therefore it can be concluded that: Fe deficiency induces  the secretion of coumarin compounds by Arabidopsis roots; the ABCG37 ABC  transporter is required for this secretion to take place; and these compounds  improved plant Fe nutrition.', '2014 Jan', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.12471', 'Briat']
