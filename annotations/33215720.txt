Drought induces stomata closure and lowers the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the mesophyll, limiting CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and favoring photorespiration. The photosynthetic apparatus is protected under drought conditions by a number of downregulation mechanisms like photosynthetic control and activation of cyclic electron transport leading to the generation of a high proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. Here, we studied photosynthetic electron transport by chlorophyll fluorescence, thermoluminescence (TL), and P<sub>700</sub> absorption measurements in spinach exposed to moderate drought stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence induction and decay kinetics were slowed down. Under drought conditions, an increase of the TL AG-band and a downshift of the maximum temperatures of both, the B-band and the AG-band, were observed when leaves were illuminated under conditions that maintained the proton gradient. When leaves were frozen prior to the TL measurements, the maximum temperature of the B-band was upshifted in drought-stressed leaves. This shows a stabilization of the Q<sub>B</sub> /Q<sub>B</sub> <sup>•-</sup> redox couple in accordance with the slower fluorescence decay kinetics. We propose that during drought stress, photorespiration exerts a feedback control on photosystem II via the binding of a photorespiratory metabolite at the non-heme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II. According to our hypothesis, an exchange of bicarbonate at the non-heme iron by a photorespiratory metabolite such as glycolate would not only affect the midpoint potential of the Q<sub>A</sub> /Q<sub>A</sub> <sup>•-</sup> couple, as shown previously, but also that of the Q<sub>B</sub> /Q<sub>B</sub> <sup>•-</sup> couple.
