The application of Se yeast as a Se source to cultivate Se-rich cabbage has a significant effect on cabbage growth and quality indices. Results showed that total plant weight, head weight, and head size in cabbage were notably increased by 48.4%, 88.3%, and 25.4% under 16 mg/kg Se yeast treatment, respectively. Compare with the control, a high proportion of 3874% of Se accumulation in cabbage head was also detected in 16 mg/kg Se yeast treatment. Selenocystine (SeCys<sub>2</sub>) and Methyl-selenocysteine (MeSeCys) were the main Se speciations in the cabbage head. Application of 8 mg/kg Se yeast improved cabbage quality and antioxidant system indices, including free amino acid, soluble sugar, ascorbic acid, phenolic acid, glucosinolates, and SOD activity, which had 81.6%, 46.5%, 34.9%, 12.3%, 44.8%, 25.2% higher than that of the control, respectively. In summary, considering 8 mg/kg Se yeast as the appropriate level of Se enrichment during cabbage cultivation. These findings enhanced our understanding of the effects of Se yeast on the growth and quality of cabbage and provided new insights into Se-enrichment vegetable cultivation.
