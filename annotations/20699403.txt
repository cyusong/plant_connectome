['20699403', 'The microRNA159 (miR159) family represses the conserved GAMYB-like genes that  encode R2R3 MYB domain transcription factors that have been implicated in  gibberellin (GA) signaling in anthers and germinating seeds. In Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), the two major miR159 family members, miR159a and miR159b,  are functionally specific for two GAMYB-like genes, MYB33 and MYB65. These  transcription factors have been shown to be involved in anther development, but  there are differing reports about their role in the promotion of flowering and  little is known about their function in seed germination. To understand the  function of this pathway, we identified the genes and processes controlled by  these GAMYB-like genes. First, we demonstrate that miR159 completely represses  MYB33 and MYB65 in vegetative tissues. We show that GA does not release this  repression and that these transcription factors are not required for flowering or  growth. By contrast, in the absence of miR159, the deregulation of MYB33 and  MYB65 in vegetative tissues up-regulates genes that are highly expressed in the  aleurone and GA induced during seed germination. Confirming that these genes are  GAMYB-like regulated, their expression was reduced in myb33.myb65.myb101 seeds.  Aleurone vacuolation, a GA-mediated programmed cell death process required for  germination, was impaired in these seeds. Finally, the deregulation of MYB33 and  MYB65 in vegetative tissues inhibits growth by reducing cell proliferation.  Therefore, we conclude that miR159 acts as a molecular switch, only permitting  the expression of GAMYB-like genes in anthers and seeds. In seeds, these  transcription factors participate in GA-induced pathways required for aleurone  development and death.', '2010 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.160630', 'Millar']
