The mechanisms underlying host plant symptom development upon infection by viruses of the genus <i>Nepovirus</i> in the family <i>Secoviridae</i>, including grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), are poorly understood. In the systemic host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana,</i> GFLV strain GHu produces characteristic symptoms of vein clearing in apical leaves, unlike other GFLV strains such as F13, which cause an asymptomatic infection. In this study, we expanded on earlier findings and used reverse genetics to identify residue 802 (lysine, K) of the GFLV-GHu RNA1-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (1E<sup>Pol</sup>) as a modulator of vein-clearing symptom development in <i>N. benthamiana.</i> Mutations to this site abolished (K to G, A, or Q) or attenuated (K to N or P) symptom expression. Noteworthy, residue 802 is necessary but not sufficient for vein clearing, as GFLV-F13 RNA1 carrying K<sup>802</sup> remained asymptomatic in <i>N. benthamiana</i>. No correlation was found between symptom expression and RNA1 accumulation, as shown by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the involvement of RNA silencing of vein clearing was ruled out by virus-induced gene silencing experiments and structure predictions for protein 1E<sup>Pol</sup> suggested that residue 802 is flanked by strongly predicted stable secondary structures, including a conserved motif of unknown function (<sup>805</sup>LLKT/AHLK/RT/ALR<sup>814</sup>). Together, these results reveal the protein nature of the GFLV-GHu symptom determinant in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and provide a solid basis for probing and determining the virus-host proteome network for symptoms of vein clearing.
