Protein S-acyl transferases (PATs) play critical roles in plant developmental and environmental responses by catalyzing S-acylation of substrate proteins, most of which are involved in cellular signaling. However, only few plant PATs have been functionally characterized. We recently demonstrated that Arabidopsis PAT4 mediates root hair elongation by positively regulating the membrane association of ROP2 and actin microfilament organization. Here, we show that apex-associated re-positioning of nucleus during root hair elongation was impaired by PAT4 loss-of-function. Results presented here pose a significant question concerning the molecular machinery mediating nuclear migration during root hair growth.

PAT4: !mediates! root hair elongation
PAT4: !regulates! membrane association of ROP2
PAT4: !impairs! apex-associated re-positioning of nucleus
ROP2: !involved in! cellular signaling
