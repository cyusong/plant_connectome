Buckwheat (<i>Fagopyrum tataricum</i>), an important food crop, also has medicinal uses. It is widely planted in Southwest China, overlapping with planting areas remarkably polluted by cadmium (Cd). Therefore, it is of great significance to study the response mechanism of buckwheat under Cd stress and further develop varieties with excellent Cd tolerance. In this study, two critical periods of Cd stress treatment (days 7 and 14 after Cd treatment) of cultivated buckwheat (Pinku-1, named K33) and perennial species (<i>F. tatari-cymosum</i> Q.F. Chen) (duoku, named DK19) were analyzed using transcriptome and metabolomics. The results showed that Cd stress led to changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the chlorophyll system. Moreover, Cd-response genes related to stress response, amino acid metabolism, and ROS scavenging were enriched or activated in DK19. Transcriptome and metabolomic analyses highlighted the important role of galactose, lipid (glycerophosphatide metabolism and glycerophosphatide metabolism), and glutathione metabolism in response to Cd stress in buckwheat, which are significantly enriched at the gene and metabolic levels in DK19. The results of the present study provide valuable information for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Cd tolerance in buckwheat and useful clues for the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in buckwheat.
