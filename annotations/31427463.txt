New transformation-competent Arabidopsis lines, with new plastid transformation vectors and a protocol for measuring plastid transformation efficiency, will advance the engineering of the plastid genome in Arabidopsis.

Plastid genome: !engineered in! Arabidopsis 
Transformation-competent lines: !created with! new plastid transformation vectors 
Protocol: !measures! plastid transformation efficiency
