['22829145', 'Position-dependent patterning of hair and non-hair cells in the Arabidopsis  thaliana root epidermis is a powerful system to study the molecular basis of cell  fate specification. Here, we report an epidermal patterning mutant affecting the  ADENOSINE DIMETHYL TRANSFERASE 1A (DIM1A) rRNA dimethylase gene, predicted to  participate in rRNA posttranscriptional processing and base modification.  Consistent with a role in ribosome biogenesis, DIM1A is preferentially expressed  in regions of rapid growth, and its product is nuclear localized with nucleolus  enrichment. Furthermore, DIM1A preferentially accumulates in the developing hair  cells, and the dim1A point mutant alters the cell-specific expression of the  transcriptional regulators GLABRA2, CAPRICE, and WEREWOLF. Together, these  findings suggest that establishment of cell-specific gene expression during root  epidermis development is dependent upon proper ribosome biogenesis, possibly due  to the sensitivity of the cell fate decision to relatively small differences in  gene regulatory activities. Consistent with its effect on the predicted  S-adenosyl-l-Met binding site, dim1A plants lack the two 18S rRNA base  modifications but exhibit normal pre-rRNA processing. In addition to root  epidermal defects, the dim1A mutant exhibits abnormal root meristem division,  leaf development, and trichome branching. Together, these findings provide new  insights into the importance of rRNA base modifications and translation  regulation for plant growth and development.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.101022', 'Schiefelbein']
