['27760121', 'The stability of repetitive sequences in complex eukaryotic genomes is  safeguarded by factors suppressing homologues recombination. Prominent in this is  the role of the RTR complex. In plants, it consists of the RecQ helicase RECQ4A,  the topoisomerase TOP3alpha and RMI1. Like mammals, but not yeast, plants harbor an  additional complex partner, RMI2. Here, we demonstrate that, in Arabidopsis  thaliana, RMI2 is involved in the repair of aberrant replication intermediates in  root meristems as well as in intrastrand crosslink repair. In both instances,  RMI2 is involved independently of the DNA helicase RTEL1. Surprisingly,  simultaneous loss of RMI2 and RTEL1 leads to loss of male fertility. As both the  RTR complex and RTEL1 are involved in suppression of homologous recombination  (HR), we tested the efficiency of HR in the double mutant rmi2-2 rtel1-1 and  found a synergistic enhancement (80-fold). Searching for natural target sequences  we found that RTEL1 is required for stabilizing 45S rDNA repeats. In the double  mutant with rmi2-2 the number of 45S rDNA repeats is further decreased sustaining  independent roles of both factors in this process. Thus, loss of suppression of  HR does not only lead to a destabilization of rDNA repeats but might be  especially deleterious for tissues undergoing multiple cell divisions such as the  male germline.', '2016 Oct', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1006394', 'Puchta']
