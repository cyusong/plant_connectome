Acquisition of pluripotency by somatic cells is a striking process that enables multicellular organisms to regenerate organs. This process includes silencing of genes to erase original tissue memory and priming of additional cell type specification genes, which are then poised for activation by external signal inputs. Here, through analysis of genome-wide histone modifications and gene expression profiles, we show that a gene priming mechanism involving LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 1-LIKE 3 (LDL3) specifically eliminates H3K4me2 during formation of the intermediate pluripotent cell mass known as callus derived from Arabidopsis root cells. While LDL3-mediated H3K4me2 removal does not immediately affect gene expression, it does facilitate the later activation of genes that act to form shoot progenitors when external cues lead to shoot induction. These results give insights into the role of H3K4 methylation in plants, and into the primed state that provides plant cells with high regenerative competency.
