The genetic mechanism of aluminum (Al) tolerance in rice is great complicated. Uncovering genetic mechanism of Al tolerance in rice is the premise for Al tolerance improvement. Mining elite genes within rice landrace is of importance for improvement of Al tolerance in rice. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in EMMAX for rice Al tolerance was carried out using 150 varieties of Ting's core collection constructed from 2262 Ting's collections with more than 3.8 million SNPs. Within Ting's core collection of clear population structure and kinship relatedness as well as high rate of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay, 17 genes relating to rice Al tolerance including cloned genes like NRAT1, ART1 and STAR1 were identified in this study. Moreover, 13 new candidate regions with high LD and 69 new candidate genes were detected. Furthermore, 20 of 69 new candidate genes were detected with significant difference between Al treatment and without Al toxicity by transcriptome sequencing. Interestingly, both qRT-PCR and sequence analysis in CDS region demonstrated that the candidate genes in present study might play important roles in rice Al tolerance. The present study provided important information for further using these elite genes existing in Ting's core collection for improvement of rice Al tolerance.
