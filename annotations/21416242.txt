Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (cv. Columbia) were used to evaluate dynamic transcriptional-level genome responses to simulated microgravity condition created by 3-D clinorotation. The DNA chip data analysis showed that the plant may respond to simulated microgravity by dynamic induction (up- and down-regulations) of the responsive genes in the genome. The qRT-PCR results on the investigated genes showed that the expression patterns of the genes (molecular response) were generally similar to the physiological response patterns detected in stress-challenged plants. Expression patterns were categorized into short or continual up- or down-regulated patterns, as well as stochastic changes from short- to long-term simulated microgravity stress. The induced genes are then assumed to establish a new molecular plasticity to the newly adjusted genome status in the basic milieu of maintaining homeostasis during the process of adaptation to simulated microgravity.
