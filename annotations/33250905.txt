Theoretical and experimental evidence for an effect of sieve tube turgor pressure on the mechanisms of phloem unloading near the root tips during moderate levels of drought stress is reviewed. An additional, simplified equation is proposed relating decreased turgor pressure to decreased rate kinetics of membrane bound transporters. The effect of such a mechanism would be to decrease phloem transport speed, but increase concentration and pressure, and thus prevent or delay negative pressure in the phloem. Experimental evidence shows this mechanism precedes and exceeds a reduction in stomatal conductance.
