Teosinte branched1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor (<i>TCP</i>) gene family members are plant-specific transcription factors that regulate plant growth and development by controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. However, there are no reported studies on the <i>TCP</i> gene family in <i>Dendrobium catenatum</i> Lindl. Here, a genome-wide analysis of <i>TCP</i> genes was performed in <i>D. catenatum</i>, and 25 <i>TCP</i> genes were identified. A phylogenetic analysis classified the family into two clades: Class I and Class II. Genes in the same clade share similar conserved motifs. The GFP signals of the DcaTCP-GFPs were detected in the nuclei of tobacco leaf epidermal cells. The activity of <i>DcaTCP4</i>, which contains the miR319a-binding sequence, was reduced when combined with miR319a. A transient activity assay revealed antagonistic functions of Class I and Class II of the TCP proteins in controlling leaf development through the jasmonate-signaling pathway. After different phytohormone treatments, the <i>DcaTCP</i> genes showed varied expression patterns. In particular, <i>DcaTCP4</i> and <i>DcaTCP9</i> showed opposite trends after 3 h treatment with jasmonate. This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for further studies on the roles of <i>TCP</i> genes in <i>D. catenatum</i>.
