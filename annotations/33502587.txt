Phage-based biocontrol strategies can be an effective alternative to control Psa-induced bacterial canker of kiwifruit. The global production of kiwifruit has been seriously affected by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) over the last decade. Psa damages both Actinidia chinensis var. deliciosa (green kiwifruit) but specially the susceptible Actinidia chinensis var. chinensis (gold kiwifruit), resulting in severe economic losses. Treatments for Psa infections currently available are scarce, involving frequent spraying of the kiwifruit plant orchards with copper products. However, copper products should be avoided since they are highly toxic and lead to the development of bacterial resistance to this metal. Antibiotics are also used in some countries, but bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a serious worldwide problem. Therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches for sustainable agriculture production, avoiding the emergence of resistant Psa bacterial strains. Attempts to develop and establish highly accurate approaches to combat and prevent the occurrence of bacterial canker in kiwifruit plants are currently under study, using specific viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages) to eliminate the Psa. This review discusses the characteristics of Psa-induced kiwifruit canker, Psa transmission pathways, prevention and control, phage-based biocontrol strategies as a new approach to control Psa in kiwifruit orchards and its advantages over other therapies, together with potential ways to bypass phage inactivation by abiotic factors.
