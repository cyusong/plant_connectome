['12900416', 'Flavonol glycosides constitute one of the most prominent plant natural product  classes that accumulate in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To date there  are no reports of functionally characterized flavonoid glycosyltransferases in  Arabidopsis, despite intensive research efforts aimed at both flavonoids and  Arabidopsis. In this study, flavonol glycosyltransferases were considered in a  functional genomics approach aimed at revealing genes involved in determining the  flavonol-glycoside profile. Candidate glycosyltransferase-encoding genes were  selected based on homology to other known flavonoid glycosyltransferases and two  T-DNA knockout lines lacking flavonol-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnosides (ugt78D1)  and quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-glucoside (ugt73C6 and ugt78D1) were identified.  To confirm the in planta results, cDNAs encoding both UGT78D1 and UGT73C6 were  expressed in vitro and analyzed for their qualitative substrate specificity.  UGT78D1 catalyzed the transfer of rhamnose from UDP-rhamnose to the 3-OH position  of quercetin and kaempferol, whereas UGT73C6 catalyzed the transfer of glucose  from UDP-glucose to the 7-OH position of kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside and  quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, respectively. The present results suggest that UGT78D1  and UGT73C6 should be classified as UDP-rhamnose:flavonol-3-Orhamnosyltransferase  and UDP-glucose:flavonol-3-O-glycoside-7-O-glucosyltransferase, respectively.', '2003 Nov 7', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M303523200', 'Saito']
