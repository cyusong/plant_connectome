['17557075', 'Light activates proton (H(+))-ATPases in guard cells, to drive hyperpolarization  of the plasma membrane to initiate stomatal opening, allowing diffusion of  ambient CO(2) to photosynthetic tissues. Light to darkness transition, high CO(2)  levels and the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) promote stomatal closing. The  overall H(+)-ATPase activity is diminished by ABA treatments, but the  significance of this phenomenon in relationship to stomatal closure is still  debated. We report two dominant mutations in the OPEN STOMATA2 (OST2) locus of  Arabidopsis that completely abolish stomatal response to ABA, but importantly, to  a much lesser extent the responses to CO(2) and darkness. The OST2 gene encodes  the major plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase AHA1, and both mutations cause constitutive  activity of this pump, leading to necrotic lesions. H(+)-ATPases have been  traditionally assumed to be general endpoints of all signaling pathways affecting  membrane polarization and transport. Our results provide evidence that AHA1 is a  distinct component of an ABA-directed signaling pathway, and that dynamic  downregulation of this pump during drought is an essential step in membrane  depolarization to initiate stomatal closure.', '2007 Jul 11', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601750', 'Leung']
