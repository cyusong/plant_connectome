Arabidopsis halleri is a model species for the study of plant adaptation to extreme metallic conditions. In this species, cadmium (Cd) tolerance seems to be constitutive, and the mechanisms underlying the trait are still poorly understood. A previous quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis performed on A. halleri × Arabidopsis lyrata backcross population1 identified the metal-pump gene Heavy Metal ATPase4 as the major genetic determinant for Cd tolerance. However, although necessary, Heavy Metal ATPase4 alone is not sufficient for determining this trait. After fine mapping, a gene encoding a calcium(2+)/hydrogen(+) antiporter, cation/hydrogen(+) exchanger1 (CAX1), was identified as a candidate gene for the second QTL of Cd tolerance in A. halleri. Backcross population1 individuals displaying the A. halleri allele for the CAX1 locus exhibited significantly higher CAX1 expression levels compared with the ones with the A. lyrata allele, and a positive correlation between CAX1 expression and Cd tolerance was observed. Here, we show that this QTL is conditional and that it is only detectable at low external Ca concentration. CAX1 expression in both roots and shoots was higher in A. halleri than in the close Cd-sensitive relative species A. lyrata and Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, CAX1 loss of function in A. thaliana led to higher Cd sensitivity at low concentration of Ca, higher sensitivity to methylviologen, and stronger accumulation of reactive oxygen species after Cd treatment. Overall, this study identifies a unique genetic determinant of Cd tolerance in the metal hyperaccumulator A. halleri and offers a new twist for the function of CAX1 in plants.
