High light and high temperature (HLHT) stress may become more frequent and severe as the climate changes, affecting crop growth and resulting in reduced production. However, the mechanism of the response to HLHT stress in rice is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we screened a rice mutant library using HLHT conditions and isolated an HLHT-sensitive mutant, local lesions 1 (ls1), which showed decreased pigment contents, defective stomata and chloroplasts, and a local lesions phenotype under HLHT. We characterized and cloned LS1 by map-based cloning and genetic complementation. LS1 encodes the A subunit of the RNase H2 complex (RNASEH2A). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and comet assays indicated that mutation of LS1 led to severe DNA damage under HLHT stress. Furthermore, we found excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the ls1 mutant under HLHT stress. Exogenous antioxidants eased the local lesions phenotype of the ls1 mutant under HLHT. DNA damage caused by HLHT stress induces ROS accumulation, which causes the injury and apoptosis of leaf cells in the ls1 mutant. These results enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanism in the response to HLHT stress in higher plants.
