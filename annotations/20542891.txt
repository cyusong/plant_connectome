Strigolactones (SLs) or SL-derived metabolite(s) have recently been shown to act as endogenous inhibitors of axillary bud outgrowth. SLs released from roots induce hyphal branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that facilitate the uptake of inorganic nutrients, such as phosphate (Pi) and nitrate, by the host plants. Previous studies have shown that SL levels in root exudates are highly elevated by Pi starvation, which might contribute to successful symbiosis with AM fungi in the rhizosphere. However, how endogenous SL levels elevated by Pi starvation contribute to its hormonal action has been unknown. Here, we show that tiller bud outgrowth in wild-type rice seedlings is inhibited, while root 2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS) levels are elevated, in response to decreasing Pi concentrations in the media. However, the suppression of tiller bud outgrowth under Pi deficiency does not occur in the SL-deficient and -insensitive mutants. We also show that the responsiveness to exogenous SL is slightly increased by Pi deficiency. When Pi-starved seedlings are transferred to Pi-sufficient media, tiller bud outgrowth is induced following a decrease in root epi-5DS levels. Taken together, these results suggest that elevated SL levels by Pi starvation contribute to the inhibition of tiller bud outgrowth in rice seedlings. We speculate that SL plays a dual role in the adaptation to Pi deficiency; one as a rhizosphere signal to maximize AM fungi symbiosis for improved Pi acquisition and the other as an endogenous hormone or its biosynthetic precursor to optimize shoot branching for efficient Pi utilization.
