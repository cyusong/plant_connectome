Trees are known to be atmospheric methane (CH<sub>4</sub> ) emitters. Little is known about seasonal dynamics of tree CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes and relationships to environmental conditions. That prevents the correct estimation of net annual tree and forest CH<sub>4</sub> exchange. We aimed to explore the contribution of stem emissions to forest CH<sub>4</sub> exchange. We determined seasonal CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes of mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica) stems and adjacent soil in a typical temperate beech forest of the White Carpathians with high spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture. The beech stems were net annual CH<sub>4</sub> sources, whereas the soil was a net CH<sub>4</sub> sink. High CH<sub>4</sub> emitters showed clear seasonality in their stem CH<sub>4</sub> emissions that followed stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux. Elevated CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes were detected during the vegetation season. Observed high spatial variability in stem CH<sub>4</sub> emissions was neither explicably by soil CH<sub>4</sub> exchange nor by CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations, water content, or temperature studied in soil profiles near each measured tree. The stem CH<sub>4</sub> emissions offset the soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake by up to 46.5% and on average by 13% on stand level. In Central Europe, widely grown beech contributes markedly to seasonal dynamics of ecosystem CH<sub>4</sub> exchange. Its contribution should be included into forest greenhouse gas flux inventories.
