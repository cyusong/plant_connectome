The developmental process of inflorescence and gametophytes is vital for sexual reproduction in rice. Multiple genes and conserved miRNAs have been characterized to regulate the process. The changes of miRNAs expression during the early development of rice inflorescence remain unknown. In this study, the analysis of miRNAs profiles in the early stage of rice inflorescence development identified 671 miRNAs, including 67 known and 44 novel differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). Six distinct clusters of miRNAs expression patterns were detected, and Cluster 5 comprised 110 DEMs, including unconserved, rice-specific osa-miR5506. Overexpression of osa-miR5506 caused pleiotropic abnormalities, including over- or under-developed palea, various numbers of floral organs and spikelet indeterminacy. In addition, the defects of ovaries development were frequently characterized by multiple megasporocytes, ovule-free ovary, megasporocyte degenerated and embryo sac degenerated in the transgenic lines. osa-miR5506 targeted REM transcription factor <i>LOC_Os03g11370</i>. Summarily, these results demonstrated that rice-specific osa-miR5506 plays an essential role in the regulation of floral organ number, spikelet determinacy and female gametophyte development in rice.
