Terpenoids constitute the largest class of plant primary and secondary metabolites with a broad range of biological and ecological functions. They are synthesized from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, which in plastids are condensed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPSs) to produce GGPP (C20) for diterpene biosynthesis and by geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPSs) to form GPP (C10) for monoterpene production. Depending on the plant species, unlike homomeric GGPPSs, GPPSs exist as homo- and heteromers, the latter of which contain catalytically inactive GGPPS-homologous small subunits (SSUs) that can interact with GGPPSs. By combining phylogenetic analysis with functional characterization of GGPPS homologs from a wide range of photosynthetic organisms, we investigated how different GPPS architectures have evolved within the GGPPS protein family. Our results reveal that GGPPS gene family expansion and functional divergence began early in nonvascular plants, and that independent parallel evolutionary processes gave rise to homomeric and heteromeric GPPSs. By site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamic simulations, we also discovered that Leu-Val/Val-Ala pairs of amino acid residues were pivotal in the functional divergence of homomeric GPPSs and GGPPSs. Overall, our study elucidated an evolutionary path for the formation of GPPSs with different architectures from GGPPSs and uncovered the molecular mechanisms involved in this differentiation.
