Sugars are fundamental to plant developmental processes. For fruits, the accumulation and proportion of sugars play crucial roles in the development of quality and attractiveness. In citrus (Citrus reticulata Blanco.), we found the difference in sweetness between mature fruits of 'Gongchuan' and its bud sport 'Youliang' is related to hexose contents. Expression of a SuS (Sucrose Synthase) gene CitSUS5 and a SWEET (Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter) gene CitSWEET6, characterized by transcriptome analysis at different developmental stages of these two varieties revealed higher expression levels in 'Youliang' fruit. The roles of CitSUS5 and CitSWEET6 were investigated by enzyme activity and transient assays. CitSUS5 promoted the cleavage of sucrose to hexoses, and CitSWEET6 was identified as a fructose transporter. Further investigation identified the transcription factor CitZAT5 (ZINC FINGER OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA) that contributes to sucrose metabolism and fructose transportation by positively regulating CitSUS5 and CitSWEET6. The role of CitZAT5 in fruit sugar accumulation and hexose proportion was investigated by homologous transient CitZAT5-overexpression, -VIGS and -RNAi. CitZAT5 modulates the hexose proportion in citrus by mediating CitSUS5 and CitSWEET6 expression, and the molecular mechanism explained the differences in sugar composition of 'Youliang' and 'Gongchuan' fruit.
