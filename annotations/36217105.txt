Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD), caused by rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) belonging to the Fijivirus genus, seriously threatens maize production worldwide. Three susceptible varieties (Ye478, Zheng 58, and Zhengdan 958) and two resistant varieties (P138 and Chang7-2) were used in our study. A set of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B (ABCB) transporter genes were screened to evaluate their possible involvements in RBSDV resistance. In the present study, ZmABCB15, an ABCB transporter family member, was cloned and functionally identified. Expression analysis showed that ZmABCB15 was significantly induced in the resistant varieties, not in the susceptible varieties, suggesting its involvement in resistance to the RBSDV infection. ZmABCB15 gene encodes a putative polar auxin transporter containing two trans-membrane domains and two P-loop nucleotide-binding domains. Transient expression analysis indicated that ZmABCB15 is a cell membrance localized protein. Over-expression of ZmABCB15 enhanced the resistance by repressing the RBSDV replication ratio. ZmABCB15 might participate in the RBSDV resistance by affecting the homeostasis of active and inactive auxins in RBSDV infected seedlings. Polar auxin transport might participate in the RBSDV resistance by affecting the distribution of endogenous auxin among tissues. Our data showed the involvement of polar auxin transport in RBSDV resistance and provided novel mechanism underlying the auxin-mediated disease control technology.
