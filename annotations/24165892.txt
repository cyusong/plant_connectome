['24165892', 'PYR1/PYL/RCAR family proteins (PYLs) are well-characterized abscisic acid (ABA)  receptors. Among the 14 PYL members in Arabidopsis thaliana, PYL13 is ABA  irresponsive and its function has remained elusive. Here, we show that PYL13  selectively inhibits the phosphatase activity of PP2CA independent of ABA. The  crystal structure of PYL13-PP2CA complex, which was determined at 2.4 A  resolution, elucidates the molecular basis for the specific recognition between  PP2CA and PYL13. In addition to the canonical interactions between PYLs and  PP2Cs, an extra interface is identified involving an element in the vicinity of a  previously uncharacterized CCCH zinc-finger (ZF) motif in PP2CA. Sequence blast  identified another 56 ZF-containing PP2Cs, all of which are from plants. The  structure also reveals the molecular determinants for the ABA irresponsiveness of  PYL13. Finally, biochemical analysis suggests that PYL13 may hetero-oligomerize  with PYL10. These two PYLs antagonize each other in their respective  ABA-independent inhibitions of PP2Cs. The biochemical and structural studies  provide important insights into the function of PYL13 in the stress response of  plant and set up a foundation for future biotechnological applications of PYL13.', '2013 Dec', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2013.143', 'Yan']
