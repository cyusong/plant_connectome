Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are RNA-binding proteins that function in posttranscriptional regulation as gene-specific regulators of RNA metabolism in plant organelles. Plant PPR proteins are divided into four classes: P, PLS, E and DYW. The E- and DYW-class proteins are mainly implicated in RNA editing, whereas most of the P-class proteins predominantly participate in RNA cleavage, splicing and stabilization. In contrast, the functions of PLS-class proteins still remain obscure. Here, we report the function of PLS-class PpPPR_31 and PpPPR_9 in Physcomitrella patens. The knockout (KO) mutants of PpPPR_31 and PpPPR_9 exhibited slower protonema growth compared to the wild type. The PpPPR_31 KO mutants showed a considerable reduction in the splicing of nad5 intron 3 and atp9 intron 1. The PpPPR_9 KO mutants displayed severely reduced splicing of cox1 intron 3. An RNA electrophoresis mobility shift assay showed that the recombinant PpPPR_31 protein bound to the 5' region of nad5 exon 4 and the bulged A region in domain VI of atp9 group II intron 1 while the recombinant PpPPR_9 bound to the translated region of ORF622 in cox1 intron 3. These results suggest that a certain set of PLS-class PPR proteins may influence the splicing efficiency of mitochondrial group II introns.
