Stigma exsertion is an important agricultural trait that facilitates the application of heterosis in crop breeding. Although several quantitative trait loci associated with stigma exsertion have been fine-mapped or cloned, the underlying genetic basis, particularly in legumes, remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized the exserted stigma mutant <i>stigma exsertion1</i> (<i>sge1</i>) in the model legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i> The exserted stigma phenotype of <i>sge1</i> is mainly caused by physical interaction between floral organs, in which normal petal and stamen elongation are inhibited due to flower cuticle defects. <i>SGE1</i> encodes an ATP-binding cassette G (ABCG) transporter that plays a critical role in regulating floral cutin and wax secretion in <i>M. truncatula</i> SGE1 physically interacts with another half-size transporter, MtABCG13, to form a functional heterodimer. Mutation of <i>MtABCG13</i> results in flower cuticle defects similar to those in <i>sge1</i> as well as stigma exsertion, indicating that SGE1 and MtABCG13 are indispensable for flower cuticle secretion and collaboratively control stigma exsertion in <i>M. truncatula</i> Our findings reveal novel functions for ABCG transporters in determining stigma exsertion by affecting the physical interactions of floral organs, providing insight into the molecular mechanism underlying stigma exsertion in leguminous plants with complex zygomorphic flowers.
