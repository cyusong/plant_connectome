['22361507', "VPS15 protein is a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex which  plays a pivotal role in the development of yeast and mammalian cells. The  knowledge about the function of its homologue in plants remains limited. Here we  report that AtVPS15, a homologue of yeast VPS15p in Arabidopsis, plays an  essential role in pollen germination. Homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants of  AtVPS15 could not be obtained from the progenies of self-pollinated heterozygous  mutants. Reciprocal crosses between atvps15 mutants and wild-type Arabidopsis  revealed that the T-DNA insertion was not able to be transmitted by male  gametophytes. DAPI staining, Alexander's stain and scanning electron microscopic  analysis showed that atvps15 heterozygous plants produced pollen grains that were  morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type pollen, whereas in vitro  germination experiments revealed that germination of the pollen grains was  defective. GUS staining analysis of transgenic plants expressing the GUS reporter  gene driven by the AtVPS15 promoter showed that AtVPS15 was mainly expressed in  pollen grains. Finally, DUALmembrane yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that  AtVPS15 might interact directly with AtVPS34. These results suggest that AtVPS15  is very important for pollen germination, possibly through modulation of the  activity of PI3-kinase.", '2012 Feb', 'J Genet Genomics', '10.1016/j.jgg.2012.01.002', 'Qu']
