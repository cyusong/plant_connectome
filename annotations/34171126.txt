Teosinte branched1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor (TCP) transcription factors (TFs) are essential for regulating plant developmental processes, which is still largely unknown in Torenia fournieri (T. fournieri), a widely used horticultural flower. In this study, we used a de novo transcriptome assembly method to predict the TCP transcription factors in T. fournieri. In total, 15 out of 21 predicted T. fournieri TCPs (TfTCPs) were isolated and verified with Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these 15 TfTCPs could be classified into two major classes. Most of these TfTCPs were expressed in floral buds, flowers, or leaves, suggesting an important role in developmental regulation in these tissues. Moreover, TfTCP8 and TfTCP13, the homologues of the Arabidopsis thaliana TCP5-like transcription factor, were able to bind to the conserved Class II TCP binding motifs and are localized to the nucleus, indicating that TfTCP8 and TfTCP13 act as transcriptional regulators. In agreement with the overexpression phenotype of AtTCP5, ectopic expression of TfTCP8 and TfTCP13 resulted in narrow leaves and the small petal phenotype in Arabidopsis, suggesting that these two TfTCPs potentially regulate leaf or flower shape in T. fournieri.
