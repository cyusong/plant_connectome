Little information is available about signaling response to magnesium toxicity (MgT) in plants. This study presents the first evidence that abscisic acid (ABA) and DELLA proteins participate in signaling response to long-term MgT in Arabidopsis thaliana (Landsberg erecta). Morphological, physiological, and molecular characteristics of a wild-type and two Arabidopsis mutants, ABA-insensitive mutant abi1-1 and constitutive elevated GA response mutant quadruple-DELLA (DELLA-Q: gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 rgl2-1) were monitored under MgT and normal magnesium conditions. Two weeks of MgT treatment strongly influenced the growth of young plants, but growth inhibition of the DELLA-Q and abi1-1 mutants was less than that of the wild-type plants. Exogenous ABA further inhibited the growth of the DELLA-Q mutants, similar to that of the wild-type. Both ABA and MgT also promoted DELLA protein RGA accumulation in the nuclei. Transcriptional analysis supported these results and revealed that a complex signaling network has responded to MgT in Arabidopsis. DELLA enhancement, which depends on ABI1, contributed to the remodeling growth and development of young seedlings.
