['23684977', 'Successful sexual reproduction in animals and plants requires communication  between male and female gametes. In flowering plants, unlike in animals, eggs and  sperm cells are enclosed in multicellular embryo sacs and pollen grains,  respectively; guided growth of the pollen tube into the ovule is necessary for  fertilization. Pollen tube guidance requires accurate perception of ovule-emitted  guidance cues by the receptors in pollen tubes. Although several ovule-secreted  peptides controlling pollen tube guidance have recently been identified, i.e.,  maize EGG APPARATUS1 (EA1), Torenia LURE1/LURE2, and Arabidopsis  CRP810_1/AtLURE1, little is known about the receptors. Here, we identified two  receptor-like kinase (RLK) genes preferentially expressed in Arabidopsis pollen  tubes, Lost In Pollen tube guidance 1 (LIP1) and 2 (LIP2), which are involved in  guidance control of pollen tubes. LIP1 and LIP2 were anchored to the membrane in  the pollen tube tip region via palmitoylation, which was essential for their  guidance control. Simultaneous inactivation of LIP1 and LIP2 led to impaired  pollen tube guidance into micropyle and significantly reduced attraction of  pollen tubes toward AtLURE1. Our results suggest that LIP1 and LIP2 represent  essential components of the pollen tube receptor complex to perceive the female  signal AtLURE1 for micropylar pollen tube guidance.', '2013 Jun 3', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2013.04.043', 'Qu']
