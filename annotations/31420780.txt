Anther dehiscence, one of the essential steps in pollination and double fertilization, is regulated by a complex signaling pathway encompassing hormones and environmental factors. However, key components underlying the signaling pathway that regulate anther dehiscence remain largely elusive. Here, we isolated a rice mutant anther dehiscence defected 1 (Osadd1) that exhibited defects in anther dehiscence and glume open. Map-based cloning revealed that OsADD1 encoded a GARP (Golden2, ARR-B and Psr1) transcription factor. Sequence analysis showed that a single base deletion in Osadd1 mutant resulted in pre-termination of the GARP domain. OsADD1 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, with more abundance in the panicles. The major genes associated with anther dehiscence were affected in the Osadd1 mutant, and the expression level of the cellulose synthase-like D sub-family 4 (OsCSLD4) was significantly decreased. We demonstrate that OsADD1 regulated the expression of OsCSLD4 by binding to its promoter, and affects rice anther dehiscence.
