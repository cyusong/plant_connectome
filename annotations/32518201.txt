It has been argued that accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates triggers a decrease in Rubisco content, which downregulates photosynthesis. However, a decrease in the sink-source ratio in several plant species leads to a decrease in photosynthesis and increases in both structural and nonstructural carbohydrate content. Here, we tested whether increases in cell-wall materials, rather than starch content, impact directly on photosynthesis by decreasing mesophyll conductance. We measured various morphological, anatomical, and physiological traits in primary leaves of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) and French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) grown under high- or low-nitrogen conditions. We removed other leaves 2 weeks after sowing to decrease the sink-source ratio and conducted measurements 0, 1, and 2 weeks after defoliation.
