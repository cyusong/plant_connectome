Petunia inflata possesses a self-incompatibility (SI) mechanism, which involves S-RNase and multiple S-locus F-box (SLF) genes at the polymorphic S-locus. For a given S-haplotype, each SLF is thought to interact with some of its non-self S-RNases, but not with its self S-RNase. In this work, we studied an allelic pair of SLF1, S2-SLF1 and S3-SLF1, which differ in 44 amino acids and show differential interactions with S3-RNase. We first used an in vivo transgenic assay to determine whether four chimeric proteins of S2-SLF1 and S3-SLF1, each with one of the three functional domains swapped, interact with S3-RNase. The results narrowed the candidate amino acids for specific interaction of S2-SLF1 with S3-RNase to the 16 in domain FD3. We then examined seven additional chimeric proteins by dividing FD3 into two subdomains and four mini-domains (A, B, C and D). The results further narrowed the candidate amino acids to four in mini-domain A and four in mini-domain D. Molecular modeling of interactions between S3-RNase and S2-SLF1 revealed that three of these eight are at the interaction surface, and all three are conserved in S1-SLF1 and S6a-SLF1, both of which interact with S3-RNase based on the in vivo transgenic assay. Three of the chimeric proteins were used for the in vivo transgenic assay to determine whether FD3 alone contains the amino acids required for S2-SLF1 to interact with S7-RNase and S13-RNase. The results revealed the diversity and complexity of interactions between SLF proteins and S-RNases.
