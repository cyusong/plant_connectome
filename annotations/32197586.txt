Panax notoginseng is a medicinally important Chinese herb with a long history of cultivation and clinical application. The planting area is mainly distributed in Wenshan Prefecture, where the quality and safety of P. notoginseng have been threatened by high concentration of arsenic (As) from the soil. The roles of phosphate (Pi) transporters involved in Pi acquisition and arsenate (AsV) tolerance were still unclear in this species. In this study, two open reading frames (ORFs) of PnPht1;1 and PnPht1;2 separated from P. notoginseng were cloned based on RNA-seq, which encoded 527 and 541 amino acids, respectively. The results of relative expression levels showed that both genes responded to the Pi deficiency or As exposure, and were highly upregulated. Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae MB192 revealed that PnPht1;1 and PnPht1;2 performed optimally in complementing the yeast Pi-transport defect, particularly in PnPht1;2. Cells expressing PnPht1;2 had a stronger AsV tolerance than PnPht1;1-expressing cells, and accumulated less As in cells under a high-Pi concentration. Combining with the result of plasma membrane localization, these data confirmed that transporters PnPht1;1 and PnPht1;2 were putative high-affinity H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> symporters, mediating the uptake of Pi and AsV. PnPht1;1 and PnPht1;2 encoded functional plasma membrane-localized transporter proteins that mediated a putative high-affinity Pi/H<sup>+</sup> symport activity. Expression of PnPht1;1 or PnPht1;2 in mutant strains could enhance the uptake of Pi and AsV, that is probably responsible for the As accumulation in the roots of P. notoginseng.
