Within the Arabidopsis family of 21 heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) HsfA2 is the strongest expressed member under heat stress (hs) conditions. Irrespective of the tissue, HsfA2 accumulates under heat stress similarly to other heat stress proteins (Hsps). A SALK T-DNA insertion line with a complete HsfA2-knockout was analyzed with respect to the changes in the transcriptome under heat stress conditions. Ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APX2) was identified as the most affected transcript in addition to several sHsps, individual members of the Hsp70 and Hsp100 family, as well as many transcripts of genes with yet unknown functions. For functional validation, the transcription activation potential of HsfA2 on GUS reporter constructs containing 1 kb upstream promoter sequences of selected target genes were analyzed using transient reporter assays in mesophyll protoplasts. By deletion analysis the promoter region of the strongest affected target gene APX2 was functionally mapped in detail to verify potential HsfA2 binding sites. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays we identified TATA-Box proximal clusters of heat stress elements (HSE) in the promoters of selected target genes as potential HsfA2 binding sites. The results presented here demonstrate that the expression of HsfA2 in Arabidopsis is strictly heat stress-dependent and this transcription factor represents a regulator of a subset of stress response genes in Arabidopsis.
