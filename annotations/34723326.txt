The Green Non-Coding Database (GreeNC) is one of the reference databases for the study of plant long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here we present our most recent update where 16 species have been updated, while 78 species have been added, resulting in the annotation of more than 495 000 lncRNAs. Moreover, sequence clustering was applied providing information about sequence conservation and gene families. The current version of the database is available at: http://greenc.sequentiabiotech.com/wiki2/Main_Page.
