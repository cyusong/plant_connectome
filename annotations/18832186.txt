The co-ordination of cell wall synthesis with plant cell expansion is an important topic of contemporary plant biology research. In studies of cell wall synthesis pathways, cellulose synthesis inhibitors are broadly used. It is demonstrated here that ancymidol, known as a plant growth retardant primarily affecting gibberellin biosynthesis, is also capable of inhibiting cellulose synthesis. Its ability to inhibit cellulose synthesis is not related to its anti-gibberellin action and possesses some unique features never previously observed when conventional cellulose synthesis inhibitors were used. It is suggested that ancymidol targets the cell wall synthesis pathway at a regulatory step where cell wall synthesis and cell expansion are coupled. The elucidation of the ancymidol target in plant cells could potentially contribute to our understanding of cell wall synthesis and cell expansion control.
