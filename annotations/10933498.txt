['10933498', 'Little is known of the plant branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex.  We have undertaken a detailed study of the structure of the dihydrolipoyl  acyltransferase (BCE2) subunit that forms the core of the complex, to which two  other enzymes attach. Mature Arabidopsis thaliana BCE2 was expressed in  Escherichia coli. The soluble recombinant protein was purified using a Superose 6  size-exclusion column to >90% homogeneity and was catalytically active. The  recombinant protein formed a stable complex with a native molecular mass of 0.95  MDa and an S coefficient of 19.4, consistent with formation of a 24-mer.  Negative-staining transmission electron microscopy of the recombinant protein  confirmed that BCE2 forms a core with octagonal symmetry. Despite divergence of  mammalian and plant BCE2s, there is clearly conservation of structure that is  independent of primary sequence.', '2000 Jul', 'Protein Sci', '10.1110/ps.9.7.1334', 'Randall']
