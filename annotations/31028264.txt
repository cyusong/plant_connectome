Grain protein content (GPC) affects rice nutrition quality. Here, we identify two stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs), qGPC-1 and qGPC-10, controlling GPC in a mapping population derived from indica and japonica cultivars crossing. Map-based cloning reveals that OsGluA2, encoding a glutelin type-A2 precursor, is the candidate gene underlying qGPC-10. It functions as a positive regulator of GPC and has a pleiotropic effect on rice grain quality. One SNP located in OsGluA2 promoter region is associated with its transcript expression level and GPC diversity. Polymorphisms of this nucleotide can divide all haplotypes into low (OsGluA2<sup>LET</sup>) and high (OsGluA2<sup>HET</sup>) expression types. Population genetic and evolutionary analyses reveal that OsGluA2<sup>LET</sup>, mainly present in japonica accessions, originates from wild rice. However, OsGluA2<sup>HET</sup>, the dominant type in indica, is acquired through mutation of OsGluA2<sup>LET</sup>. Our results shed light on the understanding of natural variations of GPC between indica and japonica subspecies.
