We identified two phenylquinazoline compounds in a large-scale screening for cytokinin antagonists in yeast expressing the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptor cytokinin response 1/histidine kinase 4 (CRE1). After chemical modifications, we obtained compound S-4893, which non-competitively inhibited binding of the natural ligand 2-isopentenyladenine to CRE1. S-4893 antagonized cytokinin-induced activation of the Arabidopsis response regulator 5 promoter in Arabidopsis. Importantly, S-4893 had no detectable intrinsic cytokinin agonist activity in Arabidopsis or in the transformed yeast system. Cytokinin bioassay further demonstrated that S-4893 antagonized cytokinin-induced stimulation of callus formation and inhibition of root elongation. S-4893 also promoted seminal, crown and lateral root growth in rice, suggesting that S-4893 could potentially promote root growth in a variety of agronomically important plants. We believe S-4893 will be a useful tool in functional studies of cytokinin action in a wide range of plants and a lead compound for the development of useful root growth promoters in agriculture.
