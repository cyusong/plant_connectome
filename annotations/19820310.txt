Epigenetic modifications and small RNAs play an important role in gene regulation. Here, we discuss results of our Solexa/Illumina 1G sequencing-based survey of DNA methylation, activating and repressive histone modifications, small RNAs and mRNA in the maize genome. We analyze tissue-specific epigenetic patterns, discuss antagonistic relationships between repressive epigenetic marks and highlight synergistic relationships between activating histone modifications. We discuss our observation that small RNAs show a tissue-specific distribution in maize. Whereas 24-nucleotide long small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) accumulated preferentially in shoots, 21-nucleotide long micro RNAs (miRNAs) were the most abundant group in roots, which follows the transcript level of mop1. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that a novel class of 22-nucleotide siRNAs might originate from long double-stranded RNAs in an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)-independent manner. This supports the intriguing possibility that maize possesses at least two distinct pathways to generate siRNAs, one of which relies on RdRP and a second one that might be RdRP-independent.
