We share whole genome sequences of six strains from the <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> species complex, a diverse group of <i>Betaproteobacteria</i> that cause plant vascular wilt diseases. Using single-molecule real-time technology, we sequenced and assembled full genomes of Rs5 and UW700, two phylotype IA-sequevar 7 (IIA-7) strains from the southeastern United States that are closely related to the <i>R. solanacearum</i> species type strain, K60, but were isolated >50 years later. Four sequenced strains from Africa include a soil isolate from Nigeria (UW386, III-23), a tomato isolate from Senegal (UW763, I-14), and two potato isolates from the Madagascar highlands (RUN2474, III-19 and RUN2279, III-60). This resource will support studies of the genetic diversity, ecology, virulence, and microevolution of this globally distributed group of high-impact plant pathogens.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
