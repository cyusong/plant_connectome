['27354416', 'Receptor kinases convey diverse environmental and developmental inputs by sensing  extracellular ligands. In plants, one group of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) is  characterized by extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which interact  with various ligands that include the plant hormone brassinosteroid and peptides  of the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) type. For instance, the CLE45  peptide requires the LRR-RLK BARELY ANY MERISTEM 3 (BAM3) to prevent protophloem  formation in Arabidopsis root meristems. Here, we show that other proposed CLE45  receptors, the two redundantly acting LRR-RLKs STERILITY-REGULATING KINASE MEMBER  1 (SKM1) and SKM2 (which perceive CLE45 in the context of pollen tube  elongation), cannot substitute for BAM3 in the root. Moreover, we identify  MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED KINASE REGULATOR 5 (MAKR5) as a post-transcriptionally  regulated amplifier of the CLE45 signal that acts downstream of BAM3. MAKR5  belongs to a small protein family whose prototypical member, BRI1 KINASE  INHIBITOR 1, is an essentially negative regulator of brassinosteroid signaling.  By contrast, MAKR5 is a positive effector of CLE45 signaling, revealing an  unexpected diversity in the conceptual roles of MAKR genes in different signaling  pathways.', '2016 Aug', 'EMBO Rep', '10.15252/embr.201642450', 'ORCID:']
