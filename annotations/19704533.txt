['19704533', 'Receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are cell surface receptors that play important  roles in various processes. In several plant species RLPs have been found to play  a role in disease resistance, including the tomato Cf and Ve proteins and the  apple HcrVf proteins that mediate resistance against the fungal pathogens  Cladosporium fulvum, Verticillium spp., and Venturia inaequalis, respectively.  The Arabidopsis genome contains 57 AtRLP genes. Two of these, CLV2 (AtRLP10) and  TMM (AtRLP17), have well-characterized functions in meristem and stomatal  development, respectively, while AtRLP52 is required for defense against powdery  mildew. We recently reported the assembly of a genome-wide collection of T-DNA  insertion lines for the Arabidopsis AtRLP genes. This collection was functionally  analyzed with respect to plant growth, development and sensitivity to various  stress responses including pathogen susceptibility. Only few new phenotypes were  discovered; while AtRLP41 was found to mediate abscisic acid sensitivity, AtRLP30  (and possibly AtRLP18) was found to be required for full non-host resistance to a  bacterial pathogen. Possibly, identification of novel phenotypes is obscured by  functional redundancy. Therefore, RNA interference (RNAi) to target the  expression of multiple AtRLP genes simultaneously was employed followed by  functional analysis of the RNAi lines.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.3.10.6543', 'Thomma']
