Crops that exhibit symptoms of calcium (Ca) deficiency constitute a major agricultural problem. Molecular breeding of resistant cultivars is a promising method for overcoming this problem. However, the involved genes must first be identified. Here, we show that the glucan synthase-like (GSL) 1 gene is essential for low-Ca tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. GSL1 is homologous to GSL10, which we previously showed was essential for low-Ca tolerance. Under low-Ca conditions, gsl1 mutants exhibit reduced growth and the onset of necrosis in new leaves. These symptoms are typical of Ca-deficient crops. A grafting experiment suggested that the shoot genotype, but not the root genotype, was important for the suppression of shoot necrosis. The ectopic accumulation of callose under low-Ca conditions was significantly reduced in gsl1 mutants compared with wild-type plants. Because the corresponding single-mutant phenotypes are similar, we investigated the interaction between GSL1 and GSL10 by testing the gsl1 gsl10 double mutant for sensitivity to low-Ca conditions. The double mutant exhibited a more severe phenotype than did the single mutants, indicating that the effects of GSL1 and GSL10 on low-Ca tolerance are additive. Because GSL genes are highly conserved within the plant kingdom, the GSL loci may be useful for breeding low-Ca tolerant crops.
