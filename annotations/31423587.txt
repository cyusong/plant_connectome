Inorganic polyphosphates (polyPs) and inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) form important stores of inorganic phosphate and can act as energy metabolites and signaling molecules. Here we review our current understanding of polyP and inositol phosphate (InsP) metabolism and physiology in plants. We outline methods for polyP and InsP detection, discuss the known plant enzymes involved in their synthesis and breakdown, and summarize the potential physiological and signaling functions for these enigmatic molecules in plants.
