Cell walls define the shape of plant cells, controlling the extent and orientation of cell elongation, and hence organ growth. The main load-bearing component of plant cell walls is cellulose, and how plants regulate its biosynthesis during development and in response to various environmental perturbations is a central question in plant biology. Cellulose is synthesized by cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs) that are assembled in the Golgi apparatus and then delivered to the plasma membrane (PM), where they actively synthesize cellulose. CSCs travel along cortical microtubule paths that define the orientation of synthesis of the cellulose microfibrils. CSCs recycle between the PM and various intracellular compartments, and this trafficking plays an important role in determining the level of cellulose synthesized. In this review, we summarize recent findings in CESA complex organization, CESA posttranslational modifications and trafficking, and other components that interact with CESAs. We also discuss cell wall integrity maintenance, with a focus on how this impacts cellulose biosynthesis.
