The nuclear envelope (NE) is a fundamental structure of eukaryotic cells with a dual role: it separates two distinct compartments, and enables communication between them via nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Little is known about NPCs and NE structural organization in plants. We investigated the structure of NPCs from both sides of the NE in tobacco BY-2 cells. We detected structural differences between the NPCs of dividing and quiescent nuclei. Importantly, we also traced the organizational pattern of the NPCs, and observed non-random NPC distribution over the nuclear surface. Lastly, we observed an organized filamentous protein structure that underlies the inner nuclear membrane, and interconnects NPCs. The results are discussed within the context of the current understanding of NE structure and function in higher eukaryotes.
