This review describes physiological mechanisms and selectable indicators of gene action, with the aim of promoting new screening methods to identify genetic variation for increasing the salt tolerance of cereal crops. Physiological mechanisms that underlie traits for salt tolerance could be used to identify new genetic sources of salt tolerance. Important mechanisms of tolerance involve Na+ exclusion from the transpiration stream, sequestration of Na+ and Cl- in the vacuoles of root and leaf cells, and other processes that promote fast growth despite the osmotic stress of the salt outside the roots. Screening methods for these traits are discussed in relation to their use in breeding, particularly with respect to wheat. Precise phenotyping is the key to finding and introducing new genes for salt tolerance into crop plants.
