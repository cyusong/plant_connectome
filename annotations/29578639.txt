Leguminous plants can establish symbiotic associations with diazotropic rhizobia to form nitrogen-fixating nodules, which are classified as determinate or indeterminate based on the persistence of nodule meristem. The formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules requires coordinating rhizobial infection and root nodule organogenesis. The formation of an infection thread and the extent of nodule formation are largely under plant control, but vary with environmental conditions and the physiological state of the host plants. Many achievements in these two areas have been made in recent decades. Phytohormone signaling pathways have gradually emerged as important regulators of root nodule symbiosis. Cytokinin, strigolactones (SLs) and local accumulation of auxin can promote nodule development. Ethylene, jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) all negatively regulate infection thread formation and nodule development. However, salicylic acid (SA) and brassinosteroids (BRs) have different effects on the formation of these two nodule types. Some peptide hormones are also involved in nodulation. This review summarizes recent findings on the roles of these plant hormones in legume-rhizobial symbiosis, and we propose that DELLA proteins may function as a node to integrate plant hormones to regulate nodulation.
