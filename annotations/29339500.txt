ROOT MERISTEM GROWTH FACTOR (RGF) 1 is an important peptide hormone that regulates root growth. Upon binding to its receptor, RGFR1, RGF1 regulates the expression of two transcription factors, <i>PLETHORA</i> 1 and 2 (<i>PLT1/2</i>), to influence root meristem development. Here, we show that the ubiquitin-specific proteases UBP12 and UBP13 are positive regulators of root meristem development and that UBP13 interacts directly with RGF1 receptor (RGFR1) and its close homolog RGFR2. The <i>ubp12,13</i> double-mutant root is completely insensitive to exogenous applied RGF1. Consistent with this result, RGF1-induced ubiquitination and turnover of RGFR1 protein were accelerated in <i>ubp12,13</i>-mutant plants but were delayed in transgenic plants overexpressing <i>UBP13</i> Genetic analysis showed that <i>PLT2</i> or <i>RGFR1</i> overexpression partially rescued the short-root phenotype and the reduced cortical root meristem cell number in <i>ubp12,13</i> plants. Together, our results demonstrate that UBP12/13 are regulators of the RGF1-RGFR1-PLT1/2 signaling pathway and that UBP12/13 can counteract RGF1-induced RGFR1 ubiquitination, stabilize RGFR1, and maintain root cell sensitivity to RGF1.
