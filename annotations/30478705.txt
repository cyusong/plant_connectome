This article (Zhou et al. 2018) has been retracted by the authors because the sequence BIBAC 002A111F06 was incorrectly assigned to the wrong bacterial species. The BIBAC 002A111F06 sequence (GenBank Accession KC129717) reported in the paper was attributed to Populus euphratica Oliv. The BLAST search of this KC129717 sequence against the nr database at NCBI showed that it has very high similarity to a genomic sequence from the gram-negative bacteria Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The bacterium associates with Populus euphratica Oliv. and DNA isolated from Populus euphratica Oliv. for the construction of the BIBAC clone library inlcuded DNA from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Therefore, the phenotype of the transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying the KC129717 sequence cannot be attributed to genes from Populus euphratica Oliv. The authors apologize for the confusion and misinterpretation of our data resulting from the incorrect sequence assignment. All authors agree to this retraction.
