Three types of nematode-feeding sites (NFSs) caused by M. graminicola on rice were suggested, and the NFS polarized expansion stops before the full NFS maturation that occurs at adult female stage. Root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., secrete effectors and recruit host genes to establish their feeding sites giant cells, ensuring their nutrient acquisition. There is still a limited understanding of the mechanism underlying giant cell development. Here, the three-dimensional structures of M. graminicola-caused nematode-feeding sites (NFSs) on rice as well as changes in morphological features and cytoplasm density of the giant cells (GCs) during nematode parasitism were reconstructed and characterized by confocal microscopy and the Fiji software. Characterization of morphological features showed that three types of M. graminicola-caused NFSs, type I-III, were detected during parasitism at the second juvenile (J2), the third juvenile (J3), the fourth juvenile (J4) and adult female stages. Type I is the majority at all stages and type II develops into type I at J3 stage marked by its longitudinal growth. Meanwhile, NFSs underwent polarized expansion, where the lateral and longitudinal expansion ceased at later parasitic J2 stage and the non-feeding J4 stage, respectively. The investigation of giant cell cytoplasm density indicates that it reaches a peak at the midpoint of early parasitic J2 and adult female stages. Our data suggest the formation of three types of NFSs caused by M. graminicola on rice and the NFS polarized expansion stopping before full NFS maturation, which provides unprecedented spatio-temporal characterization of development of giant cells caused by a root-knot nematode.
