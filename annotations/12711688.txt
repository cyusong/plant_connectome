['12711688', 'Thus far, no transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) from higher plants has been  cloned and characterized. We have cloned and characterized TFIIIA and ribosomal  protein L5 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Primary sequence comparison revealed a high  divergence of AtTFIIIA and a relatively high conservation of AtL5 when compared  with other organisms. The AtTFIIIA cDNA encodes a protein with nine  Cys(2)-His(2)-type zinc fingers, a 23 amino acid spacer between fingers 1 and 2,  a 66 amino acid spacer between fingers 4 and 5, and a 50 amino acid non-finger  C-terminal tail. Aside from the amino acids required for proper zinc finger  folding, AtTFIIIA is highly divergent from other known TFIIIAs. AtTFIIIA can bind  5S rDNA, as well as 5S rRNA, and efficiently stimulates the transcription of an  Arabidopsis 5S rRNA gene in vitro. AtL5 identity was confirmed by demonstrating  that this protein binds to 5S rRNA but not to 5S rDNA. Protoplast transient  expression assays with green fluorescent protein fusion proteins revealed that  AtTFIIIA is absent from the cytoplasm and concentrated at several nuclear foci  including the nucleolus. AtL5 protein accumulates in the nucleus, especially in  the nucleolus, and is also present in the cytoplasm.', '2003 May 1', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkg335', 'Tourmente']
