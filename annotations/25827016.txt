['25827016', "Plant basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play essential roles in  abiotic stress tolerance. However, most bHLHs have not been functionally  characterized. Here, we characterized the functional role of a bHLH transcription  factor from Arabidopsis, AtbHLH112, in response to abiotic stress. AtbHLH112 is a  nuclear-localized protein, and its nuclear localization is induced by salt,  drought and abscisic acid (ABA). In addition, AtbHLH112 serves as a  transcriptional activator, with the activation domain located at its N-terminus.  In addition to binding to the E-box motifs of stress-responsive genes, AtbHLH112  binds to a novel motif with the sequence 'GG[GT]CC[GT][GA][TA]C' (GCG-box). Gain-  and loss-of-function analyses showed that the transcript level of AtbHLH112 is  positively correlated with salt and drought tolerance. AtbHLH112 mediates stress  tolerance by increasing the expression of P5CS genes and reducing the expression  of P5CDH and ProDH genes to increase proline levels. AtbHLH112 also increases the  expression of POD and SOD genes to improve reactive oxygen species (ROS)  scavenging ability. We present a model suggesting that AtbHLH112 is a  transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of genes via binding to  their GCG- or E-boxes to mediate physiological responses, including proline  biosynthesis and ROS scavenging pathways, to enhance stress tolerance.", '2015 Aug', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13387', 'Wang']
