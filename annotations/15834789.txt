['15834789', 'The proanthocyanidin (PA) content was increased in seeds of pap1-D mutant of  Arabidopsis thaliana, in which the expression of endogenous PAP1 gene encoding a  Myb-like transcription factor was induced by activation-tagging with enhancer  sequences derived from cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. In contrast, the PA  contents decreased in seeds of transgenic plants transformed with a PAP1 cDNA or  with a PAP1 chimeric repressor, although the amount of soluble anthocyanins  increased in seeds of transgenic plants over-expressing PAP1 cDNA. The enhanced  radical scavenging activity was observed only in the seed extracts of pap1-D  mutant, indicating that PAs are primarily responsible for radical scavenging  activity in seeds. The present study suggests the feasibility of engineering a  transcription factor of flavonoid biosynthesis for health beneficial plant seeds.', '2005 Mar', 'Biotechnol Lett', '10.1007/s10529-005-0683-7', 'Saito']
