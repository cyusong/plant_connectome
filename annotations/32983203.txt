Cacti have a highly specialized stem that enables survival during extended dry periods. Despite the ornamental value of cacti and the fact that stems represent the main source of explants in tissue culture, there are no studies on their morpho-anatomical and cytological characteristics in <i>Melocactus</i>. The present study seeks to address the occurrence of cells with mixed ploidy level in cacti tissues. Specifically, we aim to understand how <i>Melocactus</i> stem tissue is organized, how mixoploidy is distributed when present, and whether detected patterns of ploidy change after long periods of <i>in vitro</i> culture. To analyze tissue organization, <i>Melocactus glaucescens</i> and <i>Melocactus paucispinus</i> plants that had been germinated and cultivated <i>in vitro</i> were analyzed for stem structure using toluidine blue, Xylidine Ponceau, Periodic Acid Schiff, ruthenium red, and acid floroglucin. To investigate patterns of ploidy, apical, medial, and basal zones of the stem, as well as, periphery, cortex, and stele (vascular tissue and pith) regions of the stem and root apexes from four- and ten-year old cultured <i>in vitro</i> were analyzed by flow cytometry. X-ray micro-computed tomography (XRµCT) was performed with fragments of stems from both species. The scarcity of support elements (<i>i.e.</i>, sclereids and fibers) indicates that epidermis, hypodermis, and wide-band tracheids present in cortical vascular bundles and stele, as well as water stored in aquifer parenchyma cells along the cortex, provide mechanical support to the stem. Parenchyma cells increase in volume with a four-fold increase in ploidy. <i>M. glaucescens</i> and <i>M. paucispinus</i> exhibit the same pattern of cell ploidy irrespective of topophysical region or age, but there is a marked difference in ploidy between the stem periphery (epidermis and hypodermis), cortex, stele, and roots. Mixoploidy in <i>Melocactus</i> is not related to the age of the culture, but is a developmental trait, whereby endocycles promote cell differentiation to accumulate valuable water.
