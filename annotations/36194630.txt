Sexual reproduction is widespread in eukaryotes; however, only asexual reproduction has been observed in unicellular red algae, including <i>Galdieria</i>, which branched early in Archaeplastida. <i>Galdieria</i> possesses a small genome; it is polyextremophile, grows either photoautotrophically, mixotrophically, or heterotrophically, and is being developed as an industrial source of vitamins and pigments because of its high biomass productivity. Here, we show that <i>Galdieria</i> exhibits a sexual life cycle, alternating between cell-walled diploid and cell wall-less haploid, and that both phases can proliferate asexually. The haploid can move over surfaces and undergo self-diploidization or generate heterozygous diploids through mating. Further, we prepared the whole genome and a comparative transcriptome dataset between the diploid and haploid and developed genetic tools for the stable gene expression, gene disruption, and selectable marker recycling system using the cell wall-less haploid. The BELL/KNOX and MADS-box transcription factors, which function in haploid-to-diploid transition and development in plants, are specifically expressed in the haploid and diploid, respectively, and are involved in the haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Galdieria</i>, providing information on the missing link of the sexual life cycle evolution in Archaeplastida. Four actin genes are differently involved in motility of the haploid and cytokinesis in the diploid, both of which are myosin independent and likely reflect ancestral roles of actin. We have also generated photosynthesis-deficient mutants, such as blue-colored cells, which were depleted in chlorophyll and carotenoids, for industrial pigment production. These features of <i>Galdieria</i> facilitate the understanding of the evolution of algae and plants and the industrial use of microalgae.
