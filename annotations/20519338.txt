['20519338', "Histone modifications play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene  expression. All histone modifications are reversible, which may therefore provide  a flexible way for regulating gene expression during the plant's development and  during the plant response to environmental stimuli. The reversible acetylation  and deacetylation of specific lysine residues on core histones are catalysed by  histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAs). HDA6 is an RPD3-type  histone deacetylase in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis HDA6 mutant, axe1-5, and HDA6  RNA-interfering plants displayed a phenotype that was hypersensitive to ABA and  salt stress. Compared with wild-type plants, the expression of the ABA and  abiotic stress-responsive genes, ABI1, ABI2, KAT1, KAT2, DREB2A, RD29A, and  RD29B, was decreased in axe1-5 and HDA6 RNA-interfering plants when treated with  ABA or salt stress. It was found that both ABA and salt stress could enrich the  gene activation markers, histone H3K9K14 acetylation, and H3K4 trimethylation,  but decrease the gene repression marker, H3K9 dimethylation, of the ABA and  abiotic stress-responsive genes. Our study indicates that HDA6-involved histone  modifications modulate seed germination and the salt stress response, as well as  ABA- and salt stress-induced gene expression in Arabidopsis.", '2010 Jul', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erq154', 'Wu']
