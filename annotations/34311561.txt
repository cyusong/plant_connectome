We report here the genome sequence of <i>Bacillus</i> sp. RRD69, a plant-growth-promoting bacterial endophyte isolated from switchgrass plants grown on a reclaimed coal-mining site in Kentucky. RRD69 is predicted to contain 3,758 protein-coding genes, with a genome size of 3.715 Mbp and a 41.41% GC content.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
