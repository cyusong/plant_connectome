Bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is a tradable and desirable crop; however, its perishable nature requires low-temperature handling. Paradoxically, cold causes chilling injury (CI) and post-harvest waste. Current knowledge about CI in pepper is limited. The mechanism of CI is multi-faceted; therefore, we focused on fatty acid (FA) desaturation. We identified an upstream nuclear transcription factor (TF), CaMYB340, belonging to the R2R3 MYB subfamily, that negatively regulates FA desaturation and CaCBF3 expression and whose gene and protein expression is induced by low temperature (4°C). Specifically, McrBC treatment and bisulfite sequencing PCR indicate that exposure to cold triggers DNA methylation on one of the CHH sites in the CaMYB340 promoter. This epigenetic event at least partly contributes to the upregulation of CaMYB340 transcript levels. Increased expression of CaMYB340 results in the formation of protein complexes with CabHLH93 and CaMYB1R1, which in turn downregulate the expression of downstream genes. For peppers held at low temperature, transient overexpression of CaMYB340 reduced unsaturated FA content and membrane fluidity, resulting in cold-induced poor peel texture. Transient CaMYB340 silencing increased FA desaturation and lowered electrolyte leakage, enhancing cold tolerance in CaMYB340 knockdown fruits. Overall, these results underscore the intricacy of transcriptional networks in plants and highlight the role of CaMYB340 in CI occurrence in pepper fruits.
