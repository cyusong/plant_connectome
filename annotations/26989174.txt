['26989174', 'Stomata are highly specialized epidermal structures that control transpiration  and gas exchange between plants and the environment. Signal networks underlying  stomatal development have been previously uncovered but much less is known about  how signals involved in stomatal development are transmitted to RNA polymerase II  (Pol II or RPB), which plays a central role in the transcription of mRNA coding  genes. Here, we identify a partial loss-of-function mutation of the third largest  subunit of nuclear DNA-dependent Pol II (NRPB3) that exhibits an increased number  of stomatal lineage cells and paired stomata. Phenotypic and genetic analyses  indicated that NRPB3 is not only required for correct stomatal patterning, but is  also essential for stomatal differentiation. Protein-protein interaction assays  showed that NRPB3 directly interacts with two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)  transcription factors, FAMA and INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1 (ICE1), indicating  that NRPB3 serves as an acceptor for signals from transcription factors involved  in stomatal development. Our findings highlight the surprisingly conserved  activating mechanisms mediated by the third largest subunit of Pol II in  eukaryotes.', '2016 May 1', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.129098', 'Hou']
