Drought is a major threat to plant growth and crop productivity. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a critical role in plant response to drought stress. Although ABA signaling-mediated drought tolerance has been widely investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, the feedback mechanism and components negatively regulating this pathway are less well understood. Here we identified a member of Arabidopsis HD-ZIP transcription factors HAT1 which can interacts with and be phosphorylated by SnRK2s. hat1hat3, loss-of-function mutant of HAT1 and its homolog HAT3, was hypersensitive to ABA in primary root inhibition, ABA-responsive genes expression, and displayed enhanced drought tolerance, whereas HAT1 overexpressing lines were hyposensitive to ABA and less tolerant to drought stress, suggesting that HAT1 functions as a negative regulator in ABA signaling-mediated drought response. Furthermore, expression levels of ABA biosynthesis genes ABA3 and NCED3 were repressed by HAT1 directly binding to their promoters, resulting in the ABA level was increased in hat1hat3 and reduced in HAT1OX lines. Further evidence showed that both protein stability and binding activity of HAT1 was repressed by SnRK2.3 phosphorylation. Overexpressing SnRK2.3 in HAT1OX transgenic plant made a reduced HAT1 protein level and suppressed the HAT1OX phenotypes in ABA and drought response. Our results thus establish a new negative regulation mechanism of HAT1 which helps plants fine-tune their drought responses.
