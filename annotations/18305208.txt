The balance between the supply and utilization of carbon (C) changes continually. It has been proposed that plants respond in an acclimatory manner, modifying C utilization to minimize harmful periods of C depletion. This hypothesis predicts that signaling events are initiated by small changes in C status. We analyzed the global transcriptional response to a gradual depletion of C during the night and an extension of the night, where C becomes severely limiting from 4 h onward. The response was interpreted using published datasets for sugar, light, and circadian responses. Hundreds of C-responsive genes respond during the night and others very early in the extended night. Pathway analysis reveals that biosynthesis and cellular growth genes are repressed during the night and genes involved in catabolism are induced during the first hours of the extended night. The C response is amplified by an antagonistic interaction with the clock. Light signaling is attenuated during the 24-h light/dark cycle. A model was developed that uses the response of 22K genes during a circadian cycle and their responses to C and light to predict global transcriptional responses during diurnal cycles of wild-type and starchless pgm mutant plants and an extended night in wild-type plants. By identifying sets of genes that respond at different speeds and times during C depletion, our extended dataset and model aid the analysis of candidates for C signaling. This is illustrated for AKIN10 and four bZIP transcription factors, and sets of genes involved in trehalose signaling, protein turnover, and starch breakdown.
