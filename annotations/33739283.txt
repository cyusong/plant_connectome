['33739283', 'Asymmetric and self-renewing divisions build and pattern tissues. In the  Arabidopsis stomatal lineage, asymmetric cell divisions, guided by polarly  localized cortical proteins, generate most cells on the leaf surface. Systemic  and environmental signals modify tissue development, but the mechanisms by which  plants incorporate such cues to regulate asymmetric divisions are elusive. In a  screen for modulators of cell polarity, we identified CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE  RESPONSE1, a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. We subsequently revealed  antagonistic impacts of ethylene and glucose signaling on the self-renewing  capacity of stomatal lineage stem cells. Quantitative analysis of cell polarity  and fate dynamics showed that developmental information may be encoded in both  the spatial and temporal asymmetries of polarity proteins. These results provide  a framework for a mechanistic understanding of how nutritional status and  environmental factors tune stem-cell behavior in the stomatal lineage, ultimately  enabling flexibility in leaf size and cell-type composition.', '2021 Mar 19', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.63335', 'ORCID:']
