Recent evidence shows that small RNAs are transferred from a species to another through cross-species transmission and exhibit biological activities in the receptor. In this study, we focused on tomato-derived sRNAs play a role of defense against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Bioinformatics method was firstly employed to identify tomato-encoded sRNAs as the cross-species antifungal factors targeting <i>B. cinerea</i> genes. Then the expression levels of some identifed sRNAs were checked in <i>B. cinerea</i>-infected plant using qRT-PCR method. Exogenic RNA-induced gene silences analysis were performed to investigate the antifungal roles of the sRNAs, and the target genes in <i>B. cinerea</i> of antifungal sRNAs would be confirmed by using co-expression analysis. Results showed that a total of 21 <i>B.cinerea</i>-induced sRNAs with high abundance were identified as the cross-kingdom regulator candidates. Among them, three sRNAs containing a miRNA (miR396a-5p) and two siRNA (siR3 and siR14) were selected for experimental validation and bioassay analysis. qRT-PCR confirmed that all of these 3 sRNAs were induced in tomato leaves by <i>B. cinerea</i> infection. Correspondingly, 4 virulence genes of B. cinerea respectively targeted by these 3 sRNAs were down-regulated. Bioassay revealed that all of these 3 cross-species sRNAs could inhibit the virulence and spore gemination of <i>B. cinerea</i>. Correspondingly, the coding genes of <i>B. cinerea</i> targeted by these sRNAs were also down-regulated. Moreover, the virulence inhibition by double strand sRNA was more effective than that by single strand sRNA. The inhibition efficiency of sRNA against <i>B. cinerea</i> increased with the increase of its concentration. Our findings provide new evidence into the coevolution of pathogens and host plants, as well as new directions for the use of plant-derived sRNAs to control pathogens.
