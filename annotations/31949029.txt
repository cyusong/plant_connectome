['31949029', 'Deficiency of water and phosphate induce lignin deposition in roots. LACCASEs, a  family of cell wall-localized multicopper oxidases, are involved in lignin  biosynthesis. We demonstrate here that LACCASE2 (LAC2) acts as a negative  regulator of lignin deposition in root vascular tissues during water deficit. An  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transfer DNA insertion mutant of LAC2  displayed a short primary root and high lignin deposition in root vascular  tissues. However, restoration of LAC2 expression rescued these phenotypes. LAC2  expression was significantly down-regulated under water deficit and  posttranscriptionally regulated by microRNA397b (miR397b) in roots under normal  and water-deficit conditions. Down-regulation of miR397b activity increased LAC2  expression and root length, and decreased lignin content in root vasculature.  Similarly, phosphate (Pi) deficiency inversely affected miR397b and LAC2  expression. Lignin deposition in the root elongation zone under Pi-limited  conditions was dependent on LAC2 expression. Localized iron accumulation and  callose deposition in the root elongation zone under Pi deficiency increased with  LAC2-dependent lignification, suggesting a direct relationship between these  processes. Our study reveals a regulatory role for the miR397b-LAC2 module in  root lignification during water and phosphate deficiency.', '2020 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00921', 'ORCID:']
