['33777065', 'SMALL AUXIN UP-REGULATED RNAs (SAURs) are recognized as auxin-responsive genes  involved in the regulation of abiotic stress adaptive growth. Among the  growth-limiting factors, water-deficit condition significantly affects plant  growth and development. The putative function of SAUR family member AtSAUR32 has  the potential to diminish the negative impact of drought stress, but the exact  function and mode of action remain unclear in Arabidopsis. In the current study,  AtSAUR32 gene was cloned and functionally analyzed. AtSAUR32 localized to the  plasma membrane and nucleus was dominantly expressed in roots and highly induced  by abscisic acid and drought treatment at certain time points. The stomatal  closure and seed germination of saur32 were less sensitive to ABA relative to  AtSAUR32-overexpressed line (OE32-5) and wild type (WT). Moreover, the saur32  mutant under drought stress showed increased ion leakage while quantum yield of  photosystem II (PhiPSII) and endogenous ABA accumulation were reduced, along with  the expression pattern of ABA/stress-responsive genes compared with WT and the  OE32-5 transgenic line. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular  fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that AtSAUR32 interacted with  clade-A PP2C proteins (AtHAI1 and AtAIP1) to regulate ABA sensitivity in  Arabidopsis. Taken together, these results indicate that AtSAUR32 plays an  important role in drought stress adaptation via mediating ABA signal  transduction.', '2021', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2021.625493', 'Lu']
