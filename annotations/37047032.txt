The plasma membrane (PM), which is composed of a lipid layer implanted with proteins, has diverse functions in plant responses to environmental triggers. The heterogenous dynamics of lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane play important roles in regulating cellular activities with an intricate pathway that orchestrates reception, signal transduction and appropriate response in the plant immune system. In the process of the plasma membrane participating in defense responses, the cytoskeletal elements have important functions in a variety of ways, including regulation of protein and lipid dynamics as well as vesicle trafficking. In this review, we summarized how the plasma membrane contributed to plant immunity and focused on the dynamic process of cytoskeleton regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis and propose future research directions.
