Two homologs of PISTILLATA have been identified in rice: OsMADS2 and OsMADS4. However, their roles in floral organ development are controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the genes show unequal redundancy of class B function. Although OsMADS2 plays an important role in lodicule development, OsMADS4 also supports the specification of lodicule identity. In contrast, the genes are roughly equally important in stamen development. Consistent with their redundant functions, both OsMADS2 and OsMADS4 interact with the unique rice AP3 ortholog SPW1.
