['19563437', 'Uridine nucleotides can be formed by energy-consuming de novo synthesis or by the  energy-saving recycling of nucleobases resulting from nucleotide catabolism.  Uracil phosphoribosyltransferases (UPRTs; EC 2.4.2.9) are involved in the salvage  of pyrimidines by catalyzing the formation of uridine monophosphate (UMP) from  uracil and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. To date, UPRTs are described as  non-essential, energy-saving enzymes. In the present work, the six genes  annotated as UPRTs in the Arabidopsis genome are examined through phylogenetic  and functional complementation approaches and the available T-DNA insertion  mutants are characterized. We show that a single nuclear gene encoding a protein  targeted to plastids, UPP, is responsible for almost all UPRT activity in  Arabidopsis. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic  pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable  progeny in loss-of-function mutants. Plastid biogenesis and starch accumulation  were affected in all analysed tissues, with the exception of stomata. Therefore  we propose that uracil salvage is of major importance for plant development.', '2009 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03963.x', 'Renou']
