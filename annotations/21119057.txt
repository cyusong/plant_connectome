['21119057', 'The acentrosomal plant mitotic spindle is uniquely structured in that it lacks  opposing centrosomes at its poles and is equipped with a connective preprophase  band that regulates the spatial framework for spindle orientation and mobility.  These features are supported by specialized microtubule-associated proteins and  motors. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana MAP65-4, a non-motor microtubule  associated protein (MAP) that belongs to the evolutionarily conserved MAP65  family, specifically associates with the forming mitotic spindle during prophase  and with the kinetochore fibers from prometaphase to the end of anaphase. In  vitro, MAP65-4 induces microtubule (MT) bundling through the formation of  cross-bridges between adjacent MTs both in polar and antipolar orientations. The  association of MAP65-4 with an MT bundle is concomitant with its elongation.  Furthermore, MAP65-4 modulates the MT dynamic instability parameters of  individual MTs within a bundle, mainly by decreasing the frequency of  catastrophes and increasing the frequency of rescue events, and thereby supports  the progressive lengthening of MT bundles over time. These properties are in line  with its role of initiating kinetochore fibers during prospindle formation.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.080606', 'Vantard']
