Plants are sessile organisms that have to adapt their growth to the surrounding environment. Concomitant with this adaptation capability, they have adopted a post-embryonic development characterized by continuous growth and differentiation abilities. Constant growth is based on the potential of stem cells to divide almost incessantly and on a precise balance between cell division and cell differentiation. This balance is influenced by environmental conditions and by the genetic information of the cell. Among the internal cues, the cross-talk between different hormonal signalling pathways is essential to control this division/differentiation equilibrium. Auxin, one of the most important plant hormones, regulates cell division and differentiation, among many other processes. Amazing advances in auxin signal transduction at the molecular level have been reported, but how this signalling is connected to the cell cycle is, so far, not well known. Auxin signalling involves the auxin-dependent degradation of transcription repressors by F-box-containing E3 ligases of ubiquitin. Recently, SKP2A, another F-box protein, was shown to bind auxin and to target cell-cycle repressors for proteolysis, representing a novel mechanism that links auxin to cell division. In this review, a general vision of what is already known and the most recent advances on how auxin signalling connects to cell division and the role of the ubiquitin pathway in plant cell cycle will be covered.
