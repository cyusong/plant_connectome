Soil salinity is a constraint for major agricultural crops leading to severe yield loss, which may increase with the changing climatic conditions. Disruption in the cellular ionic homeostasis is one of the primary responses induced by elevated sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup> ). Therefore, unraveling the mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and transport in plants along with the characterization of the candidate genes facilitating ion homeostasis is obligatory for enhancing salinity tolerance in crops. This review summarizes the current advances in understanding the ion homeostasis mechanism in crop plants, emphasizing the role of transporters involved in the regulation of cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> level along with the conservation of K<sup>+</sup> /Na<sup>+</sup> ratio. Furthermore, expression profiles of the candidate genes for ion homeostasis were also explored under various developmental stages and tissues of Oryza sativa based on the publicly available microarray data. The review also gives an up-to-date summary on the efforts to increase salinity tolerance in crops by manipulating selected stress-associated genes. Overall, this review gives a combined view on both the ionomic and molecular background of salt stress tolerance in plants.
