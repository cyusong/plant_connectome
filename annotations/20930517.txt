Phenotypic plasticity is an adaptive feature of all organisms, which, in land plants, entails changes in orientation of growth (tropism), patterns of development, organ architecture, timing of developmental processes, and resource allocation. However, little is known about the molecular components that integrate exogenous environmental cues with internal hormonal signaling pathways. This addendum describes a role for calcium-regulated calmodulin-binding transcription 1 (CAMTA1) in auxin signaling and stress responses. We discuss possible mechanisms that may underlie this role of CAMTA1, and speculate on the more general roles of CAMTAs in auxin responses and phenotypic plasticity.

CAMTA1: !regulates! Auxin signaling 
CAMTA1: !integrates! Environmental cues 
CAMTA1: !mediates! Stress responses 
CAMTA1: !affects! Phenotypic plasticity
