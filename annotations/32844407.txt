Ozone pollution is a damaging air pollutant that reduces maize yields equivalently to nutrient deficiency, heat, and aridity stress. Therefore, understanding the physiological and biochemical responses of maize to ozone pollution and identifying traits predictive of ozone tolerance is important. In this study, we examined the physiological, biochemical and yield responses of six maize hybrids to elevated ozone in the field using Free Air Ozone Enrichment. Elevated ozone stress reduced photosynthetic capacity, in vivo and in vitro, decreasing Rubisco content, but not activation state. Contrary to our hypotheses, variation in maize hybrid responses to ozone was not associated with stomatal limitation or antioxidant pools in maize. Rather, tolerance to ozone stress in the hybrid B73 × Mo17 was correlated with maintenance of leaf N content. Sensitive lines showed greater ozone-induced senescence and loss of photosynthetic capacity compared to the tolerant line.
