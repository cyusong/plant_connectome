Activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to secondary xylem for wood formation in trees. The transcription factor WUSCHEL-related HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) is a central regulator downstream of the hormone and peptide signaling pathways that maintain cambial activity. However, the genetic regulatory network underlying WOX4-mediated wood formation at the post-transcriptional level remains to be elucidated. In this study, we identified the ubiquitin receptor PagDA1 in hybrid poplar (Populus alba × Populus glandulosa clone 84K) as a negative regulator of wood formation, which restricts cambial activity during secondary growth. Overexpression of PagDA1 in poplar resulted in a relatively reduced xylem due to decreased cambial cell division. By contrast, mutation of PagDA1 by CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in an increased cambial cell activity and promoted xylem formation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that PagDA1 functions antagonistically in a common pathway as PagWOX4 to regulate cambial activity. We propose that PagDA1 physically associates with PagWOX4 and modulates the degradation of PagWOX4 by the 26S proteasome. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed that PagDA1 exerts its negative effect on cambial development by modulating the stability of PagWOX4 in a ubiquitin-dependent manner mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase PagDA2. In sum, we have identified a cambial regulatory protein complex, PagDA1-PagWOX4, as a potential target for wood biomass improvement.
