The architecture of flowering plants exhibits both phenotypic diversity and plasticity, determined, in part, by the number and activity of axillary meristems and, in part, by the growth characteristics of the branches that develop from the axillary buds. The plasticity of shoot branching results from a combination of various intrinsic and genetic elements, such as number and position of nodes and type of growth phase, as well as environmental signals such as nutrient availability, light characteristics, and temperature (Napoli et al., 1998; Bennett and Leyser, 2006; Janssen et al., 2014; Teichmann and Muhr, 2015; Ueda and Yanagisawa, 2019). Axillary meristem initiation and axillary bud outgrowth are controlled by a complex and interconnected regulatory network. Although many of the genes and hormones that modulate branching patterns have been discovered and characterized through genetic and biochemical studies, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the control mechanisms at play. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge of the control of axillary meristem initiation and outgrowth into a branch.
