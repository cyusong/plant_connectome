Herbivore microbial associates can affect diverse interactions between plants and insect herbivores. Some insect symbionts enable herbivores to expand host plant range or to facilitate host plant use by modifying plant physiology. However, little attention has been paid to the role of herbivore-associated microbes in manipulating plant defenses. We have recently shown that Colorado potato beetle secrete the symbiotic bacteria to suppress plant defenses. The bacteria in oral secretions from the beetle hijack defense signaling pathways of host plants and the suppression of induced plant defenses benefits the beetle's performance. While the defense suppression by the beetle-associated bacteria has been investigated in local damaged leaves, little is known about the effects of the symbiotic bacteria on the manipulation of plant defenses in systemic undamaged leaves. Here, we demonstrate that the symbiotic bacteria suppress plant defenses in both local and systemic tissues when plants are attacked by antibiotic-untreated larvae.
