Canopy photosynthesis (A<sub>c</sub> ) describes photosynthesis of an entire crop field and the daily and seasonal integrals of A<sub>c</sub> positively correlate with daily and seasonal biomass production. Much effort in crop breeding has focused on improving canopy architecture and hence light distribution inside the canopy. Here, we develop a new integrated canopy photosynthesis model including canopy architecture, a ray tracing algorithm, and C<sub>3</sub> photosynthetic metabolism to explore the option of manipulating leaf chlorophyll concentration ([Chl]) for greater A<sub>c</sub> and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Model simulation results show that (a) efficiency of photosystem II increased when [Chl] was decreased by decreasing antenna size and (b) the light received by leaves at the bottom layers increased when [Chl] throughout the canopy was decreased. Furthermore, the modelling revealed a modest ~3% increase in A<sub>c</sub> and an ~14% in NUE was accompanied when [Chl] reduced by 60%. However, if the leaf nitrogen conserved by this decrease in leaf [Chl] were to be optimally allocated to other components of photosynthesis, both A<sub>c</sub> and NUE can be increased by over 30%. Optimizing [Chl] coupled with strategic reinvestment of conserved nitrogen is shown to have the potential to support substantial increases in A<sub>c</sub> , biomass production, and crop yields.
