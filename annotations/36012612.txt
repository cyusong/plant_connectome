Spanish fir (<i>Abies pinsapo</i> Boiss.) is an endemic, endangered tree that has been scarcely investigated at the molecular level. In this work, the transcriptome of Spanish fir was assembled, providing a large catalog of expressed genes (22,769), within which a high proportion were full-length transcripts (12,545). This resource is valuable for functional genomics studies and genome annotation in this relict conifer species. Two intraspecific variations of <i>A. pinsapo</i> can be found within its largest population at the <i>Sierra de las Nieves</i> National Park: one with standard green needles and another with bluish-green needles. To elucidate the causes of both phenotypes, we studied different physiological and molecular markers and transcriptome profiles in the needles. "Green" trees showed higher electron transport efficiency and enhanced levels of chlorophyll, protein, and total nitrogen in the needles. In contrast, needles from "bluish" trees exhibited higher contents of carotenoids and cellulose. These results agreed with the differential transcriptomic profiles, suggesting an imbalance in the nitrogen status of "bluish" trees. Additionally, gene expression analyses suggested that these differences could be associated with different epigenomic profiles. Taken together, the reported data provide new transcriptome resources and a better understanding of the natural variation in this tree species, which can help improve guidelines for its conservation and the implementation of adaptive management strategies under climatic change.
