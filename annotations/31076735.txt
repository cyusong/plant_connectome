['31076735', "Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a major mechanism regulating gene  expression in higher eukaryotes. To identify novel players in PTGS, a forward  genetics screen was performed on an Arabidopsis thaliana line overexpressing a  strong growth-repressive gene, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR6 (ERF6). We identified  six independent ethyl-methanesulfonate mutants rescuing the dwarfism of  ERF6-overexpressing plants as a result of transgene silencing. Among the  causative genes, ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE5, SUPERKILLER2 and HASTY1 have previously  been reported to inhibit PTGS. Notably, the three other causative genes have not,  to date, been related to PTGS: UTP:RNA-URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE1 (URT1), C-TERMINAL  DOMAIN PHOSPHATASE-LIKE3 (CPL3) and RESURRECTION1 (RST1). We show that these  genes may participate in protecting the 3' end of transgene transcripts. We  present a model in which URT1, CPL3 and RST1 are classified as PTGS suppressors,  as compromisation of these genes provokes the accumulation of aberrant  transcripts which, in turn, trigger the production of small interfering RNAs,  initiating RNA silencing.", '2019 May', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-019-0419-7', 'ORCID:']
