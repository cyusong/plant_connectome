Dwindling fossil fuel reserves and poor environmental credentials of chemical synthesis means, new renewable sources for the production and manufacture of valuable chemicals and pharmaceuticals are required. Presently, tobacco is an underutilised non-food crop with the potential to act as a biofactory. In this study, metabolite profiling across vegetative development has been carried out to provide a quantitative baseline of metabolites, their formation and interaction. Two tobacco platforms have been used, Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana tabacum. Our data generated has provided the quantitative and qualitative baseline levels for exploitable pathways and metabolites, across two complementary Nicotiana species. N. benthamiana is the chassis of choice for transient expression. The metabolite data obtained for N. benthamiana highlighted that before flower emergence, the increased central carbon metabolism and high amino acid levels are available for the biosynthesis of endogenous or heterologous metabolites. In the future, engineering pathways or biocatalysts into N. benthamiana could add value to the process presently used to produce low volume, high cost pharmaceuticals. Similar outputs were obtained for N. tabacum, which has the advantage of providing a large biomass and hence, high product yield. These data provide an insight into the metabolite pools available in tobacco for future exploitation by emerging New Plant Breeding Techniques.
