Carotenoids are organic pigments that play an important role in both plant coloration and human health; they are a critical subject in molecular breeding due to growing demand for natural molecules in both food and medicine. In this study, we focus upon characterizing <i>BoaCRTISO</i>, the carotenoid isomerase gene before the branch of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, which is expressed in all organs and developmental stages of Chinese kale, and BoaCRTISO, which is located in the chloroplast. The expression of <i>BoaCRTISO</i> is induced by strong light, red and blue combined light, and gibberellic acid treatment, but it is suppressed by darkness and abscisic acid treatment. We obtained <i>BoaCRTISO</i>-silenced plants via virus-induced gene silencing technology, and the silence efficiencies ranged from 52 to 77%. The expressions of most carotenoid and chlorophyll biosynthetic genes in <i>BoaCRTISO</i>-silenced plants were downregulated, and the contents of carotenoids and chlorophyll were reduced. Meanwhile, <i>BoaCRTISO</i>-silenced plants exhibited phenotypes of yellowing leaves and inhibited growth. This functional characterization of <i>BoaCRTISO</i> provides insight for the biosynthesis and regulation of carotenoid in Chinese kale.
