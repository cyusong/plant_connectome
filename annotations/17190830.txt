['17190830', 'CDC48/p97 is an essential AAA-ATPase chaperone that functions in numerous diverse  cellular activities through its interaction with specific adapter proteins. The  ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX)-containing protein, PUX1, functions to regulate the  hexameric structure and ATPase activity of AtCDC48. To characterize the  biochemical mechanism of PUX1 action on AtCDC48, we have defined domains of both  PUX1 and AtCDC48 that are critical for interaction and oligomer disassembly.  Binding of PUX1 to AtCDC48 was mediated through a region containing both the UBX  domain and the immediate C-terminal flanking amino acids (UBX-C). Like other UBX  domains, the primary binding site for the UBX-C of PUX1 is the N(a) domain of  AtCDC48. Alternative plant PUX protein UBX domains also bind AtCDC48 through the  N terminus but were found not to be able to substitute for the action imparted by  the UBX-C of PUX1 in hexamer disassembly, suggesting unique features for the  UBX-C of PUX1. We propose that the PUX1 UBX-C domain modulates a second binding  site on AtCDC48 required for the N-terminal domain of PUX1 to interact with and  promote dissociation of the AtCDC48 hexamer. Utilizing Atcdc48 ATP hydrolysis and  binding mutants, we demonstrate that PUX1 binding was not affected but that  hexamer disassembly was significantly influenced by the ATP status of AtCDC48.  ATPase activity in both the D1 and the D2 domains was critical for PUX1-mediated  AtCDC48 hexamer disassembly. Together these results provide new mechanistic  insight into how the hexameric status and ATPase activity of AtCDC48 are  modulated.', '2007 Feb 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M609042200', 'Bednarek']
