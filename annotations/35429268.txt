The CO2 diffusion conductance within the leaf mesophyll (gm) is considered a major limiting factor of photosynthesis. However, the effects of the major secondary air pollutant ozone (O3) on gm have been poorly investigated. Eight genotypes of the economically important tree species Populus × canadensis Moench were exposed to 120 ppb O3 for 21 d. gm showed a genotype-dependent response to O3-induced oxidative stress and was a major limiting factor of net assimilation rate (Anet), ahead of stomatal conductance to CO2 (gsc) and of the maximum carboxylation capacity of the Rubisco enzyme (Vcmax) in half of the tested genotypes. Increased leaf dry mass per area (LMA) and decreased chlorophyll content were linked to the observed gm decrease, but this relationship did not entirely explain the different genotypic gm responses. Moreover, the oxidative stress defence metabolites ascorbate and glutathione were not related to O3 tolerance of gm. However, malondialdehyde probably mitigated the observed gm decrease in some genotypes due to its oxidative stress signalling function. The large variation of gm suggests different regulation mechanisms amongst poplar genotypes under oxidative stress.
