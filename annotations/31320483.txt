Oxygenic photosynthesis relies on accessory factors to promote the assembly and maintenance of the photosynthetic apparatus in the thylakoid membranes. The highly conserved membrane-bound rubredoxin-like protein RubA has previously been implicated in the accumulation of both PSI and PSII, but its mode of action remains unclear. Here, we show that RubA in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp PCC 6803 is required for photoautotrophic growth in fluctuating light and acts early in PSII biogenesis by promoting the formation of the heterodimeric D1/D2 reaction center complex, the site of primary photochemistry. We find that RubA, like the accessory factor Ycf48, is a component of the initial D1 assembly module as well as larger PSII assembly intermediates and that the redox-responsive rubredoxin-like domain is located on the cytoplasmic surface of PSII complexes. Fusion of RubA to Ycf48 still permits normal PSII assembly, suggesting a spatiotemporal proximity of both proteins during their action. RubA is also important for the accumulation of PSI, but this is an indirect effect stemming from the downregulation of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis induced by PSII deficiency. Overall, our data support the involvement of RubA in the redox control of PSII biogenesis.
