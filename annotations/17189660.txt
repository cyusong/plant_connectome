In prior studies we learned that colonization of soil can be as important as colonization of roots in determining mycorrhizal influence on the water relations of host plants. Here we use a path analysis modeling approach to test (a) whether quantity of hyphae in soil contributes to variations in stomatal behavior and soil drying, and (b) whether soil colonization or root colonization has a stronger influence on these stomatal and soil drying responses. Experiments were performed on Sorghum bicolor and Cucurbita pepo, with soils and roots colonized by a mixture of Glomus intraradices and Gigaspora margarita. Soil colonization generally made more significant contributions to stomatal conductance than did root colonization. Soil colonization did not make significant direct contributions to soil water potential measures (soil water potential at stomatal closure or soil drying rate), whereas root colonization did contribute a potentially important path to each. The findings further support a role for mycorrhization of the soil itself in contributing to the regulation of stomatal behavior of host plants.
