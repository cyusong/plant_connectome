['16914145', 'Glucan, water dikinase (GWD) and phosphoglucan, water dikinase (PWD) are required  for normal starch metabolism. We analysed starch phosphorylation in Arabidopsis  wild-type plants and mutants lacking either GWD or PWD using (31)P NMR.  Phosphorylation at both C6- and C3-positions of glucose moieties in starch was  drastically decreased in GWD-deficient mutants. In starch from PWD-deficient  plants C3-bound phosphate was reduced to levels close to the detection limit. The  latter result contrasts with previous reports according to which GWD  phosphorylates both C6- and C3-positions. In these studies, phosphorylation had  been analysed by HPLC of acid-hydrolysed glucans. We now show that  maltose-6-phosphate, a product of incomplete starch hydrolysis, co-eluted with  glucose-3-phosphate under the chromatographic conditions applied. Re-examination  of the specificity of the dikinases using an improved method demonstrates that  C6- and C3-phosphorylation is selectively catalysed by GWD and PWD, respectively.', '2006 Sep 4', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.07.085', 'Steup']
