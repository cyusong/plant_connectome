Whether photosynthesis has improved with increasing yield in major crops remains controversial. Research in this area has often neglected to account for differences in light intensity experienced by cultivars released in different years. Light intensity is expected to be positively associated with photosynthetic capacity and the resistance of the photosynthetic apparatus to high light but negatively associated with light-utilization efficiency under low light. Here, we analyzed the light environment, photosynthetic activity, and protein components of leaves of 26 winter wheat cultivars released during the past 60 years in China. Over time, light levels on flag leaves significantly decreased due to architectural changes, but photosynthetic rates under high or low light and the resistance of the photosynthetic apparatus to high light remained steady, contrary to expectations. We propose that the difference between the actual and expected trends is due to breeding. Specifically, breeding has optimized photosynthetic performance under high light rather than low light. Moreover, breeding selectivity altered the stoichiometry of several proteins related to dynamic photosynthesis, canopy light distribution, and photoprotection. These results indicate that breeding has significantly altered the photosynthetic mechanism in wheat and its response to the light environment. These changes likely have helped increase wheat yields.
