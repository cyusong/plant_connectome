Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) disease or citrus greening is caused by <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus (Las) and is the most devastating disease in the global citrus industry. Salicylic acid (SA) plays a central role in regulating plant defenses against pathogenic attack. SA methyltransferase (SAMT) modulates SA homeostasis by converting SA to methyl salicylate (MeSA). Here, we report on the functions of the citrus <i>SAMT</i> (<i>CsSAMT1</i>) gene from HLB-susceptible Wanjincheng orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i> (L.) Osbeck) in plant defenses against Las infection. The <i>CsSAMT1</i> cDNA was expressed in yeast. Using in vitro enzyme assays, yeast expressing CsSAMT1 was confirmed to specifically catalyze the formation of MeSA using SA as a substrate. Transgenic Wanjincheng orange plants overexpressing <i>CsSAMT1</i> had significantly increased levels of SA and MeSA compared to wild-type controls. HLB resistance was evaluated for two years and showed that transgenic plants displayed significantly alleviated symptoms including a lack of chlorosis, low bacterial counts, reduced hyperplasia of the phloem cells, and lower levels of starch and callose compared to wild-type plants. These data confirmed that <i>CsSAMT1</i> overexpression confers an enhanced tolerance to Las in citrus fruits. RNA-seq analysis revealed that <i>CsSAMT1</i> overexpression significantly upregulated the citrus defense response by enhancing the transcription of disease resistance genes. This study provides insight for improving host resistance to HLB by manipulation of SA signaling in citrus fruits.
