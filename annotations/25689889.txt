['25689889', 'AtSFT12, an Arabidopsis Qc-SNARE protein, is localized to Golgi organelles and is  involved in salt and osmotic stress responses via accumulation of Na (+) in  vacuoles. To reduce the detrimental effects of environmental stresses, plants  have evolved many defense mechanisms. Here, we identified an Arabidopsis Qc-SNARE  gene, AtSFT12, involved in salt and osmotic stress responses using an  activation-tagging method. Both activation-tagged plants and overexpressing  transgenic plants (OXs) of the AtSFT12 gene were tolerant to high concentrations  of NaCl, LiCl, and mannitol, whereas loss-of-function mutants were sensitive to  NaCl, LiCl, and mannitol. AtSFT12 transcription increased under NaCl, ABA, cold,  and mannitol stresses but not MV treatment. GFP-fusion AtSFT12 protein was  juxtaposed with Golgi marker, implying that its function is associated with  Golgi-mediated transport. Quantitative measurement of Na(+) using induced coupled  plasma atomic emission spectroscopy revealed that AtSFT12 OXs accumulated  significantly more Na(+) than WT plants. In addition, Na(+)-dependent  fluorescence analysis of Sodium Green showed comparatively higher Na(+)  accumulation in vacuoles of AtSFT12 OX cells than in those of WT plant cells  after salt treatments. Taken together, our findings suggest that AtSTF12, a Golgi  Qc-SNARE protein, plays an important role in salt and osmotic stress responses  and functions in the salt stress response via sequestration of Na(+) in vacuoles.', '2015 Jul', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-015-1771-3', 'Moon']
