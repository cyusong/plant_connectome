['26643131', 'Flowering is crucial for achieving reproductive success. A large number of  well-delineated factors affecting flowering are involved in complex genetic  networks in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the underlying part played by the WRKY  transcription factors in this process is not yet clear. Here, we report that  WRKY71 is able to accelerate flowering in Arabidopsis. An activation-tagged  mutant WRKY71-1D and a constitutive over-expresser of WRKY71 both flowered  earlier than the wild type (WT). In contrast, both the RNA interference-based  multiple WRKY knock-out mutant (w71w8 + 28RNAi) and the dominant repression line  (W71-SRDX) flowered later. Gene expression analysis showed that the transcript  abundance of the flowering time integrator gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and the  floral meristem identity genes LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1) and FRUITFULL (FUL)  were greater in WRKY71-1D than in the WT, but lower in w71w8 + 28RNAi and  W71-SRDX. Further, WRKY71 was shown to bind to the W-boxes in the FT and LFY  promoters in vitro and in vivo. The suggestion is that WRKY71 activity hastens  flowering via the direct activation of FT and LFY.', '2016 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13092', 'Xiang']
