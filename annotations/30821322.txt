There is increasing evidence that the chaperone-like protein CDC48 (cell division cycle 48) plays a role in plant immunity. Cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (cAPX), which is a major regulator of the redox status of plant cells, has previously been shown to interact with CDC48. In this study, we examined the regulation of cAPX by the ATPase NtCDC48 during the cryptogein-induced immune response in tobacco cells. Our results not only confirmed the interaction between the proteins but also showed that it occurs in the cytosol. cAPX accumulation was modified in cells overexpressing NtCDC48, a process that was shown to involve post-translational modification of cAPX. In addition, cryptogein-induced increases in cAPX activity were suppressed in cells overexpressing NtCDC48 and the abundance of the cAPX dimer was below the level of detection. Furthermore, the levels of both reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the GSH/GSSG ratio decreased more rapidly in response to the elicitor in these cells than in controls. A decrease in cAPX activity was also observed in response to heat shock in the cells overexpressing NtCDC48, indicating that the regulation of cAPX by NtCDC48 is not specific to the immune response.
