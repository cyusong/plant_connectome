The methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) and the mevalonate pathways are the unique synthesis routes for the precursors of all isoprenoids. An original mean to measure the carbon flux through the MEP pathway in plants is proposed by using cadmium as a total short-term inhibitor of 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEcDP) reductase (GcpE) and measuring the accumulation rate of its substrate MEcDP by (31) P-NMR spectroscopy. The MEP pathway metabolic flux was determined in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), pea (Pisum sativum), Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium) and boxwood (Buxus sempervirens) leaves. In spinach, flux values were compared with the synthesis rate of major isoprenoids. The flux increases with light intensity (fourfold in the 200-1200 µmol m(-2) s(-1) PPFR range) and temperature (sevenfold in the 25-37 °C range). The relationship with the light and the temperature dependency of isoprenoid production downstream of the MEP pathway is discussed.
