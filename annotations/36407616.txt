The WUSCHEL (WUS)-related homeobox (<i>WOX</i>) gene family plays a crucial role in stem cell maintenance, apical meristem formation, embryonic development, and various other developmental processes. However, the identification and function of <i>WOX</i> genes have not been reported in perennial loquat. In this study, 18 <i>EjWOX</i> genes were identified in the loquat genome. Chromosomal localization analysis showed that 18 <i>EjWOX</i> genes were located on 12 of 17 chromosomes. Gene structure analysis showed that all <i>EjWOX</i> genes contain introns, of which 11 <i>EjWOX</i> genes contain untranslated regions. There are 8 pairs of segmental duplication genes and 0 pairs of tandem duplication genes in the loquat <i>WOX</i> family, suggesting that segmental duplications might be the main reason for the expansion of the loquat <i>WOX</i> family. A <i>WOX</i> transcription factor gene named <i>EjWUSa</i> was isolated from loquat. The EjWUSa protein was localized in the nucleus. Protein interactions between EjWUSa with EjWUSa and EjSTM were verified. Compared with wild-type <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the <i>35S::EjWUSa</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed early flowering. Our study provides an important basis for further research on the function of <i>EjWOX</i> genes and facilitates the molecular breeding of loquat early-flowering varieties.
