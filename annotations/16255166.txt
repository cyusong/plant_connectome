The activity of enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) was investigated in two diazotrophic cyanobacteria, Anabaena sp. (ARM 629) and Nostoc calcicola, in the presence of CO2/NaHCO3 and different inhibitors. The CA activity increased when the cells were pretreated with a high concentration of CO2/NaHCO3 and then transferred to ambient level CO2. Maximum activity of CA was observed after 8 h of incubation in light on transfer of cells from high Ci to ambient level CO2, and was low when incubated in dark. Addition of the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU brought about a differential reduction in CA activity, depending on the carbon source (NaHCO3/CO2). CA inhibitors--ethoxyzolamide (EZ) and acetazolamide (AZ)--inhibited the enzyme activity in both the genera, but the extent of inhibition was greater in Anabaena sp. than in N. calcicola. Such a variation in extent of inhibition/stimulation of CA activity being different in the two genera reflects differences in their inherent potential and genetic background. The relevance of such cyanobacterial strains as CO2 sinks is also discussed.

CO2/NaHCO3: !increases! CA activity 
DCMU: !inhibits! CA activity 
EZ/AZ: !inhibits! CA activity 
Anabaena sp./N. calcicola: !differ in! extent of inhibition/stimulation of CA activity
