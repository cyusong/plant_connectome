Species of <i>Alternaria</i> (phylum Ascomycota, family Pleosporaceae) are known as serious plant pathogens, causing major losses on a wide range of crops. <i>Alternaria atra</i> (previously known as <i>Ulocladium atrum</i>) can grow as a saprophyte on many hosts and causes Ulocladium blight on potato. It has been reported that it can also be used as a biocontrol agent against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Here, we present a scaffold-level reference genome assembly for <i>A. atra.</i> The assembly contains 43 scaffolds with a total length of 39.62 Mbp, with scaffold N<sub>50</sub> of 3,893,166 bp, L<sub>50</sub> of 4, and the longest 10 scaffolds containing 89.9% of the assembled data. RNA<i>-</i>sequencing-guided gene prediction using BRAKER resulted in 12,173 protein-coding genes with their functional annotation. This first high-quality reference genome assembly and annotation for <i>A. atra</i> can be used as a resource for studying evolution in the highly complicated <i>Alternaria</i> genus and might help in understanding the mechanisms defining its role as pathogen or biocontrol agent.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
