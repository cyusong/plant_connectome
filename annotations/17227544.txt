['17227544', 'Homologous recombination (HR) is an essential process in maintaining genome  integrity and variability. In eukaryotes, the Rad52 epistasis group proteins are  involved in meiotic recombination and/or HR repair. One member of this group,  Rad54, belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-stimulated ATPases. Recent studies  indicate that Rad54 has important functions in HR, both as a chromatin  remodelling factor and as a mediator of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament. Despite  the importance of Rad54 in HR, no study of Rad54 from plants has yet been  performed. Here, we cloned the full-length AtRAD54 cDNA sequence; an open reading  frame of 910 amino acids encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of  101.9 kDa. Western blotting analysis showed that the AtRad54 protein was indeed  expressed as a protein of approximately 110 kDa in Arabidopsis. The predicted  protein sequence of AtRAD54 contains seven helicase domains, which are conserved  in all other Rad54s. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed an interaction between  Arabidopsis Rad51 and Rad54. AtRAD54 transcripts were found in all tissues  examined, with the highest levels of expression in flower buds. Expression of  AtRAD54 was induced by gamma-irradiation. A T-DNA insertion mutant of AtRAD54  devoid of full-length AtRAD54 expression was viable and fertile; however, it  showed increased sensitivity to gamma-irradiation and the cross-linking reagent  cisplatin. In addition, the efficiency of somatic HR in the mutant plants was  reduced relative to that in wild-type plants. Our findings point to an important  role for Rad54 in HR repair in higher plants.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02927.x', 'Toki']
