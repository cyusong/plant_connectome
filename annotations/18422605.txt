['18422605', 'We identified an embryo yellow (eye) mutation in Arabidopsis that leads to the  abnormal coloration and morphology of embryos. The eye mutant formed bushy  plants, with aberrant organization of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and  unexpanded leaves with irregular phyllotaxy. The epidermal cells of the eye  mutant were much smaller than that of the wild-type. Thus, EYE is required for  expansion of cells and organs, and for formation of the organized SAM.  Hydrophobic layers of epidermal cells were also disrupted, suggesting that EYE  might be involved in the generation of the extra-cellular matrix. The mutated  gene encoded a protein that is homologous to Cog7, a subunit of the conserved  oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, which is required for the normal morphology and  function of the Golgi appratus. The eye mutation caused mislocalization of a  Golgi protein. In addition, the size of the Golgi apparatus was also altered.  Thus, EYE might be involved in transport or retention of Golgi-localized proteins  and in maintenance of Golgi morphology. We propose that some Golgi-localized  proteins, distributions of which are controlled by EYE, play important roles in  expansion of cells and organs, and in formation of the properly organized SAM in  plants.', '2008 Jun', 'Genes Cells', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2008.01186.x', 'Machida']
