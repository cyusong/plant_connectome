['26071531', 'Lateral organ boundary formation is highly regulated by transcription factors and  hormones such as auxins and brassinosteroids. However, in contrast to many other  developmental processes in plants, no role for signalling peptides in the  regulation of this process has been reported yet. The first characterization of  the secreted cysteine-rich TAXIMIN (TAX) signalling peptides in Arabidopsis is  presented here. TAX1 overexpression resulted in minor alterations in the primary  shoot and root metabolome, abnormal fruit morphology, and fusion of the base of  cauline leaves to stems forming a decurrent leaf attachment. The phenotypes at  the paraclade junction match TAX1 promoter activity in this region and are  similar to loss of LATERAL ORGAN FUSION (LOF) transcription factor function.  Nevertheless, TAX1 expression was unchanged in lof1lof2 paraclade junctions and,  conversely, LOF gene expression was unchanged in TAX1 overexpressing plants,  suggesting TAX1 may act independently. This study identifies TAX1 as the first  plant signalling peptide influencing lateral organ separation and implicates the  existence of a peptide signal cascade regulating this process in Arabidopsis.', '2015 Aug', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erv291', 'Pauwels']
