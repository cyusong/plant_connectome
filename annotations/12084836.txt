['12084836', 'The chloroplastic drought-induced stress protein of 32 kD (CDSP32) is composed of  two thioredoxin modules and is induced by environmental and oxidative stress  conditions. We investigated whether the plastidic protein BAS1, which is related  to eubacterial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, is a target for CDSP32. Using a CDSP32  active-site mutant, we showed that the BAS1 and CDSP32 proteins form a mixed  disulfide complex in vitro. Moreover, affinity chromatography indicated that BAS1  is a major target for CDSP32 in chloroplasts. CDSP32 was able to reduce BAS1 in  vitro, and BAS1 displayed CDSP32-dependent peroxidase activity. The function of  CDSP32 was investigated in transgenic potato lines without detectable levels of  the protein as a result of cosuppression. Under conditions of photooxidative  stress induced by incubation with either methyl viologen or t-butyl hydroperoxide  or by exposure to low temperature under high light, plants lacking CDSP32  exhibited decreased maximal photosystem II photochemical efficiencies compared  with the wild type and transgenic controls. In addition, plants without CDSP32  retained much less chlorophyll than controls under stress, indicating increased  damage to photosynthetic membranes. We conclude that CDSP32 is a thioredoxin with  a critical role in plastid defense against oxidative damage and that this role is  related to its function as a physiological electron donor to the BAS1  peroxiredoxin.', '2002 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.001644', 'Rey']
