RNA interference (RNAi) enables flexible and dynamic interrogation of entire gene families or essential genes without the need for exogenous proteins, unlike CRISPR-Cas technology. Unfortunately, isolation of plants undergoing potent gene silencing requires laborious design, visual screening, and physical separation for downstream characterization. Here, we developed an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APT)-based RNAi technology (APTi) in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> that improves upon the multiple limitations of current RNAi techniques. APTi exploits the prosurvival output of transiently silencing <i>APT</i> in the presence of 2-fluoroadenine, thereby establishing survival itself as a reporter of RNAi. To maximize the silencing efficacy of gene targets, we created vectors that facilitate insertion of any gene target sequence in tandem with the APT silencing motif. We tested the efficacy of APTi with two gene families, the actin-dependent motor, myosin XI (a,b), and the putative chitin receptor Lyk5 (a,b,c). The APTi approach resulted in a homogenous population of transient <i>P. patens</i> mutants specific for our gene targets with zero surviving background plants within 8 d. The observed mutants directly corresponded to a maximal 93% reduction of myosin XI protein and complete loss of chitin-induced calcium spiking in the Lyk5-RNAi background. The positive selection nature of APTi represents a fundamental improvement in RNAi technology and will contribute to the growing demand for technologies amenable to high-throughput phenotyping.
