Climacteric ripening of tomato fruit is initiated by a characteristic surge of the production rate of ethylene, accompanied by an increase in respiration rate. As both activities consume O<sub>2</sub> and produce CO<sub>2</sub> , gas concentration gradients develop in the fruit that cause diffusive transport. This may, in turn, affect respiration and ethylene biosynthesis. Gas diffusion in fruit depends on the amount and connectivity of cells and intercellular spaces in 3D. We investigated micromorphological changes in different tomato tissues during development and ripening by visualizing cells and pores based on high-resolution micro-computed tomography, and computed effective O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity coefficients based on microstructural features of the tissues. We demonstrated that mesocarp and septa tissues have larger cells but small and more disconnected pores than the placenta and columella, resulting in relatively lower effective O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity coefficients. Cell disintegration occurred in the mesocarp and septa during ripening, indicating lysigenous air pore formation and resulting in a gradual increase of the effective O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity. The results suggest that hypoxic conditions caused by the increasing size and, hence, diffusion resistance of the growing fruit may induce an increase of tissue porosity that results in a greatly enhanced O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity and, thus, helps to alleviate them.
