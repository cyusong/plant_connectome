The marine environment has unique properties of light transmission, with an attenuation of long wavelengths within the first meters of the water column. Marine organisms have therefore evolved specific blue-light receptors such as aureochromes to absorb shorter-wavelength light. Here, we identify and characterize a light, oxygen, or voltage sensing (LOV) containing histidine kinase (LOV-HK) that functions as a new class of eukaryotic blue-light receptor in the pico-phytoplanktonic cell Ostreococcus tauri. This LOV-HK is related to the large family of LOV-HKs found in prokaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the LOV domains from LOV-HKs, including O. tauri LOV-HK, and phototropins (phot; plant and green algal LOV serine/threonine kinases) have different evolutionary histories. Photochemical analysis shows that the LOV domain of LOV-HK binds a flavin cofactor and absorbs blue light with a fast photocycle compared with its prokaryotic counterparts. Ostreococcus tauri LOV-HK expression is induced by blue light and is under circadian control. Further, both overexpression and downregulation of LOV-HK result in arrhythmia of the circadian reporter CCA1:Luc under constant blue light. In contrast, photochemical inactivation of O. tauri LOV-HK is without effect, demonstrating its importance for function of the circadian clock under blue light. Overexpression/downregulation of O. tauriLOV-HK alters CCA1 rhythmicity under constant red light, irrespective of LOV-HK's photochemical reactivity, suggesting that O. tauri LOV-HK also participates in regulation of the circadian clock independent of its blue-light-sensing property. Molecular characterization of O. tauri LOV-HK demonstrates that this type of photoreceptor family is not limited to prokaryotes.
