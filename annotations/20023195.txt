['20023195', 'In eukaryotes, class I alpha-mannosidases are involved in early N-glycan  processing reactions and in N-glycan-dependent quality control in the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER). To investigate the role of these enzymes in plants, we identified  the ER-type alpha-mannosidase I (MNS3) and the two Golgi-alpha-mannosidase I  proteins (MNS1 and MNS2) from Arabidopsis thaliana. All three MNS proteins were  found to localize in punctate mobile structures reminiscent of Golgi bodies.  Recombinant forms of the MNS proteins were able to process oligomannosidic  N-glycans. While MNS3 efficiently cleaved off one selected alpha1,2-mannose  residue from Man(9)GlcNAc(2), MNS1/2 readily removed three alpha1,2-mannose  residues from Man(8)GlcNAc(2). Mutation in the MNS genes resulted in the  formation of aberrant N-glycans in the mns3 single mutant and Man(8)GlcNAc(2)  accumulation in the mns1 mns2 double mutant. N-glycan analysis in the mns triple  mutant revealed the almost exclusive presence of Man(9)GlcNAc(2), demonstrating  that these three MNS proteins play a key role in N-glycan processing. The mns  triple mutants displayed short, radially swollen roots and altered cell walls.  Pharmacological inhibition of class I alpha-mannosidases in wild-type seedlings  resulted in a similar root phenotype. These findings show that class I  alpha-mannosidases are essential for early N-glycan processing and play a role in  root development and cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.072363', 'Strasser']
