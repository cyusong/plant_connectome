The quality and quantity of mulberry leaves are often affected by various environmental factors. The plant NPR1 and its homologous genes are important for plant systemic acquired resistance. Here, the full-length cDNAs encoding the NPR1 and NPR4 genes (designated MuNPR1 and MuNPR4, respectively) were isolated from Morus multicaulis. Sequence analysis of the amino acids and protein modeling of the MuNPR1 and MuNPR4 proteins showed that MuNPR1 shares some conserved characteristics with its homolog MuNPR4. MuNPR1 was shown to have different expression patterns than MuNPR4 in mulberry plants. Interestingly, MuNPR1 or MuNPR4 transgenic Arabidopsis produced an early flowering phenotype, and the expression of the pathogenesis-related 1a gene was promoted in MuNPR1 transgenic Arabidopsis. The MuNPR1 transgenic plants showed more resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst. DC3000) than did the wild-type Arabidopsis. Moreover, the ectopic expression of MuNPR1 might lead to enhanced scavenging ability and suppress collase accumulation. In contrast, the MuNPR4 transgenic Arabidopsis were hypersensitive to Pst. DC3000 infection. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic expression of either MuNPR1 or MuNPR4 showed sensitivity to salt and drought stresses. Our data suggest that both the MuNPR1 and MuNPR4 genes play a role in the coordination between signaling pathways, and the information provided here enables the in-depth functional analysis of the MuNPR1 and MuNPR4 genes and may promote mulberry resistance breeding in the future.
