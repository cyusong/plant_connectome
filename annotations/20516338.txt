['20516338', 'Ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10) proteins are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom.  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has three RPL10 genes encoding RPL10A to  RPL10C proteins, while two genes are present in the maize (Zea mays) genome  (rpl10-1 and rpl10-2). Maize and Arabidopsis RPL10s are tissue-specific and  developmentally regulated, showing high levels of expression in tissues with  active cell division. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that RPL10s in  Arabidopsis associate with translation proteins, demonstrating that it is a  component of the 80S ribosome. Previously, ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure was  shown to increase the expression of a number of maize ribosomal protein genes,  including rpl10. In this work, we demonstrate that maize rpl10 genes are induced  by UV-B while Arabidopsis RPL10s are differentially regulated by this radiation:  RPL10A is not UV-B regulated, RPL10B is down-regulated, while RPL10C is  up-regulated by UV-B in all organs studied. Characterization of Arabidopsis T-DNA  insertional mutants indicates that RPL10 genes are not functionally equivalent.  rpl10A and rpl10B mutant plants show different phenotypes: knockout rpl10A  mutants are lethal, rpl10A heterozygous plants are deficient in translation under  UV-B conditions, and knockdown homozygous rpl10B mutants show abnormal growth.  Based on the results described here, RPL10 genes are not redundant and  participate in development and translation under UV-B stress.', '2010 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.157057', 'Casati']
