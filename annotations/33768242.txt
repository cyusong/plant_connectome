Components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRTs) were first identified in a genetic screen in budding yeast as factors interfering with vacuolar protein sorting. In the last three decades, intensive studies have revealed the subunit composition of ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, ESCRT-III, their structure, the assembling mechanisms and their molecular and physiological functions. In plants, ESCRTs are essential for development, growth and stress responses. ESCRTs are best known for their function in endosomal trafficking, during which they are required for sorting ubiquitylated membrane proteins into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). The formation of ILVs requires the function of ESCRT-III, which has been shown to mediate the membrane scission. Although the function of plant ESCRTs has been predominantly discussed in the context of endosomal trafficking, recent studies in other model organisms revealed a versatile role of ESCRTs in diverse cellular events with broad physiological implications. The non-endosomal functions of ESCRTs include cytokinesis, viral budding, autophagy, nuclear envelope reformation and membrane repair, although many of these have not yet been studied in plants. In this review, recent findings on non-endosomal ESCRT functions in plant, yeast and animals are highlighted and discussed.
