Tomato is subject to several diseases that affect both field- and greenhouse-grown crops. To select cost-effective potential biocontrol agents, we used laboratory throughput screening to identify bacterial strains with versatile characteristics suitable for multipurpose uses. The natural diversity of tomato root-associated bacterial communities was bioprospected under a real-world environment represented by an intensive tomato cultivation area characterized by extraseasonal productions in the greenhouse. Approximately 400 tomato root-associated bacterial isolates, in majority Gram-negative bacteria, were isolated from three compartments: the soil close to the root surface (rhizosphere, R), the root surface (rhizoplane, RP), and the root interior (endorhizosphere, E). A total of 33% of the isolates produced siderophores and were able to solubilize phosphates and grow on NA with 8% NaCl. A total of 30% of the root-associated bacteria showed antagonistic activity against all the tomato pathogens tested, i.e., <i>Clavibacter michiganesis</i> pv. <i>michiganensis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i>, <i>Pseudomonas corrugata</i> and <i>Xanthomonas euvesicatoria</i> pv. <i>perforans</i>, and <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i>. We found that the sampling site rather than the root compartment of isolation influenced bacterial composition in terms of analyzed phenotype. This was demonstrated through a diversity analysis including general characteristics and PGPR traits, as well as biocontrol activity <i>in vitro</i>. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequencing of 77 culturable endophytic bacteria that shared multiple beneficial activity revealed a predominance of bacteria in Bacillales, Enterobacteriales, and Pseudomonadales. Their <i>in vitro</i> antagonistic activity showed that <i>Bacillus</i> species were significantly more active than the isolates in the other taxonomic group. <i>In planta</i> activity against phytopathogenic bacteria of a subset of <i>Bacillus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates was also assessed.
