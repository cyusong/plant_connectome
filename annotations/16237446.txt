['16237446', 'Illumination changes elicit modifications of thylakoid proteins and  reorganization of the photosynthetic machinery. This involves, in the short term,  phosphorylation of photosystem II (PSII) and light-harvesting (LHCII) proteins.  PSII phosphorylation is thought to be relevant for PSII turnover, whereas LHCII  phosphorylation is associated with the relocation of LHCII and the redistribution  of excitation energy (state transitions) between photosystems. In the long term,  imbalances in energy distribution between photosystems are counteracted by  adjusting photosystem stoichiometry. In the green alga Chlamydomonas and the  plant Arabidopsis, state transitions require the orthologous protein kinases STT7  and STN7, respectively. Here we show that in Arabidopsis a second protein kinase,  STN8, is required for the quantitative phosphorylation of PSII core proteins.  However, PSII activity under high-intensity light is affected only slightly in  stn8 mutants, and D1 turnover is indistinguishable from the wild type, implying  that reversible protein phosphorylation is not essential for PSII repair.  Acclimation to changes in light quality is defective in stn7 but not in stn8  mutants, indicating that short-term and long-term photosynthetic adaptations are  coupled. Therefore the phosphorylation of LHCII, or of an unknown substrate of  STN7, is also crucial for the control of photosynthetic gene expression.', '2005 Oct 20', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature04016', 'Leister']
