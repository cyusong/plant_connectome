Stripe rust (caused by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i>) is one of the most severe diseases affecting wheat production. The disease is best controlled by developing and growing resistant cultivars. Chinese wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) landraces have excellent resistance to stripe rust. The objectives of this study were to identify wheat landraces with stable resistance and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to stripe rust from 271 Chinese wheat landraces using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach. The landraces were phenotyped for stripe rust responses at the seedling stage with two predominant Chinese races of <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> in a greenhouse and the adult-plant stage in four field environments and genotyped using the 660K wheat single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Thirteen landraces with stable resistance were identified, and 17 QTL, including eight associated to all-stage resistance and nine to adult-plant resistance, were mapped on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2D, 3A, 3B, 5A, 5B, 6D, and 7A. These QTL explained 6.06-16.46% of the phenotypic variation. Five of the QTL, <i>QYrCL.sicau-3AL</i>, <i>QYrCL.sicau-3B.4</i>, <i>QYrCL.sicau-3B.5</i>, <i>QYrCL.sicau-5AL.1</i> and <i>QYrCL.sicau-7AL</i>, were likely new. Five Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers for four of the QTL were converted from the significant SNP markers. The identified wheat landraces with stable resistance to stripe rust, significant QTL, and KASP markers should be useful for breeding wheat cultivars with durable resistance to stripe rust.
