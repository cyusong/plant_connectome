Plant genotype strongly affects disease resistance, and also influences the composition of the leaf microbiome. However, these processes have not been studied and linked in the microevolutionary context of breeding for improved disease resistance. We hypothesised that broad-spectrum disease resistance alleles also affect colonisation by nonpathogenic symbionts. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to multiple fungal pathogens were introgressed into a disease-susceptible maize inbred line. Bacterial and fungal leaf microbiomes of the resulting near-isogenic lines were compared with the microbiome of the disease-susceptible parent line at two time points in multiple fields. Introgression of QTL from disease-resistant lines strongly shifted the relative abundance of diverse fungal and bacterial taxa in both 3-wk-old and 7-wk-old plants. Nevertheless, the effects on overall community structure and diversity were minor and varied among fields and years. Contrary to our expectations, host genotype effects were not any stronger in fields with high disease pressure than in uninfected fields, and microbiome succession over time was similar in heavily infected and uninfected plants. These results show that introgressed QTL can greatly improve broad-spectrum disease resistance while having only limited and inconsistent pleiotropic effects on the leaf microbiome in maize.
