['9488692', 'An Arabidopsis cDNA (AtRPB15.9) that encoded a protein related to the RPB4  subunit in yeast RNA polymerase II was cloned. The predicted molecular mass of  15.9 kDa for the AtRPB15.9 protein was significantly smaller than 25 kDa for  yeast RBP4. In SDS-PAGE, AtRPB15.9 migrated as the seventh or eighth largest  subunit (i.e. apparent molecular mass of 14-15 kDa) in Arabidopsis RNA polymerase  II, whereas RPB4 migrates as the fourth largest subunit (i.e. apparent molecular  mass of 32 kDa) in yeast RNA polymerase II. Unlike yeast RPB4 and RPB7, which  dissociate from RNA polymerase II under mildly denaturing conditions, plant  subunits related to RPB4 and RPB7 are more stably associated with the enzyme.  Recombinant AtRPB15.9 formed stable complexes with AtRPB19.5 (i.e. a subunit  related to yeast RPB7) in vitro as did recombinant yeast RPB4 and RPB7 subunits.  Stable heterodimers were also formed between AtRPB15. 9 and yeast RPB7 and  between yeast RPB4 and AtRPB19.5.', '1998 Mar 6', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.273.10.5631', 'Guilfoyle']
