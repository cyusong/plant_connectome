['20097790', 'Thylakoids are the chloroplast internal membrane systems that house  light-harvesting and electron transport reactions. Despite the important  functions and well-studied constituents of thylakoids, the molecular mechanism of  their development remains largely elusive. A recent genetic study has  demonstrated that plastidic type I signal peptidase 1 (Plsp1) is vital for proper  thylakoid development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) chloroplasts. Plsp1  was also shown to be necessary for processing of an envelope protein, Toc75, and  a thylakoid lumenal protein, OE33; however, the relevance of the protein  maturation in both of the two distinct subcompartments for proper chloroplast  development remained unknown. Here, we conducted an extensive analysis of the  plsp1-null mutant to address the significance of lumenal protein maturation in  thylakoid development. Plastids that lack Plsp1 were found to accumulate vesicles  of variable sizes in the stroma. Analyses of the mutant plastids revealed that  the lack of Plsp1 causes a reduction in accumulation of thylakoid proteins and  that Plsp1 is involved in maturation of two additional lumenal proteins, OE23 and  plastocyanin. Further immunoblotting and electron microscopy immunolocalization  studies showed that OE33 associates with the stromal vesicles of the mutant  plastids. Finally, we used a genetic complementation system to demonstrate that  accumulation of improperly processed forms of Toc75 in the plastid envelope does  not disrupt normal plant development. These results suggest that proper  maturation of lumenal proteins may be a key process for correct assembly of  thylakoids.', '2010 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.151977', 'Inoue']
