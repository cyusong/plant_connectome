['35163496', 'CCCH zinc finger proteins are a large protein family and are classified as either  tandem CCCH zinc finger (TZF) or non-TZF proteins. The roles of TZF genes in  several plants have been well determined, whereas the functions of many non-TZF  genes in plants remain uncharacterized. Herein, we describe biological and  molecular functions of AtC3H12, an Arabidopsis non-TZF protein containing three  CCCH zinc finger motifs. AtC3H12 has orthologs in several plant species but has  no paralog in Arabidopsis. AtC3H12-overexpressing transgenic plants (OXs)  germinated slower than wild-type (WT) plants, whereas atc3h12 mutants germinated  faster than WT plants. The fresh weight (FW) and primary root lengths of AtC3H12  OX seedlings were lighter and shorter than those of WT seedlings, respectively.  In contrast, FW and primary root lengths of atc3h12 seedlings were heavier and  longer than those of WT seedlings, respectively. AtC3H12 was localized in the  nucleus and displayed transactivation activity in both yeast and Arabidopsis. We  found that the 97-197 aa region of AtC3H12 is an important part for its  transactivation activity. Detection of expression levels and analysis of  Arabidopsis transgenic plants harboring a P(AtC3H12)::GUS construct showed that  AtC3H12 expression increases as the Arabidopsis seedlings develop. Taken  together, our results demonstrate that AtC3H12 negatively affects seed  germination and seedling development as a nuclear transcriptional activator in  Arabidopsis. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that non-TZF  proteins negatively affect plant development as nuclear transcriptional  activators.', '2022 Jan 29', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms23031572', 'ORCID:']
