As a multigenic trait, rice tillering can optimize plant architecture for the maximum agronomic yield. SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE14 (OsSPL14) has been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient to inhibit rice branching, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that OsSPL14, which is cleaved by miR529 and miR156, inhibits tillering by fine-tuning auxin transport in rice. RNA interference of OsSPL14 or miR529 and miR156 overexpression significantly increased the tiller number, whereas OsSPL14 overexpression decreased the tiller number. Histological analysis revealed that the OsSPL14-overexpressing line had normal initiation of axillary buds but inhibited outgrowth of tillers. Moreover, OsSPL14 was found to be responsive to indole-acetic acid and 1-naphthylphthalamic acid, and RNA interference of OsSPL14 reduced polar auxin transport and increased 1-naphthylphthalamic acid sensitivity of rice plants. Further analysis revealed that OsSPL14 directly binds to the promoter of PIN-FORMED 1b (OsPIN1b) and PIN-LIKE6b (PILS6b) to regulate their expression positively. OsPIN1b and PILS6b were highly expressed in axillary buds and proved involved in bud outgrowth. Loss of function of OsPIN1b or PILS6b increased the tiller number of rice. Taken together, our findings suggested that OsSPL14 could control axillary bud outgrowth and tiller number by activating the expression of OsPIN1b and PILS6b to fine-tune auxin transport in rice.
