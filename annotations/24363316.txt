Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which controls carbon flux to a variety of bioactive small-molecule aromatic compounds, and to lignin, the structural component of the cell wall. PAL is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Our knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of PAL is relatively comprehensive, but our knowledge of the molecular basis of the posttranslational regulation of PAL remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis thaliana Kelch repeat F-box (KFB) proteins KFB01, KFB20, and KFB50 physically interact with four PAL isozymes and mediate their proteolytic turnover via the ubiquitination-26S proteasome pathway. The KFB genes are differentially expressed in Arabidopsis tissues and respond to developmental and environmental cues. Up- or downregulation of their expression reciprocally affects the stability of the PAL enzymes, consequently altering the levels of phenylpropanoids. These data suggest that the KFB-mediated protein ubiquitination and degradation regulates the proteolysis of PALs, thus posttranslationally regulating phenylpropanoid metabolism. Characterizing the KFB-mediated proteolysis of PAL enzymes may inform future strategies for manipulating the synthesis of bioactive phenolics.
