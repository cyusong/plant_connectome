Over the last decades, several studies have reported emissions of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub> O) from microalgal cultures and aquatic ecosystems characterized by a high level of algal activity (e.g. eutrophic lakes). As N<sub>2</sub> O is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone-depleting pollutant, these findings suggest that large-scale cultivation of microalgae (and possibly, natural eutrophic ecosystems) could have a significant environmental impact. Using the model unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, this study was conducted to investigate the molecular basis of microalgal N<sub>2</sub> O synthesis. We report that C. reinhardtii supplied with nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ) under aerobic conditions can reduce NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> into nitric oxide (NO) using either a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) or a dual enzymatic system of nitrate reductase (NR) and amidoxime-reducing component, and that NO is subsequently reduced into N<sub>2</sub> O by the enzyme NO reductase (NOR). Based on experimental evidence and published literature, we hypothesize that when nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ) is the main Nitrogen source and the intracellular concentration of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> is low (i.e. under physiological conditions), microalgal N<sub>2</sub> O synthesis involves the reduction of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> by NR followed by the reduction of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> to NO by the dual system involving NR. This microalgal N<sub>2</sub> O pathway has broad implications for environmental science and algal biology because the pathway of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> assimilation is conserved among microalgae, and because its regulation may involve NO.
