Fucoidans are polysaccharides that consist predominantly of sulfated L-fucoses, from which, fucoidan oligosaccharides (FOSs) are prepared through different methods. Fucoidan has versatile physiological activities, like antiviral functions against SARS CoV-2 and bioactivitiy in enhancing immune responses. Although fucoidan or FOS has been widely used in mammals as functional foods and new drugs, its application in plants is still very limited. Moreover, whether fucoidan or its derived hydrolytic products can trigger immune responses in plants remained unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that the fucoidan enzymatic hydrolysate (FEH) prepared from Sargassum hemiphyllum triggers various immune responses, such as ROS production, MAPK activation, gene expression reprogramming, callose deposition, stomatal closure, and plant resistance to the bacterial strain Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Notably, FEH did not induce Arabidopsis root growth inhibition at the concentration used for triggering other immune responses. Our work suggests that EHF can potentially be used as a non-microbial elicitor in agricultural practices to protect plants from pathogen infection.
