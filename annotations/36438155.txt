In common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.), postharvest seed coat darkening is an undesirable trait that affects crop value. The increased accumulation of proanthocyanidins (PAs) in the seed coat results in darker seeds in many market classes of colored beans after harvest. The precursors of PAs are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and subsequently get glycosylated and then transported to the vacuoles where polymerization occurs. Thus, vacuolar transporters play an important role in the accumulation of PAs. Here, we report that common bean genome contains 59 multidrug and toxic compound extrusion genes (<i>PvMATE</i>s). Phylogenetic analysis of putative PvMATEs with functionally characterized MATEs from other plant species categorized them into substrate-specific clades. Our data demonstrate that a vacuolar transporter <i>PvMATE8</i> is expressed at a higher level in the pinto bean cultivar CDC Pintium (regular darkening) compared to 1533-15 (slow darkening). PvMATE8 localizes in the vacuolar membrane and rescues the PA deficient (<i>tt12</i>) mutant phenotype in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Analysis of PA monomers in transgenic seeds together with wild-type and mutants suggests a possible feedback regulation of PA biosynthesis and accumulation. Identification of PvMATE8 will help better understand the mechanism of PA accumulation in common bean.
