Pot-culture experiments were carried out to estimate the role of non-hydraulic root signals (nHRS) and the relation of these signals to drought tolerance and grain yield formation under drought stress in six wheat varieties. These were two modern hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L., AABBDD) Plateau602 and Longchun8139-2, two diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum L., AB) MO1 and MO4, and two tetraploid wheat (Triticum dicoccum Schuebl L., AABB) DM22 and DM31. In the two diploid relatives, the nHRS was switched on and off at a soil water content (SWC) of approximately 53-45% field water capacity (FWC). In contrast, in the modern hexaploid varieties, Longchun8139-2 and Plateau602 the nHRS occurred between a SWC of about 71 and 35% FWC, a much wider soil moisture range. The two tetraploid relatives, DM22 and DM31, were generally intermediate. The nHRS threshold range in SWC also narrowed as all six varieties went through successive developmental stages from shooting to grain filling. The two hexaploid wheat varieties had the longest duration of survival after the water supply ceased, and the best yield stability under drought stress, similar to with tetraploid wheat varieties; the diploid wheat varieties were least robust. These two parameters were both significantly correlated with the nHRS soil moisture threshold range (r=0.9456** and 0.8608*, respectively). Based on these patterns, we propose a "triple Z" model to describe the features of non-hydraulic stomatal sensitivity versus soil drought in wheat growth.
