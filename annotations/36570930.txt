Soil properties and microbial activities are indicators that shape plant communities and evolution. We aimed to determine the interdependency between trees, belowground herbaceous plants, soil characteristics, and arbuscular mycorrhizal communities. <i>Vachellia seyal</i> and <i>Prosopis chilensis</i> and their associated herb layers were targeted. Soils sampled beneath the trees and outside the canopies were subjected to physicochemical and microbial characterization. Randomly collected living roots of trees and dominant herbs were checked for arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization. A tree seedlings nursery was conducted using black bags filled with the following substrates: natural soil 100%, soil mixed with leaf tree plants (LTPs) as organic matter at 10%, soil mixed with LTP at 20%, soil mixed with LTP at 30%, and soil mixed with LTP at 50%. As a result, the presence of trees improves both herb richness and diversity. Soil mycorrhizal inoculum potentials are higher beneath <i>V. seyal</i> than <i>P. chilensis</i> and decreased significantly with increasing distance from trees. The soil MIP decreased with increasing organic matter content for both tree species but was more pronounced for <i>P. chilensis</i>. Soil salinity is lower beneath <i>V. seyal</i> and higher under <i>P. chilensis</i> and outside the canopies. Soil fertility parameters such as carbon, nitrogen, and available phosphorus are higher beneath the trees and then decreased as the distance to the trees increases. We conclude that microbial communities, soil properties, and herb richness and diversity increased beneath the trees but decreased with increasing distance from the trees. This effect is tree species-dependent as <i>P. chilensis</i> increased soil salinity and decreased the belowground density of herbs.
