['18849474', 'Lateral organ polarity in Arabidopsis is regulated by antagonistic interactions  between genes that promote either adaxial or abaxial identity, but the molecular  basis of this interaction is largely unknown. We show that the adaxial regulator  ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) is a direct target of the abaxial regulator KANADI1  (KAN1), and that KAN1 represses the transcription of AS2 in abaxial cells.  Mutation of a single nucleotide in a KAN1 binding site in the AS2 promoter causes  AS2 to be ectopically expressed in abaxial cells, resulting in a dominant,  adaxialized phenotype. We also show that the abaxial expression of KAN1 is  mediated directly or indirectly by AS2. These results demonstrate that KAN1 acts  as a transcriptional repressor and that mutually repressive interactions between  KAN1 and AS2 contribute to the establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity in  plants.', '2008 Oct 21', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0803997105', 'Kerstetter']

KAN1: !represses! AS2
AS2: !mediates! KAN1 expression
