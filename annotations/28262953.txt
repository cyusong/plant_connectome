Accumulating evidence highlights the importance of proteases as being central hubs of developmental programs. Yet the molecular pathways that many proteases act on, their natural substrates and their putative nonproteolytic functions remain largely elusive. Here, we discuss recent findings on proteases with functions that converge into plant development regulation, such as DEFECTIVE KERNEL 1 (DEK1), separase and subtilisins, to highlight conspicuous but unexplored aspects of protease biology. We also suggest an exploratory framework for addressing protease functions.
