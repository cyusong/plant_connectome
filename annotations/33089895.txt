Rice (Oryza sativa) is a short-day (SD) plant originally having strong photoperiod sensitivity (PS), with SDs promoting and long days (LDs) suppressing flowering. Although the evolution of PS in rice has been extensively studied, there are few studies that combine the genetic effects and underlying mechanism of different PS gene combinations with variations in PS. We created a set of isogenic lines among the core PS-flowering genes Hd1, Ghd7 and DTH8 using CRISPR mutagenesis, to systematically dissect their genetic relationships under different day-lengths. We investigated their monogenic, digenic, and trigenic effects on target gene regulation and PS variation. We found that Hd1 and Ghd7 have the primary functions for promoting and repressing flowering, respectively, regardless of day-length. However, under LD conditions, Hd1 promotes Ghd7 expression and is recruited by Ghd7 and/or DTH8 to form repressive complexes that collaboratively suppress the Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 pathway to block heading, but under SD conditions Hd1 competes with the complexes to promote Hd3a/RFT1 expression, playing a tradeoff relationship with PS flowering. Natural allelic variations of Hd1, Ghd7 and DTH8 in rice populations have resulted in various PS performances. Our findings reveal that rice PS flowering is controlled by crosstalk of two modules - Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 in SD conditions and (Hd1/Ghd7/DTH8)-Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 in LD conditions - and the divergences of these genes provide the basis for rice adaptation to broad regions.
