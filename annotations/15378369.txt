The carrot (Daucus carota L.) lea-class gene Dc3 is expressed in developing seeds and in vegetative tissues subject to drought and treatment with exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Cis regulatory elements involved in seed-specific expression and in response to ABA were identified in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene constructs containing a series of deletion and orientation mutants of the Dc3 promoter. These experiments demonstrated that the Dc3 promoter is comprised of a proximal promoter region (PPR) and a distal promoter region (DPR). TCGTGT motifs in the DPR in combination with the PPR comprise a novel, bipartite ABA module in the Dc3 gene promoter. The PPR contains cis-acting elements responsible for the developmental regulation of Dc3 expression in seeds. Five similar sequence motifs with the consensus ACACgtGCa were identified in the PPR. Both DPR and PPR interact with common nuclear proteins that are present in embryos and are inducible by ABA in vegetative tissues.
