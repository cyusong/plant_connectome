['11168407', 'Serine acetyltransferase (SAT) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of cysteine  biosynthesis in bacteria and plants and functions in association with  O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL) in the cysteine synthase complex. Very  little is known about the structure and catalysis of SATs except that they share  a characteristic C-terminal hexapeptide-repeat domain with a number of  enzymatically unrelated acyltransferases. Computational modeling of this domain  was performed for the mitochondrial SAT isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana, based  on crystal structures of bacterial acyltransferases. The results indicate a  left-handed parallel beta-helix consisting of beta-sheets alternating with turns,  resulting in a prism-like structure. This model was challenged by site-directed  mutagenesis and tested for a suspected dual function of this domain in catalysis  and hetero-oligomerization. The bifunctionality of the SAT C-terminus in  transferase activity and interaction with OAS-TL is demonstrated and discussed  with respect to the putative role of the cysteine synthase complex in regulation  of cysteine biosynthesis.', '2001 Feb', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.01920.x', 'Hell']
