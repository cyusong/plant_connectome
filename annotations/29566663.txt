The fatty acid composition of B. napus' seeds determines the oil's nutritional and industrial values, and affects seed germination. Many studies have reported correlations among C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 based on phenotypic data; however, the genetic basis of the fatty acid composition in B. napus is still not well understood. In this study, unconditional and conditional quantitative trail locus (QTL) mapping analyses were conducted using a recombinant inbred line in six environments. In total, 21 consensus QTLs each for C16:0, C18:0 and C18:2, 16 for C18:1 and 22 for C18:3 were detected by unconditional mapping. The QTLs with overlapping confidence intervals were integrated into 71 pleiotropically unique QTLs by meta-analysis. Two major QTLs, uuqA5-6 and uuqA5-7, simultaneously affected the fatty acids, except C18:0, in most of environments, with the homologous genes fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2) and glycerol-3-phosphate sn-2-acyltransferase 5 (GPAT5) occurring in the confidence interval of uuqA5-6, while phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase 1 (PAH1) was assigned to uuqA5-7. Moreover, 49, 30, 48, 60 and 45 consensus QTLs were detected for C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3, respectively, by the conditional mapping analysis. In total, 128 unique QTLs were subsequently integrated from the 232 conditional consensus QTLs. A comparative analysis revealed that 63 unique QTLs could be identified by both mapping methodologies, and 65 additional unique QTLs were only identified in conditional mapping. Thus, conditional QTL mapping for fatty acids may uncover numerous additional QTLs that were inhibited by the effects of other traits. These findings provide useful information for better understanding the genetic relationships among fatty acids at the QTL level.
