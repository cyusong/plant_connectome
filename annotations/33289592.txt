<i>Atractylodes lancea</i> is a type of typical traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) herb that is economically important in China. The traditional planting method of <i>A. lancea</i> is to plant <i>in situ</i> continuously for many years, which often leads to impediments for its growth and development and soil-borne diseases. The root-associated microbiome is believed to play an important role in plant resistance and the quality of products from the plant. This study aims to reveal detailed changes in the populations of rhizosphere microorganisms, and providing theoretical guidance for the prevention and control of soil-borne diseases in <i>A. lancea</i>. A high-throughput sequencing approach was utilized to illustrate changes in the microbial community from different planting years. Results and conclusions: The results show that the diversity and composition of the root-associated microbiome was significantly impacted by the consecutive monoculture of <i>A. lancea</i>. At the level of the comparisons of the phyla, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota declined significantly. In contrast, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Mortierellomycota distinctly increased. Comparisons at the genus level indicated that <i>Sphingomonas, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Pedobacter</i>, and <i>Tausonia</i> decreased significantly, whereas <i>Mortierella, Cylindrocarpon, Dactylonectria</i>, and <i>Mucor</i> distinctly increased. In conclusion, this study helps to develop an understanding of the impediments involved in the consecutive monoculture of <i>A. lancea</i>.
