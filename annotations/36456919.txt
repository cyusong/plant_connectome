Containing the largest number of species, the orchid family provides not only materials for studying plant evolution and environmental adaptation, but economically and culturally important ornamental plants for human society. Previously, we collected genome and transcriptome information of Dendrobium catenatum, Phalaenopsis equestris, and Apostasia shenzhenica which belong to two different subfamilies of Orchidaceae, and developed user-friendly tools to explore the orchid genetic sequences in the OrchidBase 4.0. The OrchidBase 4.0 offers the opportunity for plant science community to compare orchid genomes and transcriptomes and retrieve orchid sequences for further study.In the year 2022, two whole-genome sequences of Orchidoideae species, Platanthera zijinensis and Platanthera guangdongensis, were de novo sequenced, assembled and analyzed. In addition, systemic transcriptomes from these two species were also established. Therefore, we included these datasets to develop the new version of OrchidBase 5.0. In addition, three new functions including synteny, gene order, and miRNA information were also developed for orchid genome comparisons and miRNA characterization.OrchidBase 5.0 extended the genetic information to three orchid subfamilies (including five orchid species) and provided new tools for orchid researchers to analyze orchid genomes and transcriptomes.
