To evaluate components of fruit metabolic composition, we have previously metabolically phenotyped tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) introgression lines containing segmental substitutions of wild species chromosome in the genetic background of a cultivated variety. Here, we studied the hereditability of the fruit metabolome by analyzing an additional year's harvest and evaluating the metabolite profiles of lines heterozygous for the introgression (ILHs), allowing the evaluation of putative quantitative trait locus (QTL) mode of inheritance. These studies revealed that most of the metabolic QTL (174 of 332) were dominantly inherited, with relatively high proportions of additively (61 of 332) or recessively (80 of 332) inherited QTL and a negligible number displaying the characteristics of overdominant inheritance. Comparison of the mode of inheritance of QTL revealed that several metabolite pairs displayed a similar mode of inheritance of QTL at the same chromosomal loci. Evaluation of the association between morphological and metabolic traits in the ILHs revealed that this correlation was far less prominent, due to a reduced variance in the harvest index within this population. These data are discussed in the context of genomics-assisted breeding for crop improvement, with particular focus on the exploitation of wide biodiversity.
