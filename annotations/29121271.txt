Auxin-induced callus formation represents an important cell reprogramming process during in vitro regeneration of plants, in which the pericycle or pericycle-like cells within plant organs are reprogrammed into the pluripotent cell mass termed callus that is generally required for subsequent regeneration of root or shoot. However, the molecular events behind cell reprogramming during auxin-induced callus formation are largely elusive. We previously identified that auxin-induced LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) transcription factors act as the master regulators to trigger auxin-induced callus formation. Here, by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation-based sequencing) and RNA sequencing approaches, we identified the potential LBD29 target genes at the genome-wide level and outlined the molecular events of LBD-triggered cell reprogramming during callus formation. We showed that LBD29 preferentially bound to the G-box (CACGTG) and TGGGC[C/T] motifs and potentially targeted >350 genes, among which the genes related to methylation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, cell wall hydrolysis and lipid metabolism were rapidly activated, while most of the light-responsive genes were suppressed by LBD29. Further examination of a few representative genes validated that they were targeted by LBD29 and participated in the regulation of cell reprogramming during callus formation. Our data not only outline a framework of the early molecular events behind auxin-induced cell reprogramming of callus formation, but also provide a valuable resource for identification of genes that regulate cell fate switch during in vitro regeneration of plants.
