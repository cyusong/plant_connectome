Rice yield and heading date are the two discrete traits controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Both traits are influenced by the genetic make-up of the plant as well as the environmental factors where it thrives. Drought and salinity adversely affect crop productivity in many parts of the world. Tolerance to these stresses is multigenic and complex in nature. In this study, we have characterized a QTL, DTH8 (days to heading) from Oryza sativa L. cv IR64 that encodes a putative HAP3/NF-YB/CBF subunit of CCAAT-box binding protein (HAP complex). We demonstrate DTH8 to be positively influencing the yield, heading date, and stress tolerance in IR64. DTH8 up-regulates the transcription of RFT1, Hd3a, GHD7, MOC1, and RCN1 in IR64 at the pre-flowering stage and plays a role in early flowering, increased number of tillers, enhanced panicle branching, and improved tolerance towards drought and salinity stress at the reproductive stage. The presence of DTH8 binding elements (CCAAT) in the promoter regions of all of these genes, predicted by in silico analysis of the promoter region, indicates the regulation of their expression by DTH8. In addition, DTH8 overexpressing transgenic lines showed favorable physiological parameters causing less yield penalty under stress than the WT plants. Taken together, DTH8 is a positive regulator of the network of genes related to early flowering/heading, higher yield, as well as salinity and drought stress tolerance, thus, enabling the crops to adapt to a wide range of climatic conditions.
