Pectin methyl-esterification is catalysed by S-adenosyl-L: -methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases. As deficiency in adenosine kinase (ADK; EC 2.7.1.20) activity impairs SAM recycling and utilization, we investigated the relationship between ADK-deficiency and the degree of pectin methyl-esterification in cell walls of Arabidopsis thaliana. The distribution patterns of epitopes associated with methyl-esterified homogalacturonan in leaves and hypocotyls of wild-type (WT) and ADK-deficient plants were examined using immunolocalization and biochemical techniques. JIM5 and LM7 epitopes, characteristic of low esterified pectins, were more irregularly distributed along the cell wall in ADK-deficient plants than in WT cell walls. In addition, epitopes recognized by JIM7, characteristic of pectins with a higher degree of methyl-esterification, were less abundant in ADK-deficient leaves and hypocotyls. Since de-esterified pectins have enhanced adhesion properties, we propose that the higher abundance and the altered distribution of low methyl-esterified pectin in ADK-deficient cell walls lead to the leaf shape abnormalities observed in these plants.

ADK-deficient plants: !have more! irregularly distributed JIM5/LM7 epitopes
ADK-deficient plants: !have less! JIM7 epitopes
de-esterified pectins: !have enhanced! adhesion properties
ADK-deficiency: !leads to! leaf shape abnormalities
