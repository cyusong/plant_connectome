The plant circadian clock coordinates developmental, physiological, and metabolic processes with diel changes in light and temperature throughout the year. The balance between the persistence and plasticity of the clock in response to predictable and unpredictable environmental changes may be key to the clock's adaptive nature across temporal and spatial scales. Studies under controlled conditions have uncovered critical signaling pathways involved in light and temperature perception by the clock; however, they don't account for the natural lag of temperature behind photoperiod. Studies in natural environments provide key insights into the clock's adaptive advantage under more complex natural settings. Here, we discuss the role of the circadian clock in light and temperature perception and signaling, how the clock integrates these signals for a coordinated and adaptive response, and the adaptive advantage conferred by the clock across time and space in natural environments.
