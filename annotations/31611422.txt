Heat stress transcription factors (HSFs) are central regulators of plant responses to heat stress. Their heat-induced transcriptional regulation has been extensively studied; however, their posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation is poorly understood. In a previous study, we established that there were at least two <i>HSFA3</i> homologs, <i>LlHSFA3A</i> and <i>LlHSFA3B</i>, in lily (<i>Lilium</i> spp.) and that these genes played distinct roles in thermotolerance. Here, we demonstrate that <i>LlHSFA3B</i> is alternatively spliced under heat stress to produce the heat-inducible splice variant <i>LlHSFA3B-III</i> We further show that LlHSFA3B-III protein localizes in the cytoplasm and nucleus, has no transcriptional activity, and specifically disturbs the protein interactions of intact HSFA3 orthologs LlHSFA3A-I and LlHSFA3B-I. Heterologous expression of <i>LlHSFA3B-III</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> increased plant tolerance of salt and prolonged heat at 40°C, yet reduced plant tolerance of acute heat shock at 45°C. Conversely, heterologous expression of <i>LlHSFA3A-I</i> caused opposing phenotypes, which were substantially ameliorated by coexpression of <i>LlHSFA3B-III</i> LlHSFA3B-III interacted with LlHSFA3A-I to limit its transactivation function and temper the function of LlHSFA3A-I, thus reducing the adverse effects of excessive LlHSFA3A-I accumulation. Based on these observations, we propose a regulatory mechanism of HSFs involving heat-inducible alternative splicing and protein interaction, which might be used in strategies to promote thermotolerance and attenuate the heat stress response in crop plants.
