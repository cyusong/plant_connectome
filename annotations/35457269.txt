Agriculture crop development and production may be hampered in the modern era because of the increasing prevalence of ecological problems around the world. In the last few centuries, plant and agrarian scientific experts have shown significant progress in promoting efficient and eco-friendly approaches for the green synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs), which are noteworthy due to their unique physio-biochemical features as well as their possible role and applications. They are thought to be powerful sensing molecules that regulate a wide range of significant physiological and biochemical processes in plants, from germination to senescence, as well as unique strategies for coping with changing environmental circumstances. This review highlights current knowledge on the plant extract-mediated synthesis of NPs, as well as their significance in reprogramming plant traits and ameliorating abiotic stresses. Nano particles-mediated modulation of phytohormone content in response to abiotic stress is also displayed. Additionally, the applications and limitations of green synthesized NPs in various scientific regimes have also been highlighted.
