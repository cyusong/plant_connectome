Predicting how belowground carbon storage reflects changes in aboveground vegetation biomass is an unresolved challenge in most ecosystems. This is especially true for fire-prone savannas, where frequent fires shape the fraction of carbon allocated to root traits for post-fire vegetation recovery. Here I review evidence on how root traits may respond to frequent fires and propose to leverage root traits to infer belowground carbon dynamics in fire-prone savannas. Evidently, we still lack an understanding of trade-offs in root acquisitive vs. conservative traits in response to frequent fires, nor have we determined which root traits are functionally important to mediate belowground carbon dynamics in a frequently burned environment. Focusing research efforts along these topics should improve our understanding of savanna carbon cycling under future changes in fire regimes.
