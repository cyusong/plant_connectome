The available literature is conflicting on the potential protection of plants against ozone (O(3)) injury by exogenous jasmonates, including methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Protective antagonistic interactions of O(3) and MeJA have been observed in some systems and purely additive effects in others. Here it is shown that chronic exposure to low to moderate O(3) concentrations (4-114 ppb; 12 h mean) and to MeJA induced additive reductions in carbon assimilation (A (n)) and root respiration (R (r)), and in calculated whole plant carbon balance. Neither this chronic O(3) regime nor MeJA induced emission of ethylene (ET) from the youngest fully expanded leaves. ET emission was induced by acute 3 h pulse exposure to much higher O(3) concentrations (685 ppb). ET emission was further enhanced in plants treated with MeJA. Responses of growth, allocation, photosynthesis, and respiration to moderate O(3) concentrations and to MeJA appear to be independent and additive, and not associated with emission of ET. These results suggest that responses of Pima cotton to environmentally relevant O(3) are not mediated by signalling pathways associated with ET and MeJA, though these pathways are inducible in this species and exhibit a synergistic O(3)×MeJA interaction at very high O(3) concentrations.
