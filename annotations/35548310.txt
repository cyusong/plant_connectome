AtRsmD was recently demonstrated to be a chloroplast <i>16S rRNA</i> methyltransferase (MTase) for the m<sup>2</sup>G915 modification in Arabidopsis. Here, its function of AtRsmD for chloroplast development and photosynthesis was further analyzed. The <i>AtRsmD</i> gene is highly expressed in green photosynthetic tissues. AtRsmD is associated with the thylakoid in chloroplasts. The <i>atrsmd-2</i> mutant exhibited impaired photosynthetic efficiency in emerging leaves under normal growth conditions. A few thylakoid lamellas could be observed in the chloroplast from the <i>atrsmd-2</i> mutant, and these thylakoids were loosely organized. Knockout of the <i>AtRsmD</i> gene had minor effects on chloroplast ribosome biogenesis and RNA loading on chloroplast ribosomes, but it reduced the amounts of chloroplast-encoded photosynthesis-related proteins in the emerging leaves, for example, D1, D2, CP43, and CP47, which reduced the accumulation of the photosynthetic complex. Nevertheless, knockout of the <i>AtRsmD</i> gene did not cause a general reduction in chloroplast-encoded proteins in Arabidopsis grown under normal growth conditions. Additionally, the <i>atrsmd-2</i> mutant exhibited more sensitivity to lincomycin, which specifically inhibits the elongation of nascent polypeptide chains. Cold stress exacerbated the effect on chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in the <i>atrsmd-2</i> mutant. All these data suggest that the AtRsmD protein plays distinct regulatory roles in chloroplast translation, which is required for chloroplast development and chloroplast function.
