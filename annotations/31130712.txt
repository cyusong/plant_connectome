Salinity critically limits rice metabolism, growth, and productivity worldwide. Improvement of the salt resistance of locally grown high-yielding cultivars is a slow process. The objective of this study was to develop a new salt-tolerant rice germplasm using speed-breeding. Here, we precisely introgressed the <i>hst1</i> gene, transferring salinity tolerance from "Kaijin" into high-yielding "Yukinko-mai" (WT) rice through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker-assisted selection. Using a biotron speed-breeding technique, we developed a BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>3</sub> population, named "YNU31-2-4", in six generations and 17 months. High-resolution genotyping by whole-genome sequencing revealed that the BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> genome had 93.5% similarity to the WT and fixed only 2.7% of donor parent alleles. Functional annotation of BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> variants along with field assessment data indicated that "YNU31-2-4" plants carrying the <i>hst1</i> gene had similar agronomic traits to the WT under normal growth condition. "YNU31-2-4" seedlings subjected to salt stress (125 mM NaCl) had a significantly higher survival rate and increased shoot and root biomasses than the WT. At the tissue level, quantitative and electron probe microanalyzer studies indicated that "YNU31-2-4" seedlings avoided Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in shoots under salt stress. The "YNU31-2-4" plants showed an improved phenotype with significantly higher net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and lower yield decline than WT under salt stress at the reproductive stage. "YNU31-2-4" is a potential candidate for a new rice cultivar that is highly tolerant to salt stress at the seedling and reproductive stages, and which might maintain yields under a changing global climate.
