Germination requires sufficient water absorption by seeds, but excessive water in the soil inhibits plant growth. We therefore hypothesized that tolerance mechanisms exist that help young seedlings survive and develop in waterlogged conditions. Many ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER subfamily G (ABCG) proteins protect terrestrial plants from harsh environmental conditions. To establish whether any of these proteins facilitate plant development under waterlogged conditions, we observed the early seedling growth of many ABCG transporter mutants under waterlogged conditions. abcg5 seedlings exhibited severe developmental problems under waterlogged conditions: the shoot apical meristem was small, and the seedling failed to develop true leaves. The seedlings had a high water content and reduced buoyancy on water, suggesting that they were unable to retain air spaces on and inside the plant. Supporting this possibility, abcg5 cotyledons had increased cuticle permeability, reduced cuticular wax contents, and a much less dense cuticle layer than the wild-type. These results indicate that proper development of plants under waterlogged conditions requires the dense cuticle layer formed by ABCG5 activity.
