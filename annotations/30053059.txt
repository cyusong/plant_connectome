['30053059', 'Group II introns are common features of most angiosperm mitochondrial genomes.  Intron splicing is thus essential for the expression of mitochondrial genes and  is facilitated by numerous nuclear-encoded proteins. However, the molecular  mechanism and the protein cofactors involved in this complex process have not  been fully elucidated. In this study, we characterized three new  pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) genes, called MISF26, MISF68, and MISF74, of  Arabidopsis and showed they all function in group II intron splicing and plant  development. The three PPR genes encode P-type PPR proteins that localize in the  mitochondrion. Transcript analysis revealed that the splicing of a single intron  is altered in misf26 mutants, while several mitochondrial intron splicing defects  were detected in misf68 and misf74 mutants. To our knowledge, MISF68 and MISF74  are the first two PPR proteins implicated in the splicing of more than one intron  in plant mitochondria, suggesting that they may facilitate splicing differently  from other previously identified PPR splicing factors. The splicing defects in  the misf mutants induce a significant decrease in complex I assembly and  activity, and an overexpression of mRNAs of the alternative respiratory pathway.  These results therefore reveal that nuclear encoded proteins MISF26, MISF68, and  MISF74 are involved in splicing of a cohort of mitochondrial group II introns and  thereby required for complex I biogenesis.', '2018 Oct 12', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ery275', 'Mireau']
