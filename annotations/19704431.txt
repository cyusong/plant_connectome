The strategies used by necrotrophic fungal pathogens to infect plants are often perceived as lacking the sophistication of their haustorium producing, host defence suppressing, biotrophic counterparts. There is also a relative paucity of knowledge regarding how effective gene-for-gene based resistance reactions might function against necrotrophic plant pathogens. However, recent data has emerged from a number of systems which has highlighted that particular species of necrotrophic (and/or hemibiotrophic) fungi, have evolved very sophisticated strategies for plant infection which appear, in fact, to hijack the host resistance responses that are commonly deployed against biotrophs. Both disease resistance (R) protein homologues and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades commonly associated with incompatible disease resistance responses; appear to be targeted by necrotrophic fungi during compatible disease interactions. These findings highlight an emerging sophistication in the strategies deployed by necrotrophic fungi to infect plants.
