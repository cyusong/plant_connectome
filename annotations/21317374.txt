['21317374', 'Indole glucosinolates, derived from the amino acid Trp, are plant secondary  metabolites that mediate numerous biological interactions between cruciferous  plants and their natural enemies, such as herbivorous insects, pathogens, and  other pests. While the genes and enzymes involved in the Arabidopsis thaliana  core biosynthetic pathway, leading to indol-3-yl-methyl glucosinolate (I3M), have  been identified and characterized, the genes and gene products responsible for  modification reactions of the indole ring are largely unknown. Here, we combine  the analysis of Arabidopsis mutant lines with a bioengineering approach to  clarify which genes are involved in the remaining biosynthetic steps in indole  glucosinolate modification. We engineered the indole glucosinolate biosynthesis  pathway into Nicotiana benthamiana, showing that it is possible to produce indole  glucosinolates in a noncruciferous plant. Building upon this setup, we  demonstrate that all members of a small gene subfamily of cytochrome P450  monooxygenases, CYP81Fs, are capable of carrying out hydroxylation reactions of  the glucosinolate indole ring, leading from I3M to 4-hydroxy-indol-3-yl-methyl  and/or 1-hydroxy-indol-3-yl-methyl glucosinolate intermediates, and that these  hydroxy intermediates are converted to 4-methoxy-indol-3-yl-methyl and  1-methoxy-indol-3-yl-methyl glucosinolates by either of two family 2  O-methyltransferases, termed indole glucosinolate methyltransferase 1 (IGMT1) and  IGMT2.', '2011 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.081711', 'Kroymann']
