Plants growing in nature often experience fluctuating irradiance. However, in the laboratory, the dynamics of photosynthesis are usually explored by instantaneously exposing dark-adapted plants to constant light and examining the dark-to-light transition, which is a poor approximation of natural phenomena. With the aim creating a better approximation, we exposed leaves of pea (Pisum sativum) to oscillating light and measured changes in the functioning of PSI and PSII, and of the proton motive force at the thylakoid membrane. We found that the dynamics depended on the oscillation period, revealing information about the underlying regulatory networks. As demonstrated for a selected oscillation period of 60 s, the regulation tries to keep the reaction centers of PSI and PSII open. We present an evaluation of the data obtained, and discuss the involvement of particular processes in the regulation of photosynthesis. The forced oscillations provided an information-rich fingerprint of complex regulatory networks. We expect future progress in understanding these networks from experiments involving chemical interventions and plant mutants, and by using mathematical modeling and systems identification and control tools.
