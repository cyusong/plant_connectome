['15086805', 'We identified a novel mutation of a nuclear-encoded gene, designated as CRUMPLED  LEAF (CRL), of Arabidopsis thaliana that affects the morphogenesis of all plant  organs and division of plastids. Histological analysis revealed that planes of  cell division were distorted in shoot apical meristems (SAMs), root tips, and  embryos in plants that possess the crl mutation. Furthermore, we observed that  differentiation patterns of cortex and endodermis cells in inflorescence stems  and root endodermis cells were disturbed in the crl mutant. These results suggest  that morphological abnormalities observed in the crl mutant were because of  aberrant cell division and differentiation. In addition, cells of the crl mutant  contained a reduced number of enlarged plastids, indicating that the division of  plastids was inhibited in the crl. The CRL gene encodes a novel protein with a  molecular mass of 30 kDa that is localized in the plastid envelope. The CRL  protein is conserved in various plant species, including a fern, and in  cyanobacteria, but not in other organisms. These data suggest that the CRL  protein is required for plastid division, and it also plays an important role in  cell differentiation and the regulation of the cell division plane in plants. A  possible function of the CRL protein is discussed.', '2004 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02057.x', 'Machida']
