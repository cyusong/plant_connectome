The use of biocontrol agents (BCAs) represents a promising alternative to conventional methods for the management of gray mold in vineyards during the berry ripening stage. The main advantages of BCAs are the short preharvest interval and lack of chemical fungicide residues in wine. In this study, eight commercial BCAs (based on different <i>Bacillus</i> or <i>Trichoderma</i> species and strains, <i>Aureobasidium pullulans</i>, <i>Metschnikowia fructicola</i>, and <i>Pythium oligandrum</i>) and a reference fungicide (boscalid) were applied to a vineyard during berry ripening over three seasons to evaluate the dynamics over time in terms of their relative efficacies in gray mold control. At 1-13 days after application of BCAs to the berry surfaces in field conditions, the berries were collected and artificially inoculated with conidia of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> under controlled laboratory conditions, and gray mold severity was observed after 7 days of incubation. Significant differences were observed in gray mold severity among years, according to the number of days the BCAs grew on the berry surface before <i>B. cinerea</i> inoculation, and the season by day interaction (altogether accounting for >80% of the experimental variance). The variability in BCA efficacy was closely related to the environmental conditions at the time of application and in the following days. Overall, the BCA efficacy increased with the degree days accumulated between BCA application in the vineyard and <i>B. cinerea</i> inoculation in the dry (no rain) periods (r = 0.914, P = 0.001). Rainfall and the associated drop in temperature caused a relevant reduction of BCA efficacy. These results demonstrate that BCAs are an effective alternative to conventional chemicals for the preharvest control of gray mold in vineyards. However, environmental conditions can considerably affect the BCA efficacy.
