The cell wall and extracellular matrix in higher plants include secreted proteins that play critical roles in a wide range of cellular processes, such as structural integrity and biogenesis. Compared with the intensive cell wall proteomic studies in Arabidopsis, the list of cell wall proteins identified in monocot species is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a large-scale proteomic analysis of secreted proteins from rice. Highly purified secreted rice proteins were obtained from the medium of a suspension of callus culture and were analyzed with multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). As a result, we could detect a total of 555 rice proteins by MudPIT analysis. Based on bioinformatic analyses, 27.7% (154 proteins) of the identified proteins are considered to be secreted proteins because they possess a signal peptide for the secretory pathway. Among the 154 identified proteins, 27% were functionally categorized as stress response proteins, followed by metabolic proteins (26%) and factors involved in protein modification (24%). Comparative analysis of cell wall proteins from Arabidopsis and rice revealed that one third of the secreted rice proteins overlapped with those of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, 25 novel rice-specific secreted proteins were found. This work presents the large scale of the rice secretory proteome from culture medium, which contributes to a deeper understanding of the rice secretome.
