['16804053', 'Laccases, EC 1.10.3.2 or p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductases, are multi-copper  containing glycoproteins. Despite many years of research, genetic evidence for  the roles of laccases in plants is mostly lacking. In this study, a reverse  genetics approach was taken to identify T-DNA insertional mutants (the SALK  collection) available for genes in the Arabidopsis laccase family. Twenty true  null mutants were confirmed for 12 laccase genes of the 17 total laccase genes  (AtLAC1 to AtLAC17) in the family. By examining the mutants identified, it was  found that four mutants, representing mutations in three laccase genes, showed  altered phenotypes. Mutants for AtLAC2, lac2, showed compromised root elongation  under PEG-induced dehydration conditions; lac8 flowered earlier than wild-type  plants, and lac15 showed an altered seed colour. The diverse phenotypes suggest  that laccases perform different functions in plants and are not as genetically  redundant as previously thought. These mutants will prove to be valuable  resources for understanding laccase functions in vivo.', '2006', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erl022', 'Wu']
