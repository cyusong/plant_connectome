Recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) with a molecular mass of 29 kDa was transiently expressed in Agrobacterium-inoculated leaf-disks prepared from Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Expression of GFP from the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter within a replicating vector based on the geminivirus Beet curly top virus (BCTV) was more than 3 times higher than from a control, non-replicating vector. Use of the Cassava vein mosaic virus (CsVMV) promoter in the BCTV replicating vector increased the expression of recombinant GFP 320% at the transcript level, compared to use of the control CaMV 35 S promoter. Expression of recombinant GFP from Agrobacterium-inoculated leaf-disks of N. benthamiana was further enhanced up to 240% in the presence of post-transcriptional gene silencing suppressor p19.
