Time-dependent kinetics of xylem Na<sup>+</sup> loading was investigated using a large number of barley genotypes contrasting in their salinity tolerance. Salt-sensitive varieties were less efficient in controlling xylem Na<sup>+</sup> loading and showed a gradual increase in the xylem Na<sup>+</sup> content over the time. To understand underlying ionic and molecular mechanisms, net fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> were measured from the xylem parenchyma tissue in response to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and ABA; both of them associated with salinity stress signalling. Our results indicate that NADPH oxidase-mediated apoplastic H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production acts upstream of the xylem Na<sup>+</sup> loading and is causally related to ROS-inducible Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake systems in the root stelar tissue. It was also found that ABA regulates (directly or indirectly) the process of Na<sup>+</sup> retrieval from the xylem and the significant reduction of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> fluxes induced by bumetanide are indicative of a major role of chloride cation co-transporter (CCC) on xylem ion loading. Transcript levels of HvHKT1;5_like and HvSOS1_like genes in the root stele were observed to decrease after salt stress, while there was an increase in HvSKOR_like gene, indicating that these ion transporters are involved in primary Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> movement into/out of xylem.
