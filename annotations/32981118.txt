In their natural environment, plants are exposed to biotic or abiotic stresses that occur sequentially or simultaneously. Plant responses to these stresses have been studied widely and have been well characterised in simplified systems involving single plant species facing individual stress. Temperature elevation is a major abiotic driver of climate change and scenarios have predicted an increase in the number and severity of epidemics. In this context, here we review the available data on the effect of heat stress on plant-pathogen interactions. Considering 45 studies performed on model or crop species, we discuss the possible implications of the optimum growth temperature of plant hosts and pathogens, mode of stress application and temperature variation on resistance modulations. Alarmingly, most identified resistances are altered under temperature elevation, regardless of the plant and pathogen species. Therefore, we have listed current knowledge on heat-dependent plant immune mechanisms and pathogen thermosensory processes, mainly studied in animals and human pathogens, that could help to understand the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions under elevated temperatures. Based on a general overview of the mechanisms involved in plant responses to pathogens, and integrating multiple interactions with the biotic environment, we provide recommendations to optimise plant disease resistance under heat stress and to identify thermotolerant resistance mechanisms.
