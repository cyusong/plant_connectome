Silicon (Si) is known to protect against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic plant pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which it exerts its prophylactic role remain unknown. In an attempt to obtain unique insights into the mode of action of Si, we conducted a full comparative transcriptomic analysis of soybean (Glycine max) plants and Phytophthora sojae, a hemibiotroph that relies heavily on effectors for its virulence. Supplying Si to inoculated plants provided a strong protection against P. sojae over the course of the experiment (21 day). Our results showed that the response of Si-free (Si<sup>-</sup>) plants to inoculation was characterized early (4 dpi) by a high expression of defense-related genes, including plant receptors, which receded over time as the pathogen progressed into the roots. The infection was synchronized with a high expression of effectors by P. sojae, the nature of which changed over time. By contrast, the transcriptomic response of Si-fed (Si<sup>+</sup>) plants was remarkably unaffected by the presence of P. sojae, and the expression of effector-coding genes by the pathogen was significantly reduced. Given that the apoplast is a key site of interaction between effectors and plant defenses and receptors in the soybean-P. sojae complex, as well as the site of amorphous-Si accumulation, our results indicate that Si likely interferes with the signaling network between P. sojae and the plant, preventing or decreasing the release of effectors reaching plant receptors, thus creating a form of incompatible interaction.
