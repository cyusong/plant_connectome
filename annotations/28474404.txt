Cell elongation and secondary wall deposition are two consecutive stages during cotton fiber development. The mechanisms controlling the progression of these two developmental phases remain largely unknown. Here, we report the functional characterization of the actin-bundling protein GhFIM2 in cotton fiber. Overexpression of GhFIM2 increased the abundance of actin bundles, which was accompanied with accelerated fiber growth at the fast-elongating stage. Meanwhile, overexpression of GhFIM2 could propel the onset of secondary cell wall biogenesis. These results indicate that the dynamic rearrangement of actin higher structures involving GhFIM2 plays an important role in the development of cotton fiber cells.
