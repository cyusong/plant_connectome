Crop genomics and breeding CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED (CLE) proteins belong to a small peptide family in plants. During plant development, <i>CLE</i> gene family members play a pivotal role in regulating cell-to-cell communication and stem cell maintenance. However, the evolutionary process and functional importance of <i>CLE</i>s are unclear in Brassicaceae. In this study, a total of 70 <i>BnCLE</i>s were identified in <i>Brassica napus</i> (2n = 4x = 38, A<sub>n</sub>C<sub>n</sub>): 32 from the A<sub>n</sub> subgenome, 36 from the C<sub>n</sub> subgenome, and 2 from the unanchored subgenome. Meanwhile, 29 <i>BrCLE</i> and 32 <i>BoCLE</i> genes were explored in <i>Brassica rapa</i> (2n = 2x = 20, A<sub>r</sub>) and <i>Brassica oleracea</i> (2n = 2x = 18, C<sub>o</sub>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 163 <i>CLE</i>s derived from three <i>Brassica</i> species and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> can be divided into seven subfamilies. Homology and synteny analyses indicated whole-genome triplication (WGT) and segmental duplication may be the major contributors to the expansion of <i>CLE</i> family. In addition, RNA-seq and qPCR analysis indicated that 19 and 16 <i>BnCLE</i>s were more highly expressed in immature seeds and roots than in other tissues. Some <i>CLE</i> gene pairs exhibited different expression patterns in the same tissue, which indicated possible functional divergence. Furthermore, genetic variations and regional association mapping analysis indicated that 12 <i>BnCLE</i>s were potential genes for regulating important agronomic traits. This study provided valuable information to understand the molecular evolution and biological function of <i>CLE</i>s in <i>B. napus</i> and its diploid progenitors, which will be helpful for genetic improvement of high-yield breeding in <i>B. napus</i>.
