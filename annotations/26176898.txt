Plants need to adapt to various stress factors originating from the environment. Signal transduction pathways connecting the recognition of environmental cues and the initiation of appropriate downstream responses in plants often involve intracellular Ca(2+) concentration changes. These changes must be deciphered into specific cellular signals. Calmodulin-like proteins, CMLs, act as Ca(2+) sensors in plants and are known to be involved in various stress reactions. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis 2 different CMLs, AtCML37 and AtCML42 are antagonistically involved in drought stress response. Whereas a CML37 knock-out line, cml37, was highly susceptible to drought stress, CML42 knockout line, cml42, showed no obvious effect compared to wild type (WT) plants. Accordingly, the analysis of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) revealed a significant reduction of ABA upon drought stress in cml37 plants, while in cml42 plants an increase of ABA was detected. Summarizing, our results show that both CML37 and CML42 are involved in drought stress response but show antagonistic effects.

AtCML37: !enhances! drought stress response
AtCML42: !represses! drought stress response
AtCML37: !reduces! ABA
AtCML42: !increases! ABA
