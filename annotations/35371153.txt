<i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>CO</i>) plays a critical role in the photoperiodic flowering pathway. However, the function of soybean <i>CO</i> orthologs and the molecular mechanisms in regulating flowering remain largely unknown. This study characterized the natural variations in <i>CO</i> family genes and their association with flowering time and maturity in soybeans. A total of 21 soybean <i>CO</i> family genes (<i>GmCOL</i>s) were cloned and sequenced in 128 varieties covering 14 known maturity groups (MG 0000-MG X from earliest to latest maturity). Regarding the whole genomic region involving these genes, <i>GmCOL1</i>, <i>GmCOL3</i>, <i>GmCOL8</i>, <i>GmCOL9</i>, <i>GmCOL10</i>, and <i>GmCOL13</i> were conserved, and the remaining 15 genes showed genetic variation that was brought about by mutation, namely, all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions-deletions (InDels). In addition, a few genes showed some strong linkage disequilibrium. Point mutations were found in 15 <i>GmCOL</i> genes, which can lead to changes in the potential protein structure. Early flowering and maturation were related to eight genes (<i>GmCOL1</i>/<i>3</i>/<i>4</i>/<i>8</i>/<i>13</i>/<i>15</i>/<i>16</i>/<i>19</i>). For flowering and maturation, 11 genes (<i>GmCOL2</i>/<i>5</i>/<i>6</i>/<i>14</i>/<i>20</i>/<i>22</i>/<i>23</i>/<i>24</i>/<i>25</i>/<i>26</i>/<i>28</i>) expressed divergent physiognomy. Haplotype analysis indicated that the haplotypes of <i>GmCOL5-Hap2</i>, <i>GmCOL13-Hap2/3</i>, and <i>GmCOL28-Hap2</i> were associated with flowering dates and soybean maturity. This study helps address the role of <i>GmCOL</i> family genes in adapting to diverse environments, particularly when it is necessary to regulate soybean flowering dates and maturity.
