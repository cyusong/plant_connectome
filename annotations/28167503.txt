['28167503', 'The characteristic shapes and sizes of organs are established by cell  proliferation patterns and final cell sizes, but the underlying molecular  mechanisms coordinating these are poorly understood. Here we characterize a  ubiquitin-activated peptidase called DA1 that limits the duration of cell  proliferation during organ growth in Arabidopsis thaliana The peptidase is  activated by two RING E3 ligases, Big Brother (BB) and DA2, which are  subsequently cleaved by the activated peptidase and destabilized. In the case of  BB, cleavage leads to destabilization by the RING E3 ligase PROTEOLYSIS 1 (PRT1)  of the N-end rule pathway. DA1 peptidase activity also cleaves the deubiquitylase  UBP15, which promotes cell proliferation, and the transcription factors TEOSINTE  BRANCED 1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF 15 (TCP15) and TCP22, which promote cell proliferation  and repress endoreduplication. We propose that DA1 peptidase activity regulates  the duration of cell proliferation and the transition to endoreduplication and  differentiation during organ formation in plants by coordinating the  destabilization of regulatory proteins.', '2017 Jan 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.292235.116', 'Bevan']
