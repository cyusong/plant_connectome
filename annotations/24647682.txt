Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferases (UGTs) from plants transfer sugar moieties from activated sugar donors to a wide range of small molecules, and control many metabolic processes during plant growth and development. Here, we report a genome-wide analysis of maize that identified 147 Family-1 glycosyltransferases based on their conserved PSPG motifs. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes with 18 Arabidopsis UGTs and two rice UGTs clustered them into 17 groups (A-Q). The patterns of intron gain/loss events, as well as their positions within UGTs from the same group, further aided elucidation of their divergence and evolutionary relationships between UGTs. Expression analysis of the maize UGT genes using both online microarray data and quantitative real-time PCR verification indicates that UGT genes are widely expressed in various tissues and likely play important roles in plant growth and development. Our study provides useful information on the Family-1 UGTs in maize, and will facilitate their further characterization to better understand their functions.
