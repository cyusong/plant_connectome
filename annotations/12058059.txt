['12058059', 'The SCF (for SKP1, Cullin/CDC53, F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase targets a number  of cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, and other proteins for  degradation in yeast and mammalian cells. Recent genetic studies demonstrate that  plant F-box proteins are involved in auxin responses, jasmonate signaling, flower  morphogenesis, photocontrol of circadian clocks, and leaf senescence, implying a  large spectrum of functions for the SCF pathway in plant development. Here, we  present a molecular and functional characterization of plant cullins. The  Arabidopsis genome contains 11 cullin-related genes. Complementation assays  revealed that AtCUL1 but not AtCUL4 can functionally complement the yeast cdc53  mutant. Arabidopsis mutants containing transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertions in the  AtCUL1 gene were shown to display an arrest in early embryogenesis. Consistently,  both the transcript and the protein of the AtCUL1 gene were found to accumulate  in embryos. The AtCUL1 protein localized mainly in the nucleus but also weakly in  the cytoplasm during interphase and colocalized with the mitotic spindle in  metaphase. Our results demonstrate a critical role for the SCF ubiquitin ligase  in Arabidopsis embryogenesis.', '2002 Jun', 'Mol Biol Cell', '10.1091/mbc.e02-02-0077', 'Genschik']
