['25640950', 'The fungus Verticillium longisporum is a soil-borne plant pathogen of increasing  economic importance, and information on plant responses to it is limited. To  identify the genes and components involved in the early stages of infection,  transcripts in roots of V. longisporum-challenged Arabidopsis Col-0 and the  susceptible NON-RACE SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE 1 (ndr1-1) mutant were compared  using ATH1 gene chips. The analysis revealed altered transcript levels of several  terpene biosynthesis genes, including the monoterpene synthase TPS23/27. When  transgenic 35S:TPS23/27 and TPS23/27-amiRNA plants were monitored the  over-expresser line showed enhanced fungal colonization whereas the silenced  genotype was indistinguishable from Col-0. Transcript analysis of terpene  biosynthesis genes suggested that only the TPS23/27 pathway is affected in the  two transgenic genotypes. To confirm changes in monoterpene production, emitted  volatiles were determined using solid-phase microextraction and gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry. Levels of all identified TPS23/27 monoterpene  products were significantly altered in the transgenic plants. A stimulatory  effect on conidial germination and hyphal growth of V. longisporum was also seen  in co-cultivation with 35S:TPS23/27 plants and upon exposure to 1,8-cineole, the  main product of TPS23/27. Methyl jasmonate treatments of myc2-1 and myc2-2  mutants and analysis of TPS23/27:uidA in the myc2-2 background suggested a  dependence on jasmonic acid mediated by the transcription factor MYC2. Taken  together, our results show that TPS23/27-produced monoterpenes stimulate  germination and subsequent invasion of V. longisporum in Arabidopsis roots.', '2015 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12752', 'Dixelius']
