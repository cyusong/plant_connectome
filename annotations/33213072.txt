As key players in biotic stress response of plants, jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivatives cover a specific and prominent role in pathogens-mediated signaling and hence are promising candidates for a sustainable management of phytopathogenic fungi. Recently, JA directed antimicrobial effects on plant pathogens has been suggested, supporting the theory of oxylipins as double gamers in plant-pathogen interaction. Based on these premises, six derivatives (dihydrojasmone and cis-jasmone, two thiosemicarbazonic derivatives and their corresponding complexes with copper) have been evaluated against 13 fungal species affecting various economically important herbaceous and woody crops, such as cereals, grapes and horticultural crops: <i>Phaeoacremonium minimum</i>, <i>Neofusicoccum parvum</i>, <i>Phaeomoniella chlamydospora</i>, <i>Fomitiporia mediterranea</i>, <i>Fusarium poae</i>, <i>F. culmorum</i>, <i>F. graminearum</i>, <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lactucae,</i><i>F. sporotrichioides</i>, <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>, <i>Rhizoctonia solani,</i><i>Sclerotinia</i> spp. and <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. The biological activity of these compounds was assessed in terms of growth inhibition and, for the two mycotoxigenic species <i>A. flavus</i> and <i>F. sporotrichioides</i>, also in terms of toxin containment. As expected, the inhibitory effect of molecules greatly varied amongst both genera and species; cis-jasmone thiosemicarbazone in particular has shown the wider range of effectiveness. However, our results show that thiosemicarbazones derivatives are more effective than the parent ketones in limiting fungal growth and mycotoxins production, supporting possible applications for the control of pathogenic fungi.
