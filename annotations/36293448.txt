Changes in soil microbial communities in response to hydrocarbon pollution are critical indicators of disturbed ecosystem conditions. A core component of these communities that is functionally adjusted to the life-history traits of the host and environmental factors consists of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF communities associated with <i>Poa trivialis</i> and <i>Phragmites australis</i> growing at a phenol and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated site and at an uncontaminated site were compared based on LSU rDNA sequencing. Dissimilarities in species composition and community structures indicated soil pollution as the main factor negatively affecting the AMF diversity. The AMF communities at the contaminated site were dominated by fungal generalists (<i>Rhizophagus</i>, <i>Funneliformis</i>, <i>Claroideoglomus</i>, <i>Paraglomus</i>) with wide ecological tolerance. At the control site, the AMF communities were characterized by higher taxonomic and functional diversity than those exposed to the contamination. The host plant identity was the main driver distinguishing the two AMF metacommunities. The AMF communities at the uncontaminated site were represented by <i>Polonospora</i>, <i>Paraglomus</i>, <i>Oehlia</i>, <i>Nanoglomus</i>, <i>Rhizoglomus</i>, <i>Dominikia</i>, and <i>Microdominikia</i>. <i>Polonosporaceae</i> and <i>Paraglomeraceae</i> were particularly dominant in the <i>Ph. australis</i> mycorrhizosphere. The high abundance of early diverging AMF could be due to the use of primers able to detect lineages such as <i>Paraglomeracae</i> that have not been recognized by previously used 18S rDNA primers.
