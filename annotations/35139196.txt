The flux, distribution, and storage of soluble sugars regulate crop yield in terms of starch, oil, protein, and total carbohydrates, and affect the quality of many horticultural products. Sugar transporters contribute to phloem loading and unloading. The mechanisms of phloem loading have been studied in detail, but the complex and diverse mechanisms of phloem unloading and sugar storage in sink organs are less explored. Unloading and subsequent transport mechanisms for carbohydrates vary in different sink organs. Analyzing the transport and storage mechanisms of carbohydrates in important storage organs, such as cereal seeds, fruits, or stems of sugarcane, will provide information for genetic improvements to increase crop yield and fruit quality. This review discusses current research progress on sugar transporters involved in carbohydrate unloading and storage in sink organs. The roles of sugar transporters in crop yield and the accumulation of sugars are also discussed to highlight their contribution to efficient breeding.
