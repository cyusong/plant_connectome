In the present study we address the question which factors during the synthesis of zeaxanthin determine its capacity to act as a non-photochemical quencher of chlorophyll fluorescence. Our results show that zeaxanthin has to be synthesized in the presence of a transmembrane proton gradient. However, it is not essential that the proton gradient is generated by the light-driven electron transport. NPQ-effective zeaxanthin can also be formed by an artificial proton gradient in the dark due to ATP hydrolysis. Zeaxanthin that is synthesized in the dark in the absence of a proton gradient by the low pH-dependent activation of violaxanthin de-epoxidase is not able to induce NPQ. The second important factor during the synthesis of zeaxanthin is the pH-value of the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane. Here we show that the stromal side has to be neutral or slightly basic in order to generate zeaxanthin which is able to induce NPQ. Thylakoid membranes in reaction medium pH 5.2, which experience low pH-values on both sides of the membrane, are unable to generate NPQ-effective zeaxanthin, even in the presence of an additional light-driven proton gradient. Analysing the pigment contents of purified photosystem II light-harvesting complexes we are further able to show that the NPQ ineffectiveness of zeaxanthin formed in the absence of a proton gradient is not caused by changes in its rebinding to the light-harvesting proteins. Purified monomeric and trimeric light-harvesting complexes contain comparable amounts of zeaxanthin when they are isolated from thylakoid membranes enriched in either NPQ-effective or ineffective zeaxanthin.

proton gradient: !synthesizes! NPQ-effective zeaxanthin 
stromal side pH: !determines! NPQ-effectiveness of zeaxanthin 
low pH: !prevents! NPQ-effectiveness of zeaxanthin 
light-harvesting proteins: !bind! NPQ-effective/ineffective zeaxanthin
