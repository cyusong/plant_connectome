Increasing grain yield is an endless challenge for cereal crop breeding. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), grain number is controlled mainly by <i>Six-rowed spike 1</i> (<i>Vrs1</i>), which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper class I transcription factor. However, little is known about the genetic basis of grain size. Here, we show that extreme suppression of lateral florets contributes to enlarged grains in <i>deficiens</i> barley. Through a combination of fine-mapping and resequencing of <i>deficiens</i> mutants, we have identified that a single amino acid substitution at a putative phosphorylation site in VRS1 is responsible for the <i>deficiens</i> phenotype. <i>deficiens</i> mutant alleles confer an increase in grain size, a reduction in plant height, and a significant increase in thousand grain weight in contemporary cultivated germplasm. Haplotype analysis revealed that barley carrying the <i>deficiens</i> allele (<i>Vrs1.t1</i>) originated from two-rowed types carrying the <i>Vrs1.b2</i> allele, predominantly found in germplasm from northern Africa. In situ hybridization of <i>histone H4</i>, a marker for cell cycle or proliferation, showed weaker expression in the lateral spikelets compared with central spikelets in <i>deficiens</i> Transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of <i>histone</i> superfamily genes were up-regulated in the <i>deficiens</i> mutant, suggesting that enhanced cell proliferation in the central spikelet may contribute to larger grains. Our data suggest that grain yield can be improved by suppressing the development of specific organs that are not positively involved in sink/source relationships.
