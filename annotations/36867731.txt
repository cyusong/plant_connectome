The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is an ancient and highly conserved mutualism between plant and fungal symbionts, in which a highly specialized membrane-delimited fungal arbuscule acts as the symbiotic interface for nutrient exchange and signaling. As a ubiquitous means of biomolecule transport and intercellular communication, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are likely to play a role in this intimate cross-kingdom symbiosis, yet, there is a lack of research investigating the importance of EVs in AM symbiosis despite known roles in microbial interactions in both animal and plant pathosystems. Clarifying the current understanding of EVs in this symbiosis in light of recent ultrastructural observations is paramount to guiding future investigations in the field, and, to this end, this review summarizes recent research investigating these areas. Namely, this review discusses the available knowledge regarding biogenesis pathways and marker proteins associated with the various plant EV subclasses, EV trafficking pathways during symbiosis, and the endocytic mechanisms implicated in the uptake of these EVs.
