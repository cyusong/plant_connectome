A putative powdery mildew effector can elicit defense responses including reactive oxygen species and callose accumulations in model plants Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana and host plant Hevea brasiliensis. Powdery mildew fungi cause severe diseases in many agricultural plants, such as the mildew fungus Erysiphe quercicola infecting the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), causing latex yield losses. However, effectors of E. quercicola were rarely functionally characterized. In this study, we identified a highly specific candidate-secreted effector protein, EqCSEP04187, from E. quercicola. This putative effector is expressed at the late stage but not the early stage during infection. The constitutive expression of EqCSEP04187 in model plants Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana elicited defense responses, as did transient expression of EqCSEP04187 in protoplasts of H. brasiliensis. Introducing EqCSEP04187 into another H. brasiliensis-associated fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, inhibited H. brasiliensis infection, and infection by E. quercicola was decreased in the A. thaliana eds1 mutant expressing EqCSEP04187. Further analysis suggests that these reductions in infection were the consequences of EqCSEP04187 eliciting defense responses. Our study suggests that this putative effector has elicitor activity that can improve plant resistance.
