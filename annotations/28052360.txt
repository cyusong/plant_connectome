These questions concern either traits only found in members of the Ranunculales or traits that have convergently evolved in other large clades of flowering plants. We present recent results obtained on floral organ identity and number, symmetry evolution and spur formation in Ranunculales species. We discuss benefits and future prospects of evo-devo studies in Ranunculales, which can provide the opportunity to decipher the genetic architecture of novel floral traits and also to appraise the degree of conservation of genetic mechanisms involved in homoplasious traits.
