Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important gas signal molecule, but little is known about its signal mechanism. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an important second messenger in plant cells, and its fluctuation in the cytoplasm causes downstream physiological responses. Our previous study found that H<sub>2</sub>S can induce the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). We also found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can further induce the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in guard cells by noninvasive micro-teat technology (NMT). This study confirmed that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in guard cells, resulting in stomatal closure. Thus, revealing a novel mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S promoting stomatal closure.

H<sub>2</sub>S: !induces! H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
ROS: !induces! Ca<sup>2+</sup>
Ca<sup>2+</sup>: !promotes! stomatal closure
