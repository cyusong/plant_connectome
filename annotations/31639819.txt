Agarwood is derived from wounds in Aquilaria trees and is widely used in traditional medicine, incense, and perfume. Sesquiterpenes are one of the main active components in agarwood and are known to be induced by wounding or injury; However, the molecular mechanisms by which wounding leads to sesquiterpene formation remain largely unknown. Agarwood sesquiterpene synthase 1 (ASS1) is one of key enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes and is a crucial jasmonate (JA)-responsive wound-inducible synthase. However, it is not known why ASS1 is not expressed in healthy trees and how its expression is induced as a result of wounding. Here, we report that ASS1 is a wound-induced gene with a promoter in which a 242-bp region (-973 to -731bp) is identified as the core sequence for responding to wound signals. AsWRKY44 binds directly to this region and represses ASS1 promoter activity. Down-regulation or disruption of AsWRKY44 can relieve the inhibition and activate ASS1 expression. In addition, AsWRKY44 is degraded and the expression of ASS1 is significantly up-regulated in response to exogenous application of methyl jasmonate. Thus, AsWRKY44 is a crucial negative regulator of wound-induced ASS1 transcription, and is central to the mechanism of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in agarwood.
