The circadian pacemaker in plants is a hierarchical multioscillator system that directs and maintains a 24-hr oscillation required for organism homeostasis and environmental fitness. Molecular clockwork within individual tissues and organs acts cell autonomously, showing differences in circadian expression of core oscillators and their target genes; there are functional dominance and coupling in the complex regulatory network. However, molecular characteristics of organ-specific clocks are still unknown. Here, we showed the detached shoot and root possess dynamic circadian protein-protein interactions between clock core components, periodicity in organs exhibits a difference. The period length difference between shoot and root was not remarkable in prr7-3 and prr7-3 prr9-1 mutants. In addition, the phase transition curve indicated that shoot and root clock respond differently to the resetting cues of ambient temperature. PRR9 and PRR7 compensate circadian period between 22°C and 28°C in shoot, not in root. The circadian rhythms of PRR9 or PRR7 transcript accumulation showed no difference at 22°C and 28°C in shoot, but differences were observed in root. In summary, our results reveal the specificity of dynamic circadian protein-protein interactions in organ-autonomous clocks and the critical roles of PRR9 and PRR7 in mechanisms regulating temperature compensation in aerial shoot system.
