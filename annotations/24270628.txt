Following studies on the transcriptome of pollen tubes of an agp6 agp11 Arabidopsis double null mutant, together with the knowledge that arabinogalactan protein (AGP) 6 is important for male gametogenesis and pollen germination, we sought to know whether AGP6 could be present in the vegetative cell wall or in the generative cell wall or in both. To that end, Arabidopsis plants were transformed with AGP6 gene sequence fused with Sirius fluorescent protein. Fluorescent blue light emission could be detected in the vegetative cell wall only. This result supports the model by which AGP6 and other pollen AGPs are probably important signaling molecules at the pollen tube apex.
