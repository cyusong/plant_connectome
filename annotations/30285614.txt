NAC proteins contribute to diverse plant developmental processes as well as tolerances to biotic and abiotic stresses. The pear genome had been decoded and provided the basis for the genome-wide analysis to find the evolution, duplication, gene structures and predicted functions of PpNAC transcription factors. A total of 185 PpNAC genes were found in pear, of which 148 were mapped on chromosomes while 37 were on unanchored scaffolds. Phylogeny split the NAC genes into 6 clades (Group1- Group6) with their sub clades (~ subgroup A to subgroup H) and each group displayed common motifs with no/minor change. The numbers of exons in each group varied from 1 to 12 with an average of 3 while 44 pairs from all groups showed their duplication events. qPCR and RNA-Seq data analyses in different pear cultivars/species revealed some predicted functions of PpNAC genes i.e. PpNACs 37, 61, 70 (2A), 53, 151(2D), 10, 92, 130 and 154 (3D) were potentially involved in bud endodormancy, PpNACs 61, 70 (2A), 172, 176 and 23 (4E) were associated with fruit pigmentations in blue light, PpNACs 127 (1E), 46 (1G) and 56 (5A) might be related to early, middle and late fruit developments respectively. Besides, all genes from subgroups 2D and 3D were found to be related with abiotic stress (cold, salt and drought) tolerances by targeting the stress responsive genes in pear. The present genome-wide analysis provided valuable information for understanding the classification, motif and gene structure, evolution and predicted functions of NAC gene family in pear as well as in higher plants. NAC TFs play diverse and multifunctional roles in biotic and abiotic stresses, growth and development and fruit ripening and pigmentation through multiple pathways in pear.
