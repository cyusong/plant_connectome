In most angiosperms, the inheritance of the mitochondria takes place in a typical maternal manner. However, very less information is available about if the existence of structural variations or not in mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) between maternal parents and their progenies. In order to find the answer, a stable rice backcross inbred line (BIL) population was derived from the crosses of Oryza glaberrima/Oryza sativa//Oryza sativa. The current study presents a comparative analysis of the mitogenomes between maternal parents and five BILs. There were recorded universal structural variations such as reversal, translocation, fusion, and fission among the BILs. The repeat-mediated recombination and non-homologous end-joining contributed virtually equal to the rearrangement of mitogenomes. Similarly, the relative order, copy-number, expression level, and RNA-editing rate of mitochondrial genes were also extensively varied among BILs. These novel findings unraveled an unusual mystery of the maternal inheritance and possible cause for heterogeneity of mitogenomes in rice population. The current piece of work will greatly develop our understanding of the plant nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction and their potential role in plant growth and developmental processes.
