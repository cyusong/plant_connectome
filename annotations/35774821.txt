Temperature is a major abiotic stress factor limiting plant growth and development during the early developmental stage. Information on carinata (<i>Brassica carinata</i> A. Braun) traits response to low and high temperatures is necessary for breeding or selecting genotypes suited for specific ecoregions, which is limited. In the present study, 12 carinata genotypes were evaluated under low (17/09°C), optimum (22/14°C), and high (27/19°C) day/night temperatures at the early developmental stage. This study quantified temperature effects on several physiological and morphological characteristics of 12-advanced carinata lines. High-temperature plants decreased (15%) the accumulation of flavonoids and increased the nitrogen balance index by 25%. Low-temperature treatment significantly inhibited the aboveground (plant height, leaf area, number, and shoot weight) and root (length, surface area, and weight) traits. Across all genotypes, the shoot weight decreased by 55% and the root weight by 49% under low temperature. On the other hand, the maximum proportion of biomass was partitioned to roots under low temperature than at the high temperature. A poor relationship (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.09) was found between low- and high-temperature indices, indicating differences in trait responses and tolerance mechanisms. AX17004 and AX17009 with higher root to shoot ratios might be suitable for late planting windows or regions with low-temperature spells. The two genotypes (AX17015 and AX17005) accumulated higher biomass under low- and high-temperature treatments can be used for planting in later summer or early winter. The identified low- and high-temperature stress-tolerant carinata genotypes could be a valuable resource for increasing stress tolerance during the early developmental stage.
