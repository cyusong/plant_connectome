In plants, the root is a typical sink organ that relies exclusively on the import of sugar from the aerial parts. Sucrose is delivered by the phloem to the most distant root tips and, en route to the tip, is used by the different root tissues for metabolism and storage. Besides, a certain portion of this carbon is exuded in the rhizosphere, supplied to beneficial microorganisms and diverted by parasitic microbes. The transport of sugars toward these numerous sinks either occurs symplastically through cell connections (plasmodesmata) or is apoplastically mediated through membrane transporters (MST, mononsaccharide tranporters, SUT/SUC, H+/sucrose transporters and SWEET, Sugar will eventually be exported transporters) that control monosaccharide and sucrose fluxes. Here, we review recent progresses on carbon partitioning within and outside roots, discussing membrane transporters involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic factors.

MST: !transports! Monosaccharides 
SUT/SUC: !transports! Sucrose 
H+/sucrose transporters: !transports! Sucrose 
SWEET: !transports! Sugar 
Plasmodesmata: !transports! Symplastically 
Biotic factors: !affects! Plant responses 
Abiotic factors: !affects! Plant responses
