Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is recognized as a crucial eukaryotic regulatory mechanism that controls a range of cellular processes during both development and adaptation to environmental changes. In Arabidopsis, the E2 conjugated enzymes UBIQUITIN CARRIER PROTEINs (UBCs) -1 and -2 mediate ubiquitination of H2B. Here, we elucidated the functions of UBC1 and -2 in salt-stress responses and revealed their downstream target genes. Real-time quantitative PCR assays showed that UBC1 and -2 positively regulated the salt-induced expression of MYB42 and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 4 (MPK4). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that H2Bub1 was enriched weakly on the chromatin of MYB42 and MPK4 in the ubc1,2 mutant. We further determined that UBC1/2-mediated H2Bub1 enhanced the level of histone H3 tri-methylated on K4 (H3K4me3) in the chromatin of MYB42 and MPK4 under salt-stress conditions. MPK4 interacted with and phosphorylated MYB42. The MPK4-mediated MYB42 phosphorylation enhanced the MYB42 protein stability and transcriptional activity under salt-stress conditions. We further showed that MYB42 directly bound to the SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 2 (SOS2) promoter and mediated the rapid induction of its expression after a salt treatment. Our results indicate that UBC1 and -2 positively regulate salt-stress responses by modulating MYB42-mediated SOS2 expression.
