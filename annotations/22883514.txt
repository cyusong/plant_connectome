['22883514', 'In eukaryotes, dolichols (C(70-120)) play indispensable roles as glycosyl carrier  lipids in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins on endoplasmic reticulum. In addition  to dolichols, seed plants have other types of Z,E-mixed polyisoprenoids termed  ficaprenol (tri-trans,poly-cis-polyprenol, C(45-75)) and betulaprenol  (di-trans,poly-cis-polyprenol, C(30-45) and C(>/=70)) in abundance. However, the  physiological significance of these polyprenols has not been elucidated because  of limited information regarding cis-prenyltransferases (cPTs) which catalyze the  formation of the structural backbone of Z,E-mixed polyisoprenoids. In the  comprehensive identification and characterization of cPT homologues from  Arabidopsis thaliana, AtHEPS was identified as a novel cis,trans-mixed  heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase. AtHEPS heterologously expressed in Escherichia  coli catalyzed the formation of C(35) polyisoprenoid as a major product,  independent of the chain lengths of all-trans allylic primer substrates. Kinetic  analyses revealed that farnesyl diphosphate was the most favorable for AtHEPS  among the allylic substrates tested suggesting that AtHEPS was responsible for  the formation of C(35) betulaprenol. AtHEPS partially suppressed the phenotypes  of a yeast cPT mutant deficient in the biosynthesis of dolichols. Moreover, in A.  thaliana cells, subcellular localization of AtHEPS on the endoplasmic reticulum  was shown by using green fluorescent protein fused proteins. However, a  cold-stress-inducible expression of AtHEPS suggested that AtHEPS and its product  might function in response to abiotic stresses rather than in cell maintenance as  a glycosyl carrier lipid on the endoplasmic reticulum.', '2012 Oct', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08742.x', 'Nakayama']
