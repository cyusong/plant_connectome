['25912720', 'Various environmental stresses limit plant growth, development, and reproductive  success. Plants have therefore evolved sophisticated adaptive responses to deal  with environmental challenges. The responses of plants to environmental stresses  are mainly mediated by abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and ABA-independent  signaling pathways. While these two pathways have been implicated to play  discrete roles in abiotic stress responses, accumulating evidence suggests that  they are also intertwined. Here, we report that an R2R3-type MYB transcription  factor, MYB96, integrates the ABA and cold signaling pathways. In addition to its  role in ABA-mediated drought responses, MYB96 is also induced by cold stress in  an ABA-independent manner and subsequently activates freezing tolerance. Notably,  MYB96 regulates HEPTAHELICAL PROTEIN (HHP) genes by binding to their promoters.  The HHP proteins, in turn, interact with C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR (CBF) upstream  regulators, such as INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1), ICE2, and  CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 3 (CAMTA3). The specific interactive  networks of HHPs with the CBF upstream regulators are necessary to facilitate  transcriptional activation of the CBF regulon under stressful conditions.  Together, the MYB96-HHP module integrates ABA-dependent and ABA-independent  signals and activates the CBF pathway, ensuring plant adaptation to a wide range  of adverse environmental fluctuations.', '2015 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12866', 'Seo']
