['35022409', 'Nucleosomal acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4) is an essential transcriptional  coactivator in eukaryotes, but remains poorly characterized in plants. Here, we  describe Arabidopsis homologs of the NuA4 scaffold proteins Enhancer of  Polycomb-Like 1 (AtEPL1) and Esa1-Associated Factor 1 (AtEAF1). Loss of AtEAF1  results in inhibition of growth and chloroplast development. These effects are  stronger in the Atepl1 mutant and are further enhanced by loss of Golden2-Like  (GLK) transcription factors, suggesting that NuA4 activates nuclear plastid genes  alongside GLK. We demonstrate that AtEPL1 is necessary for nucleosomal  acetylation of histones H4 and H2A.Z by NuA4 in vitro. These chromatin marks are  diminished genome-wide in Atepl1, while another active chromatin mark, H3K9  acetylation (H3K9ac), is locally enhanced. Expression of many chloroplast-related  genes depends on NuA4, as they are downregulated with loss of H4ac and H2A.Zac.  Finally, we demonstrate that NuA4 promotes H2A.Z deposition and by doing so  prevents spurious activation of stress response genes.', '2022 Jan 12', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-021-27882-5', 'ORCID:']
