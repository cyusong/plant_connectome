Climate change adversely affects plant nutrition, which serves as a major hurdle in the production of enough nutritious food to meet the needs of the growing global population. Here, we discuss how various climatic stressors impact nutrient homeostasis and how natural variation studies can yield resilient crop production systems to ensure future food security.
