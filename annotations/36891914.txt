Auxins are a class of phytohormones with roles involved in the establishment and maintenance of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS). Auxin response factors (ARFs) and Auxin/Indole-acetic acids (AUX/IAAs), as two transcription factors of the auxin signaling pathway, coregulate the transcription of auxin response genes. However, the interrelation and regulatory mechanism of ARFs and AUX/IAAs in regulating AMS are still unclear. In this study, we found that the content of auxin in tomato roots increased sharply and revealed the importance of the auxin signaling pathway in the early stage of AMS. Notably, SlARF6 was found to play a negative role in AMF colonization. Silencing SlARF6 significantly increased the expression of AM-marker genes, as well as AMF-induced phosphorus uptake. SlIAA23 could interact with SlARF6 in vivo and in vitro, and promoted the AMS and phosphorus uptake. Interestingly, SlARF6 and SlIAA23 played a contrary role in strigolactone (SL) synthesis and accumulation in AMF-colonized roots of tomato plants. SlARF6 could directly bind to the AuxRE motif of the SlCCD8 promoter and inhibited its transcription, however, this effect was attenuated by SlIAA23 through interaction with SlARF6. Our results suggest that SlIAA23-SlARF6 coregulated tomato-AMS via an SL-dependent pathway, thus affecting phosphorus uptake in tomato plants.
