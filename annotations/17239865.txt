Monoclonal antibodies against the K(+) channel KAT1 of Arabidopsis thaliana, a low abundance, plant plasma membrane protein, were generated by genetic immunisation to avoid the time and labour consuming purification of native or recombinant proteins and peptides usually necessary for conventional immunisation techniques. The resulting polyclonal and monoclonal antibody sera recognised a single protein band in a microsomal fraction of wild-type A. thaliana leaves and in membrane fractions of transgenic yeast cells and tobacco plants expressing the KAT1 protein. Therefore, genetic immunisation is suitable for generating monoclonal antibodies against plant proteins and particularly, against plant membrane proteins of low abundance.
