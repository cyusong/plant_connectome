The maize inbred line W22 has lower herbivore-induced volatile production than B73 but both fall armyworm larvae and the wasps that parasitize them prefer W22 over B73. Maize inbred line W22 is an important resource for genetic studies due to the availability of the UniformMu mutant population and a complete genome sequence. In this study, we assessed the suitability of W22 as a model for tritrophic interactions between maize, Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and the parasitoid wasp Cotesia marginiventris. W22 was found to be a good model for studying the interaction as S. frugiperda prefers W22 over B73 and a higher parasitism rate by C. marginiventris was observed on W22 compared to the inbred line B73. W22 also produced lower amounts of many herbivore-induced volatile terpenes and indole emission upon treatment with S. frugiperda oral secretions. We propose that some of the major herbivore-induced terpene volatiles are perhaps impeding S. frugiperda and C. marginiventris preference and that as yet unidentified compounds are produced at low abundance may be positively impacting these interactions.
