Cold is a common abiotic stress that seriously affects plant growth and development. MYB transcription factors are regulatory molecules that play important roles in various biological processes. We have previously demonstrated that SlMYB15 positively regulates cold tolerance in tomato. However, the underlying mechanism of SlMYB15-induced cold tolerance remains largely unexplored. Here, cold-induced SlMYB15 was found to be targeted by Solanum lycopersicum (sly)-miR156e-3p, which was decreased by cold stimulus in tomato. Tomato plants overexpressing sly-MIR156e-3p displayed significant enhancement in susceptibility to cold stress, while silencing of sly-miR156e-3p by an artificial microRNA interference strategy caused tomato plants to be more tolerant to cold. Moreover, both overexpression of SlMYB15 and silencing of sly-miR156e-3p increased the accumulation of ABA. SlMYB15 directly binds to the promoter regions of ABA biosynthesis and signalling genes, SlNCED1 and SlABF4, resulting in enhanced cold tolerance. Further experiments showed that SlMYB15 and sly-miR156e-3p also coordinated the cold tolerance of tomato via the reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling pathway, as reflected by the increased expression of SlRBOH1, enhanced H2O2 and O2•-accumulation, and amplified activity of antioxidant enzymes in SlMYB15-overexpressing and sly-miR156e-3p-silenced plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SlMYB15 targeted by sly-miR156e-3p confers higher survivability to cold stress via ABA and ROS signals. This study provides valuable information for breeding improved crop cultivars better equipped with cold tolerance.
