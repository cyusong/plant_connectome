<i>Diaporthe</i> spp. are critical plant pathogens that cause wood cankers, wilt, dieback, and fruit rot in a wide variety of economic plant hosts and are regarded as one of the most acute threats faced by the kiwifruit industry worldwide. <i>Diaporthe phragmitis</i> NJD1 is a highly pathogenic isolate of soft rot of kiwifruit. Here, we present a high-quality genome-wide sequence of <i>D. phragmitis</i> NJD1 that was assembled into 28 contigs containing a total size of 58.33 Mb and N<sub>50</sub> length of 3.55 Mb. These results lay a solid foundation for understanding host-pathogen interaction and improving disease management strategies.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
