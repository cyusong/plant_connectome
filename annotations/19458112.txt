['19458112', 'The mitosis-to-endocycle transition requires the controlled inactivation of M  phase-associated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Previously, the B-type  CDKB1;1 was identified as an important negative regulator of endocycle onset.  Here, we demonstrate that CDKB1;1 copurifies and associates with the A2-type  cyclin CYCA2;3. Coexpression of CYCA2;3 with CDKB1;1 triggered ectopic cell  divisions and inhibited endoreduplication. Moreover, the enhanced  endoreduplication phenotype observed after overexpression of a dominant-negative  allele of CDKB1;1 could be partially complemented by CYCA2;3 co-overexpression,  illustrating that both subunits unite in vivo to form a functional complex.  CYCA2;3 protein stability was found to be controlled by CCS52A1, an activator of  the anaphase-promoting complex. We conclude that CCS52A1 participates in  endocycle onset by down-regulating CDKB1;1 activity through the destruction of  CYCA2;3.', '2009 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.140269', 'De']
