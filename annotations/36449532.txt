Plants contain many nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins that are postulated to function as intracellular immune receptors but do not yet have an identified function during plant-pathogen interactions. SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC1) is one such NLR protein of the Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) type, despite its well-characterized gain-of-function activity and its involvement in autoimmunity in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we investigated the role of SNC1 in natural plant-pathogen interactions and genetically tested the importance of the enzymatic activities of its TIR domain for its function. The SNC1 loss-of-function mutants were more susceptible to avirulent bacterial pathogen strains of Pseudomonas syringae containing specific effectors, especially under constant light growth condition. The mutants also had reduced defense gene expression induction and hypersensitive responses upon infection by avirulent pathogens under constant light growth condition. In addition, genetic and biochemical studies supported that the TIR enzymatic activity of SNC1 is required for its gain-of-function activity. In sum, our study uncovers the role of SNC1 as an amplifier of plant defense responses during natural plant-pathogen interactions and indicates its use of enzymatic activity and intermolecular interactions for triggering autoimmune responses.
