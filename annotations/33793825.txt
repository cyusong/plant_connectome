In plants, chitin-triggered immunity is one of the first lines of defense against fungi, but phytopathogenic fungi have developed different strategies to prevent the recognition of chitin. Obligate biotrophs such as powdery mildew fungi suppress the activation of host responses; however, little is known about how these fungi subvert the immunity elicited by chitin. During epiphytic growth, the cucurbit powdery mildew fungus Podosphaera xanthii expresses a family of candidate effector genes comprising nine members with an unknown function. In this work, we examine the role of these candidates in the infection of melon (Cucumis melo L.) plants, using gene expression analysis, RNAi silencing assays, protein modeling and protein-ligand predictions, enzymatic assays, and protein localization studies. Our results show that these proteins are chitinases that are released at pathogen penetration sites to break down immunogenic chitin oligomers, thus preventing the activation of chitin-triggered immunity. In addition, these effectors, designated effectors with chitinase activity (EWCAs), are widely distributed in pathogenic fungi. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which fungi suppress plant immunity and reinforce the idea that preventing the perception of chitin by the host is mandatory for survival and development of fungi in plant environments.
