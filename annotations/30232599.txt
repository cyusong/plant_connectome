Transcriptome analysis was performed on the roots of susceptible and resistant sweetpotato cultivars infected with the major root-knot nematode species Meloidogyne incognita. In addition, we identified a transcription factor-mediated defense signaling pathway that might function in sweetpotato-nematode interactions. Root-knot nematodes (RKNs, Meloidogyne spp.) are important sedentary endoparasites of many agricultural crop plants that significantly reduce production in field-grown sweetpotato. To date, no studies involving gene expression profiling in sweetpotato during RKN infection have been reported. Therefore, in the present study, transcriptome analysis was performed on the roots of susceptible (cv. Yulmi) and resistant (cv. Juhwangmi) sweetpotato cultivars infected with the widespread, major RKN species Meloidogyne incognita. Using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, we generated 455,295,628 pair-end reads from the fibrous roots of both cultivars, which were assembled into 74,733 transcripts. A number of common and unique genes were differentially expressed in susceptible vs. resistant cultivars as a result of RKN infection. We assigned the differentially expressed genes into gene ontology categories and used MapMan annotation to predict their functional roles and associated biological processes. The candidate genes including hormonal signaling-related transcription factors and pathogenesis-related genes that could contribute to protection against RKN infection in sweetpotato roots were identified and sweetpotato-nematode interactions involved in resistance are discussed.
