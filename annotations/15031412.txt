['15031412', 'The biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters is a highly regulated process involving  several proteins. Among them, so-called scaffold proteins play pivotal roles in  both the assembly and delivery of iron-sulfur clusters. Here, we report the  identification of two chloroplast-localized NifU-like proteins, AtCnfU-V and  AtCnfU-IVb, from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) with high sequence similarity  to a cyanobacterial NifU-like protein that was proposed to serve as a molecular  scaffold. AtCnfU-V is constitutively expressed in several tissues of Arabidopsis,  whereas the expression of AtCnfU-IVb is prominent in the aerial parts. Mutant  Arabidopsis lacking AtCnfU-V exhibited a dwarf phenotype with faint pale-green  leaves and had drastically impaired photosystem I accumulation. Chloroplasts in  the mutants also showed a decrease in both the amount of ferredoxin, a major  electron carrier of the stroma that contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster, and in the in  vitro activity of iron-sulfur cluster insertion into apo-ferredoxin. When  expressed in Escherichia coli cells, AtCnfU-V formed a homodimer carrying a  [2Fe-2S]-like cluster, and this cluster could be transferred to apo-ferredoxin in  vitro to form holo-ferredoxin. We propose that AtCnfU has an important function  as a molecular scaffold for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis in chloroplasts and  thereby is required for biogenesis of ferredoxin and photosystem I.', '2004 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.020511', 'Nakai']
