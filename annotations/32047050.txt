['32047050', 'The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cyclin-dependent kinase G1 (CDKG1) is  necessary for recombination and synapsis during male meiosis at high ambient  temperature. In the cdkg1-1 mutant, synapsis is impaired and there is a dramatic  reduction in the number of class I crossovers, resulting in univalents at  metaphase I and pollen sterility. Here, we demonstrate that CDKG1 is necessary  for the processing of recombination intermediates in the canonical ZMM  recombination pathway and that loss of CDKG1 results in increased class II  crossovers. While synapsis and events associated with class I crossovers are  severely compromised in a cdkg1-1 mutant, they can be restored by increasing the  number of recombination intermediates in the double cdkg1-1 fancm-1 mutant.  Despite this, recombination intermediates are not correctly resolved, leading to  the formation of chromosome aggregates at metaphase I. Our results show that  CDKG1 acts early in the recombination process and is necessary to stabilize  recombination intermediates. Finally, we show that the effect on recombination is  not restricted to meiosis and that CDKG1 is also required for normal levels of  DNA damage-induced homologous recombination in somatic tissues.', '2020 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00942', 'ORCID:']
