<i>Vanilla planifolia</i> is an orchid of cultural and economic value. However, its cultivation in many tropical countries is threatened by water stress. In contrast, <i>V. pompona</i> is a species that is tolerant of prolonged periods of drought. Due to the need for plants' resistant to water stress, the use of hybrids of these two species is considered. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the morphological and physio-chemical responses of in vitro vanilla seedlings of the parental genotype <i>V. planifolia</i>, and the hybrids <i>V. planifolia</i> × <i>V. pompona</i> and <i>V. pompona</i> × <i>V. planifolia,</i> which were then exposed over five weeks to polyethylene glycol-induced water stress (-0.49 mPa). Stem and root length, relative growth rate, number of leaves and roots, stomatal conductance, specific leaf area, and leaf water content were determined. Metabolites potentially associated with the response to water stress were identified in leaves, through untargeted and targeted metabolomics. Both hybrids exhibited a smaller decrease in the morphophysiological responses compared to <i>V. planifolia</i> and exhibited an enrichment of metabolites such as carbohydrates, amino acids, purines, phenols, and organic acids. Hybrids of these two species are considered as a potential alternative to the traditional cultivation of vanilla to face drought in a global warming scenario.
