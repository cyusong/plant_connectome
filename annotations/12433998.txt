['12433998', 'The Arabidopsis SUPERMAN (SUP) gene has been shown to be important in maintaining  the boundary between stamens and carpels, and is presumed to act by regulating  cell proliferation. In this work, we show that the SUP protein, which contains a  single Cys2-His2 zinc finger domain including the QALGGH sequence, highly  conserved in the plant zinc finger proteins, binds DNA. Using a series of  deletion mutants, it was determined that the minimal domain required for specific  DNA binding (residues 15-78) includes the single zinc finger and two basic  regions located on either side of this motif. Furthermore, amino acid  substitutions in the zinc finger or in the basic regions, including a mutation  that knocks out the function of the SUP protein in vivo (glycine 63 to  aspartate), have been found to abolish the activity of the SUP DNA-binding  domain. These results strongly suggest that the SUP protein functions in vivo by  acting as a DNA-binding protein, likely involved in transcriptional regulation.  The association of both an N-terminal and a C-terminal basic region with a single  Cys2-His2 zinc finger represents a novel DNA-binding motif suggesting that the  mechanism of DNA recognition adopted by the SUP protein is different from that  described so far in other zinc finger proteins.', '2002 Nov 15', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkf613', 'Pedone']
