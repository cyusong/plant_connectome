['23939432', 'Ca(2+)-dependent oxidation of cytosolic NADPH is mediated by NDB1, which is an  external type II NADPH dehydrogenase in the plant mitochondrial electron  transport chain. Using RNA interference, the NDB1 transcript was suppressed by  80% in Arabidopsis thaliana plants, and external Ca(2+)-dependent NADPH  dehydrogenase activity became undetectable in isolated mitochondria. This was  linked to a decreased level of NADP(+) in rosettes of the transgenic lines.  Sterile-grown transgenic seedlings displayed decreased growth specifically on  glucose, and respiratory metabolism of (14)C-glucose was increased. On soil,  NDB1-suppressing plants had a decreased vegetative biomass, but leaf maximum  quantum efficiency of photosystem II and CO2 assimilation rates, as well as total  respiration, were similar to the wild-type. The in vivo alternative oxidase  activity and capacity were also similar in all genotypes. Metabolic profiling  revealed decreased levels of sugars, citric acid cycle intermediates, and amino  acids in the transgenic lines. The NDB1-suppression induced transcriptomic  changes associated with protein synthesis and glucosinolate and jasmonate  metabolism. The transcriptomic changes also overlapped with changes observed in a  mutant lacking ABAINSENSITIVE4 and in A. thaliana overexpressing stress tolerance  genes from rice. The results thus indicate that A. thaliana NDB1 modulates  NADP(H) reduction levels, which in turn affect central metabolism and growth, and  interact with defense signaling.', '2014 Feb', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sst115', 'Rasmusson']
