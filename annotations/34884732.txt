The photoperiodic flowering pathway is essential for plant reproduction. As blue and ultraviolet-A light receptors, cryptochromes play an important role in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering. <i>Lilium × formolongi</i> is an important cut flower that flowers within a year after seed propagation. Floral induction is highly sensitive to photoperiod. In this study, we isolated the <i>CRYPTOCHROME2</i> gene (<i>LfCRY2</i>) from <i>L. × formolongi</i>. The predicted LfCRY2 protein was highly homologous to other CRY2 proteins. The transcription of <i>LfCRY2</i> was induced by blue light. <i>LfCRY2</i> exhibits its highest diurnal expression during the floral induction stage under both long-day and short-day photoperiods. Overexpression of <i>LfCRY2</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> promoted flowering under long days but not short days, and inhibited hypocotyl elongation under blue light. Furthermore, LfCRY2 was located in the nucleus and could interact with <i>L. × formolongi</i> CONSTANS-like 9 (LfCOL9) and <i>A. thaliana</i> CRY-interacting basic-helix-loop-helix 1 (AtCIB1) in both yeast and onion cells, which supports the hypothesis that <i>LfCRY2</i> hastens the floral transition via the CIB1-CO pathway in a manner similar to <i>AtCRY2</i>. These results provide evidence that <i>LfCRY2</i> plays a vital role in promoting flowering under long days in <i>L. × formolongi</i>.
