['18984675', 'The plant signaling molecule salicylic acid (SA) and/or xenobiotic chemicals like  the auxin mimic 2,4-D induce transcriptional activation of defense- and  stress-related genes that contain activation sequence-1 (as-1)-like cis-elements  in their promoters. as-1-like sequences are recognized by basic/leucine zipper  transcription factors of the TGA family. Expression of genes related to the  SA-dependent defense program systemic acquired resistance requires the  TGA-interacting protein NPR1. However, a number of as-1-containing promoters can  be activated independently from NPR1. Here, we report the identification of  Arabidopsis thaliana SCARECROW-like 14 (SCL14), a member of the GRAS family of  regulatory proteins, as a TGA-interacting protein that is required for the  activation of TGA-dependent but NPR1-independent SA- and 2,4-D-inducible  promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that class II TGA  factors TGA2, TGA5, and/or TGA6 are needed to recruit SCL14 to promoters of  selected SCL14 target genes identified by whole-genome transcript profiling  experiments. The coding regions and the expression profiles of the  SCL14-dependent genes imply that they might be involved in the detoxification of  xenobiotics and possibly endogenous harmful metabolites. Consistently, plants  ectopically expressing SCL14 showed increased tolerance to toxic doses of the  chemicals isonicotinic acid and 2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid, whereas the scl14 and  the tga2 tga5 tga6 mutants were more susceptible. Hence, the TGA/SCL14 complex  seems to be involved in the activation of a general broad-spectrum detoxification  network upon challenge of plants with xenobiotics.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.058974', 'Gatz']
