['28687624', 'Coordinated cell polarization in developing tissues is a recurrent theme in  multicellular organisms. In plants, a directional distribution of the plant  hormone auxin is at the core of many developmental programs. A feedback  regulation of auxin on the polarized localization of PIN auxin transporters in  individual cells has been proposed as a self-organizing mechanism for coordinated  tissue polarization, but the molecular mechanisms linking auxin signalling to  PIN-dependent auxin transport remain unknown. We used a microarray-based approach  to find regulators of the auxin-induced PIN relocation in Arabidopsis thaliana  root, and identified a subset of a family of phosphatidylinositol transfer  proteins (PITPs), the PATELLINs (PATLs). Here, we show that PATLs are expressed  in partially overlapping cell types in different tissues going through mitosis or  initiating differentiation programs. PATLs are plasma membrane-associated  proteins accumulated in Arabidopsis embryos, primary roots, lateral root  primordia and developing stomata. Higher order patl mutants display reduced PIN1  repolarization in response to auxin, shorter root apical meristem, and drastic  defects in embryo and seedling development. This suggests that PATLs play a  redundant and crucial role in polarity and patterning in Arabidopsis.', '2018 Jan 29', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.204198', 'ORCID:']
