This paper focuses on image segmentation, image correction and spatial-spectral dimensional denoising of images in hyperspectral image preprocessing to improve the classification accuracy of hyperspectral images. Firstly, the images were filtered and segmented by using spectral angle and principal component analysis, and the segmented results are intersected and then used to mask the hyperspectral images. Hyperspectral images with a excellent segmentation result was obtained. Secondly, the standard reflectance plates with reflectance of 2 and 98% were used as <i>a priori</i> spectral information for image correction of samples with known true spectral information. The mean square error between the corrected and calibrated spectra is less than 0.0001. Comparing with the black-and-white correction method, the classification model constructed based on this method has higher classification accuracy. Finally, the convolution kernel of the one-dimensional Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter was extended into a two-dimensional convolution kernel to perform joint spatial-spectral dimensional filtering (TSG) on the hyperspectral images. The SG filter (<i>m</i> = 7,<i>n</i> = 3) and TSG filter (<i>m</i> = 3,<i>n</i> = 4) were applied to the hyperspectral image of Pavia University and the quality of the hyperspectral image was evaluated. It was found that the TSG filter retained most of the original features while the noise information of the filtered hyperspectral image was less. The hyperspectral images of sample 1-1 and sample 1-2 were processed by the image segmentation and image correction methods proposed in this paper. Then the classification models based on SG filtering and TSG filtering hyperspectral images were constructed, respectively. The results showed that the TSG filter-based model had higher classification accuracy and the classification accuracy is more than 98%.
