Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance refers to the transmission of epigenetic information through the germline. While it has been observed in plants, nematodes and fruit flies, its occurrence in mammals-and humans in particular-is the matter of controversial debate, mostly because the study of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is confounded by genetic, ecological and cultural inheritance. In this comment, I discuss the phenomenon of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and the difficulty of providing conclusive proof for it in experimental and observational studies.

Germline: !transmits! Epigenetic Information
Plants/Nematodes/Fruit Flies: !exhibit! Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance
Mammals/Humans: !debated to exhibit! Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance
Experimental/Observational Studies: !confound! Proof of Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance
