['15367721', 'We have isolated a new mutant, hanaba taranu (han), which affects both flower and  shoot apical meristem (SAM) development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutants have  fused sepals and reduced organ numbers in all four whorls, especially in the 2nd  (petal) and 3rd (stamen) whorls. han meristems can become flatter or smaller than  in the wild type. HAN encodes a GATA-3-like transcription factor with a single  zinc finger domain. HAN is transcribed at the boundaries between the meristem and  its newly initiated organ primordia and at the boundaries between different  floral whorls. It is also expressed in vascular tissues, developing ovules and  stamens, and in the embryo. han interacts strongly with clavata (clv) mutations  (clv1, clv2, and clv3), resulting in highly fasciated SAMs, and we find that WUS  expression is altered in han mutants from early embryogenesis. In addition, HAN  is ectopically expressed both in clv1 and clv3 mutants. We propose that HAN is  normally required for establishing organ boundaries in shoots and flowers and for  controlling the number and position of WUS-expressing cells. Ectopic HAN  expression causes growth retardation, aberrant cell division patterns, and loss  of meristem activity, suggesting that HAN is involved in controlling cell  proliferation and differentiation.', '2004 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.024869', 'Meyerowitz']
