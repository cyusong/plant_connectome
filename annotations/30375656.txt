Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) not only provides a supplement to primary grain crops in China but also has high medicinal value, by virtue of its rich content of flavonoids possessing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Light is an important environmental factor that can regulate the synthesis of plant secondary metabolites. In this study, we treated tartary buckwheat seedlings with different wavelengths of light and found that red and blue light could increase the content of flavonoids and the expression of genes involved in flavonoid synthesis pathways. Through coexpression analysis, we identified a new MYB transcription factor (FtMYB116) that can be induced by red and blue light. Yeast one-hybrid assays and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that FtMYB116 binds directly to the promoter region of flavonoid-3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), and a transient luciferase activity assay indicated that FtMYB116 can induce F3'H expression. After transforming FtMYB116 into the hairy roots of tartary buckwheat, we observed significant increases in the content of rutin and quercetin. Collectively, our results indicate that red and blue light promote an increase in flavonoid content in tartary buckwheat seedlings; we also identified a new MYB transcription factor, FtMYB116, that promotes the accumulation of rutin via direct activation of F3'H expression.

Light: !induces! FtMYB116
FtMYB116: !binds to! F3'H promoter
FtMYB116: !activates! F3'H expression
F3'H: !synthesizes! Rutin and Quercetin
