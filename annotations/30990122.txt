Cymbidium aloifolium is known for its ornamental and medicinal values. It has been listed as threatened orchid species. In this study, in vitro propagated C. aloifolium plantlets were interacted with the Piriformospora indica. The growth assay was performed for 45 days; the plant growth pattern such as number and length of roots and shoots were measured. Microscopic study of the root section stained by trypan blue was done to detect the peloton formation. The methanol extracts of the fungal colonized plant as well as uncolonized (control) plant were prepared and various metabolites were identified by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. Acclimatization was done in a substrate composition of coco peat: gravel: charcoal in ratio 2:2:1. P. indica-colonized plantlet showed the highest growth with the formation of clamdospore in the root section. The growth regulator such as auxin, ascorbic acid, andrographolide, hexadecanoic acid, and DL-proline were identified. After three months of field transfer, plantlet colonized by P. indica survived and remained healthy as compared to uncolonized control plantlet.
