['11094978', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ubiquitous DNA-damaging agents, and the repair  of oxidative DNA lesions is essential to prevent mutations and cell death.  Escherichia coli endonuclease III is the prototype repair enzyme for removal of  oxidized pyrimidines from DNA. A database homology search identified a genomic  sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a predicted protein with sequence  similarity to E. coli endonuclease III. We cloned, sequenced and expressed the  corresponding cDNA, which encodes a 39.1 kDa protein containing several sequence  motifs conserved in endonuclease III homologues, including an iron-sulfur cluster  domain and critical residues at the active site. The protein, designated AtNTH1,  was over-expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. AtNTH1  exhibits DNA-glycosylase activity on different types of DNA substrates with  pyrimidine damage, being able to release both urea and thymine glycol from  double-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides. The enzyme also possesses an  apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity on UV- and gamma-irradiated DNA substrates.  The AtNTH1 gene contains 10 introns and 11 exons and is widely expressed in  different plant tissues. Our results suggest that AtNTH1 is a structural and  functional homologue of endonuclease III and probably plays a major role in plant  defence against oxidative DNA damage.', '2000 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006429114451', 'Ariza']
