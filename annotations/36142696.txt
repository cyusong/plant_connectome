Columnar apple was an important germplasm resource to develop compact cultivars for labor-saving cultivation and to study fruit tree architecture. <i>MdCoL</i> is a strong candidate gene for controlling the columnar phenotype in apple. In this study, a 2000 bp upstream region of <i>MdCoL</i> was cloned as a full-length promoter, named <i>MdCoLp1</i>. To gain a better understanding of the characterization of the <i>MdCoL</i> promoter, cis-acting elements and the binding sites of transcription factors were predicted and analyzed, and four binary expression vectors consisting of the GUS reporter gene under the control of the <i>MdCoL</i> promoter was transformed into <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to analyze the response to abscisic acid (ABA), brassinosteroid (BR) and gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) of <i>MdCoL</i> promoters. Multiple transcription factors involving TCP, BEL1 and BES1/BZR1 and other transcription factor (TF) binding sites were predicted on the promoter of <i>MdCoL</i>. Histochemical staining showed that both full-length and 5' truncated promoters could initiate GUS expression. The GUS activity was the most in leaf and stem, and mainly concentrated in the fibrovascular tissue, followed by root, and the least activity was observed in silique and flower. In addition, <i>MdCoL</i> expression was mainly localized in the quiescent center (QC) and lateral root growing point of root tip and the vascular tissue of stem and leaf by in situ hybridization. The results of exogenous hormones treatment showed that ABA and BR could activate the activity of the <i>MdCoL</i> promoter, while GA<sub>3</sub> had opposite effects. In columnar apple seedlings, ABA treatment could upregulate the expression of <i>MdCoL</i>, but GA<sub>3</sub> and BR restrained the transcription level of <i>MdCoL</i>. These results provide the foundation for deciphering the regulatory network of hormones affecting <i>MdCoL</i> transcription.
