Phytochromes are red/far-red reversible photoreceptors essential for plant growth and development. Phytochrome signaling is mediated by the physiologically active far-red-absorbing Pfr form that can be inactivated to the red-absorbing Pr ground state by light-dependent photoconversion or by light-independent thermal reversion, also termed dark reversion. Although the term "dark reversion" is justified by historical reasons and frequently used in the literature, "thermal reversion" more appropriately describes the process of light-independent but temperature-regulated Pfr relaxation that not only occurs in darkness but also in light and is used throughout the review. Thermal reversion is a critical parameter for the light sensitivity of phytochrome-mediated responses and has been studied for decades, often resulting in contradictory findings. Thermal reversion is an intrinsic property of the phytochrome molecules but can be modulated by intra- and intermolecular interactions, as well as biochemical modifications, such as phosphorylation. In this review, we outline the research history of phytochrome thermal reversion, highlighting important predictions that have been made before knowing the molecular basis. We further summarize and discuss recent findings about the molecular mechanisms regulating phytochrome thermal reversion and its functional roles in light and temperature sensing in plants.
