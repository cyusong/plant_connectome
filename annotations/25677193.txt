Glucuronosyldiacylglycerol (GlcADG) is a plant glycolipid that accumulates in Arabidopsis and rice in response to phosphorus (P) starvation. It has been suggested that GlcADG functions to mitigate the stress induced by P depletion. Biosynthesis of GlcADG requires sulfolipid (SQDG) synthase, which is coded for in plant genomes. This indicates the possibility that GlcADG may be a general constituent of membrane lipids in plants. In this study, we investigated the SQDG synthases found in the genomes of higher plants, ferns, mosses, algae and cyanobacteria. In addition, we analyzed GlcADG accumulation, and the expression of SQDG synthase homologs in tomato and soybean plants grown under P-limited conditions. LC-MS analysis of lipids from these plants confirmed that GlcADG accumulated during P deprivation, as previously observed in Arabidopsis and rice. We also observed upregulation of SQDG synthase transcripts in these plants during P deprivation. These data suggest that GlcADG is present not only in model plants, but also in various other plant species, and that this lipid molecule performs an important physiological function as a mitigator of P-deprivation stress in plants.
