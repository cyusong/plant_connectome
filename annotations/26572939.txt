Phosphorus (P) is an essential element involved in numerous biochemical reactions. In plants, stress responses, such as the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), are induced to help them adapt to low phosphate (Pi) concentrations. In this study, deep sequencing was performed using the roots and leaves of maize seedlings grown under low Pi concentrations to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed during the early stages of Pi deficiency. Eight small RNA libraries were constructed, and 159 known miRNAs representing 32 miRNA families and 10 novel miRNAs. Members of the miR396 family were extremely abundant. Further, 28 Pi-responsive miRNAs were identified (27 known and 1 novel) of which 8 and 7 were significantly expressed exclusively in leaf and root tissues, respectively. The analysis of Pi-responsive miRNAs target genes suggested that most target genes functioning as transcription factors were involved in root and leaf development. The expression profiles of selected Pi-responsive miRNAs and target genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, we discuss the significance of the differences in expression patterns of these miRNAs during the early and later stages of Pi starvation. This study provides useful information concerning the role of miRNAs in response to Pi starvation and will further our understanding of the mechanisms governing Pi homeostasis in maize.
