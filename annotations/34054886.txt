Metabolites have been reported as the main factor that influences the fruit flavor of watermelon. But the comprehensive study on the dynamics of metabolites during the development of watermelon fruit is not up-to-date. In this study, metabolome and transcriptome datasets of 'Crimson' watermelon fruit at four key developmental stages were generated. A total of 517 metabolites were detected by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-solid-phase microextraction-mass spectrometry. Meanwhile, by K-means clustering analysis, the total differentially expressed genes were clustered in six classes. Integrating transcriptome and metabolome data revealed similar expression trends of sugars and genes involved in the glycolytic pathway, providing molecular insights into the formation of taste during fruit development. Furthermore, through coexpression analysis, we identified five differentially expressed ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) genes (<i>Cla97C01G013600</i>, <i>Cla97C05G089700</i>, <i>Cla97C01G001290</i>, <i>Cla97C05G095170</i>, and <i>Cla97C06G118330</i>), which were found to be closely related to C9 alcohols/aldehydes, providing information for the formation of fruit aroma. Our findings establish a metabolic profile during watermelon fruit development and provide insights into flavor formation.
