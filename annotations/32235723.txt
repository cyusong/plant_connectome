['32235723', 'TPX2 (Targeting Protein for Xklp2) is an evolutionary conserved  microtubule-associated protein important for microtubule nucleation and mitotic  spindle assembly. The protein was described as an activator of the mitotic kinase  Aurora A in humans and the Arabidopsis AURORA1 (AUR1) kinase. In contrast to  animal genomes that encode only one TPX2 gene, higher plant genomes encode a  family with several TPX2-LIKE gene members (TPXL). TPXL genes of Arabidopsis can  be divided into two groups. Group A proteins (TPXL2, 3, 4, and 8) contain Aurora  binding and TPX2_importin domains, while group B proteins (TPXL1, 5, 6, and 7)  harbor an Xklp2 domain. Canonical TPX2 contains all the above-mentioned domains.  We confirmed using in vitro kinase assays that the group A proteins contain a  functional Aurora kinase binding domain. Transient expression of Arabidopsis  TPX2-like proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed preferential localization to  microtubules and nuclei. Co-expression of AUR1 together with TPX2-like proteins  changed the localization of AUR1, indicating that these proteins serve as  targeting factors for Aurora kinases. Taken together, we visualize the various  localizations of the TPX2-LIKE family in Arabidopsis as a proxy to their  functional divergence and provide evidence of their role in the targeted  regulation of AUR1 kinase activity.', '2020 Mar 22', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms21062183', 'ORCID:']
