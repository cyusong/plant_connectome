N-glycans play a protective or monitoring role according to the folding state of associated protein or the distance from structural defects. Asparagine-linked (Asn/N-) glycosylation is one of the most prevalent and complex protein modifications and the associated N-glycans play crucial roles on protein folding and secretion. The studies have shown that many glycoproteins hold multiple N-glycans, yet little is known about the redundancy of N-glycans on a protein. In this study, we used BRI1 to decipher the roles of N-glycans on protein secretion and function. We found that all 14 potential N-glycosylation sites on BRI1 were occupied with oligosaccharides. The elimination of single N-glycan had no obvious effect on BRI1 secretion or function except N<sup>154</sup>-glycan, which resulted in the retention of BRI1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), similar to the loss of multiple highly conserved N-glycans. To misfolded bri1, the absence of N-glycans next to local structural defects enhanced the ER retention and the artificial addition of N-glycan could help the misfolded bri1-GFPs exiting from the ER, indicating that the N-glycans might serve as steric hindrance to protect the structure defects from ER recognition. We also found that the retention of misfolded bri1-9 by lectins and chaperones in the ER relied on the presence of multiple N-glycans distal to the local defects. Our findings revealed that the N-glycans might play a protective or monitoring role according to the folding state of associated protein or the distance from structural defects.
