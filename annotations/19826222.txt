We recently identified a novel and transplantable di-acidic motif (EXXD) that facilitates ER export of the Golgi syntaxin SYP31 (type IV protein) and which may function also for type I and type II proteins in plants. By mutagenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana SYP31 and live cell imaging experiments in tobacco leaf epidermal cells, we determined that replacing the MELAD sequence of SYP31 with gagag retained SYP31 in the ER, which demonstrates that the di-acidic motif ELAD is critical for SYP31 ER export. To investigate whether blockage of a Golgi SNARE in the ER have consequences for plant growth, we produced tobacco plants stably overexpressing either the wild type MELAD or the mutant gagag form of SYP31. Whereas tobacco plants overexpressing the wild-type SYP31 developed to set seed, tobacco plants overexpressing the mutant form gagag rapidly became chlorotic, ceased their growth and invariably died after several weeks. This indicated that retention of overexpressed SYP31 in the ER is likely toxic for the secretory pathway and, therefore, plant development. Putative explanations for this observation are discussed taking into account SNARE properties and possible interactions.
