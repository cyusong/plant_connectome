Ethylene response factor (ERF) has been widely studied in regulating fruit ripening in tomato, apple, banana and kiwifruit, but little is known in pear. In this study 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatment, an inhibitor of ethylene perception, was conducted at approximately 30 days before harvest to delay fruit ripening in a climacteric white pear cultivar Yali. Transcriptome libraries were constructed and sequenced in pre-ripening, ripening, and 1-MCP treated fruits. Data analysis showed that 73 candidate genes related to fruit ripening were induced by 1-MCP, among which two were positively related, namely 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxyla oxidase and an ERF gene (designated as ACO54 and ERF24). Transient transformations in pear fruit revealed that over-expression of ACO54 enhance transcription level of ERF24 and most ripening-related genes. Meanwhile, over-expression of ERF24 raises expression level of ACO54 and partially ripening-related genes. Moreover, dual-luciferase and yeast-one-hybrid assays unravel an interaction between ERF24 and the ACO54 promoter. Therefore, the ERF24 could directly regulate ACO54 expression by binding to its promoter. These results suggested that the first identified ERF24 is involved in regulating fruit ripening in Chinese white pear.
