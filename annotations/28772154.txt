The plant phenolic compound (E)-chalcone has been previously found to induce noticeable seedling size reduction and progressive de-greening (bleaching) in shoots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. In this work, we demonstrate that this progressive de-greening occurring on Arabidopsis shoots after (E)-chalcone treatment, is directly linked to early plasma membrane depolarization and dramatic effects on chloroplasts structure and function. Later effects in chalcone-treated seedlings included ROS accumulation, pigment degradation, reduced photosynthetic activity, bleaching, and eventually cell death. De-greening and pigment degradation induced by (E)-chalcone were partially reversed when NaCl was added together with chalcone, which could be related to restoration of altered pH gradients. All these results suggest that rapid alteration of plasma membrane potential after chalcone treatment is a major component of the mode of action of (E)-chalcone on Arabidopsis metabolism.
