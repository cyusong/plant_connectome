With the development of high-throughput sequencing, many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play important roles in diverse biological processes. However, the biological functions of most plant lncRNAs are still unknown. We have previously discovered a tomato ripening-related lncRNA, lncRNA1459. Here, we cloned the full-length lncRNA1459, giving two transcript isoforms. In addition, lncRNA1459 exhibited a specific location in the nucleus. Furthermore, in order to fully identify the function of lncRNA1459 in tomato ripening, loss-of-function mutants of lncRNA1459 were developed using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-induced genome editing technology. Compared with wild-type fruits, the tomato ripening process was significantly repressed in lncRNA1459 mutants. Ethylene production and lycopene accumulation were largely repressed in lncRNA1459 mutants. Additionally, genes related to ethylene and carotenoid biosynthesis were distinctly downregulated in lncRNA1459 mutants compared with wild-type fruits. Moreover, expression of numerous ripening-related genes was changed significantly when lncRNA1459 was knocked out. Expression of potential tomato ripening-related lncRNAs was also specifically changed after knocking out lncRNA1459. Taken together, these results provide insight into the role of lncRNA1459 in tomato fruit ripening.
