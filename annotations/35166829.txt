Nannochloropsis oceanica, like other stramenopile microalgae, is rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We observed that fatty acid desaturases (FADs) involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis were among the strongest blue light-induced genes in N. oceanica CCMP1779. Blue light was also necessary for maintaining LC-PUFA levels in CCMP1779 cells, and growth under red light led to a reduction in EPA content. Aureochromes are stramenopile-specific proteins that contain a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV)-sensing domain that associates with a flavin mononucleotide and is able to sense blue light. These proteins also contain a basic leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and can act as blue light-regulated transcription factors by associating with an E-box like motif, which we found enriched in the promoters of blue light-induced genes. We demonstrated that, in vitro, two CCMP1779 aureochromes were able to absorb blue light. Moreover, the loss or reduction of the expression of any of the three aureochrome genes led to a decrease in the blue light-specific induction of several FADs in CCMP1779. EPA content was also significantly reduced in NoAUREO2 and NoAUREO4 mutants. Taken together, our results indicate that aureochromes mediate blue light-dependent regulation of LC-PUFA content in N. oceanica CCMP1779 cells.
