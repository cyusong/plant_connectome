The LRR receptor serine/threonine kinases are a major eukaryotic receptor family, for which the central regulatory mechanism of endosomal trafficking remains largely unadressed. We show that the steroid receptor BRI1 localizes to both plasma membrane and early endosomal compartments, even when observed at low, endogenous expression levels, and that its localization and turnover are independent of ligand. However, increasing endosomal localization of BRI1 enhances activation of the pathway and genomic responses. Our data indicate distinct signaling and trafficking mechanisms within this receptor class and show that the use of endosomes as signaling compartments is an unexpectedly broad phenomenon in eukaryotes.
