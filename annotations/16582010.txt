['16582010', 'Mutations in genes encoding components of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex  were previously shown to confer altered sensitivity to increased levels of  D-glucose. This suggests that G-protein coupling may be a novel sugar-signaling  mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. THYLAKOID FORMATION1 (THF1) is here  demonstrated in vivo as a Galpha interaction partner that functions downstream of  the plasma membrane-delimited heterotrimeric G-protein (GPA1) in a D-glucose  signaling pathway. THF1 is a plastid protein localized to both the outer plastid  membrane and the stroma. Contact between root plastidic THF1 and GPA1 at the  plasma membrane occurs at sites where the plastid membrane abuts the plasma  membrane, as demonstrated by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). A probable  role for THF1 in sugar signaling is demonstrated by both biochemical and genetic  evidence. Root growth in the thf1-1 null mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous  D-glucose, and THF1-overexpressing roots are resistant to inhibition of growth  rate by high D-glucose. Additionally, THF1 levels are rapidly degraded by  D-glucose but not L-glucose. The interaction between THF1 and GPA1 has been  confirmed by in vitro and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, FRET analysis, and  genetic epistasis and provides evidence of a sugar-signaling mechanism between  plastids and the plasma membrane.', '2006 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.037259', 'Jones']
