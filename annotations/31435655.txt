Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone and a major determinant of seed dormancy in plants. Seed dormancy is gradually lost during dry storage, a process known as 'after-ripening', and this dormancy decay is related to a decline in ABA content and sensitivity in seeds after imbibition. In this study, we aimed at investigating the effect of after-ripening on ABA signaling in barley, our cereal model species. Phosphosignaling networks in barley grains were investigated by a large-scale analysis of phosphopeptides to examine potential changes in response pathways to after-ripening. We used freshly harvested (FH) and after-ripened (AR) barley grains which showed different ABA sensitivity. A total of 1,730 phosphopeptides were identified in barley embryos isolated from half-cut grains. A comparative analysis showed that 329 and 235 phosphopeptides were upregulated or downregulated, respectively after ABA treatment, and phosphopeptides profiles were quite different between FH and AR embryos. These results were supported by peptide motif analysis which suggested that different sets of protein kinases are active in FH and AR grains. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation assays confirmed that some phosphopeptides were phosphorylated by SnRK2s, which are major protein kinases involved in ABA signaling. Taken together, our results revealed very distinctive phosphosignaling networks in FH and AR embryos of barley, and suggested that the after-ripening of barley grains is associated with differential regulation of phosphosignaling pathways leading to a decay of ABA signaling.
