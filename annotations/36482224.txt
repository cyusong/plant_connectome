Unlike the bicellular glands characteristic of all known excreting grasses, unique single-celled salt glands were discovered in the only salt tolerant species of the genus Oryza, Oryza coarctata. Salt tolerance has evolved frequently in a large number of grass lineages with distinct difference in mechanisms. Mechanisms of salt tolerance were studied in three species of grasses characterized by salt excretion: C<sub>3</sub> wild rice species Oryza coarctata, and C<sub>4</sub> species Sporobolus anglicus and Urochondra setulosa. The leaf anatomy and ultrastructure of salt glands, pattern of salt excretion, gas exchange, accumulation of key photosynthetic enzymes, leaf water content and osmolality, and levels of some osmolytes, were compared when grown without salt, with 200 mM NaCl versus 200 mM KCl. Under salt treatments, there was little effect on the capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, while stomatal conductance decreased with a reduction in water loss by transpiration and an increase in water use efficiency. All three species accumulate compatible solutes but with drastic differences in osmolyte composition. Having high capacity for salt excretion, they have distinct structural differences in the salt excreting machinery. S. anglicus and U. setulosa have bicellular glands while O. coarctata has unique single-celled salt glands with a partitioning membrane system that are responsible for salt excretion rather than multiple hairs as previously suggested. The features of physiological responses and salt excretion indicate similar mechanisms are involved in providing tolerance and excretion of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>.
