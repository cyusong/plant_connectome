['15659481', 'The PRETTY FEW SEEDS2 gene encodes a homeodomain protein that regulates ovule  development. In peptide alignments spanning the homeodomain and the WOX domain,  PFS2 shared 95% amino acid identity with the PRESSED FLOWER and WUSCHEL proteins.  In the pfs2-1 allele, the integuments display morphological abnormalities and 95%  of the embryo sacs fail to develop properly, which results in reduced fecundity.  PFS2 transcripts were most abundant in developing ovules, which accounts for the  ovule phenotype in pfs2 mutants. In addition, PFS2 transcripts were present in  developing primordia and differentiating organs, but, interestingly, they were  absent during cell maturation. Ectopic PFS2 expression interfered with  differentiation of primordia from meristems. For most plants, this resulted in  fasciated stems, altered phyllotaxy, a cessation of primordia differentiation, or  a combination of these. In the plants that made ovules, ectopic PFS2 expression  blocked megaspore mother cell differentiation and often impeded polarized growth  of the outer integument. PFS2 activity altered AGAMOUS expression, which accounts  for some of the gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes. Based on analyses  presented here, PFS2 affects either ovule patterning or differentiation.', '2005 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.01654', 'Hauser']
