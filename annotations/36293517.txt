Wheat flour's end-use quality is tightly linked to the quantity and composition of storage proteins in the endosperm. TAM 111 and TAM 112 are two popular cultivars grown in the Southern US Great Plains with significantly different protein content. To investigate regulatory differences, transcriptome data were analyzed from developing grains at early- and mid-filling stages. At the mid-filling stage, TAM 111 preferentially upregulated starch metabolism-related pathways compared to TAM 112, whereas amino acid metabolism and transporter-related pathways were over-represented in TAM 112. Elemental analyses also indicated a higher N percentage in TAM 112 at the mid-filling stage. To explore the regulatory variation, weighted correlation gene network was constructed from publicly available RNAseq datasets to identify the modules differentially regulated in TAM 111 and TAM 112. Further, the potential transcription factors (TFs) regulating those modules were identified using graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO). Homologs of the OsNF-Y family members with known starch metabolism-related functions showed higher connectivities in TAM 111. Multiple TFs with high connectivity in TAM 112 had predicted functions associated with ABA response in grain. These results will provide novel targets for breeders to explore and further our understanding in mechanisms regulating grain development.
