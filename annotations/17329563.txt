['17329563', 'Seed dormancy is defined as the failure of a viable seed to germinate under  favorable conditions. Besides playing an adaptive role in nature by optimizing  germination to the most suitable time, a tight control of dormancy is important  in crop plants. Extensive genetic and physiological studies have identified the  involvement of several factors, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this  process are still largely unknown. We cloned the HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1  (HUB1) gene, of which the mutant (previously identified as reduced dormancy4) has  reduced seed dormancy and several pleiotropic phenotypes. HUB1 encodes a C3HC4  RING finger protein. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains one HUB1 homolog,  which we named HUB2. The hub2 mutant also has reduced seed dormancy and is not  redundant with hub1. Homologs of HUB1 and HUB2 in other species are required for  histone H2B monoubiquitination. In agreement with this, the ubiquitinated form of  histone H2B could not be detected in the hub1 and hub2 mutants. In yeast and  human cells, histone H2B monoubiquitination is associated with actively  transcribed genes. The hub1 mutant showed altered expression levels for several  dormancy-related genes. We propose a role for chromatin remodeling in seed  dormancy by H2B monoubiquitination through HUB1 and HUB2.', '2007 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.049221', 'Soppe']
