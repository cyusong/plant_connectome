['11162499', 'Soluble sugar levels affect a diverse array of plant developmental processes. For  example, exposure to high levels of glucose or sucrose inhibits early seedling  development of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Media-shift experiments indicate  that Arabidopsis seedlings lose their sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of  high sugar levels on early development within approximately two days after the  start of imbibition. The sugar-insensitive1 (sis1) mutant of Arabidopsis was  isolated by screening for plants that are insensitive to the inhibitory effects  of high concentrations of sucrose on early seedling development. The sis1 mutant  also displays glucose and mannose resistant phenotypes and has an osmo-tolerant  phenotype during early seedling development. The sis1 mutant is resistant to the  negative effects of paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis, on  seed germination. Characterization of the sis1 mutant revealed that it is allelic  to ctr1, a previously identified mutant with a constitutive response to ethylene.', '2001 Jan 12', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1006/bbrc.2000.4062', 'Kim']
