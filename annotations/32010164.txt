RPM1 is a CC-NBS-LRR protein that was first shown to be required for resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>maculicola</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Our previous study showed that <i>TaRPM1</i> gene in wheat was upregulated about six times following infection by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) under high temperature, compared with normal temperature. To study the function of <i>TaRPM1</i> in wheat high-temperature seedling-plant (HTSP) resistance to <i>Pst</i>, the full length of <i>TaRPM1</i> was cloned, with three copies each located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D. Transient expression of the TaRPM1-GFP fusion protein in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> indicated that TaRPM1 localizes in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Profiling <i>TaRPM1</i> expression indicated that <i>TaRPM1</i> transcription was rapidly upregulated upon <i>Pst</i> inoculation under high temperature. In addition, <i>TaRPM1</i> was induced by exogenous salicylic acid hormone application. Silencing <i>TaRPM1</i> in wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 (XY 6) resulted in reduced HTSP resistance to <i>Pst</i> in terms of reduced number of necrotic cells and increased uredinial length, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in <i>TaRPM1</i>-silenced leaves under normal temperature. Related defense genes <i>TaPR1</i> and <i>TaPR2</i> were downregulated in <i>TaRPM1</i>-silenced plants under high temperature. We conclude that <i>TaRPM1</i> is involved in HTSP resistance to <i>Pst</i> in XY 6.
