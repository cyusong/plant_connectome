['27110948', 'Based on their sequence homology to Arabidopsis NDR1 and tobacco (Nicotiana  tabacum) HIN1, 45 NHL (NDR1/HIN1-like) family genes are found in Arabidopsis  genome. Recently, we reported that overexpression of NHL6, a member of NHL  family, modulated seed germination under abiotic stresses through affecting ABA  biosynthesis and signaling. We also carried out qPCR and investigated the  expression of the other 8 member genes (NHL7a, 16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 41, 43) whose  transcriptional data are publicly unavailable, and found that expression of NHL17  was induced more than 2 folds in ABA treated seedlings. Furthermore, in addition  to the plasma membrane localization, YFP-NHL6 fusion protein was also observed in  the cytosol (as dots) or on the membrane of small vacuoles or vesicles. As a  member of the pathogen infection related genes, expression of NHL6 was  significantly induced by salicylic acid and NHL6s are evolutionarily conserved  among different plant species. A working model of NHL6 in ABA response was  proposed.', '2016 May 3', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.1080/15592324.2016.1180493', 'Zhang']
