*Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis develops in roots; extensive cellular reorganizations and specific metabolic changes occur, which are mirrored by local and systemic changes in the transcript profiles. *A TOM2 microarray (c. 12 000 probes) has been used to obtain an overview of the transcriptional changes that are triggered in Solanum lycopersicum roots and shoots, as a result of colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. The cell-type expression profile of a subset of genes was monitored, using laser microdissection, to identify possible plant determinants of arbuscule development,. *Microarrays revealed 362 up-regulated and 293 down-regulated genes in roots. Significant gene modulation was also observed in shoots: 85 up- and 337 down-regulated genes. The most responsive genes in both organs were ascribed to primary and secondary metabolism, defence and response to stimuli, cell organization and protein modification, and transcriptional regulation. Six genes, preferentially expressed in arbusculated cells, were identified. *A comparative analysis only showed a limited overlap with transcript profiles identified in mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula, probably as a consequence of the largely nonoverlapping probe sets on the microarray tools used. The results suggest that auxin and abscisic acid metabolism are involved in arbuscule formation and/or functioning.
