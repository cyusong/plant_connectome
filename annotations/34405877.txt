Plants perceive externally produced microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and endogenously produced danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to activate inducible immunity. While several inducible immune responses have been observed during Fusarium graminearum infection, the identity of the signaling pathways involved is only partly known. We screened 227 receptor kinase and innate immune response genes in Arabidopsis to identify nine genes with a role in F. graminearum resistance. Resistance-promoting genes included the chitin receptors LYK5 and CERK1, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing NADPH oxidase RbohF, which were required for full inducible immune responses during infection. Two of the genes identified in our screen, APEX and the PAMP-induced peptide 1 (PIP1) DAMP receptor RLK7, repressed F. graminearum resistance. Both RbohF and RLK7 were required for full chitin-induced immune responses and PIP1 precursor expression was induced by chitin and F. graminearum infection. Together, this indicates that F. graminearum resistance is mediated by MAMP and DAMP signaling pathways and that chitin-induced signaling is enhanced by PIP1 perception and ROS production.
