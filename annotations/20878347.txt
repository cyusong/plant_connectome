In animals, high glucose exerts some of its deleterious effects by activation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a branch of the glycolytic pathway that produces amino sugars (Daniels et al. in Mol Endocrinol 7:1041-1048, 1993; Du et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:12222-12226, 2000). Glucosamine (GlcN) is a naturally occurring amino sugar produced by amidation of fructose-6-phosphate. Previously, we observed that glucosamine (GlcN) inhibits hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana by a process involving the significant increase of reactive oxygen species. The present study investigated the relationship between GlcN-induced ROS generation and abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis by generating two types of transgenic plant. Scavenging of endogenous GlcN by ectopic expression of E. coli glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB) was observed to confer enhanced tolerance to oxidative, drought, and cold stress. Consistent with this result, overproduction of GlcN by the ectopic expression of E. coli glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlmS) induced cell death at an early stage. Taken together, these data suggest that genetic manipulation of endogenous GlcN level can effectively lead to the generation of abiotic stress-tolerant transgenic crop plants.

GlcN: !overproduced by! E. coli glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlmS)
Scavenging GlcN: !confers! enhanced tolerance to oxidative, drought, and cold stress
