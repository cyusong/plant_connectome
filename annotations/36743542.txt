The world has experienced an unprecedented boom in nanotechnology. Nanoparticles (NPs) are likely to act as biostimulants in various plants due to having high surface/volume value. However, understanding the actual effect of NPs is essential to discriminate them from other counterparts in terms of being applicable, safe and cost-effective. This study aimed to assay the impact of manganese(III) oxide (Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)-NPs <i>via</i> seed-priming (SP) and a combination of SP and foliar application (SP+F) on <i>Artemisia. annua</i> performance at several times intervals and comparison with other available manganese (Mn) forms. Our findings indicate that SP with MnSO<sub>4</sub> and Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-NPs stimulates the processes that occur prior to germination and thus reduces the time for radicle emergence. In both applications (i.e., SP and +F), none of the Mn treatments did show adverse phytotoxic on <i>A. annua</i> growth at morpho-physio and biochemical levels except for Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3,</sub> which delayed germination and further plant growth, subsequently. Besides, from physio-biochemical data, it can be inferred that the general mechanism mode of action of Mn is mainly attributed to induce the photosynthetic processes, stimulate the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and up-regulation of proline and phenolic compounds. Therefore, our results showed that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants could be influenced by the application of Mn treatments in a type-dependent manner. In general, this study revealed that Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-NPs at the tested condition could be used as biostimulants to improve germination, seedling development and further plant growth. However, they are not as effective as MnSO<sub>4</sub> treatments. Nonetheless, these findings can be used to consider and develop Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-NPs priming in future studies to improve seed germination and seedling quality in plants.
