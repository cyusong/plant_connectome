Plants monitor environmental cues to balance their vegetative and productive growth by optimizing their inflorescence architecture. TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) and its orthologs regulate the inflorescence structure in cucumber, yet the mechanisms underlying their responses to environmental factors and the formation of terminal flowers remain elusive. Here, we performed map-based cloning to identify the gene that controls a season-dependent determinate growth phenotype and found that it was caused by the complete deletion of CsTFL1 in the genome of cucumber line WI1983Hde. In the CsTFL1 deletion plants (CsTFL1<sup>del</sup> ), determinate growth could be partially rescued by high-temperature and long-day conditions. The expressions of CsTFL1 and its ortholog CsTFL1d could be upregulated by long-day and high-temperature signals. Knockdown of CsTFL1d resulted in determinate growth and the formation of terminal flowers in WT. These results indicate that the induction of CsTFL1d expression by long-day and high-temperature might partially rescue determinate growth of CsTFL1<sup>del</sup> . Furthermore, biochemical analyses showed that CsTFL1d interacts directly with CsNOT2a, which indicated that CsTFL1d and CsTFL1 function via similar regulatory mechanism. Our data suggest that CsTFL1 and CsTFL1d co-contribute to inhibit determinate growth by responding to temperature and photoperiod signals. It provides mechanistic insights into how environmental cues sculpt the inflorescence architecture of cucumber.
