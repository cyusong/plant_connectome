['20154152', 'The establishment and maintenance of auxin maxima in vascular plants is regulated  by auxin biosynthesis and polar intercellular auxin flow. The disruption of  normal auxin biosynthesis in mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) leads to  severe abnormalities, suggesting that spatiotemporal regulation of auxin  biosynthesis is fundamental for normal growth and development. We have shown  previously that the induction of the SHORT-INTERNODES/STYLISH (SHI/STY) family  member STY1 results in increased transcript levels of the YUCCA (YUC) family  member YUC4 and also higher auxin levels and auxin biosynthesis rates in  Arabidopsis seedlings. We have also shown previously that SHI/STY family members  redundantly affect development of flowers and leaves. Here, we further examine  the function of STY1 by analyzing its DNA and protein binding properties. Our  results suggest that STY1, and most likely other SHI/STY members, are DNA binding  transcriptional activators that target genes encoding proteins mediating auxin  biosynthesis. This suggests that the SHI/STY family members are essential  regulators of auxin-mediated leaf and flower development. Furthermore, the lack  of a shoot apical meristem in seedlings carrying a fusion construct between STY1  and a repressor domain, SRDX, suggests that STY1, and other SHI/STY members, has  a role in the formation and/or maintenance of the shoot apical meristem, possibly  by regulating auxin levels in the embryo.', '2010 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.064816', 'Sundberg']
