Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient and a key cellular messenger. Plants have evolved refined molecular systems to sense the cellular nitrogen status. This is exemplified by the root nodule symbiosis between legumes and symbiotic rhizobia, where nitrate availability inhibits this mutualistic interaction. Additionally, nitrate also functions as a metabolic messenger, resulting in nitrate signaling cascades which intensively crosstalk with other physiological pathways. Nodule inception-like proteins (NLPs) are key players in nitrate signaling and regulate nitrate-dependent transcription during legume-rhizobia interactions. Nevertheless, the coordinated interplay between nitrate signaling pathways and rhizobacteria-induced responses remains to be elucidated. In our study, we investigated rhizobia-induced changes in the root system architecture of the non-legume host arabidopsis under different nitrate conditions. We demonstrate that rhizobium-induced lateral root growth and increased root hair length and density are regulated by a nitrate-related signaling pathway. Key players in this process are <i>AtNLP4</i> and <i>AtNLP5</i>, because the corresponding mutants failed to respond to rhizobia. At the cellular level, <i>AtNLP4</i> and <i>AtNLP5</i> control a rhizobia-induced decrease in cell elongation rates, while additional cell divisions occurred independently of <i>AtNLP4</i>. In summary, our data suggest that root morphological responses to rhizobia are coordinated by a newly considered nitrate-related NLP pathway that is evolutionarily linked to regulatory circuits described in legumes.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
