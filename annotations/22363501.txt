['22363501', 'Class II histone deacetylases in humans and other model organisms undergo  nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. This unique functional regulatory mechanism has been  well elucidated in eukaryotic organisms except in plant systems. In this study,  we have paved the baseline evidence for the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization  of Class II HDAs as well as their mRNA expression patterns. RT-PCR analysis on  the different vegetative parts and developmental stages reveal that Class II HDAs  are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues with minimal developmental specificity.  Moreover, stable and transient expression assays using HDA-YFP/GFP fusion  constructs indicate cytoplasmic localization of HDA5, HDA8, and HDA14 further  suggesting their potential for nuclear transport and deacetylating organellar and  cytoplasmic proteins. Organelle markers and stains confirm HDA14 to abound in the  mitochondria and chloroplasts while HDA5 localizes in the ER. HDA15, on the other  hand, shuttles in and out of the nucleus upon light exposure. In the absence of  light, it is exported out of the nucleus where further re-exposition to light  treatments signals its nuclear import. Unlike HDA5 which binds with 14-3-3  proteins, HDA15 fails to interact with these chaperones. Instead, HDA15 relies on  its own nuclear localization and export signals to navigate its subcellular  compartmentalization classifying it as a Class IIb HDA. Our study indicates that  nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is indeed a hallmark for all eukaryotic Class II  histone deacetylases.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0030846', 'Wu']
