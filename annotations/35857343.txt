The molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin-based flower coloration remain unknown in Brassica napus. To identify the key genes and metabolites associated with apricot and pink flower colors, metabolome, BSA-seq, and RNA-seq analyses were conducted on apricot-, pink-, yellow-, and white-flowered F2B. napus. Yellow carotenoids and red anthocyanins were abundant in apricot petals, while colorless carotenoids and red anthocyanins accumulated in pink petals. Most carotenoid genes were not differentially regulated between apricot and yellow or between pink and white petals. Three regulator genes, BnaMYBL2, BnaA07.PAP2, and BnaTT8, and structural genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis were dramatically enhanced in apricot and pink petals in comparison with yellow and white petals. Map-based cloning revealed that BnaA07.PAP2 is responsible for anthocyanin-based flower color and encodes a nucleus-localized protein predominantly expressed in apricot and pink flowers. Two insertions in the promoter region are responsible for the transcriptional activation of BnaA07.PAP2 in flowers. Introducing the BnaA07.PAP2In-184-317 allele broadly activated the expression of anthocyanin-related genes and promoted anthocyanin accumulation in flowers, yielding color change from yellow to apricot. These findings illustrate the genetic basis of anthocyanin-based flower coloration and provide a valuable genetic resource for breeding varieties with novel flower colors in B. napus.
