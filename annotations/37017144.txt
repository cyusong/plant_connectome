Formative asymmetric divisions produce cells with different fates and are critical for development. We show the maize (Zea mays) myosin XI protein, OPAQUE1 (O1), is necessary for asymmetric divisions during maize stomatal development. We analyzed stomatal precursor cells before and during asymmetric division to determine why o1 mutants have abnormal division planes. Cell polarization and nuclear positioning occur normally in the o1 mutant, and the future site of division is correctly specified. The defect in o1 becomes apparent during late cytokinesis, when the phragmoplast forms the nascent cell plate. Initial phragmoplast guidance in o1 is normal; however, as phragmoplast expansion continues o1 phragmoplasts become misguided. To understand how O1 contributes to phragmoplast guidance, we identified O1-interacting proteins. Maize kinesins related to the Arabidopsis thaliana division site markers PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESINs (POKs), which are also required for correct phragmoplast guidance, physically interact with O1. We propose that different myosins are important at multiple steps of phragmoplast expansion, and the O1 actin motor and POK-like microtubule motors work together to ensure correct late-stage phragmoplast guidance.
