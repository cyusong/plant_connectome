Twelve articles (ten research papers and two reviews) included in the Special Issue entitled "Wheat and Barley: Acclimatization to Abiotic and Biotic Stress" are summed up here to present the latest research on the molecular background of adaptation to environmental stresses in two cereal species. Crucial research results were presented and discussed, as they may be of importance in breeding aimed at increasing wheat and barley tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses.
