Recent advances in our understanding of the roles of photoreceptors in light-dependent regulation of plant growth and development have been rapid and significant. Developments have been reported for numerous plant photoreceptor signaling pathways, yet researchers have made the most progress in increasing our comprehension of the roles of phytochrome family members, as well as the intracellular roles of phytochromes and phytochrome-interacting proteins in light-dependent signaling. An understudied, but vitally important, area of phytochrome biology centers on the roles phytochromes play in intercellular and interorgan signaling at the molecular level that results in the coordination of growth responses between distinct tissues and organs. This frontier of research into the spatiotemporal roles of phytochromes, and more generally plant photoreceptors, which is only beginning to be investigated and understood at the molecular genetic level, has a rich history of physiological data.
