Pollution of the environment with plastic is an important concern of the modern world. It is estimated that annually over 350 million tonnes of this material are produced, wherein, despite the recycling methods, a significant part is deposited in the environment. The plastic has been detected in the industrial areas, as well as farmlands and gardens in many world regions. Larger plastic pieces degraded in time into smaller pieces including microplastic (MP) and nanoplastic particles (NP). Nanoplastic is suggested to pose the most serious danger as due to the small size, it is effectively taken up from the environment by the biota and transported within the organisms. An increasing number of reports show that NP exert toxic effects also on plants. One of the most common plant response to abiotic stress factors is the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the one hand, these molecules are engaged in cellular signalling and regulation of genes expression. On the other hand, ROS in excess lead to oxidation and damage of various cellular compounds. This article reviews the impact of NP on plants, with special emphasis on the oxidative response.

NP: !exerts! toxic effects 
ROS: !accumulated in! response to abiotic stress 
ROS: !regulates! gene expression 
ROS: !causes! oxidation and damage
