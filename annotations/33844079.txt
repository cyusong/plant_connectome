Tyrosine aminotransferase (AaTAT) from the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis Paton (Anthocerotaceae) was amplified and expressed in E. coli. The active enzyme is able to accept a wide range of substrates with distinct preference for L-tyrosine, therefore, possibly catalysing the initial step in rosmarinic acid biosynthesis. The presence of rosmarinic acid (RA) in the hornwort A. agrestis is well known, and some attempts have been made to clarify the biosynthesis of this caffeic acid ester in lower plants. Parallel to the biosynthesis in vascular plants, the involvement of tyrosine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5; TAT) as the initial step was assumed. The amplification of a nucleotide sequence putatively encoding AaTAT (Genbank MN922307) and expression in E. coli were successful. The enzyme proved to have a high acceptance of L-tyrosine (K<sub>m</sub> 0.53 mM) whilst slightly preferring 2-oxoglutarate over phenylpyruvate as co-substrate. Applying L-phenylalanine as a potential amino donor or using oxaloacetate or pyruvate as a replacement for 2-oxoglutarate as amino acceptor resulted in significantly lower catalytic efficiencies in each of these cases. To facilitate further substrate search, two methods were introduced, one using ninhydrin after thin-layer chromatography and the other using derivatisation with o-phthalaldehyde followed by HPLC or LC-MS analysis. Both methods proved to be well applicable and helped to confirm the acceptance of further aromatic and aliphatic amino acids. This work presents the first description of a heterologously expressed TAT from a hornwort (A. agrestis) and describes the possible entry into the biosynthesis of RA and other specialised compounds in a so far neglected representative of terrestrial plants and upcoming new model organism.
