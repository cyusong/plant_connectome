The RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases play an important role in plant growth, development, and defense responses to abiotic stresses and pathogens. However, their roles in the resistance of plants to herbivorous insects remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolated the rice gene <i>OsJMJ715</i>, which encodes a RING-domain containing protein, and investigated its role in rice resistance to brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>). OsJMJ715 is a nucleus-localized E3 ligase whose mRNA levels were upregulated by the infestation of gravid BPH females, mechanical wounding, and treatment with JA or ABA. Silencing <i>OsJMJ715</i> enhanced BPH-elicited levels of ABA, JA, and JA-Ile as well as the amount of callose deposition in plants, which in turn increased the resistance of rice to BPH by reducing the feeding of BPH and the hatching rate of BPH eggs. These findings suggest that OsJMJ715 negative regulates the BPH-induced biosynthesis of ABA, JA, and JA-Ile and that BPH benefits by enhancing the expression of OsJMJ715.
