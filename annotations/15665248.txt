The expression of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes depends on nucleus-encoded proteins, some of which control processing, stability, and/or translation of organellar RNAs. To test the specificity of one such RNA stability factor, we used two known Chlamydomonas reinhardtii nonphotosynthetic mutants carrying mutations in the Mcd1 nuclear gene (mcd1-1 and mcd1-2). We previously reported that these mutants fail to accumulate the chloroplast petD mRNA and its product, subunit IV of the cytochrome b6/f complex, which is essential for photosynthesis. Such mutants are generally presumed to be gene specific but are not tested rigorously. Here, we have used microarray analysis to assess changes in chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear RNAs, and since few other RNAs were significantly altered in these mutants, conclude that Mcd1 is indeed specifically required for petD mRNA accumulation. In addition, a new unlinked nuclear mutation was discovered in mcd1-2, which greatly reduced chloroplast atpA mRNA accumulation. Genetic analyses showed failure to complement mda1-ncc1, where atpA-containing transcripts are similarly affected (D. Drapier, J. Girard-Bascou, D.B. Stern, F.-A. Wollman [2002] Plant J 31: 687-697), and we have named this putative new allele mda1-2. We conclude that DNA microarrays are efficient and useful for characterizing the specificity of organellar RNA accumulation mutants.
