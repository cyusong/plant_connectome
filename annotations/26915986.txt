The defensive chemistry and persistence of plant tissues determine their suitability and apparency - the likelihood of being discovered - to insect herbivores. As consumers of plant tissues with transient apparency, florivores and seed-feeders must frequently migrate between host plants to synchronize colonization with plant phenology. Aggregation pheromones could provide information-based solutions to finding ephemeral hosts, but little is known about plant-influenced variation in this form of chemical communication. Combining analytical chemistry, de novo synthesis and field ecology, we investigated the change in colonization of two sympatric host plants, Nicotiana attenuata and Nicotiana obtusifolia, which differ in apparency-related life history traits, by a heteropteran seed-feeder, Corimelaena extensa. We identified a novel pheromone released by C.만xtensa males - (5Z,8Z)-tetradeca-5,8-dienal - and performed field assays with the synthetic pheromone, showing that it stimulates the formation of feeding aggregations on the post-fire annual N.마ttenuata. Corimelaena extensa pheromone emission was 40-fold higher when feeding on N.마ttenuata compared with the perennial N.맖btusifolia, as were adult fecundity and seed capsule content of the putative biosynthetic precursor, linoleic acid. Higher pheromone emission increases the apparency and colonization of the ephemeral, high-quality host N.마ttenuata. This plant-specific variation in insect signaling could facilitate host-finding by seed-feeders migrating between plant patches.
