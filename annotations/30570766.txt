Leaves with stomata on both upper and lower surfaces, termed amphistomatous, are relatively rare compared with hypostomatous leaves with stomata only on the lower surface. Amphistomaty occurs predominantly in fast-growing herbaceous annuals and in slow-growing perennial shrubs and trees. In this paper, we present the current understanding and hypotheses on the costs and benefits of amphistomaty related to water and CO<sub>2</sub> transport in contrasting leaf morphologies. First, there is no evidence that amphistomatous species achieve higher stomatal densities on a projected leaf area basis than hypostomatous species, but two-sided gas exchange is less limited by boundary layer effects. Second, amphistomaty may provide a specific advantage in thick leaves by shortening the pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> transport between the atmosphere and the chloroplasts. In thin leaves of fast-growing herbaceous annuals, in which both the adaxial and abaxial pathways are already short, amphistomaty enhances leaf-atmosphere gas-exchange capacity. Third, amphistomaty may help to optimise the leaf-interior water status for CO<sub>2</sub> transport by reducing temperature gradients and so preventing the condensation of water that could limit CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion. Fourth, a potential cost of amphistomaty is the need for additional investments in leaf water transport tissue to balance the water loss through the adaxial surface.
