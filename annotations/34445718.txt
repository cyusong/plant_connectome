<i>Pythium brassicum</i> P1 Stanghellini, Mohammadi, Förster, and Adaskaveg is an oomycete root pathogen that has recently been characterized. It only attacks plant species belonging to <i>Brassicaceae</i> family, causing root necrosis, stunting, and yield loss. Since <i>P. brassicum</i> P1 is limited in its host range, this prompted us to sequence its whole genome and compare it to those of broad host range <i>Pythium</i> spp. such as <i>P. aphanidermatum</i> and <i>P. ultimum</i> var. <i>ultimum</i>. A genomic DNA library was constructed with a total of 374 million reads. The sequencing data were assembled using SOAPdenovo2, yielding a total genome size of 50.3 Mb contained in 5434 scaffolds, N50 of 30.2 Kb, 61.2% G+C content, and 13,232 putative protein-coding genes. <i>Pythium brassicum</i> P1 had 175 species-specific gene families, which is slightly below the normal average. Like <i>P. ultimum</i>, <i>P. brassicum</i> P1 genome did not encode any classical RxLR effectors or cutinases, suggesting a significant difference in virulence mechanisms compared to other oomycetes. <i>Pythium brassicum</i> P1 had a much smaller proportions of the YxSL sequence motif in both secreted and non-secreted proteins, relative to other <i>Pythium</i> species. Similarly, <i>P. brassicum</i> P1 had the fewest <i>Crinkler</i> (CRN) effectors of all the <i>Pythium</i> species. There were 633 proteins predicted to be secreted in the <i>P. brassicum</i> P1 genome, which is, again, slightly below average among <i>Pythium</i> genomes. <i>Pythium brassicum</i> P1 had only one cadherin gene with calcium ion-binding LDRE and DxND motifs, compared to <i>Pythium ultimum</i> having four copies. <i>Pythium brassicum</i> P1 had a reduced number of proteins falling under carbohydrate binding module and hydrolytic enzymes. <i>Pythium brassicum</i> P1 had a reduced complement of cellulase and pectinase genes in contrast to <i>P. ultimum</i> and was deficient in xylan degrading enzymes. The contraction in ABC transporter families in <i>P. brassicum</i> P1 is suggested to be the result of a lack of diversity in nutrient uptake and therefore host range.
