Plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs), or multivesicular bodies (MVBs), are single membrane-bound organelles that play important roles in mediating protein trafficking to vacuoles in the secretory pathway. PVC/MVB also serves as a late endosome in the endocytic pathway in plants. Since the plant PVC was identified as an MVB more than 10 years ago, great progress has been made toward the understanding of PVC/MVB function and biogenesis in plants. In this review, we first summarize previous research into the identification and characterization of plant PVCs/MVBs, and then highlight recent advances on the mechanisms underlying intraluminal vesicle formation and maturation of plant PVCs/MVBs. In addition, we discuss the possible crosstalk that appears to occur between PVCs/MVBs and autophagosomes during autophagy in plants. Finally, we list some open questions and present future perspectives in this field.
