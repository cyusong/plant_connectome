['17259264', 'We isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, katamari2 (kam2), that has a defect  in the organization of endomembranes. This mutant had deformed endosomes and  formed abnormally large aggregates with various organelles. Map-based cloning  revealed that kam2 is allelic to gravitropism defective 2 (grv2). The KAM2/GRV2  gene encodes a homolog of a DnaJ domain-containing RECEPTOR-MEDIATED  ENDOCYTOSIS-8, which is considered to play a vital role in the endocytotic  pathway from the plasma membrane to lysosomes in animal cells. Immunofluorescent  staining showed that KAM2/GRV2 protein localizes on punctate structures, which  did not merge with any markers for Golgi, trans-Golgi network, endosomes, or  prevacuolar compartments. KAM2/GRV2, which does not have a predicted  transmembrane domain, was peripherally associated with the membrane surface of  uncharacterized compartments. KAM2/GRV2 was expressed at the early to middle  stages of seed maturation. We found kam2 mis-sorted seed storage proteins by  secreting them from cells, indicating that KAM2/GRV2 is involved in the transport  of the proteins into protein storage vacuoles. kam2 had another defect in  embryogenesis. Half of the developing kam2-1 cotyledons grew into the opposite  space of the seeds before the walking stick-shaped embryo stage. Our findings  suggest that KAM2/GRV2 is required for proper formation of the endosomes  involving protein trafficking to the vacuoles and determination of growth axis of  the embryo.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.046631', 'Hara-Nishimura']
