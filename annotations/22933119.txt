AGL6-clade genes are a subfamily of MADS-box genes and preferentially expressed in floral organs. OsMADS6 and OsMADS17 are two AGL6-like genes in rice. OsMADS17 has been shown to play a minor role in floral development and appears to result from a duplication of OsMADS6. OsMADS6 was initially named as MFO1 for mosaic floral organs based on its moderate mutant phenotypes. So far, four moderate or weak mutant alleles of OsMADS6 have been described, providing valuable insights into its role in flower development. Here, we report a null allele of OsMADS6 (Osmads6-5), which exhibited a strong mutant phenotype in spikelet without affecting vegetative traits, causing all floral organs except lemma homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs (LLOs) as well as an indeterminate floral meristem, thus resulting in a mutant floret consisting of reiterating whorls of lemma and LLOs. In consistently, over-expression of OsMADS6 led to additional lodicule-, stamen- and carpel-like organs. Expression analysis showed that OsMADS6 controls the formation of the incipient primordia of lodicule, stamen and carpel via regulating the expression of class B, C and SEP-like MADS-box genes. Taken together, our results revealed that OsMADS6 acts as a critical regulator for early flower development in rice and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of OsMADS6.
