['11250154', 'The infection of plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens leads to the formation of  crown gall tumors due to the transfer of a nucleoprotein complex into plant cells  that is mediated by the virulence (vir) region-encoded transport system (reviewed  in [1-5]). In addition, A. tumefaciens secretes the Vir proteins, VirE2 and VirF,  directly into plant cells via the same VirB/VirD4 transport system [6], and both  assist there in the transformation of normal cells into tumor cells. The function  of the 22 kDa VirF protein is not clear. Deletion of the virF gene in A.  tumefaciens leads to diminished virulence [7, 8] and can be complemented by the  expression of the virF gene in the host plant. This finding indicates that VirF  functions within the plant cell [8]. Here, we report that the VirF protein is the  first prokaryotic protein with an F box by which it can interact with plant  homologs of the yeast Skp1 protein. The presence of the F box turned out to be  essential for the biological function of VirF. F box proteins and Skp1p are both  subunits of a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases referred to as SCF complexes. Thus,  VirF may be involved in the targeted proteolysis of specific host proteins in  early stages of the transformation process.', '2001 Feb 20', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00069-0', 'Hooykaas']
