Although fungal association has been instrumental to the evolution of land plants, how genes of fungal origin might have contributed to major plant innovations remains unclear. In a recent study, we showed that a macro2 domain-containing gene likely acquired from mycorrhiza-like fungi is important in gametophore development of mosses, suggesting a role of fungi-derived genes in the three-dimensional growth of land plants.
