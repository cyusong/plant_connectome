Root cap not only protects root meristem, but also detects and transduces the signals of environmental changes to affect root development. The symplastic communication is an important way for plants to transduce signals to coordinate the development and physiology in response to the changing enviroments. However, it is unclear how the symplastic communication between root cap cells affects root growth. Here we exploit an inducible system to specifically block the symplastic communication in the root cap. Transient blockage of plasmodesmata (PD) in differentiated collumella cells severely impairs the root development in Arabidopsis, in particular in the stem cell niche and the proximal meristem. The neighboring stem cell niche is the region that is most sensitive to the disrupted symplastic communication and responds rapidly via the alteration of auxin distribution. In the later stage, the cell division in proximal meristem is inhibited, presumably due to the reduced auxin level in the root cap. Our results reveal the essential role of the differentiated collumella cells in the root cap mediated signaling system that directs root development.
