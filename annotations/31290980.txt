Brassinosteroids (BRs), a group of plant steroid hormones, participate in the regulation of plant growth and developmental processes. BR functions through the BES1/BZR1 family of transcription factors, however, the regulation of the BES1 activity by post-translational modifications remains largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that the SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1 negatively regulates BR signaling pathway. T-DNA insertion mutant siz1-2 shows BL (Brassinolide, the most active BR) hypersensitivity and BRZ (Brassinazole, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor) insensitivity during hypocotyl elongation. In addition, expression of BES1-dependent BR-response genes is hyper-regulated in siz1-2 seedlings. The siz1-2bes1-D double mutant exhibits longer hypocotyl than bes1-D. Moreover, SIZ1 physically interacts with BES1 in vivo and in vitro and mediates the sumoylation of BES1. A K302R substitution in BES1 blocks its sumoylation mediated by SIZ1 in plants, indicating that K302 is the principal site for SUMO conjugation. Consistently, we find that sumoylation inhibits BES1 protein stability and activity. Taken together, our data show that the sumoylation of BES1 via SIZ1 negatively regulates the BR signaling pathway.
