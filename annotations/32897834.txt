['32897834', 'Arabidopsis thaliana FLL2, a member of the FLO2 gene family, is expressed  specifically in green leaves. The fll2 mutant showed significantly large rosette  leaves and reduced the chlorophyll content. The sucrose content was significantly  reduced. The glucose content was higher during the vegetative growth stage but  decreased during the early reproductive growth stage. The amount of assimilated  starch was lower than that in the wild type plant. The expression levels of genes  involved in biosynthesis of sucrose and starch were largely altered. These  results suggest that, in the fll2 mutant, a small amount of photosynthetic  products was used for the biosynthesis of starch, and the products were supplied  to promote intracellular growth of the source organs or for transport to the sink  organs. These findings suggest that FLL2 is a factor affecting the expression  level of genes involved in sugar metabolism, whose mutation caused a change in  the assimilated products.
