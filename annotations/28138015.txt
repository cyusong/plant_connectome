Plants growing at high densities elongate their shoots to reach for light, a response known as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). Phytochrome-mediated detection of far-red light reflection from neighboring plants activates growth-promoting molecular pathways leading to SAS However, it is unknown how plants that complete their life cycle in the forest understory and are shade tolerant prevent SAS when exposed to shade. Here, we show how two wild <i>Geranium</i> species from different native light environments regulate contrasting responses to light quality cues. A comparative RNA sequencing approach unveiled the molecular underpinnings of their contrasting growth responses to far-red light enrichment. It also identified differential phytochrome control of plant immunity genes and confirmed that far-red enrichment indeed contrastingly affects resistance against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> between the two species. Furthermore, we identify a number of candidate regulators of differential shade avoidance. Three of these, the receptor-like kinases FERONIA and THESEUS1 and the non-DNA binding bHLH protein KIDARI, are functionally validated in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> through gene knockout and/or overexpression studies. We propose that these components may be associated with either showing or not showing shade avoidance responses.
