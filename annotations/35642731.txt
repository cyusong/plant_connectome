Similar to other cropping systems, few walnut cultivars are used as scion in commercial production. Germplasm collections can be used to diversify cultivar options and hold potential for improving crop productivity, disease resistance and stress tolerance. In this study, we explored the anatomical and biochemical bases of photosynthetic capacity and response to water stress in 11 Juglans regia accessions in the U.S. department of agriculture, agricultural research service (USDA-ARS) National Clonal Germplasm. Net assimilation rate (A<sub>n</sub> ) differed significantly among accessions and was greater in lower latitudes coincident with higher stomatal and mesophyll conductances, leaf thickness, mesophyll porosity, gas-phase diffusion, leaf nitrogen and lower leaf mass and stomatal density. High CO<sub>2</sub> -saturated assimilation rates led to increases in A<sub>n</sub> under diffusional and biochemical limitations. Greater A<sub>n</sub> was found in lower-latitude accessions native to climates with more frost-free days, greater precipitation seasonality and lower temperature seasonality. As expected, water stress consistently impaired photosynthesis with the highest % reductions in lower-latitude accessions (A3, A5 and A9), which had the highest A<sub>n</sub> under well-watered conditions. However, A<sub>n</sub> for A3 and A5 remained among the highest under dehydration. J. regia accessions, which have leaf structural traits and biochemistry that enhance photosynthesis, could be used as commercial scions or breeding parents to enhance productivity.
