Mapping-by-sequencing analyses have largely required a complete reference sequence and employed whole genome re-sequencing. In species such as wheat, no finished genome reference sequence is available. Additionally, because of its large genome size (17 Gb), re-sequencing at sufficient depth of coverage is not practical. Here, we extend the utility of mapping by sequencing, developing a bespoke pipeline and algorithm to map an early-flowering locus in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.) that is closely related to the bread wheat genome A progenitor. We have developed a genomic enrichment approach using the gene-rich regions of hexaploid bread wheat to design a 110-Mbp NimbleGen SeqCap EZ in solution capture probe set, representing the majority of genes in wheat. Here, we use the capture probe set to enrich and sequence an F2 mapping population of the mutant. The mutant locus was identified in T. monococcum, which lacks a complete genome reference sequence, by mapping the enriched data set onto pseudo-chromosomes derived from the capture probe target sequence, with a long-range order of genes based on synteny of wheat with Brachypodium distachyon. Using this approach we are able to map the region and identify a set of deleted genes within the interval.
