Flooding and drought are serious constraints that reduce crop productivity worldwide. Previous studies identified genes conferring tolerance to both water extremes in various plants. However, overlapping responses to flooding and drought at the genome-scale remain obscure. Here, we defined overlapping and stress-specific transcriptomic and hormonal responses to submergence, drought and recovery from these stresses in soybean (Glycine max). We performed comparative RNA-sequencing and hormone profiling, identifying genes, hormones and biological processes that are differentially regulated in an overlapping or stress-specific manner. Overlapping responses included positive regulation of trehalose and sucrose metabolism and negative regulation of cellulose, tubulin, photosystem II and I, and chlorophyll biosynthesis, facilitating the economization of energy reserves under both submergence and drought. Additional energy-consuming pathways were restricted in a stress-specific manner. Downregulation of distinct pathways for energy saving under each stress suggests energy-consuming processes that are relatively unnecessary for each stress adaptation are turned down. Our newly developed transcriptomic-response analysis revealed that abscisic acid and ethylene responses were activated in common under both stresses, whereas stimulated auxin response was submergence-specific. The energy-saving strategy is the key overlapping mechanism that underpins adaptation to both submergence and drought in soybean. Abscisic acid and ethylene are candidate hormones that coordinate transcriptomic energy-saving processes under both stresses. Auxin may be a signaling component that distinguishes submergence-specific regulation of the stress response.
