Plants must cope with ever-changing temperature conditions in their environment. Suboptimal high and low temperatures, and stressful extreme temperatures, induce adaptive mechanisms that allow optimal performance and survival, respectively. These processes have been extensively studied at the physiological, transcriptional and (epi)genetic level. Cellular temperature signalling cascades and tolerance mechanisms also involve post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly protein phosphorylation. Many protein kinases are known to be involved in cold acclimation and heat stress responsiveness but research on the role and importance of kinases and phosphatases in triggering responses to mild changes in temperature such as thermomorphogenesis is inadequately understood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the roles of kinases and phosphatases in plant temperature responses. We discuss how kinases can function over a range of temperatures in different signalling pathways and provide an outlook to the application of PTM-modifying factors for the development of thermotolerant crops.
