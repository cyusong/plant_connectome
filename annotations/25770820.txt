['25770820', 'Small RNAs (sRNAs) play important regulatory roles in various aspects of plant  biology. They are processed from double-stranded RNA precursors by Dicer-like  (DCL) proteins. There are three major classes of sRNAs in Arabidopsis:  DCL1-dependent microRNA (miRNA), DCL3-dependent heterochromatic siRNA (hc-siRNA),  and DCL4-dependent trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA). We have previously isolated a  mutant with compromised miRNA activity, cma33. Here we show that CMA33 encodes a  nuclear localized protein, XAP5 CIRCADIAN TIMEKEEPER (XCT). The cma33/xct  mutation led to reduced accumulation of not only miRNAs but also hc-siRNAs and  ta-siRNAs. Intriguingly, we found that the expression of DCL1, DCL3, and DCL4,  but not other genes in the sRNA biogenesis pathways, was decreased in cma33/xct.  Consistent with this, the occupancy of Pol II at DCL1, DCL3, and DCL4 genes was  reduced upon the loss of CMA33/XCT. Collectively, our data suggest that CMA33/XCT  modulates sRNA production through regulating the transcription of DCLs.', '2015 Aug', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2015.03.002', 'Qi']
