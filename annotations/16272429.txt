['16272429', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana protein nitric oxide synthase1 (NOS1) is needed for  nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and signaling during defense responses, hormonal  signaling, and flowering. The cellular localization of NOS1 was examined because  it is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein. NOS1-green fluorescent protein  fusions were localized by confocal microscopy to mitochondria in roots. Isolated  mitochondria from leaves of wild-type plants supported Arg-stimulated NO  synthesis that could be inhibited by NOS inhibitors and quenched by a NO  scavenger; this NOS activity is absent in mitochondria isolated from nos1 mutant  plants. Because mitochondria are a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which  participate in senescence and programmed cell death, these parameters were  examined in the nos1 mutant. Dark-induced senescence of detached leaves and  intact plants progressed more rapidly in the mutant compared with the wild type.  Hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, oxidized lipid, and oxidized protein levels  were all higher in the mutant. These results demonstrate that NOS1 is a  mitochondrial NOS that reduces ROS levels, mitigates oxidative damage, and acts  as an antisenescence agent.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.037770', 'Crawford']
