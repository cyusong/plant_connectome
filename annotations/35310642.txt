<i>Fraxinus velutina</i> Torr with high salt tolerance has been widely grown in saline lands in the Yellow River Delta, China. However, the salt-tolerant mechanisms of <i>F. velutina</i> remain largely elusive. Here, we identified two contrasting cutting clones of <i>F. velutina</i>, R7 (salt-tolerant), and S4 (salt-sensitive) by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics (Fv/Fm ratio) in the excised leaves and physiological indexes in roots or leaves under salt treatment. To further explore the salt resistance mechanisms, we compared the transcriptomes of R7 and S4 from leaf and root tissues exposed to salt stress. The results showed that when the excised leaves of S4 and R7 were, respectively, exposed to 250 mM NaCl for 48 h, <i>Fv</i>/<i>Fm</i> ratio decreased significantly in S4 compared with R7, confirming that R7 is more tolerant to salt stress. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that salt stress induced the significant upregulation of stress-responsive genes in R7, making important contributions to the high salt tolerance. Specifically, in the R7 leaves, salt stress markedly upregulated key genes involved in plant hormone signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways; in the R7 roots, salt stress induced the upregulation of main genes involved in proline biosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism. In addition, 12 genes encoding antioxidant enzyme peroxidase were all significantly upregulated in both leaves and roots. Collectively, our findings revealed the crucial defense pathways underlying high salt tolerance of R7 through significant upregulation of some key genes involving metabolism and hub signaling pathways, thus providing novel insights into salt-tolerant <i>F. velutina</i> breeding.
