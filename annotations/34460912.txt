Polyol transporters have been functionally characterized in yeast and Xenopus laevis oocytes as H+-symporters with broad substrate specificity, but little is known about their physiological roles in planta. To extend this knowledge, we investigated the role of LjPLT11 in Lotus japonicus-Mesorhizobium symbiosis. Functional analyses of LjPLT11 in yeast characterized it as an energy-independent transporter of xylitol, two O-methyl inositols, xylose, and galactose. We showed that LjPLT11 is located on peribacteroid membranes and functions as a facilitative transporter of d-pinitol within infected cells of L. japonicus nodules. Knock-down of LjPLT11 (LjPLT11i) in L. japonicus accelerated plant growth under nitrogen sufficiency, but resulted in abnormal bacteroids with corresponding reductions in nitrogenase activity in nodules and plant growth in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. LjPLT11i nodules had higher osmotic pressure in cytosol, and lower osmotic pressure in bacteroids, than wild-type nodules both 3 and 4 weeks after inoculation of Mesorhizobium loti. Levels and distributions of reactive oxygen species were also perturbed in infected cells of 4-week-old nodules in LjPLT11i plants. The results indicate that LjPLT11 plays a key role in adjustment of the levels of its substrate pinitol, and thus maintenance of osmotic balance in infected cells and peribacteroid membrane stability during nodule development.
