['18980662', 'Xylan, the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide in Arabidopsis secondary cell  walls, requires a number of glycosyltransferases (GT) to catalyse formation of  the various glycosidic linkages found in the polymer. In this study, we  characterized IRX10 and IRX10-like (IRX10-L), two highly homologous genes  encoding members of the glycosyltransferase family 47 (GT47). T-DNA insertions in  IRX10 gave a mild irregular xylem (irx) phenotype consistent with a minor defect  in secondary cell-wall synthesis, whereas plants containing mutations in IRX10-L  showed no change. However, irx10 irx10-L double mutant plants showed a much more  severe irx and whole-plant phenotype, suggesting considerable functional  redundancy between these two genes. Detailed biochemical analysis of the irx10  irx10-L double mutant showed a large reduction of xylan in the secondary cell  walls, consistent with a specific defect in xylan biosynthesis. Furthermore, the  irx10 irx10-L mutant retains the unique oligosaccharide found at the reducing end  of Arabidopsis xylan, but shows a severe reduction in beta(1,4)  xylosyltransferase activity. These characteristics are similar to those of irx9  and irx14, mutants that are believed to be defective in xylan chain elongation,  and suggests that IRX10 and IRX10-L also play a role in elongation of the xylan  backbone.', '2009 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03729.x', 'Turner']
