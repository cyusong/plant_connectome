This review provides insight into the roles of heterotrimeric RPA protein complexes encompassing all aspects of DNA metabolism in plants along with specific function attributed by individual subunits. It highlights research gaps that need further attention. Replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimeric protein complex partakes in almost every aspect of DNA metabolism in eukaryotes with its principle role being a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, thereby providing stability to single-stranded (ss) DNA. Although most of our knowledge of RPA structure and its role in DNA metabolism is based on studies in yeast and animal system, in recent years, plants have also been reported to have diverse repertoire of RPA complexes (formed by combination of different RPA subunit homologs arose during course of evolution), expected to be involved in plethora of DNA metabolic activities. Here, we have reviewed all studies regarding role of RPA in DNA metabolism in plants. As combination of plant RPA complexes may vary largely depending on number of homologs of each subunit, next step for plant biologists is to develop specific functional methods for detailed analysis of biological roles of these complexes, which we have tried to formulate in our review. Besides, complete absence of any study regarding regulatory role of posttranslational modification of RPA complexes in DNA metabolism in plants, prompts us to postulate a hypothetical model of same in light of information from animal system. With our review, we envisage to stimulate the RPA research in plants to shift its course from descriptive to functional studies, thereby bringing a new angle of studying dynamic DNA metabolism in plants.
