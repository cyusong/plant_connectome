Currently, the types of factors that impact the mutation rate is a controversial issue. The marked attention towards identifying the factors that impact the genomic mutation rate is justified because mutations are the source of genetic variation underlying evolution and because many mutations have deleterious effects and can cause diseases. Although data showing correlations between germ cell division number and mutation rates (from epidemiological studies and molecular evolutionary rate analyses) have suggested that most mutations in animals are replication errors, this notion is highly debated and inconsistencies in the correlations suggest that other, replication-independent factors, could play an important role. Likely candidates include environmental parameters and cell age, but these issues have proved to be difficult to study using animals and in vitro systems, and consequently, very few or no data currently exist. The specific features of plants that make them powerful model systems for revealing the influence of the environment (natural environmental factors) and cell age on the spontaneous genomic mutation rate are discussed here. Overall, the evidence suggests that plants could be key biological systems for advancing our knowledge about how and why heritable mutations arise.
