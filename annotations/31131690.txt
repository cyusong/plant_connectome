Information on the best methods for producing endangered <i>Serianthes nelsonii</i> plants for use in species recovery projects is lacking. Plants of this species behave similarly in a nursery setting to plants of the congeneric <i>Serianthes grandiflora</i> and <i>Serianthes kanehirae</i>. Container-grown plants of these two species were repeatedly pruned in the nursery to determine if a more favorable root:shoot ratio would result, then to determine if performance after out-planting would benefit from the enhanced root growth. Repetitive pruning increased absolute root dry weight 43% to 61% and root:shoot ratio 55% to 56% above that of control plants that were not pruned. One year after out-planting, the pruned plants were greater in shoot dry weight and plant height than the control plants. More importantly, control plants exhibited 70% to 80% mortality, but the pruned plants exhibited 100% survival. This new knowledge from two surrogate species indicated that repetitive pruning of <i>S. nelsonii</i> plants in conservation nurseries would greatly increase the quality of the resulting transplants and therefore nurseries may add pruning as a prescribed production protocol to improve species recovery success.
