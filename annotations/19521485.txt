Fluid phase endocytic uptake of external solutes in plant cells was further substantiated using artificial polystyrene nano-spheres (40 nm) and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (20 nm). Both types of artificial nano-particles were taken up by sycamore-cultured cells. However, whereas polystyrene nano-spheres were delivered to the central vacuole, CdSe/ZnS nano-dots were sequestered into cytoplasmic vesicular structures. Using dextran-Texas Red (m.w. 3,000; d-TR) as additional marker, confocal micrographs confirmed the distinct topographic distribution of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots within the cell. Initially, d-TR and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots colocalized within cytoplasmic vesicles. After 18 h incubation, d-TR was distinctly localized in the vacuole whereas CdSe/ZnS quantum dots remained sequestered in cytoplasmic membranous compartments. The data provide a first evidence for the rapid distribution of solutes taken up by endocytosis to distinct intracellular compartments.
