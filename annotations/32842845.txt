Plant architecture and disease resistance are the key factors that control the production of yield. However, the mechanism behind these factors is largely unknown. In this study, we identified that <i>indeterminate domain 3</i> (<i>IDD3</i>) was obviously induced by inoculation of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> AG1-IA. Plants that overexpressed <i>IDD3 (IDD3 OX)</i> were more susceptible, while <i>idd3</i> mutants showed a similar response to sheath blight disease compared with wild-type plants. Interestingly, <i>IDD3 OX</i> plants developed a wider tiller angle and exhibited altered shoot gravitropism, while <i>idd3</i> knock-out mutants showed no visible morphological differences compared with the wild-type plants. <i>IDD3</i> is ubiquitously expressed in different tissues and stages, and the <i>IDD3</i> transcript was induced by exogenously applied auxin. Expression of the <i>PIN-FORMED (PIN)</i> and <i>Aux/IAA</i> genes was altered in <i>IDD3 OX</i> compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, <i>IDD3 OX</i> plants are sensitive to auxin and the polar auxin transporter inhibitor N-1-naphthylphalamic acid (NPA). Further yeast-one hybrid, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and transient assays revealed that IDD3 directly represses <i>PIN1b</i> via promoter binding. Inoculation with <i>R. solani</i> indicated that <i>PIN1b RNAi</i> plants are more susceptible to sheath blight disease (ShB) compared with the wild-type. Taken together, our analyses suggest that <i>IDD3</i> controls plant architecture and the resistance of rice to ShB via the regulation of <i>PIN</i> auxin transporter genes.
