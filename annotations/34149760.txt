It is well known that WRKY transcription factors play essential roles in plants' response to diverse stress responses, especially to drought and salt stresses. However, a full comprehensive analysis of this family in wheat is still missing. Here we used <i>in silico</i> analysis and identified 124 <i>WRKY</i> genes, including 294 homeologous copies from a high-quality reference genome of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). We also found that the <i>TaWRKY</i> gene family did not undergo gene duplication rather than gene loss during the evolutionary process. The <i>TaWRKY</i> family members displayed different expression profiles under several abiotic stresses, indicating their unique functions in the mediation of particular responses. Furthermore, <i>TaWRKY75-A</i> was highly induced after polyethylene glycol and salt treatments. The ectopic expression of <i>TaWRKY75-A</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> enhanced drought and salt tolerance. A comparative transcriptome analysis demonstrated that <i>TaWRKY75-A</i> integrated jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway and other potential metabolic pathways to increase drought and salt resistances in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Our study provides valuable insights into the <i>WRKY</i> family in wheat and will generate a useful genetic resource for improving wheat breeding.
