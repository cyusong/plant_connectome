Plant TRANS-ACTING SIRNA3 (TAS3)-derived short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) include tasiR-AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs), which are functionally conserved in targeting ARF genes, and a set of non-tasiR-ARF siRNAs, which have rarely been studied. In this study, TAS3 siRNAs were systematically characterized in rice (Oryza sativa). Small RNA sequencing results showed that an overwhelming majority of TAS3 siRNAs belong to the non-tasiR-ARF group, while tasiR-ARFs occupy a diminutive fraction. Phylogenetic analysis of TAS3 genes across dicot and monocot plants revealed that the siRNA-generating regions were highly conserved in grass species, especially in the Oryzoideae. Target genes were identified for not only tasiR-ARFs but also non-tasiR-ARF siRNAs by analyzing rice Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends datasets, and some of these siRNA-target interactions were experimentally confirmed using tas3 mutants generated by genome editing. Consistent with the de-repression of target genes, phenotypic alterations were observed for mutants in three TAS3 loci in comparison to wild-type rice. The regulatory role of ribosomes in the TAS3 siRNA-target interactions was further revealed by the fact that TAS3 siRNA-mediated target cleavage, in particular tasiR-ARFs targeting ARF2/3/14/15, occurred extensively in rice polysome samples. Altogether, our study sheds light into TAS3 genes in plants and expands our knowledge about rice TAS3 siRNA-target interactions.
