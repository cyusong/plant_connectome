Multicellular organisms undergo several developmental transitions during their life cycles. In contrast to animals, the plant germline is derived from adult somatic cells. As such, the juvenility of a plant must be reset in each generation. Previous studies have demonstrated that the decline in the levels of miR156/7 with age drives plant maturation. Here we show that the resetting of plant juvenility during each generation is mediated by de novo activation of MIR156/7 in Arabidopsis. Blocking this process leads to a shortened juvenile phase and premature flowering in the offspring. In particular, an Arabidopsis plant devoid of miR156/7 flowers even without formation of rosette leaves in long days. Mechanistically, we find that different MIR156/7 genes are reset at different developmental stages through distinct reprogramming routes. Among these genes, MIR156A, B and C are activated de novo during sexual reproduction and embryogenesis, while MIR157A and C are reset upon seed germination. This redundancy generates a robust reset mechanism that ensures accurate restoration of the juvenile phase in each plant generation.
