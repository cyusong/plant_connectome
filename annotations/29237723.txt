Cuticular wax plays crucial roles in protecting plants from environmental stresses, particularly drought stress. Many enzyme-encoding genes and transcription factors involved in wax biosynthesis have been identified, but the underlying posttranslational regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that <i>DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE</i> (<i>DHS</i>), encoding a Really Interesting New Gene (RING)-type protein, is a critical regulator of wax biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The cuticular wax contents were significantly reduced in <i>DHS</i> overexpression plants but increased in <i>dhs</i> mutants compared with the wild type, which resulted in a response opposite that of drought stress. DHS exhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and interacted with the homeodomain-leucine zipper IV protein ROC4. Analysis of <i>ROC4</i> overexpression plants and <i>roc4</i> mutants indicated that ROC4 positively regulates cuticular wax biosynthesis and the drought stress response. ROC4 is ubiquitinated in vivo and subjected to ubiquitin/26S proteasome-mediated degradation. ROC4 degradation was promoted by DHS but delayed in <i>dhs</i> mutants. ROC4 acts downstream of DHS, and Os<i>-BDG</i> is a direct downstream target of the DHS-ROC4 cascade. These results suggest a mechanism whereby DHS negatively regulates wax biosynthesis by promoting the degradation of ROC4, and they suggest that DHS and ROC4 are valuable targets for the engineering of drought-tolerant rice cultivars.
