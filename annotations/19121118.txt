['19121118', 'Colonisation of plant roots by selected beneficial Trichoderma fungi or  Pseudomonas bacteria can result in the activation of a systemic defence response  that is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. In Arabidopsis thaliana,  induced systemic resistance (ISR) triggered by the rhizobacterial strain  Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r is regulated by a jasmonic acid- and  ethylene-dependent defence signalling pathway. Jasmonic acid and ethylene also  play a role in Trichoderma-induced resistance. To further investigate the  similarities between rhizobacteria- and Trichoderma-induced resistance, we  studied the response of Arabidopsis to root colonisation by Trichoderma  asperellum T34. In many aspects T34-ISR was similar to WCS417r-ISR. First,  colonisation of the roots by T34 rendered the leaves more resistant to the  bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, the biotrophic oomycete  Hyaloperonospora parasitica and the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella  cucumerina. Second, treatment of the roots with T34 primed the leaf tissue for  enhanced jasmonic acid-responsive gene expression and increased formation of  callose-containing papillae upon pathogen attack. Third, T34-ISR was fully  expressed in the salicylic acid impaired mutant sid2, but blocked in the defence  regulatory mutant npr1. Finally, we show that the root-specific transcription  factor MYB72, which is essential in early signalling steps of WCS417r-ISR, is  also required for T34-ISR. Together, these results indicate that the defence  pathways triggered by beneficial Trichoderma and Pseudomonas spp. strains are  highly similar and that MYB72 functions as an early node of convergence in the  signalling pathways that are induced by these different beneficial  microorganisms.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Biol (Stuttg)', '10.1111/j.1438-8677.2008.00162.x', 'Pieterse']
