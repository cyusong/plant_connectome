Isolation and purification of a alpha-methyl-mannoside specific lectin (SL-I) of peanut was reported earlier [Singh and Das (1994) Glycoconj J 11:282-285]. Native SL-I is a glycoprotein having approximately 31 kDa subunit molecular mass and forms dimer. The gene encoding this lectin is identified from a 6-day old peanut root cDNA library by anti-SL-I antibody and N-terminal amino acid sequence homology to the native lectin. Nucleotide sequence derived amino acid sequence of the re-SL-I shows amino acid sequence homology with the N-terminal and tryptic digests' amino acid sequence of the native SL-I (nSL-I). Presence of a putative glycosylation (QNPS) site and a hydrophobic adenine-binding (VLVSYDANS) site is also identified in SL-I. Homology modeling of the lectin suggests it to be an archetype of legume lectins. It is expressed as a approximately 30 kDa apoprotein in E. coli and has the carbohydrate specificity and secondary structure identical to its natural counterpart. The lectin SL-I inhibits cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BA)-induced "delayed leaf senescence" and "cotyledon expansion". Equilibrium dialysis revealed a single high-affinity binding site for adenine (7.6 x 10(-6 )M) and BA (1.09 x 10(-5 )M) in the SL-I dimer and thus suggesting that the cytokinin antagonist effect of SL-I is mediated by the direct interaction of SL-I with BA.
