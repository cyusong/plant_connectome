<i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i>, which is known for its broad genetic diversity for virulence, is the causal agent of clubroot disease of <i>Brassica</i> crops worldwide. Studies on pathotype characterization with four differential hosts according to Williams' classification system showed the predominance of pathotype 4 in China. However, the genetic variability within pathotype 4 complicates the breeding of durable clubroot-resistant (CR) cultivars. Herein, a Sinitic clubroot differential (SCD) set was developed using a set of eight differential inbred lines of Chinese cabbage with known or novel <i>CR</i> genes. The presence of immense diversity within pathotype 4 of Williams' system was verified, and 11 pathotypes were characterized using the developed SCD system. The scalability and practicability of the system was further confirmed with a subset of 95 field isolates from different <i>Brassica</i> crops and different regions of China and Korea. Sixteen pathotypes were detected from 132 field isolates, named Pb1 to Pb16, respectively. Among them, Pb1 and Pb4 were prevalent in diverse <i>Brassica</i> crops in the southern and northern regions of China. Pb12, Pb13, Pb14, and Pb16 showed area-specific distribution. The SCD set developed herein will provide important genetic resources for pathogenicity studies of <i>P. brassicae</i> and for CR breeding in Chinese cabbage and other <i>Brassica</i> crops.
