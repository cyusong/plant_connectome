Developmental plasticity contributes to plant adaptation and fitness in a given condition. Hypocotyl elongation is under the tight control of complex genetic networks encompassing light, circadian, and photoperiod signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 (HDA9) mediates day length-dependent hypocotyl cell elongation. HDA9 binds to the <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) locus involved in photoperiodic hypocotyl elongation. The short day (SD)-accumulated HDA9 protein promotes histone H3 deacetylation at the <i>GI</i> locus during the dark period, promoting hypocotyl elongation. Consistently, <i>HDA9</i>-deficient mutants display reduced hypocotyl length, along with an increase in <i>GI</i> gene expression, only under SD conditions. Taken together, our study reveals the genetic basis of day length-dependent cell elongation in plants.
