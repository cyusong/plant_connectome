Perception of a change in light intensity leads to the activation of multiple physiological, metabolic, and molecular responses in plants. These responses allow acclimation to fluctuating light conditions, e.g. sunflecks in field grown plants, preventing cellular damage associated with excess light stress. Perception of light stress by a single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf was recently shown to activate different local and systemic responses that include rapid changes in stomatal aperture size; these were found to be coordinated by a systemic process of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-derived ROS production (i.e. the ROS wave). How light intensity is perceived, and how long the ROS wave stays "on" during this process are, however, unknown. Here we show that triggering of the ROS wave by a local excess light stress treatment results in the induction and maintenance of high levels of systemic ROS for up to 6 h. Despite these high systemic ROS levels, stomatal aperture size returns to control size within 3 h, and the systemic stomatal response can be retriggered within 6 h. These findings suggest that the ROS wave triggers a systemic stress memory mechanism that lasts for 3 to 6 h, but that within 3 h of its activation, stomata become insensitive to ROS and open. We further show that the excess light stress-triggered ROS wave, as well as the excess light stress-triggered local and systemic stomatal aperture closure responses, are dependent on phytochrome B function. Our findings reveal a delicate interplay between excess light stress, phytochrome B, ROS production, and rapid systemic stomatal responses.
