Coordinated transcriptional control employing synthetic promoters and transcription factors (TFs) can be used to achieve customized regulation of gene expression in planta. Synthetic promoter technology has yielded a series of promoters with modified cis-regulatory elements that provide useful tools for efficient modulation of gene expression. In addition, the use of zinc fingers (ZFs), transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), and catalytically inactive clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (dCas9) has made it feasible to engineer TFs that can produce targeted gene expression regulation; these approaches are particularly effective when artificial TFs are coupled with transcriptional activators or repressors. This review focuses on strategies used to engineer both promoters and TFs in the context of targeted transcriptional regulation. We also discuss the creation of synthetic inducible platforms, which can be used to impart stress tolerance to plants. We propose that combinatorial "cis-trans engineering" using a CRISPR-dCas9-based bipartite module could be used to regulate the expression of multiple target genes. This approach provides an attractive tool for introduction of specific qualitative traits into plants, thus enhancing their overall environmental adaptability.
