Legumes survive in nitrogen-limited soil by forming a symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria. During root nodule symbiosis, legumes strictly control the development of their symbiotic organs, the nodules, in a process known as autoregulation of nodulation (AON). The study of hypernodulation mutants has elucidated the molecular basis of AON. Some hypernodulation mutants show an increase in rhizobial infection in addition to developmental alteration. However, the relationship between the AON and the regulation of rhizobial infection has not been clarified. We previously isolated <i>daphne</i>, a <i>nodule inception</i> (<i>nin</i>) allelic mutant, in <i>Lotus japonicus</i>. This mutant displayed dramatically increased rhizobial infection, suggesting the existence of NIN-mediated negative regulation of rhizobial infection. Here, we investigated whether the previously isolated components of AON, especially CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE)-RELATED-ROOT SIGNAL1 (CLE-RS1), CLE-RS2, and their putative receptor HYPERNODULATION AND ABERRANT ROOT FORMATION1 (HAR1), were able to suppress increased infection in the <i>daphne</i> mutant. The constitutive expression of <i>LjCLE-RS1/2</i> strongly reduced the infection in the <i>daphne</i> mutant in a HAR1-dependent manner. Moreover, reciprocal grafting analysis showed that strong reduction of infection in <i>daphne</i> rootstock constitutively expressing <i>LjCLE-RS1</i> was canceled by a scion of the <i>har1</i> or <i>klavier</i> mutant, the genes responsible for encoding putative LjCLE-RS1 receptors. These data indicate that rhizobial infection is also systemically regulated by CLE-HAR1 signaling, a component of AON. In addition, the constitutive expression of <i>NIN</i> in <i>daphne har1</i> double-mutant roots only partially reduced the rhizobial infection. Our findings indicate that the previously identified NIN-mediated negative regulation of infection involves unknown local signaling, as well as CLE-HAR1 long-distance signaling.
