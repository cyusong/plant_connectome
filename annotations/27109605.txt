Gene amplification followed by functional diversification is a major force in evolution. A typical example of this is seen in the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) gene family, named after the Arabidopsis stem cell regulator WUSCHEL. Here we analyze functional divergence in the WOX gene family. Members of the WUS clade, except the cambium stem cell regulator WOX4, can substitute for WUS function in shoot and floral stem cell maintenance to different degrees. Stem cell function of WUS requires a canonical WUS-box, essential for interaction with TPL/TPR co-repressors, whereas the repressive EAR domain is dispensable and the acidic domain seems only to be required for female fertility. In contrast to the WUS clade, members of the ancient WOX13 and the WOX9 clades cannot support stem cell maintenance. Although the homeodomains are interchangeable between WUS and WOX9 clade members, a WUS-compatible homeodomain together with canonical WUS-box is not sufficient for stem cell maintenance. Our results suggest that WOX function in shoot and floral meristems of Arabidopsis is restricted to the modern WUS clade, suggesting that stem cell control is a derived function. Yet undiscovered functional domains in addition to the homeodomain and the WUS-box are necessary for this function.
