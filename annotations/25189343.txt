Cold stress is a major environmental factor that affects plant growth, development, productivity and distribution. In higher plants, the known major cold signaling pathway is the C-repeat (CRT)-binding factor/dehydration-responsive element (DRE) binding factor (CBF/DREB)-mediated transcriptional regulatory cascade, which is essential for the induction of a set of cold responsive (COR) genes. Recent studies indicate that various plant hormones are also involved in responses to cold stress. This review summarizes recent progress in cold signaling and our understanding of phytohormone signaling in the regulation of plant responses to cold stress.
