['31883775', 'Development of multicellular organisms requires coordination of cell division and  differentiation across tissues. In plants, directional signaling, and implicitly  cell polarity, is proposed to participate in this coordination; however,  mechanistic links between intercellular signaling, cell polarity, and cellular  organization remain unclear. Here, we investigate the localization and function  of INFLORESCENCE AND ROOT APICES RECEPTOR KINASE (IRK) in root development. We  find that IRK-GFP localizes to the outer plasma membrane domain in endodermal  cells but localizes to different domains in other cell types. Our results suggest  that IRK localization is informed locally by adjacent cell types. irk mutants  have excess cell divisions in the ground tissue stem cells and endodermis,  indicating IRK functions to maintain tissue organization through inhibition of  specific cell divisions. We predict that IRK perceives a directional cue that  negatively regulates these cell divisions, thus linking intercellular signaling  and cell polarity with the control of oriented cell divisions during development.', '2020 Jan 27', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2019.12.001', 'Van']
