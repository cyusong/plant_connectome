['11158531', 'A mutation in the Arabidopsis gene STARIK leads to dwarfism and chlorosis of  plants with an altered morphology of leaf and cell nuclei. We show that the  STARIK gene encodes the mitochondrial ABC transporter Sta1 that belongs to a  subfamily of Arabidopsis half-ABC transporters. The severity of the starik  phenotype is suppressed by the ectopic expression of the STA2 homolog; thus, Sta1  function is partially redundant. Sta1 supports the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S  protein in Deltaatm1 yeast, substituting for the ABC transporter Atm1p. Similar  to Atm1p-deficient yeast, mitochondria of the starik mutant accumulated more  nonheme, nonprotein iron than did wild-type organelles. We further show that  plant mitochondria contain a putative l-cysteine desulfurase. Taken together, our  results suggest that plant mitochondria possess an evolutionarily conserved Fe/S  cluster biosynthesis pathway, which is linked to the intracellular iron  homeostasis by the function of Atm1p-like ABC transporters.', '2001 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.1.89', 'Van']
