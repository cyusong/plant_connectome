The vegetative phase transition is a prerequisite for flowering in angiosperm plants. Mulberry miR156 has been confirmed to be a crucial factor in the vegetative phase transition in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The over-expression of miR156 in transgenic <i>Populus × canadensis</i> dramatically prolongs the juvenile phase. Here, we find that the expression of mno-miR156 decreases with age in all tissues in mulberry, which led us to study the hierarchical action of miR156 in mulberry. Utilizing degradome sequencing and dual-luciferase reporter assays, nine <i>MnSPL</i>s were shown to be directly regulated by miR156. The results of yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assays also revealed that six MnSPLs could recognize the promoter sequences of mno-miR172 and activate its expression. Our results demonstrate that mno-miR156 performs its role by repressing MnSPL/mno-miR172 pathway expression in mulberry. This work uncovered a miR156/SPLs/miR172 regulation pathway in the development of mulberry and fills a gap in our knowledge about the molecular mechanism of vegetative phase transition in perennial woody plants.
