Flower induction in adult citrus is mainly regulated by drought and low temperatures. However, the mechanism of FLOWERING LOCUS T regulation of citrus flowering (CiFT) under two flower-inductive stimuli remains largely unclear. In this study, a citrus transcription factor, nuclear factor YA (CiNF-YA1), was found to specifically bind to the CiFT promoter by forming a complex with CiNF-YB2 and CiNF-YC2 to activate CiFT expression. CiNF-YA1 was induced in juvenile citrus by low temperature and drought treatments. Overexpression of CiNF-YA1 increased drought susceptibility in transgenic citrus, whereas suppression of CiNF-YA1 enhanced drought tolerance in silenced citrus plants. Furthermore, a GOLDEN<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup> LIKE protein (CiFE) that interacts with CiFT protein was also isolated. Further experimental evidence showed that CiFE binds to the citrus LEAFY (CiLFY) promoter and activates its expression. In addition, the expressions of CiNF-YA1 and CiFE showed a seasonal increase during the floral induction period and were induced by artificial drought and low-temperature treatments at which floral induction occurred. These results indicate that CiNF-YA1 may activate CiFT expression in response to drought and low temperatures by binding to the CiFT promoter. CiFT then forms a complex with CiFE to activate CiLFY, thereby promoting the flowering of adult citrus.
