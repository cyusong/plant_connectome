Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is an almost ubiquitous phospholipid in eukaryotic algae and plants but is not found in a few species, for example Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We recently found that some species of the genus Chlamydomonas possess PC. In the universal pathway, PC is synthesized de novo by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or transfer of phosphocholine from cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline to diacylglycerol. Phosphocholine, the direct precursor to CDP-choline, is synthesized either by methylation of phosphoethanolamine or phosphorylation of choline. Here we analyzed the mechanism of PC biosynthesis in two species of Chlamydomonas (asymmetrica and sphaeroides) as well as in a red alga, Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Comparative genomic analysis of enzymes involved in PC biosynthesis indicated that C. merolae possesses only the PE methylation pathway. Radioactive tracer experiments using [(32) P]phosphate showed delayed labeling of PC with respect to PE, which was consistent with the PE methylation pathway. In Chlamydomonas asymmetrica, labeling of PC was detected from the early time of incubation with [(32) P]phosphate, suggesting the operation of phosphoethanolamine methylation pathway. Genomic analysis indeed detected the genes for the phosphoethanolamine methylation pathway. In contrast, the labeling of PC in C. sphaeroides was slow, suggesting that the PE methylation pathway was at work. These results as well as biochemical and computational results uncover an unexpected diversity of the mechanisms for PC biosynthesis in algae. Based on these results, we will discuss plausible mechanisms for the scattered distribution of the ability to biosynthesize PC in the genus Chlamydomonas.
