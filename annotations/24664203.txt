['24664203', "The chloroplast F1Fo-ATP synthase/ATPase (cpATPase) couples ATP synthesis to the  light-driven electrochemical proton gradient. The cpATPase is a multiprotein  complex and consists of a membrane-spanning protein channel (comprising subunit  types a, b, b', and c) and a peripheral domain (subunits alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon). We  report the characterization of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CONSERVED  ONLY IN THE GREEN LINEAGE160 (AtCGL160) protein (AtCGL160), conserved in green  algae and plants. AtCGL160 is an integral thylakoid protein, and its  carboxyl-terminal portion is distantly related to prokaryotic ATP SYNTHASE  PROTEIN1 (Atp1/UncI) proteins that are thought to function in ATP synthase  assembly. Plants without AtCGL160 display an increase in xanthophyll cycle  activity and energy-dependent nonphotochemical quenching. These photosynthetic  perturbations can be attributed to a severe reduction in cpATPase levels that  result in increased acidification of the thylakoid lumen. AtCGL160 is not an  integral cpATPase component but is specifically required for the efficient  incorporation of the c-subunit into the cpATPase. AtCGL160, as well as a chimeric  protein containing the amino-terminal part of AtCGL160 and Synechocystis sp.  PCC6803 Atp1, physically interact with the c-subunit. We conclude that AtCGL160  and Atp1 facilitate the assembly of the membranous part of the cpATPase in their  hosts, but loss of their functions provokes a unique compensatory response in  each organism.", '2014 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.237883', 'Leister']
