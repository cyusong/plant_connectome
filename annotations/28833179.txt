Improvements in plant photosynthesis by genetic engineering show considerable potential towards this goal. One prospective approach is to introduce a CO<sub>2</sub> -concentrating mechanism into crop plants to increase carbon fixation by supplying the central carbon-fixing enzyme, Rubisco, with a higher concentration of its substrate, CO<sub>2</sub> . A promising donor organism for the molecular machinery of this mechanism is the eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of carbon concentration in Chlamydomonas, outlines the most pressing gaps in our knowledge and discusses strategies to transfer a CO<sub>2</sub> -concentrating mechanism into higher plants to increase photosynthetic performance.
