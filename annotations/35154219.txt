Seed dormancy is a complex adaptive trait of plants that are influenced by several physiological and environmental factors. The endangered plant <i>Cinnamomum migao</i> is also known to exhibit seed dormancy and low germination, which may influence its regeneration; however, these characteristics remain unexplored. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the type of dormancy and improve the germination percentage of <i>C. migao</i> seeds. We evaluated the structure and characteristics of the embryo and endocarp of <i>C. migao</i> seeds as well as the effects of endogenous inhibitors. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of light, stratification, alternating temperature, and gibberellic acid 3 (GA<sub>3</sub>) on the dormancy release of these seeds. The embryo was well developed the endocarp was water-permeable, and no obvious mechanical hindrance to germination was observed. However, the endocarp and embryo contained phenols and other germination inhibitors. The seed extracts of <i>C. migao</i> delayed the germination of cabbage and ryegrass seeds, which indicates the presence of endogenous inhibitors. These findings suggest that <i>C. migao</i> seeds exhibit physiological dormancy. Light and an alternating temperature (15/20°C) did not influence germination. However, GA<sub>3</sub> pretreatment, alternating temperatures, and warm stratification relieved dormancy. GA<sub>3</sub> pretreatment combined with the 15°C stratification treatment was most effective in rapidly releasing the <i>C. migao</i> seed dormancy. Our findings may facilitate the storage and conservation of this endangered plant, which is currently underrepresented in <i>ex situ</i> collections.
