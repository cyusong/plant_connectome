Sorghum research has entered an exciting and fruitful era due to the genetic, genomic, and breeding resources that are now available to researchers and plant breeders. As the world faces the challenges of a rising population and a changing global climate, new agricultural solutions will need to be developed to address the food and fiber needs of the future. To that end, sorghum will be an invaluable crop species as it is a stress-resistant C<sub>4</sub> plant that is well adapted for semi-arid and arid regions. Sorghum has already remained as a staple food crop in many parts of Africa and Asia and is critically important for animal feed and niche culinary applications in other regions, such as the United States. In addition, sorghum has begun to be developed into a promising feedstock for forage and bioenergy production. Due to this increasing demand for sorghum and its potential to address these needs, the continuous development of powerful community resources is required. These resources include vast collections of sorghum germplasm, high-quality reference genome sequences, sorghum association panels for genome-wide association studies of traits involved in food and bioenergy production, mutant populations for rapid discovery of causative genes for phenotypes relevant to sorghum improvement, gene expression atlas, and online databases that integrate all resources and provide the sorghum community with tools that can be used in breeding and genomic studies. Used in tandem, these valuable resources will ensure that the rate, quality, and collaborative potential of ongoing sorghum improvement efforts is able to rival that of other major crops.
