During the legume-rhizobium symbiotic interaction, rhizobial invasion of legumes is primarily mediated by a plant-made tubular invagination called an infection thread (IT). Here, we identify a gene in <i>Lotus japonicus</i> encoding a Leu-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK), <i>RINRK1</i> (<i>Rhizobial Infection Receptor-like Kinase1</i>), that is induced by Nod factors (NFs) and is involved in IT formation but not nodule organogenesis. A paralog, RINRK2, plays a relatively minor role in infection. <i>RINRK1</i> is required for full induction of early infection genes, including Nodule Inception (<i>NIN</i>), encoding an essential nodulation transcription factor. <i>RINRK1</i> displayed an infection-specific expression pattern, and NIN bound to the <i>RINRK1</i> promoter, inducing its expression. <i>RINRK1</i> was found to be an atypical kinase localized to the plasma membrane and did not require kinase activity for rhizobial infection. We propose RINRK1 is an infection-specific RLK, which may specifically coordinate output from NF signaling or perceive an unknown signal required for rhizobial infection.
