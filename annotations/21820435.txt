['21820435', "While there is evidence of nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signalling via the second  messenger cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in plants, guanylate  cyclases (GCs), enzymes that catalyse the formation of cGMP from guanosine  5'-triphosphate (GTP) have until recently remained elusive and none of the  candidates identified to-date are NO-dependent. Using both a GC and heme-binding  domain specific (H-NOX) search motif, we have identified an Arabidopsis flavin  monooxygenase (At1g62580) and shown electrochemically that it binds NO, has a  higher affinity for NO than for O(2) and that this molecule can generate cGMP  from GTP in vitro in an NO-dependent manner.", '2011 Sep 2', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2011.07.023', 'Gehring']
