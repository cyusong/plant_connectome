The fatty acid desaturase <i>FAD2</i> genes are the main contributors to oleic acid content, and different <i>FAD2</i> alleles can result in different oleic acid contents in rapeseed oil. Hence, identification of allelic variation in <i>FAD2</i> is an extremely desirable breeding goal. By performing QTL mapping using 190 F<sub>2:3</sub> lines genotyped by genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers assayed by the <i>Brassica</i> 60 K Infinium BeadChip Array, four quantitative trait loci (QTL) for C18:1 content were mapped on chromosomes A01, A05, A09 and C05 over 3 years in a population segregating for oleic acid content. Two <i>BnFAD2</i> genes on A05 and C05 were anchored within the QTL intervals, explaining 45-52 and 15-44% of the observed variation for C18:1 content. Sequence polymorphisms between the corresponding coding regions of the parental lines found two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>BnFAD2.A05</i> and <i>BnFAD2.C05</i>, respectively, which led to the amino acid changes (C421T and G1073E) in the corresponding proteins. The mutation sites of <i>Bnfad2.A05</i> and <i>Bnfad2.C05</i> alleles were located within the second H-box and near the third H-box motif of the protein, respectively, and were found to be novel mutant alleles. Lines resulting from the combination of these two alleles contained up to 88% oleic acid in their seed oil, compared with 63% in wild-type controls. Two competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers based on these two mutation sites were successfully developed and validated in segregating F<sub>2</sub> populations. These markers will facilitate breeding for ultra-high seed oleic acid content in oilseed rape.
