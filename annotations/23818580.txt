['23818580', 'Maintaining active growth and effective immune responses is often costly for a  living organism to survive. Fine-tuning the shared cross-regulators is crucial  for metazoans and plants to make a trade-off between growth and immunity. The  Arabidopsis regulatory receptor-like kinase BAK1 complexes with the receptor  kinases FLS2 in bacterial flagellin-triggered immunity and BRI1 in  brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated growth. BR homeostasis and signaling  unidirectionally modulate FLS2-mediated immune responses at multiple levels. We  have shown previously that BIK1, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, is directly  phosphorylated by BAK1 and associates with FLS2/BAK1 complex in transducing  flagellin signaling. In contrast to its positive role in plant immunity, we  report here that BIK1 acts as a negative regulator in BR signaling. The bik1  mutant displays various BR hypersensitive phenotypes accompanied with increased  accumulation of de-phosphorylated BES1 proteins and transcriptional regulation of  BZR1 and BES1 target genes. BIK1 associates with BRI1, and is released from BRI1  receptor upon BR treatment, which is reminiscent of FLS2-BIK1 complex dynamics in  flagellin signaling. The ligand-induced release of BIK1 from receptor complexes  is associated with BIK1 phosphorylation. However, in contrast to BAK1-dependent  FLS2-BIK1 dissociation, BAK1 is dispensable for BRI1-BIK1 dissociation. Unlike  FLS2 signaling which depends on BAK1 to phosphorylate BIK1, BRI1 directly  phosphorylates BIK1 to transduce BR signaling. Thus, BIK1 relays the signaling in  plant immunity and BR-mediated growth via distinct phosphorylation by BAK1 and  BRI1, respectively. Our studies indicate that BIK1 mediates inverse functions in  plant immunity and development via dynamic association with specific receptor  complexes and differential phosphorylation events.', '2013 Jul 16', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1302154110', 'Shan']
