For woody plants, clonal propagation efficiency is largely determined by adventitious root (AR) formation at the bases of stem cuttings. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to AR morphogenesis in trees remains limited, despite the importance of vegetative propagation, currently the most common practice for tree breeding and commercialization. Here, we identified Populus-specific miR476a as a regulator of wound-induced adventitious rooting that acts by orchestrating mitochondrial homeostasis. MiR476a exhibited inducible expression during AR formation and directly targeted several Restorer of Fertility like (RFL) genes encoding mitochondrion-localized pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. Genetic modification of miR476a-RFL expression revealed that miR476a/RFL-mediated dynamic regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis influences AR formation in poplar. Mitochondrial perturbation via exogenous application of a chemical inhibitor indicated that miR476a/RFL-directed AR formation depends on mitochondrial regulation that acts via auxin signaling. Our results thus establish a microRNA-directed mitochondrion-auxin signaling cascade required for AR development, providing insights into the role of mitochondrial regulation in the developmental plasticity of plants.
