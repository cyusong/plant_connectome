Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stressors that negatively affect crop growth and yield. Salt stress can regulate antioxidants and the accumulation of osmoprotectants. In the study, a sucrose transporter MdSUT2.2 was identified in apple. Overexpression of MdSUT2.2 gene increased salt tolerance in the transgenic apple, compared with the WT control "Gala." In addition, it was found that protein MdSUT2.2 was phosphorylated at Ser<sup>254</sup> site in response to salt. A DUAL membrane yeast hybridization system through an apple cDNA library demonstrated that a protein kinase MdCIPK13 interacted with MdSUT2.2. A series of transgenic analysis in apple calli showed that MdCIPK13 was required for the salt-induced phosphorylation of MdSUT2.2 protein and enhanced its stability and transport activity. Finally, it was found that MdCIPK13 improved salt resistance in an MdSUT2.2-dependent manner. These findings had enriched our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying abiotic stress.
