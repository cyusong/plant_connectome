Transfers of organelle DNA to the nucleus established several thousand functional genes in eukaryotic chromosomes over evolutionary time. Recent transfers have also contributed nonfunctional plastid (pt)- and mitochondrion (mt)-derived DNA (termed nupts and numts, respectively) to plant nuclear genomes. The two largest transferred organelle genome copies are 131-kb nuptDNA in rice (Oryza sativa) and 262-kb numtDNA in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These transferred copies were compared in detail with their bona fide organelle counterparts, to which they are 99.77% and 99.91% identical, respectively. No evidence for purifying selection was found in either nuclear integrant, indicating that they are nonfunctional. Mutations attributable to 5-methylcytosine hypermutation have occurred at a 6- to 10-fold higher rate than other point mutations in Arabidopsis numtDNA and rice nuptDNA, respectively, revealing this as a major mechanism of mutational decay for these transferred organelle sequences. Short indels occurred preferentially within homopolymeric stretches but were less frequent than point mutations. The 131-kb nuptDNA is absent in the O. sativa subsp. indica or Oryza rufipogon nuclear genome, suggesting that it was transferred within the O. sativa subsp. japonica lineage and, as revealed by sequence comparisons, after its divergence from the indica chloroplast lineage. The time of the transfer for the rice nupt was estimated as 148,000 (74,000--296,000) years ago and that for the Arabidopsis numtDNA as 88,000 (44,000--176,000) years ago. The results reveal transfer and integration of entire organelle genomes into the nucleus as an ongoing evolutionary process and uncover mutational mechanisms affecting organelle genomes recently transferred into a new mutational environment.
