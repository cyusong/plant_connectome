The TEIL (Tobacco EIN3-Like) gene is a tobacco homologue of arabidopsis Ethylene Insensitive 3 (EIN3), and the gene product binds an 8 bp sequence in the tobacco PR1a promoter in a sequence specific manner. It was found here that accumulation of TEIL transcript was induced by wounding and preceded basic PR gene expression. To study the downstream signalling pathway of TEIL, TEIL was overexpressed under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter in tobacco plants. In 35S::TEIL lines, basic PR genes, which are wound-, jasmonate-, and ethylene-inducible, were expressed constitutively. Next, the conserved 781 bp sequence among tobacco EIN3-like (EIL) protein genes was introduced as an inverted-repeat (IR) into tobacco to suppress expression of these genes. In two independent IRTEIL lines, the TEIL transcript was not found and transcripts of other tobacco EILs, NtEIL3, and NtEIL5, were reduced. In IRTEIL plants, wound-, jasmonate-, and ACC-induced accumulation of basic PR gene transcripts was significantly inhibited. These results indicate that TEIL functions upstream of tobacco basic PR genes in wound signalling via not only ethylene but also jasmonate. In 35S::TEIL plants, the pistil length of the flower was longer with a slight protrusion of the stigma compared with the control. In IRTEIL plants, the length of the stamens was shorter than the control with significant protrusion of the stigma in the flower. These observations indicate the involvement of tobacco EILs in flower development.
