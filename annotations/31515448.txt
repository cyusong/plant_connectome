Aging-related processes in plant tissues are associated with changes in developmental and physiological processes relevant for stress tolerance and plant performance. While senescence-regulated processes have been extensively characterized in leaves, they remain poorly described in roots. Here, we investigated the physiological processes and molecular determinants underlying the senescence of seminal roots in hydroponically grown barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Transcriptome profiling in apical and basal root tissues revealed that several NAC-, WRKY-, and APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factors were upregulated just before the arrest of root elongation, when root cortical cell lysis and nitrate uptake, as well as cytokinin concentrations ceased. At this time point, root abscisic acid levels peaked, suggesting that abscisic acid is involved in root aging-related processes characterized by expression changes of genes involved in oxidative stress responses. This temporal sequence of aging-related processes in roots is highly reminiscent of typical organ senescence, with the exception of evidence for the retranslocation of nutrients from roots. Supported by the identification of senescence-related transcription factors, some of which are not expressed in leaves, our study indicates that roots undergo an intrinsic genetically determined senescence program, predominantly influenced by plant age.
