The maize ZmEA1 protein was recently postulated to be involved in short-range pollen tube guidance from the embryo sac. To date, EA1-like sequences had only been identified in monocot species. Using a more conserved C-terminal motif found in the monocot species, numerous ZmEA1-like sequences were retrieved in EST databases from dicot species, as well as from unannotated genomic sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana. RT-PCR analyses were produced for these unannotated genes and showed that these were indeed expressed genes. Further structural and phylogenetic analyses revealed that all members of the EA1-like (EAL) gene family shared a conserved 27-29 amino acid motif, termed the EA box near the C-terminal end, and appear to be secretory proteins. Therefore, the EA box proteins defines a new class of small secretory proteins, some of which being possibly involved in pollen tube guidance.
