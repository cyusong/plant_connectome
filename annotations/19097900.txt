['19097900', 'Most plant organs develop postembryonically from stem cells in the shoot and root  meristems. In Arabidopsis, Class I KNOTTED-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription  factors are specifically expressed in shoot meristems and play a primary role in  the maintenance of meristem function. Although suppression of KNOX was shown to  associate with histone H3K27-methylation, the molecular mechanism underlying this  suppression is not well understood. Here, we provide genetic, molecular, and  functional evidence that an Arabidopsis POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX1 (PRC1)-like  complex acts in conjunction with PRC2 in KNOX suppression. We identified AtRING1a  and AtRING1b as homologs of the animal PRC1 core component RING1.  Loss-of-function mutant Atring1a(-/-)Atring1b(-/-) shows release of KNOX  suppression and ectopic-meristem formation. AtRING1a and AtRING1b proteins are  localized in the nucleus. AtRING1a binds to itself and to AtRING1b, to CURLY LEAF  (CLF), a PRC2 core component catalyzing H3K27-methylation, and to LIKE  HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1), a chromodomain protein binding trimethyl-H3K27.  We further show that clf(-/-) and lhp1(-/-) enhance Atring1a(-/-)Atring1b(-/-) in  release of KNOX suppression and mutant phenotypes. We propose a model in which  AtRING1a, AtRING1b, and LHP1 form a PRC1-like complex, which binds  trimethyl-H3K27 marked by the CLF-containing PRC2, resulting in transcriptional  suppression of KNOX.', '2008 Dec 23', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2008.11.019', 'Shen']
