['16923726', 'Peroxisomes are organelles found in all eukaryotic cells. Peroxisomes import  integral membrane proteins post-translationally, and PEX19 is a predominantly  cytosolic, farnesylated protein of mammalian and yeast cells that binds multiple  peroxisome membrane proteins and is required for their correct  targeting/insertion to the peroxisome membrane. We report the characterisation of  the Arabidopsisthaliana homologue of PEX19 which is a predominantly cytosolic  protein. AtPEX19 is encoded by two genes (designated AtPEX19-1 and AtPEX19-2)  that are expressed in all tissues and at all developmental stages of the plant.  Quantitative real time PCR shows that AtPEX19-1 and AtPEX19-2 have distinct  expression profiles. Using in vitro translation and co-immunoprecipitation  AtPEX19-1 was shown to bind to the Arabidopsis peroxisomal membrane protein  PEX10. Additionally, bacterially expressed recombinant AtPEX19-1 was able to bind  a fusion protein consisting of the C-terminus of PEX10 and glutathione  S-transferase in pull-down assays, thereby demonstrating that non-farnesylated  AtPEX19 can interact with the C-terminus of AtPEX10. Purified recombinant  AtPEX19-1 was analysed by gel filtration chromatography and was found to have a  molecular weight consistent with it forming a dimer and a dimer was detected in  Arabidopsis cell extracts that was slightly destabilised in the presence of DTT.  Moreover, cross-linking studies of native AtPEX19 suggest that in vivo it is the  dimeric species of the protein that preferentially forms complexes with other  proteins.', '2006 Jul-Aug', 'Mol Membr Biol', '10.1080/09687860600738221', 'Baker']
