Cytokinins promote plant growth and development under normal plant growth conditions and also play an important role in plant resistance to stress. Understanding the working mechanisms of cytokinins under adverse conditions will help to make full use of cytokinins in agriculture to increase production and efficiency of land use. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in cytokinin research in plant response to stress and propose its future application prospects.
