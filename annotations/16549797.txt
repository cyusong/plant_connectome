['16549797', 'Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering by prolonged cold that aligns the  onset of reproductive development with spring conditions. A key step of  vernalization in Arabidopsis is the epigenetic silencing of FLOWERING LOCUS C  (FLC), which encodes a repressor of flowering. The vernalization-induced  epigenetic silencing of FLC is associated with histone deacetylation and H3K27me2  and H3K9me2 methylation mediated by VRN/VIN proteins. We have analyzed whether  different histone methyltransferases and the chromodomain protein LIKE  HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN (LHP)1 might play a role in vernalization. No single  loss-of-function mutation in the histone methyltransferases studied disrupted the  vernalization response; however, lhp1 mutants revealed a role for LHP1 in  maintaining epigenetic silencing of FLC. Like LHP1, VRN1 functions in both  flowering-time control and vernalization. We explored the localization of VRN1  and found it to be associated generally with Arabidopsis chromosomes but not the  heterochromatic chromocenters. This association did not depend on vernalization  or VRN2 function and was maintained during mitosis but was lost in meiotic  chromosomes, suggesting that VRN1 may contribute to chromatin silencing that is  not meiotically stable.', '2006 Mar 28', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0507427103', 'Dean']
