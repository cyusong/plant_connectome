In the plant male germline, transposable elements (TEs) are reactivated in the companion vegetative nucleus, resulting in siRNA production and the intercellular movement of these siRNAs to reinforce TE silencing in sperm. However, the mechanism by which siRNA movement is regulated remains unexplored. Here we show that ARID1, a transcription factor which is constitutively expressed in the vegetative nucleus but dynamically accumulates in the generative cell (the progenitor of sperm) to promote the second pollen mitosis, mediates siRNA movement to reinforce heterochromatic silencing in the male germline. We looked for regulators involved in the accumulation of ARID1 in the generative cell, and found that AGO9, a germline-specific AGO in Arabidopsis, is required for the accumulation of ARID1 in the generative cell. Mutations in either ARID1 or AGO9 lead to the interruption of not only the second pollen mitosis but also the movement of siRNA from the vegetative nucleus to the male germline, resulting in the release of heterochromatic silencing in the male germline. Moreover, conditional knockdown of ARID1 in the generative cell causes reduced heterochromatic silencing in both bicellular and mature pollen. This study provides insights into how a spatiotemporal transcription factor coordinates heterochromatic silencing and male germline maturation.
