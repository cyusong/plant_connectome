['22028775', 'A comprehensive understanding of the lipid and fatty acid metabolic machinery is  needed for optimizing production of oils and fatty acids for fuel, industrial  feedstocks and nutritional improvement in plants. T-DNA mutants in the poorly  annotated Arabidopsis thaliana gene At1g08640 were identified as containing  moderately high levels (50-100%) of 16ratio1Delta7 and 18ratio1Delta9 leaf fatty acids and subtle  decreases (5-30%) of 16ratio3 and 18ratio3 (http://www.plastid.msu.edu/). TLC separation  of fatty acids in the leaf polar lipids revealed that the chloroplastic  galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol  (DGDG) were the main lipid types affected by this mutation. Analysis of the  inferred amino acid sequence of At1g08640 predicted the presence of a transit  peptide, three transmembrane domains and an N-terminal J-like domain, and the  gene was named CJD1 for Chloroplast J-like Domain 1. GFP reporter experiments and  in vitro chloroplast import assays demonstrated CJD1 is a chloroplast membrane  protein. Screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA library by yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) using  the J-like domain of CJD1 as bait identified a plastidial inner envelope protein  (Accumulation and Replication of Chloroplasts 6, ARC6) as the primary interacting  partner in the Y2H assay. ARC6 plays a central role in chloroplast division and  binds CJD1 via its own J-like domain along with an adjacent conserved region  whose function is not fully known. These results provide a starting point for  future investigations of how mutations in CJD1 affect lipid composition.', '2011', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0025368', 'Last']
