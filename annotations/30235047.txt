VIP1 (VIRE2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1) and its close homologues are Arabidopsis thaliana bZIP proteins regulating stress responses and root tropisms. They are present in the cytoplasm under steady conditions, but transiently accumulate in the nucleus when cells are exposed to mechanical stress such as hypo-osmotic stress and touch. This pattern of changes in subcellular localization is unique to VIP1 and its close homologues, and can be useful to further characterize mechanical stress signaling in plants. A recent study showed that calcium signaling regulates this pattern of subcellular localization. Here, we show that a possible calcium channel inhibitor, streptomycin, also inhibits the nuclear accumulation of VIP1. Candidates for the specific regulators of the mechanosensitive calcium signaling are further discussed.
