['24723605', 'Plant embryogenesis initiates with the establishment of an apical-basal axis;  however, the molecular mechanisms accompanying this early event remain unclear.  Here, we show that a small cysteine-rich peptide family is required for formation  of the zygotic basal cell lineage and proembryo patterning in Arabidopsis. EMBRYO  SURROUNDING FACTOR 1 (ESF1) peptides accumulate before fertilization in central  cell gametes and thereafter in embryo-surrounding endosperm cells. Biochemical  and structural analyses revealed cleavage of ESF1 propeptides to form  biologically active mature peptides. Further, these peptides act in a  non-cell-autonomous manner and synergistically with the receptor-like kinase  SHORT SUSPENSOR to promote suspensor elongation through the YODA  mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Our findings demonstrate that the  second female gamete and its sexually derived endosperm regulate early embryonic  patterning in flowering plants.', '2014 Apr 11', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1243005', 'Gutierrez-Marcos']
