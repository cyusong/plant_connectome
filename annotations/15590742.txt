['15590742', 'The specification of the hair and non-hair cells in the Arabidopsis root  epidermis provides a useful model for the study of cell fate determination in  plants. A network of putative transcriptional regulators, including the related  bHLH proteins GLABRA3 (GL3) and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3), is known to influence  the patterning of these cell types. Here, we analyze the expression and  regulation of GL3 and EGL3 during root epidermis development. Although they are  thought to act in both the hair and non-hair cell types, we surprisingly found  that GL3 and EGL3 gene expression and RNA accumulation occurs preferentially in  the developing hair cells. By analyzing the expression of GL3::GUS and EGL3::GUS  reporter fusions in various mutant and overexpression lines, we discovered that  the expression of both genes is negatively regulated by WER, GL3 and EGL3 in the  developing non-hair cells, and positively regulated by the CPC and TRY proteins  in the developing hair cells. Further, the analysis of a GL3-YFP translational  fusion, expressed under the GL3 promoter, indicates that the GL3 protein moves  from the hair cells to the non-hair cells. These results suggest that GL3/EGL3  accumulation in the N cells is dependent on specification of the hair cell fate,  which itself is known to be influenced (via CPC-mediated lateral inhibition) by  the non-hair cells. This bi-directional signaling mechanism defines a new  regulatory circuit of intercellular communication to specify the epidermal cell  types.', '2005 Jan', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.01565', 'Schiefelbein']
