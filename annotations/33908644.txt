GTR1 and GTR2 transporters are components of the source to sink translocation network of glucosinolates, which are major defence metabolites in the Brassicaceae. These transporters can be genetically manipulated for reduction of seed-glucosinolates without inhibiting glucosinolate biosynthesis, thereby maintaining the inherent defence potential of plants. However, the different roles of GTRs in influencing tissue-specific distribution of glucosinolates in agriculturally important Brassica crops are yet unknown. Here, we report functional characterization of two groups of glucosinolate transporters (GTR1 and GTR2) from Brassica juncea based on gene expression data, biochemical analysis, gene-complementation studies in GTR-deficient mutants and RNAi-based knockdown followed by insect feeding experiments. Although both GTRs showed ubiquitous expression patterns and broad substrate specificity, the single-gene knockdown lines displayed different phenotypes. The GTR2-knockdown plants showed a significant reduction of glucosinolates in seeds and a higher accumulation in leaves and pods, while the GTR1-knockdown plants displayed a smaller reduction of glucosinolates in seeds and significantly lower glucosinolate levels in leaves. Consequently, knockdown of GTR2 resulted in higher resistance towards the generalist pest, Spodoptera litura. Overall, our study highlights the distinctive roles of B. juncea GTRs in tissue-specific accumulation of glucosinolates and the potential for manipulating GTR2 for enhanced nutrition and plant defence.
