['18643977', 'Phytosulfokines (PSKs) are secreted, sulfated peptide hormones derived from  larger prepropeptide precursors. Proteolytic processing of one of the precursors,  AtPSK4, was demonstrated by cleavage of a preproAtPSK4-myc transgene product to  AtPSK4-myc. Cleavage of proAtPSK4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue  culture. The processing of proAtPSK4 was dependent on AtSBT1.1, a subtilisin-like  serine protease, encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis. The gene  encoding AtSBT1.1 was up-regulated following the transfer of root explants to  tissue culture, suggesting that activation of the proteolytic machinery that  cleaves proAtPSK4 is dependent on AtSBT1.1 expression. We also demonstrated that  a fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in  proAtPSK4 is cleaved in vitro by affinity-purified AtSBT1.1. An alanine scan  through the recognition site peptide indicated that AtSBT1.1 is fairly specific  for the AtPSK4 precursor. Thus, this peptide growth factor, which promotes callus  formation in culture, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by a specific  plant subtilase encoded by a gene that is up-regulated during the process of  transferring root explants to tissue culture.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03598.x', 'Howell']
