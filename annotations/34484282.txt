Stalk rot caused by <i>Colletotrichum graminicola</i> is a disease of worldwide importance. Stalk rot is difficult to detect at the early stages of infection because the fungus colonizes the tissues inside the maize stem. Current diagnostic methods are time-consuming, laborious, and destructive to the stem tissue. We utilized Raman spectroscopy to follow the development of stalk rot in three different maize genotypes grown either in the field or the greenhouse. We then used the acquired spectra to calibrate statistical models to differentiate amongst the different disease timepoints and the genotypes themselves. This non-invasive spectroscopic method enabled high-accuracy identification of stalk rot based on both stalk and leaf spectra. We additionally found that leaf spectra were favorable for identifying maize by genotype. Finally, we identified Raman bands that showed correlation with the sizes of stalk rot-associated lesions in the stems. We demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy is a viable tool for detection of stalk rot disease, as well as potent for the differentiation of maize genotypes.
