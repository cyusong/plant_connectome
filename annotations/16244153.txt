['16244153', 'Stomatal movement is important for plants to exchange gas with environment. The  regulation of stomatal movement allows optimizing photosynthesis and  transpiration. Changes in vacuolar volume in guard cells are known to participate  in this regulation. However, little has been known about the mechanism underlying  the regulation of rapid changes in guard cell vacuolar volume. Here, we report  that dynamic changes in the complex vacuolar membrane system play a role in the  rapid changes of vacuolar volume in Vicia faba guard cells. The guard cells  contained a great number of small vacuoles and various vacuolar membrane  structures when stomata closed. The small vacuoles and complex membrane systems  fused with each other or with the bigger vacuoles to generate large vacuoles  during stomatal opening. Conversely, the large vacuoles split into smaller  vacuoles and generated many complex membrane structures in the closing stomata.  Vacuole fusion inhibitor,  (2s,3s)-trans-epoxy-succinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester, inhibited  stomatal opening significantly. Furthermore, an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) mutation of the SGR3 gene, which has a defect in vacuolar fusion, also  led to retardation of stomatal opening. All these results suggest that the  dynamic changes of the tonoplast are essential for enhancing stomatal movement.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.067520', 'Wang']
