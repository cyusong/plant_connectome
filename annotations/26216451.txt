['26216451', "The biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA and its incorporation into functional ribosomes  is an essential and intricate process that includes production of mature  ribosomal RNA from large precursors. Here, we analyse the contribution of the  plant exosome and its co-factors to processing and degradation of 18S pre-RNAs in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data show that, unlike in yeast and humans, an RRP6  homologue, the nucleolar exoribonuclease RRP6L2, and the exosome complex,  together with RRP44, function in two distinct steps of pre-18S rRNA processing or  degradation in Arabidopsis. In addition, we identify TRL (TRF4/5-like) as the  terminal nucleotidyltransferase that is mainly responsible for oligoadenylation  of rRNA precursors in Arabidopsis. We show that TRL is required for efficient  elimination of the excised 5' external transcribed spacer and of 18S maturation  intermediates that escaped 5' processing. Our data also suggest involvement of  additional nucleotidyltransferases, including terminal uridylyltransferase(s), in  modifying rRNA processing intermediates in plants.", '2015 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12943', 'Lange']
