Development of the flattened laminar structure in plant leaves requires highly regulated cell division and expansion patterns. Although tight regulation of these processes is essential during leaf development, leaf shape is highly diverse across the plant kingdom, implying that patterning of growth must be amenable to evolutionary change. Here, we describe the molecular identification of the classical tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mutant lyrate, which is impaired in outgrowth of leaflet primodia and laminar tissues during compound leaf development. We found that the lyrate phenotype results from a loss-of-function mutation of the tomato JAGGED homolog, a well-described positive regulator of cell division in lateral organs. We demonstrate that LYRATE coordinates lateral outgrowth in the compound leaves of tomato by interacting with both the KNOX and auxin transcriptional networks and suggest that evolutionary changes in LYRATE expression may contribute to the fundamental difference between compound and simple leaves.
