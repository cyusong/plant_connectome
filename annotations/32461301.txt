N<sup>1</sup>-methyladenosine is a unique type of base methylation in that it blocks Watson-Crick base pairing and introduces a positive charge. m<sup>1</sup>A is prevalent in yeast and mammalian mRNA and plays a functional role. However, little is known about the abundance, dynamics, and topology of this modification in plant mRNA. Dot blotting and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses revealed a dynamic pattern of m<sup>1</sup>A mRNA modification in various tissues and at different developmental stages in petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>), a model system for plant growth and development. We performed transcriptome-wide profiling of m<sup>1</sup>A in petunia mRNA by m<sup>1</sup>A mRNA immunoprecipitation followed by a deep-sequencing approach (m<sup>1</sup>A-seq, using an m<sup>1</sup>A-specific antibody). m<sup>1</sup>A-seq analysis identified 4,993 m<sup>1</sup>A peaks in 3,231 genes expressed in petunia corollas; there were 251 m<sup>1</sup>A peaks in which A residues were partly replaced by thymine and/or reverse transcription stopped at an adenine site. m<sup>1</sup>A was enriched in coding sequences, with single peaks located immediately after start codons. Ethylene treatment upregulated 400 m<sup>1</sup>A peaks in 375 mRNAs and downregulated 603 m<sup>1</sup>A peaks in 530 mRNAs in petunia corollas; 975 m<sup>1</sup>A peaks in mRNA were only detected in corollas treated with air and 430 were only detected in corollas treated with ethylene. Silencing of petunia <i>tRNA-specific methyltransferase 61A</i> (<i>PhTRMT61A</i>) reduced the m<sup>1</sup>A level in mRNA in vivo and in vitro. In addition, <i>PhTRMT61A</i> silencing caused abnormal leaf development, and the PhTRMT61A protein was localized to the nucleus. Thus, m<sup>1</sup>A in mRNA is an important epitranscriptome marker and plays a role in plant growth and development.
