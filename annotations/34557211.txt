Gibberella stalk rot caused by <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> is one of the devastating diseases of maize that causes significant yield losses worldwide. The molecular mechanisms regulating defense against this pathogen remain poorly understood. According to recent studies, a major oxylipin hormone produced by 13-lipoxygenases (LOX) namely jasmonic acid (JA) has been associated with maize susceptibility to GSR. However, the specific roles of numerous 9-LOX-derived oxylipins in defense against Gibberella stalk rot (GSR) remain unexplained. In this study, we have shown that disruption of a 9-LOX gene, <i>ZmLOX5</i>, resulted in increased susceptibility to GSR, indicating its role in defense. To understand how <i>ZmLOX5</i> regulates GSR resistance, we conducted transcriptome and oxylipin profiling using a <i>zmlox5-3</i> mutant and near-isogenic wild type B73, upon infection with <i>F. graminearum</i>. The results showed that JA biosynthetic pathway genes were highly up-regulated, whereas multiple 9-LOX pathway genes were down-regulated in the infected <i>zmlox5-3</i> mutant. Furthermore, oxylipin profiling of the mutant revealed significantly higher contents of several jasmonates but relatively lower levels of 9-oxylipins in <i>zmlox5-3</i> upon infection. In contrast, B73 and W438, a more resistant inbred line, displayed relatively lower levels of JAs, but a considerable increase of 9-oxylipins. These results suggest antagonistic interaction between 9-oxylipins and JAs, wherein 9-oxylipins contribute to resistance while JAs facilitate susceptibility to <i>F. graminearum</i>.
