['36307987', 'Cytokinins (CKs), primarily trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine (iP) types,  play critical roles in plant growth, development, and various stress responses.  Long-distance transport of tZ-type CKs meidated by Arabidopsis ATP-binding  cassette transporter subfamily G14 (AtABCG14) has been well studied; however,  less is known about the biochemical properties of AtABCG14 and its transporter  activity toward iP-type CKs. Here we reveal the biochemical properties of  AtABCG14 and provide evidence that it is also required for long-distance  transport of iP-type CKs. AtABCG14 formed homodimers in human (Homo sapiens)  HEK293T, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and Arabidopsis cells. Transporter activity  assays of AtABCG14 in Arabidopsis, tobacco, and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)  showed that AtABCG14 may directly transport multiple CKs, including iP- and  tZ-type species. AtABCG14 expression was induced by iP in a tZ-type CK-deficient  double mutant (cypDM) of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2. The atabcg14 cypDM triple mutant  exhibited stronger CK-deficiency phenotypes than cypDM. Hormone profiling,  reciprocal grafting, and (2)H(6)-iP isotope tracer experiments showed that  root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root long-distance transport of iP-type CKs were  suppressed in atabcg14 cypDM and atabcg14. These results suggest that AtABCG14  participates in three steps of the circular long-distance transport of iP-type  CKs: xylem loading in the root for shootward transport, phloem unloading in the  shoot for shoot distribution, and phloem unloading in the root for root  distribution. We found that AtABCG14 displays transporter activity toward  multiple CK species and revealed its versatile roles in circular long-distance  transport of iP-type CKs. These findings provide new insights into the transport  mechanisms of CKs and other plant hormones.', '2023 Mar 13', 'Plant Commun', '10.1016/j.xplc.2022.100468', 'Zhang']
