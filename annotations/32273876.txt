Polyploidy is widely recognized as a major evolutionary force in plants and has been reported in the genus <i>Lippia</i> (Verbenaceae). <i>Lippia alba</i>, the most studied species, has been documented as a polyploid complex involving at least four ploidal levels. <i>L. alba</i> presents remarkable chemical and genetic variation and represents a model for understanding genome organization. Although the economic and medicinal importance of the species has been widely described, no established polyploid induction protocol has been reported so far. Here, we describe the production of synthetic polyploid plants of <i>L. alba</i> using colchicine. The ploidal levels were estimated by flow cytometry and chromosome counting. In addition, FISH and molecular markers approaches were used to confirm the stability of the synthetic polyploids. The major component of the essential oils was estimated by GCMS to compare with the natural individuals. Tetraploids and triploids were produced providing new opportunities for investigating medicinal, pharmacological, and economic applications as well as addressing intrinsic questions involved in the polyploidization process in tropical plants.
