['22708996', 'Throughout their lifetimes, plants must coordinate the regulation of various  facets of growth and development. Previous evidence has suggested that the  Arabidopsis thaliana R2R3-MYB, AtMYB61, might function as a coordinate regulator  of multiple aspects of plant resource allocation. Using a combination of cell  biology, transcriptome analysis and biochemistry, in conjunction with  gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetics, the role of AtMYB61 in  conditioning resource allocation throughout the plant life cycle was explored. In  keeping with its role as a regulator of resource allocation, AtMYB61 is expressed  in sink tissues, notably xylem, roots and developing seeds. Loss of AtMYB61  function decreases xylem formation, induces qualitative changes in xylem cell  structure and decreases lateral root formation; in contrast, gain of AtMYB61  function has the opposite effect on these traits. AtMYB61 coordinates a small  network of downstream target genes, which contain a motif in their upstream  regulatory regions that is bound by AtMYB61, and AtMYB61 activates transcription  from this same motif. Loss-of-function analysis supports the hypothesis that  AtMYB61 targets play roles in shaping subsets of AtMYB61-related phenotypes.  Taken together, these findings suggest that AtMYB61 links the transcriptional  control of multiple aspects of plant resource allocation.', '2012 Sep', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04201.x', 'Campbell']
