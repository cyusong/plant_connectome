In eukaryotes, the regulated transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytosol through nuclear pore complexes represents an important step in the expression of protein-coding genes. In plants, the mechanism of nucleocytosolic mRNA transport and the factors involved are poorly understood. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome encodes two likely orthologs of UAP56-interacting factor, which acts as mRNA export factor in mammalian cells. In yeast and plant cells, both proteins interact directly with the mRNA export-related RNA helicase UAP56 and the interaction was mediated by an N-terminal UAP56-binding motif. Accordingly, the two proteins were termed UAP56-INTERACTING EXPORT FACTOR1 and 2 (UIEF1/2). Despite lacking a known RNA-binding motif, recombinant UIEF1 interacted with RNA, and the C-terminal part of UIEF1 mainly contributed to the RNA interaction. Mutation of <i>UIEF1</i>, <i>UIEF2</i>, or both in the double-mutant <i>2xuief</i> caused modest growth defects. A cross between the <i>2xuief</i> and <i>4xaly</i> (defective in the four ALY1-4 mRNA export factors) mutants produced the sextuple mutant <i>4xaly 2xuief</i>, which displayed more severe growth impairment than the <i>4xaly</i> plants. Developmental defects including delayed bolting and reduced seed set were observed in the <i>4xaly</i> but not the <i>2xuief</i> plants. Analysis of the cellular distribution of polyadenylated mRNAs revealed more pronounced nuclear mRNA accumulation in <i>4xaly 2xuief</i> than in <i>2xuief</i> and <i>4xaly</i> cells. In conclusion, the results indicate that UIEF1 and UIEF2 act as mRNA export factors in plants and that they cooperate with ALY1-ALY4 to mediate efficient nucleocytosolic mRNA transport.
