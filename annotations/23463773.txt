['23463773', 'Ammonium acquisition by plant roots is mediated by AMMONIUM TRANSPORTERs (AMTs),  ubiquitous membrane proteins with essential roles in nitrogen nutrition in all  organisms. In microbial and plant cells, ammonium transport activity is  controlled by ammonium-triggered feedback inhibition to prevent cellular ammonium  toxicity. Data from heterologous expression in yeast indicate that  oligomerization of plant AMTs is critical for allosteric regulation of transport  activity, in which the conserved cytosolic C terminus functions as a  trans-activator. Employing the coexpressed transporters AMT1;1 and AMT1;3 from  Arabidopsis thaliana as a model, we show here that these two isoforms form  functional homo- and heterotrimers in yeast and plant roots and that AMT1;3  carrying a phosphomimic residue in its C terminus regulates both homo- and  heterotrimers in a dominant-negative fashion in vivo. (15)NH4(+) influx studies  further indicate that allosteric inhibition represses ammonium transport activity  in roots of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing a phosphomimic mutant together with  functional AMT1;3 or AMT1;1. Our study demonstrates in planta a regulatory role  in transport activity of heterooligomerization of transporter isoforms, which may  enhance their versatility for signal exchange in response to environmental  triggers.', '2013 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.108027', 'von']
