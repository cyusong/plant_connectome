Recently, a novel family of calmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTAs) was reported in various eukaryotes. All CAMTAs share a similar domain organization, with a novel type of sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (designated CG-1). This domain could bind DNA directly and activate transcription, or interact with other transcription factors, not through DNA binding, thus acting as a co-activator of transcription. Investigations of CAMTAs in various organisms imply a broad range of functions from sensory mechanisms to embryo development and growth control, highlighted by the apparent involvement of mammalian CAMTA2 in cardiac growth, and of CAMTA1 in tumor suppression and memory performance.
