Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is one of the most important forage crops in the world; however, its molecular genetics and breeding research are hindered due to the lack of a high-quality reference genome. Here, we report a de novo assembled 816-Mb high-quality, chromosome-level haploid genome sequence for 'Zhongmu No.1' alfalfa, a heterozygous autotetraploid. The contig N50 is 3.92 Mb, and 49 165 genes are annotated in the genome. The alfalfa genome is estimated to have diverged from M. truncatula approximately 8 million years ago. Genomic population analysis of 162 alfalfa accessions revealed high genetic diversity, weak population structure, and extensive gene flow from wild to cultivated alfalfa. Genome-wide association studies identified many candidate genes associated with important agronomic traits. Furthermore, we showed that MsFTa2, a Flowering Locus T homolog, whose expression is upregulated in salt-resistant germplasms, may be associated with fall dormancy and salt resistance. Taken together, these genomic resources will facilitate alfalfa genetic research and agronomic improvement.
