Saponaria vaccaria (Caryophyllaceae), a soapwort, known in western Canada as cowcockle, contains bioactive oleanane-type saponins similar to those found in soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria; Rosaceae). To improve our understanding of the biosynthesis of these saponins, a combined polymerase chain reaction and expressed sequence tag approach was taken to identify the genes involved. A cDNA encoding a beta-amyrin synthase (SvBS) was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and characterized by expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The SvBS gene is predominantly expressed in leaves. A S. vaccaria developing seed expressed sequence tag collection was developed and used for the isolation of a full-length cDNA bearing sequence similarity to ester-forming glycosyltransferases. The gene product of the cDNA, classified as UGT74M1, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and identified as a triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase. UGT74M1 is expressed in roots and leaves and appears to be involved in monodesmoside biosynthesis in S. vaccaria.
