['32345768', 'In animals, extracellular ATP is a well-studied signaling molecule that is  recognized by plasma membrane-localized P2-type purinergic receptors. However, in  contrast, much less is known about purinergic signaling in plants. P2 receptors  play critical roles in a variety of animal biological processes, including immune  system regulation. The first plant purinergic receptor, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) P2K1 (L-type lectin receptor kinase-I.9), was shown to contribute to  plant defense against bacterial, oomycete, and fungal pathogens. Here, we  demonstrate the isolation of a second purinergic receptor, P2K2, by  complementation of an Arabidopsis p2k1 mutant. P2K2 (LecRK-I.5) has 74% amino  acid similarity to P2K1. The P2K2 extracellular lectin domain binds to ATP with  higher affinity than P2K1 (dissociation constant [K (d)] = 44.47 +/- 15.73 nm).  Interestingly, p2k2 and p2k1 p2k2 mutant plants showed increased susceptibility  to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, with the double mutant showing a stronger  phenotype. In vitro and in planta studies demonstrate that P2K2 and P2K1 interact  and cross-phosphorylate upon extracellular ATP treatment. Thus, similar to  animals, plants possess multiple purinergic receptors.', '2020 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.01265', 'ORCID:']
