Here we provided a high temporal-resolution transcriptome atlas of maize embryo sac and ovule to reveal the gene activity dynamic during early seed development. The early maize (Zea mays) seed development is initiated from double fertilization in the embryo sac and needs to undergo a highly dynamic and complex development process to form the differentiated embryo and endosperm. Despite the importance of maize seed for food, feed, and biofuel, many regulators responsible for controlling its early development are not known yet. Here, we reported a high temporal-resolution transcriptome atlas of embryo sac and ovule based on 44 time point samples collected within the first four days of seed development. A total of 25,187 genes including 1598 transcription factors (TFs) involved in early seed development were detected. Global comparisons of the expressions of these genes revealed five distinct development stages of early seed, which are mainly related to double fertilization, asymmetric cell division of the zygote, as well as coenocyte formation, cellularization and differentiation in endosperm. We identified 3327 seed-specific genes, which more than one thousand seed-specific genes with main expressions during early seed development were newly identified here, including 859 and 186 genes predominantly expressed in the embryo sac and ovule, respectively. Combined with the published transcriptome data of seed, we uncovered the dominant auxin biosynthesis, transport and signaling related genes at different development stages and subregions of seed. These results are helpful for understanding the genetic control of early seed development.
