Gravitropism is an adaptive response that orients plant growth parallel to the gravity vector. Asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone auxin is a necessary prerequisite to the tropic bending both in roots and shoots. During hypocotyl gravitropic response, the PIN3 auxin transporter polarizes within gravity-sensing cells to redirect intercellular auxin fluxes. First gravity-induced PIN3 polarization to the bottom cell membranes leads to the auxin accumulation at the lower side of the organ, initiating bending and, later, auxin feedback-mediated repolarization restores symmetric auxin distribution to terminate bending. Here, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify regulators of both PIN3 polarization events during gravitropic response. We searched for mutants with defective PIN3 polarizations based on easy-to-score morphological outputs of decreased or increased gravity-induced hypocotyl bending. We identified the number of hypocotyl reduced bending (hrb) and hypocotyl hyperbending (hhb) mutants, revealing that reduced bending correlated typically with defective gravity-induced PIN3 relocation whereas all analyzed hhb mutants showed defects in the second, auxin-mediated PIN3 relocation. Next-generation sequencing-aided mutation mapping identified several candidate genes, including SCARECROW and ACTIN2, revealing roles of endodermis specification and actin cytoskeleton in the respective gravity- and auxin-induced PIN polarization events. The hypocotyl gravitropism screen thus promises to provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying cell polarity and plant adaptive development.
