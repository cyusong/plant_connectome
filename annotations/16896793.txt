Previous research has demonstrated that the thermo-sensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) gene in rice was regulated by temperature. TGMS rice is important to hybrid rice production because the application of the TGMS system in two-line breeding is cost-effective, simple, efficient and overcomes the limitations of the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system. AnnongS is the first discovered and deeply studied TGMS rice line in China. Previous studies have suggested that AnnongS-1 and Y58S, two derivative TGMS lines of AnnongS, were both controlled by a single recessive gene named tms5, which was genetically mapped on chromosome 2. In the current study, three populations (AnnongS-1 x Nanjing11, Y58S x Q611, and Y58S x Guanghui122) were developed to investigate the tms5 gene molecular map. Analysis of recombination events of sterile samples, utilizing 125 probes covering the tms5 region, suggested that the tms5 gene was physically mapped to a 19 kb DNA fragment between two markers, 4039-1 and 4039-2, located on the BAC clone AP004039. Following the construction of a physical map between the two markers, ONAC023, a member of the NAC (NAM-ATAF-CUC-related) gene family, was identified as the candidate of the tms5 gene.
