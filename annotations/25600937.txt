['25600937', 'AtMSI4/FVE/ACG1, one of five Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding MSI1-like  proteins, helps determine plant growth and development (including control of  flowering), as well as responses to certain biotic and abiotic stresses. We  reasoned that the product of this gene, AtMSI4, acts through protein partners,  which we have co-immunopurified with AtMSI4 from A. thaliana suspension culture  cells and identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Many of  the proteins associated with AtMSI4 have distinct RNA recognition motif (RRM)  domains, which we determined to be responsible for association with AtMSI4; and  most of the associated RRM domain proteins also contain PWWP domains that are  specific to plants. We propose these novel ATMSI4-associated proteins help form  nucleoprotein complexes that determine pleiotropic functional properties of  AtMSI4/FVE/ACG1 involving plant development and responses to stress.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-014-0280-z', 'Folk']
