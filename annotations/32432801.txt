Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the resistance of plants to infection by pathogens via interactions with microRNAs (miRNAs). Long non-coding RNAs are cleaved by miRNAs to produce phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), which, as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), function as decoys for mature miRNAs, thus inhibiting their expression, and contain pre-miRNA sequences to produce mature miRNAs. However, whether lncRNAs and miRNAs mediate other molecular mechanisms during plant resistance to pathogens is unknown. In this study, as a positive regulator, Sl-lncRNA15492 from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Zaofen No. 2) plants affected tomato resistance to Phytophthora infestans. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments and RNA ligase-mediated 5'-amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-5' RACE) also revealed that Sl-miR482a was negatively involved in tomato resistance by targeting Sl-NBS-LRR genes and that silencing of Sl-NBS-LRR1 decreased tomato resistance. Sl-lncRNA15492 inhibited the expression of mature Sl-miR482a, whose precursor was located within the antisense sequence of Sl-lncRNA15492. Further degradome analysis and additional RLM-5' RACE experiments verified that mature Sl-miR482a could also cleave Sl-lncRNA15492. These results provide a mechanism by which lncRNAs might inhibit precursor miRNA expression through antisense strands of lncRNAs, and demonstrate that Sl-lncRNA15492 and Sl-miR482a mutually inhibit the maintenance of Sl-NBS-LRR1 homeostasis during tomato resistance to P. infestans.
