The quality control system for messenger RNA (mRNA) is fundamental for cellular activities in eukaryotes. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase1 (PDK1), a master regulator that is essential throughout eukaryotic growth and development, we employed a forward genetic approach to screen for suppressors of the loss-of-function T-DNA insertion double mutant pdk1.1 pdk1.2 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Notably, the severe growth attenuation of pdk1.1 pdk1.2 was rescued by sop21 (suppressor of pdk1.1 pdk1.2), which harbors a loss-of-function mutation in PELOTA1 (PEL1). PEL1 is a homolog of mammalian PELOTA and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) DOM34p, which each form a heterodimeric complex with the GTPase HBS1 (HSP70 SUBFAMILY B SUPPRESSOR1, also called SUPERKILLER PROTEIN7, SKI7), a protein that is responsible for ribosomal rescue and thereby assures the quality and fidelity of mRNA molecules during translation. Genetic analysis further revealed that a dysfunctional PEL1-HBS1 complex failed to degrade the T-DNA-disrupted PDK1 transcripts, which were truncated but functional, and thus rescued the growth and developmental defects of pdk1.1 pdk1.2. Our studies demonstrated the functionality of a homologous PELOTA-HBS1 complex and identified its essential regulatory role in plants, providing insights into the mechanism of mRNA quality control.
