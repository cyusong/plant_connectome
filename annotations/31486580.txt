The thermosensitive genic male sterile 5 (tms5) mutation causes thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice (Oryza sativa) through loss of RNase Z<sup>S1</sup> function, which influences ubiquitin fusion ribosomal protein L40 (Ub<sub>L40</sub> ) messenger RNA levels during male development. Here, we used ATAC-seq, combined with analysis of H3K9ac and H3K4me2, to identify changes in accessible chromatin during fertility conversion of the two-line hybrid rice Wuxiang S (WXS) derived from a mutant tms5 allele. Furthermore, RNA-seq and bioinformatic analyses identified specific transcription factors (TFs) in differentially accessible chromatin regions. Among these TFs, only GATA10 targeted Ub<sub>L40</sub> . Osgata10 knockout mutations, which resulted in low expression of Ub<sub>L40</sub> and a tendency toward male fertility, confirmed that GATA10 regulated fertility conversion via the modulation of Ub<sub>L40</sub> . Meanwhile, GATA10 acted as a mediator for interactions with ERF65, which revealed that transcriptional regulation is a complex process involving multiple complexes of TFs, namely TF modules. It appears that the ERF141/MADS7/MADS50/MYB modules affect metabolic processes that control anther and pollen development, especially cell wall formation. Our analysis revealed that these modules directly or indirectly affect metabolic pathway-related genes to coordinate plant growth with proper anther development, and furthermore, that GATA10 regulates fertility conversion via the modulation of Ub<sub>L40</sub> expression.
