The medicinal plants were wildly library of natural products in drug discovery. The most active molecules with seven-membered rings skeleton represent a challenge for construction. A stereoselectivity (4 + 3) cycloadditions between allenyl ethers and substituted furans induced by chiral auxiliaries has been investigated. And the results showed significant stereoselectivities and regioselectivities. The optical cycloadducts with an oxygen-substituted seven-membered ring framework were generated by removing chiral auxiliaries under acidic conditions. The antiproliferative activity of the novel compounds displayed moderate antiproliferative effects toward T47D cells.
