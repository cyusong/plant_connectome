The microlocalisation of cadmium (Cd) at the tissue-cellular level in Lupinus albus L. cv. Multolupa was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDXMA). Experimental plants were grown on Cd-treated (0 and 150 microM) perlite for 35 days. In leaves, Cd was found inside cells (cytoplasm or vacuoles), especially in the vascular bundle cells. Cd-induced damage of the chloroplast structure was also detected. EDXMA of the roots showed the cell wall to be the main area of Cd binding at the cellular level; only a small amount of Cd was found in the vacuoles. At the tissue level, a decreasing Cd gradient was seen from the outer to the inner root cortical parenchyma. Cd and S were found co-localised in the vascular cylinder.
