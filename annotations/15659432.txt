Inflorescences and flowers in the grass species have characteristic structures that are distinct from those in eudicots. Owing to the availability of genetic tools and their genome sequences, rice and maize have become model plants for the grasses and for the monocots in general. Recent studies have provided much insight into the genetic control of inflorescence and flower development in grasses, especially in rice and maize. Progress in elucidating the developmental mechanisms in each of these plants may contribute greatly to our understanding of the evolution of development in higher plants.
