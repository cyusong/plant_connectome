['26745275', 'Cytokinesis in plants involves the formation of unique cellular structures such  as the phragmoplast and the cell plate, both of which are required to divide the  cell after nuclear division. In order to isolate genes that are involved in de  novo cell wall formation, we performed a large-scale, microscope-based screen for  Arabidopsis mutants that severely impair cytokinesis in the embryo. We recovered  35 mutations that form abnormally enlarged cells with multiple, often polyploid  nuclei and incomplete cell walls. These mutants represent seven genes, four of  which have previously been implicated in phragmoplast or cell plate function.  Mutations in two loci show strongly reduced transmission through the haploid  gametophytic generation. Molecular cloning of both corresponding genes reveals  that one is represented by hypomorphic alleles of the kinesin-5 gene RADIALLY  SWOLLEN 7 (homologous to tobacco kinesin-related protein TKRP125), and that the  other gene corresponds to the Arabidopsis FUSED ortholog TWO-IN-ONE (originally  identified based on its function in pollen development). No mutations that  completely abolish the formation of cross walls in diploid cells were found. Our  results support the idea that cytokinesis in the diploid and haploid generations  involve similar mechanisms.', '2016', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0146492', 'Lukowitz']
