In higher plants, pluripotent stem cells reside in the specialized microenvironment called stem cell niches (SCNs) harbored at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root apical meristem (RAM), which give rise to the aerial and underground parts of a plant, respectively. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) has been extensively studied to decipher the intricate regulatory mechanisms involving some key transcriptions factors and phytohormones that play pivotal roles in stem cell homeostasis, meristem maintenance, and organ formation. However, there is increasing evidence to show the epigenetic regulation of the chromatin architecture, gene expression exerting an influence on an innate balance between the self-renewal of stem cells, and differentiation of the progeny cells to a specific tissue type or organ. Post-translational histone modifications, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and chromatin assembly/disassembly are some of the key features involved in the modulation of chromatin architecture. Here, we discuss the major epigenetic regulators and illustrate their roles in the regulation of stem cell activity, meristem maintenance, and related organ patterning in Arabidopsis.
