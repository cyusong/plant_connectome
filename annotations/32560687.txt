MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that can influence gene expression via diverse mechanisms. Tomato is a fruit widely consumed for its flavor, culinary attributes, and high nutritional quality. Tomato fruit are climacteric and fleshy, and their ripening is regulated by endogenous and exogenous signals operating through a coordinated genetic network. Much research has been conducted on mechanisms of tomato fruit ripening, but the roles of miRNA-regulated repression/expression of specific regulatory genes are not well documented. In this study, we demonstrate that miR172 specifically targets four SlAP2 transcription factor genes in tomato. Among them, SlAP2a was repressed by the overexpression of SlmiR172, manifesting in altered flower morphology, development and accelerated ripening. miR172 over-expression lines specifically repressed SlAP2a, enhancing ethylene biosynthesis, fruit color and additional ripening characteristics. Most previously described ripening-regulatory genes, including RIN-MADS, NR, TAGL1 and LeHB-1 were not influenced by miR172 while CNR showed altered expression. Tomato fruit ripening is directly influenced by miR172 targeting of the APETALA2 transcription factor, SlAP2a, with minimal influence over additional known ripening-regulatory genes. miR172a-guided SlAP2a expression provides insight into another layer of genetic control of ripening and a target for modifying the quality and nutritional value of tomato and possibly other fleshy fruit crops.
