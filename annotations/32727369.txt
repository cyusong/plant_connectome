C2H2-type zinc finger protein (ZFPs) form a relatively large family of transcriptional regulators in plants, and play many roles in plant growth, development, and stress response. However, the comprehensive analysis of C2H2 ZFPs in cucumber (CsZFPs) and their regulation function in cucumber are still lacking. In the current study, the whole genome identification and characterization of CsZFPs, including the gene structure, genome localization, phylogenetic relationship, and gene expression were performed. Functional analysis of 4 selected genes by transient transformation were also conducted. A total of 129 full-length CsZFPs were identified, which could be classified into four groups according to the phylogenetic analysis. The 129 CsZFPs unequally distributed on 7 chromosomes. Promoter cis-element analysis showed that the CsZFPs might involve in the regulation of phytohormone and/or abiotic stress response, and 93 CsZFPs were predicted to be targeted by one to 20 miRNAs. Moreover, the subcellular localization analysis indicated that 10 tested CsZFPs located in the nucleus and the transcriptome profiling analysis of CsZFPs demonstrated that these genes are involved in root and floral development, pollination and fruit spine. Furthermore, the transient overexpression of Csa1G085390 and Csa7G071440 into Nicotiana benthamiana plants revealed that they could decrease and induce leave necrosis in response to pathogen attack, respectively, and they could enhance salt and drought stresses through the initial induction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In addition, Csa4G642460 and Csa6G303740 could induce cell death after 5 days transformation. The identification and function analysis of CsZFPs demonstrated that some key individual CsZFPs might play essential roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. These results could lay the foundation for understanding the role of CsZFPs in cucumber development for future genetic engineering studies.
