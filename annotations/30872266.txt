Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that are essential for plant growth and development. These hormones control the division, elongation and differentiation of various cell types throughout the entire plant life cycle. Our current understanding of the BR signaling pathway has mostly been obtained from studies using <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> as a model. In this context, the membrane steroid receptor BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1) binds directly to the BR ligand, triggering a signal cascade in the cytoplasm that leads to the transcription of BR-responsive genes that drive cellular growth. However, recent studies of the primary root have revealed distinct BR signaling pathways in different cell types and have highlighted cell-specific roles for BR signaling in controlling adaptation to stress. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of the spatiotemporal control of BR action in plant growth and development, focusing on BR functions in primary root development and growth, in stem cell self-renewal and death, and in plant adaption to environmental stress.
