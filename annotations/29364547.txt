The maize nodal root system plays a crucial role in the development of the aboveground plant and determines the yield via the uptake of water and nutrients in the field. However, the genetic architecture of the maize nodal root system is not well understood, and it has become the 'dark matter' of maize genetics. Here, a large teosinte-maize population was analyzed, and high-resolution mapping revealed that 62 out of 133 quantitative trait loci (QTLs), accounting for approximately half of the total genetic variation in nodal root number, were derived from QTLs for flowering time, which was further validated through a transgenic analysis and a genome-wide association study. However, only 16% of the total genetic variation in nodal root number was derived from QTLs for plant height. These results gave a hint that flowering time played a key role in shaping nodal root number via indirect selection during maize domestication. Our results also supported that more aerial nodal roots and fewer crown roots might be favored in temperate maize, and this root architecture might efficiently improve root-lodging resistance and the ability to take up deep water and nitrogen under dense planting.
