As multicellular organisms, plants acquire characteristic shapes through a complex set of biological processes known as morphogenesis. Biochemical signalling underlies much of development, as it allows cells to acquire specific identities based on their position within tissues and organs. However, as growing physical structures, plants, and their constituent cells, also experience internal and external physical forces that can be perceived and can influence key processes such as growth, polarity, and gene expression. This process, which adds another layer of control to growth and development, has important implications for plant morphogenesis. This review provides an overview of recent research into the role of mechanical signals in plant development and aims to show how mechanical signalling can be used, in concert with biochemical signals, as a cue allowing cells and tissues to coordinate their behaviour and to add robustness to developmental processes.
