Ethylene has long been regarded as the main regulator of ripening in climacteric fruits. The characterization of a few tomato mutants, unable to produce climacteric ethylene and to ripen their fruits even following treatments with exogenous ethylene, has shown that other factors also play an important role in the control of climacteric fruit ripening. In climacteric peach and tomato fruits it has been shown that, concomitant with ethylene production, increases in the amount of auxin can also be measured. In this work a genomic approach has been used in order to understand if such an auxin increase is functional to an independent role played by the hormone during ripening of the climacteric peach fruits. Besides the already known indirect activity on ripening due to its up-regulation of climacteric ethylene synthesis, it has been possible to show that auxin plays a role of its own during ripening of peaches. In fact, the hormone has shown the ability to regulate the expression of a number of different genes. Moreover, many genes involved in biosynthesis and transport and, in particular, the signalling (receptors, Auxin Response Factors and Aux/IAA) of auxin had increased expression in the mesocarp during ripening, thus strengthening the idea that this hormone is actively involved in the ripening of peaches. This study has also demonstrated the existence of an important cross-talk between auxin and ethylene, with genes in the auxin domain regulated by ethylene and genes in the ethylene domain regulated by auxin.
