['12042319', 'The synthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides and glycoproteins in the plant  cell Golgi apparatus requires UDP-galactose as substrate. The topology of these  reactions is not known, although the orientation of a plant galactosyltransferase  involved in the biosynthesis of galactomannans in fenugreek is consistent with a  requirement for UDP-galactose in the lumen of the Golgi cisternae. Here we  provide evidence that sealed, right-side-out Golgi vesicles isolated from pea  stems transport UDP-galactose into their lumen and transfer galactose, likely to  polysaccharides and other acceptors. In addition, we identified and cloned  AtUTr1, a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana that encodes a multitransmembrane  hydrophobic protein similar to nucleotide sugar transporters. Northern analysis  showed that AtUTr1 is indeed expressed in Arabidopsis. AtUTr1 is able to  complement the phenotype of MDCK ricin-resistant cells; a mammalian cell line  deficient in transport of UDP-galactose into the Golgi. In vitro assays using a  Golgi-enriched vesicle fraction obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing  AtUTr1-MycHis is able to transport UDP-galactose but also UDP-glucose. AtUTr1-  MycHis does not transport GDP-mannose, GDP-fucose, CMP-sialic acid,  UDP-glucuronic acid, or UDP-xylose when expressed in S. cerevisiae. AtUTr1 is the  first transporter described that is able to transport UDP-galactose and  UDP-glucose. Thus AtUTr1 may play an important role in the synthesis of  glycoconjugates in Arabidopsis that contain galactose and glucose.', '2002 Sep 6', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M204081200', 'Orellana']
