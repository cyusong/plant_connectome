['19054365', 'The shoot apical meristem (SAM) of angiosperms comprises a group of  undifferentiated cells which divide to maintain the meristem and also give rise  to all the above-ground structures of the plant. Previous studies revealed that  the Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE10 [AGO10, also called PINHEAD (PNH) or ZWILLE (ZLL)]  gene is one of the critical SAM regulators, but the mechanism by which AGO10  modulates the SAM is unknown. In the present study we show that AGO10 genetically  represses microRNA165/166 (miR165/166) for SAM maintenance as well as  establishment of leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity. Levels of miR165/166 in leaves  and embryonic SAMs of pnh/zll/ago10 mutants are abnormally elevated, leading to a  reduction in the quantity of homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) III gene  transcripts, the targets of miR165/166. This reduction is the primary cause of  pnh/zll SAM and leaf defects, because the aberrant pnh/zll phenotypes were  partially rescued by either increasing levels of HD-ZIP III transcripts or  decreasing levels of miR165/166 in the SAM and leaf. Furthermore, plants with an  abnormal apex were more frequent among pnh/zll rdr6 and pnh/zll ago7 double  mutants and increased levels of miR165/166 were detected in rdr6 apices. These  results indicate that AGO10 and RDR6/AGO7 may act in parallel in modulating  accumulation of miR165/166 for normal plant development.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03757.x', 'Huang']
