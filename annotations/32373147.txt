The opening and closure of stomata depend on the turgor pressure adjustment by the influx or efflux of ions and water in guard cells. In this process, aquaporins may play important roles by facilitating the transport of water and other small molecules. In this perspective, we consider the potential roles of aquaporins in the membrane diffusion of different molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), processes dependent on abscisic acid and CO<sub>2</sub> signaling in guard cells. While the limited data already available emphasizes the roles of aquaporins in stomatal movement, we propose additional approaches to elucidate the specific roles of single or several aquaporin isoforms in the stomata and evaluate the perspectives aquaporins might offer to improve stomatal dynamics.
