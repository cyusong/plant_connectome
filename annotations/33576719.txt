Gravitropism plays a critical role in the growth and development of plants. Previous reports proposed that the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton resulted in enhanced gravitropism; however, the mechanism underlying these phenomena is still unclear. In the present study, real-time observation on the effect of Latrunculin B (Lat B), a depolymerizing agent of microfilament cytoskeleton, on gravitropism of the primary root of Arabidopsis was undertaken using a vertical stage microscope. The results indicated that Lat B treatment prevented the growth of root, and the growth rates of upper and lower flanks of the horizontally placed root were asymmetrically inhibited. The growth of the lower flank was influenced by Lat B more seriously, resulting in an increased differential growth rate between the upper and lower flanks of the root. Further analysis indicated that Lat B affected cell growth mainly in the transition and elongation zones. Briefly, the current data revealed that Lat B treatment inhibited cell elongation, especially the cells in the lower flanks of the transition and elongation zones, which finally manifested as the facilitation of gravitropic curvature of the primary root.
