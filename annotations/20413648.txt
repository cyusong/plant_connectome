['20413648', 'Potassium (K(+)) is a major plant nutrient required for growth and development.  It is generally accepted that plant roots absorb K(+) through uptake systems  operating at low concentrations (high-affinity transport) and/or high external  concentrations (low-affinity transport). To understand the molecular basis of  high-affinity K(+) uptake in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), we analyzed  loss-of-function mutants in AtHAK5 and AKT1, two transmembrane proteins active in  roots. Compared with the wild type under NH(4)(+)-free growth conditions, athak5  mutant plants exhibited growth defects at 10 mum K(+), but at K(+) concentrations  of 20 mum and above, athak5 mutants were visibly indistinguishable from the wild  type. While germination, scored as radicle emergence, was only slightly decreased  in athak5 akt1 double mutants on low-K(+) medium, double mutants failed to grow  on medium containing up to 100 mum K(+) and growth was impaired at concentrations  up to 450 mum K(+). Moreover, transfer of 3-d-old plants from high to low K(+)  concentrations led to growth defects and leaf chlorosis at 10 mum K(+) in athak5  akt1 double mutant plants. Determination of Rb(+)(K(+)) uptake kinetics in  wild-type and mutant roots using rubidium ((86)Rb(+)) as a tracer for K(+)  revealed that high-affinity Rb(+)(K(+)) uptake into roots is almost completely  abolished in double mutants and impaired in single mutants. These results  strongly indicate that AtHAK5 and AKT1 are the two major, physiologically  relevant molecular entities mediating high-affinity K(+) uptake into roots during  seedling establishment and postgermination growth and that residual Rb(+)(K(+))  uptake measured in athak5 akt1 double mutant roots is insufficient to enable  plant growth.', '2010 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.154369', 'Cho']
