['18433436', 'The circadian clock is the endogenous timer that coordinates physiological  processes with daily and seasonal environmental changes. In Arabidopsis thaliana,  establishment of the circadian period relies on targeted degradation of TIMING OF  CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) by the 26S proteasome. ZEITLUPE (ZTL) is the F-box  protein that associates with the SCF (Skp/Cullin/F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase that  is responsible for marking TOC1 for turnover. CULLIN1 (CUL1) is a core component  of SCF complexes and is involved in multiple signaling pathways. To assess the  contribution of CUL1-containing SCF complexes to signaling within the plant  oscillator, circadian rhythms were examined in the recessive,  temperature-sensitive CUL1 allele axr6-3. The activity of CUL1 in this mutant  declines progressively with increasing ambient temperature, resulting in more  severe defects in CUL1-dependent activities at elevated temperature. Examination  of circadian rhythms in axr6-3 revealed circadian phenotypes comparable to those  observed in ztl null mutants; namely, lengthened circadian period, altered  expression of core oscillator genes, and limited degradation of TOC1. In  addition, treatment of seedlings with exogenous auxin did not alter TOC1  stability. These results demonstrate that CUL1 is required for TOC1 degradation  and further suggest that this protein is the functional cullin for the SCF(ZTL)  complex.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03527.x', 'Gray']
