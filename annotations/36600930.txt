Multiple grape powdery mildew (PM) genetic resistance (<i>R</i>) loci have been found in wild grape species. Little is known about the defense responses associated with each <i>R</i> locus. In this study, we compare the defense mechanisms associated with PM resistance in interspecific crosses segregating for a single <i>R</i> locus from <i>Muscadinia rotundifolia</i> (<i>Run1</i>, <i>Run1.2b</i>, <i>Run2.1</i>, <i>Run2.2</i>)<i>, Vitis cinerea</i> (<i>Ren2</i>)<i>, V. romanetii</i> (<i>Ren4D</i> and <i>Ren4U</i>), and the interspecific hybrid Villard blanc (<i>Ren3</i>). By combining optical microscopy, visual scoring, and biomass estimation, we show that the eight <i>R</i> loci confer resistance by limiting infection at different stages. We assessed the defense mechanisms triggered in response to PM at 1 and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) <i>via</i> RNA sequencing. To account for the genetic differences between species, we developed for each accession a diploid synthetic reference transcriptome by incorporating into the PN40024 reference homozygous and heterozygous sequence variants and <i>de novo</i> assembled transcripts. Most of the <i>R</i> loci exhibited a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PM resistance at 1 dpi compared to 5 dpi, suggesting that PM resistance is mostly associated with an early transcriptional reprogramming. Comparison of the PM resistance-associated DEGs showed a limited overlap between pairs of <i>R</i> loci, and nearly half of the DEGs were specific to a single <i>R</i> locus. The largest overlap of PM resistance-associated DEGs was found between <i>Ren3</i> <sup>+</sup>, <i>Ren4D</i> <sup>+</sup>, and <i>Ren4U</i> <sup>+</sup> genotypes at 1 dpi, and between <i>Ren4U</i> <sup>+</sup> and <i>Run1</i> <sup>+</sup> accessions at 5 dpi. The <i>Ren3</i> <sup>+</sup>, <i>Ren4D</i> <sup>+</sup>, and <i>Ren4U</i> <sup>+</sup> were also found to have the highest number of <i>R</i> locus-specific DEGs in response to PM. Both shared and <i>R</i> locus-specific DEGs included genes from different defense-related categories, indicating that the presence of <i>E. necator</i> triggered distinct transcriptional responses in the eight <i>R</i> loci.
