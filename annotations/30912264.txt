Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) play important roles via environmental stress. However, less is known how to sense the stress in molecular structure conformation level. Here, an OsCIPK7 mutant via TILLING procedure with a point mutation in the kinase domain showed increased chilling tolerance, which could be potentially used in the molecular breeding. We found that this point mutation of OsCIPK7 led to a conformational change in the activation loop of the kinase domain, subsequently with an increase of protein kinase activity, thus conferred an increased tolerance to chilling stress.

OsCIPK7: !mutates to! increased chilling tolerance
point mutation: !causes! conformational change
conformational change: !leads to! increase of protein kinase activity
