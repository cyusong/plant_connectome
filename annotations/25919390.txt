['25919390', 'Pollen tube (PT) reception in flowering plants describes the crosstalk between  the male and female gametophytes upon PT arrival at the synergid cells of the  ovule. It leads to PT growth arrest, rupture, and sperm cell release, and is thus  essential to ensure double fertilization. Here, we describe TURAN (TUN) and EVAN  (EVN), two novel members of the PT reception pathway that is mediated by the  FERONIA (FER) receptor-like kinase (RLK). Like fer, mutations in these two genes  lead to PT overgrowth inside the female gametophyte (FG) without PT rupture.  Mapping by next-generation sequencing, cytological analysis of reporter genes,  and biochemical assays of glycoproteins in RNAi knockdown mutants revealed both  genes to be involved in protein N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum  (ER). TUN encodes a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferase superfamily  protein and EVN a dolichol kinase. In addition to their common role during PT  reception in the synergids, both genes have distinct functions in the pollen:  whereas EVN is essential for pollen development, TUN is required for PT growth  and integrity by affecting the stability of the pollen-specific FER homologs  ANXUR1 (ANX1) and ANX2. ANX1- and ANX2-YFP reporters are not expressed in tun  pollen grains, but ANX1-YFP is degraded via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD)  pathway, likely underlying the anx1/2-like premature PT rupture phenotype of tun  mutants. Thus, as in animal sperm-egg interactions, protein glycosylation is  essential for the interaction between the female and male gametophytes during PT  reception to ensure fertilization and successful reproduction.', '2015 Apr', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.1002139', 'Grossniklaus']
