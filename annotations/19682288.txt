Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and nitric oxide (*NO) are key reactive species in signal transduction pathways leading to activation of plant defense against biotic or abiotic stress. Here, we investigated the effect of pre-treating citrus plants (Citrus aurantium L.) with either of these two molecules on plant acclimation to salinity and show that both pre-treatments strongly reduced the detrimental phenotypical and physiological effects accompanying this stress. A proteomic analysis disclosed 85 leaf proteins that underwent significant quantitative variations in plants directly exposed to salt stress. A large part of these changes was not observed with salt-stressed plants pre-treated with either H(2)O(2) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP; a *NO-releasing chemical). We also identified several proteins undergoing changes either in their oxidation (carbonylation; 40 proteins) and/or S-nitrosylation (49 proteins) status in response to salinity stress. Both H(2)O(2) and SNP pre-treatments before salinity stress alleviated salinity-induced protein carbonylation and shifted the accumulation levels of leaf S-nitrosylated proteins to those of unstressed control plants. Altogether, the results indicate an overlap between H(2)O(2)- and *NO-signaling pathways in acclimation to salinity and suggest that the oxidation and S-nitrosylation patterns of leaf proteins are specific molecular signatures of citrus plant vigour under stressful conditions.
