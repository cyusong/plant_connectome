Changes in chromatin status are correlated with gene regulation of biological processes such as development and stress responses in plants. In this study, we focused on the transition of chromatin status toward gene repression during the process of recovery from drought stress of drought-inducible genes (RD20, RD29A and AtGOLS2) and a rehydration-inducible gene (ProDH). In response to drought, RNA polymerase II was recruited on the drought-inducible genes and rapidly disappeared after rehydration, although mRNA levels of these genes were maintained to some degree after rehydration, suggesting that the transcriptional activities of these genes were rapidly inactivated by rehydration treatment. Histone H3K9ac was enriched by drought and rapidly removed from these regions by rehydration. In contrast, histone H3K4me3 was gradually decreased by rehydration but was maintained at low levels after rehydration, suggesting that H3K4me3 functions as an epigenetic mark of stress memory. These results show that the transcriptional activity and chromatin status are rapidly changed from an active to inactive mode during the recovery process. Our results demonstrate that histone modifications are correlated with the inactivation of drought-inducible genes during the recovery process by rehydration.
