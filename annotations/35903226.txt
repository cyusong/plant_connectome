The formation of the leafy heads of Chinese cabbage is an important agricultural factor because it directly affects yield. In this study, we identified two allelic non-heading mutants, <i>nhm4-1</i> and <i>nhm4-2</i>, from an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenic population of a heading Chinese cabbage double haploid line "FT." Using MutMap, Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR genotyping, and map-based cloning, we found that <i>BraA09g001440.3C</i> was the causal gene for the mutants. <i>BraA09g001440.3C</i> encodes an <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 involved in gibberellin biosynthesis. A single non-synonymous SNP in the seventh and fourth exons of <i>BraA09g001440.3C</i> was responsible for the <i>nhm4-1</i> and <i>nhm4-2</i> mutant phenotypes, respectively. Compared with the wild-type "FT," the gibberellin content in the mutant leaves was significantly reduced. Both mutants showed a tendency to form leafy heads after exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> treatment. The two non-heading mutants and the work presented herein demonstrate that gibberellin is related to leafy head formation in Chinese cabbage.
