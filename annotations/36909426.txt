Olive trees are the most cultivated evergreen trees in the Mediterranean Basin, where they have deep historical and socioeconomic roots. The fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> develops inside the vascular bundles of the host, and there are no effective applicable treatments, making it difficult to control the disease. In this sense, the use of integrated disease management, specifically the use of resistant cultivars, is the most effective means to alleviate the serious damage that these diseases are causing and reduce the expansion of this pathogen. In 2008, the University of Cordoba started a project under the UCO Olive Breeding Program whose main objective has been to develop new olive cultivars with high resistance to Verticillium wilt. Since 2008, more than 18,000 genotypes from 154 progenies have been evaluated. Only 19.9% have shown some resistance to the disease in controlled conditions and only 28 have been preselected due to their resistance in field condition and remarkable agronomic characteristics. The results of this study represent an important advancement in the generation of resistant olive genotypes that will become commercial cultivars currently demanded by the olive growing sector. Our breeding program has proven successful, allowing the selection of several new genotypes with high resistance to the disease and agronomical performance. It also highlights the need for long-term field evaluations for the evaluation of resistance and characterization of olive genotypes.
