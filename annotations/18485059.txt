Although many studies have emphasized the importance of auxin in plant growth and development, the thorough understanding of its effect on pollen-pistil interactions is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of free IAA in pollen-pistil interactions during pollen germination and tube growth in Nicotiana tabacum L. through using histo and subcellular immunolocalization with auxin monoclonal antibodies, quantification by HPLC and ELISA together with GUS staining in DR5::GUS-transformed plants. The results showed that free IAA in unpollinated styles was higher in the apical part and basal part than in the middle part, and it was more abundant in the transmitting tissue (TT). At the stage of pollen germination, IAA reached its highest content in the stigma and was mainly distributed in TT. After the pollen tubes entered the styles, the signal increased in the part where pollen tubes would enter and then rapidly declined in the part where pollen tubes had penetrated. Subcellular localization confirmed the presence of IAA in TT cells of stigmas and styles. Accordingly, a schematic diagram summarizes the changing pattern of free IAA level during flowering, pollination and pollen tube growth. Furthermore, we presented evidence that low concentration of exogenous IAA could, to a certain extent, facilitate in vitro pollen tube growth. These results suggest that IAA may be directly or indirectly involved in the pollen-pistil interactions. Additionally, some improvements of the IAA immunolocalization technique were made.
