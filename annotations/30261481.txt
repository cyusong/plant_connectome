Drought is known to limit carbon assimilation in plants. However, it has been debated whether photosynthesis is primarily inhibited by stomatal or non-stomatal factors. This research assessed the underlying limitations to photosynthesis in peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) grown under progressive drought. Specifically, field-grown peanut plants were exposed to either well-watered or drought-stressed conditions during flowering. Measurements included survey measurements of gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, PSII thermotolerance, pigment content, and rapid A-C<sub>i</sub> response (RACiR) assessments. Drought significantly decreased stomatal conductance with consequent declines in photosynthesis (A<sub>N</sub>), actual quantum yield of PSII, and electron transport rate (ETR). Pigment contents were variable and depended on stress severity. Stomatal closure on stressed plants resulted in higher leaf temperatures, but F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> and PSII thermotolerance were only slightly affected by drought. A strong, hyperbolic relationship was observed between stomatal conductance, A<sub>N</sub>, and ETR. However, when RACiR analysis was conducted, drought significantly decreased A<sub>N</sub> at C<sub>i</sub> values comparable to drought-stressed plants, indicating non-stomatal limitations to A<sub>N</sub>. The maximum rate of carboxylation and maximum electron transport rate were severely limited by drought, and chloroplast CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (C<sub>C</sub>) declined substantially under drought along with a comparable increase in partitioning of electron flow to photorespiration. Thus, while stomatal conductance may be a viable reference indicator of water deficit stress in peanut, we conclude that declines in A<sub>N</sub> were largely due to non-stomatal (diffusional and metabolic) limitations. Additionally, this is the first study to apply the rapid A-C<sub>i</sub> response method to peanut, with comparable results to traditional A-C<sub>i</sub> methods.
