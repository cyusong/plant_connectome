['30604455', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2) ] serves as a subcellular  signal on the plasma membrane, mediating various cell-polarized phenomena  including polar cell growth. Here, we investigated the involvement of Arabidopsis  thaliana PCaP2, a plant-unique plasma membrane protein with  phosphoinositide-binding activity, in PtdIns(4,5)P(2) signaling for root hair tip  growth. The long-root-hair phenotype of the pcap2 knockdown mutant was found to  stem from its higher average root hair elongation rate compared with the wild  type and to counteract the low average rate caused by a defect in the  PtdIns(4,5)P(2) -producing enzyme gene PIP5K3. On the plasma membrane of  elongating root hairs, the PCaP2 promoter-driven PCaP2-green fluorescent protein  (GFP), which complemented the pcap2 mutant phenotype, overlapped with the  PtdIns(4,5)P(2) marker 2xCHERRY-2xPH(PLC) in the subapical region, but not at the  apex, suggesting that PCaP2 attenuates root hair elongation via PtdIns(4,5)P(2)  signaling on the subapical plasma membrane. Consistent with this, a GFP fusion  with the PCaP2 phosphoinositide-binding domain PCaP2(N23) , root hair-specific  overexpression of which caused a low average root hair elongation rate, localized  more intense to the subapical plasma membrane than to the apical plasma membrane  similar to PCaP2-GFP. Inducibly overexpressed PCaP2-GFP, but not its derivative  lacking the PCaP2(N23) domain, replaced 2xCHERRY-2xPH(PLC) on the plasma membrane  in root meristematic epidermal cells, and suppressed FM4-64 internalization in  elongating root hairs. Moreover, inducibly overexpressed PCaP2 arrested an  endocytic process of PIN2-GFP recycling. Based on these results, we conclude that  PCaP2 functions as a negative modulator of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) signaling on the  subapical plasma membrane probably through competitive binding to PtdIns(4,5)P(2)  and attenuates root hair elongation.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14226', 'ORCID:']
