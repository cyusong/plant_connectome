As a fungus with both medicinal and edible value, <i>Wolfiporia cocos</i> (F. A. Wolf) Ryvarden & Gilb. has drawn more public attention. Chemical components' content fluctuates in wild and cultivated <i>W. cocos</i>, whereas the accumulation ability of chemical components in different parts is different. In order to perform a quality assessment of <i>W. cocos</i>, we proposed a comprehensive method which was mainly realized by Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and ultra-fast liquid chromatography (UFLC). A qualitative analysis means was built a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) to recognize synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) images. It can rapidly identify samples from wild and cultivated <i>W. cocos</i> in different parts. As a quantitative analysis method, UFLC was used to determine the contents of three triterpene acids in 547 samples. The results showed that a simultaneous qualitative and quantitative strategy could accurately evaluate the quality of <i>W. cocos</i>. The accuracy of ResNet models combined synchronous FT-NIR 2DCOS in identifying wild and cultivated <i>W. cocos</i> in different parts was as high as 100%. The contents of three triterpene acids in Poriae Cutis were higher than that in Poria, and the one with wild Poriae Cutis was the highest. In addition, the suitable habitat plays a crucial role in the quality of <i>W. cocos</i>. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model is a common method to predict the suitable habitat area for <i>W. cocos</i> under the current climate. Through the results, we found that suitable habitats were mostly situated in Yunnan Province of China, which accounted for approximately 49% of the total suitable habitat area of China. The research results not only pave the way for the rational planting in Yunnan Province of China and resource utilization of <i>W. cocos</i>, but also provide a basis for quality assessment of medicinal fungi.
