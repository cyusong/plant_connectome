Light is essential for photosynthesis but excess light is hazardous as it may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species. Photosynthetic organisms struggle to optimize light utilization and photosynthesis while minimizing photo-oxidative damage. Hereby light to heat dissipation via specialized proteins is a potent mechanism to acclimate toward excess light. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the expression of an ancient light-harvesting protein LHCSR3 enables cells to dissipate harmful excess energy. Herein we summarize newest insights into the function of LHCSR3 from C. reinhardtii.

Light: !promotes! Photosynthesis
Light: !causes! Photo-oxidative damage
LHCSR3: !dissipates! Excess energy
LHCSR3: !enables! C. reinhardtii cells
