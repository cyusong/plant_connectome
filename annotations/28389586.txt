Enlargement and doming of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a hallmark of the transition from vegetative growth to flowering. While this change is widespread, its role in the flowering process is unknown. The <i>late termination</i> (<i>ltm</i>) tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) mutant shows severely delayed flowering and precocious doming of the vegetative SAM <i>LTM</i> encodes a kelch domain-containing protein, with no link to known meristem maintenance or flowering time pathways. LTM interacts with the TOPLESS corepressor and with several transcription factors that can provide specificity for its functions. A subgroup of flowering-associated genes is precociously upregulated in vegetative stages of <i>ltm</i> SAMs, among them, the antiflorigen gene <i>SELF PRUNING</i> (<i>SP</i>). A mutation in <i>SP</i> restored the structure of vegetative SAMs in <i>ltm sp</i> double mutants, and late flowering was partially suppressed, suggesting that LTM functions to suppress <i>SP</i> in the vegetative SAM In agreement, <i>SP</i>-overexpressing wild-type plants exhibited precocious doming of vegetative SAMs combined with late flowering, as found in <i>ltm</i> plants. Strong flowering signals can result in termination of the SAM, usually by its differentiation into a flower. We propose that activation of a floral antagonist that promotes SAM growth in concert with floral transition protects it from such terminating effects.
