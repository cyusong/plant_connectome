Biofilms formed by bacteria on plant roots play an important role in maintaining an optimal rhizosphere environment that supports plant growth and fitness. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> is a potent plant growth promoter, forming biofilms that play a key role in protecting the host from fungal and bacterial infections. In this work, we demonstrate that the development of <i>B. subtilis</i> biofilms is antagonized by specific indole derivatives that accumulate during symbiotic interactions with plant hosts. Indole derivatives are more potent signals when the plant polysaccharide xylan serves as a carbon source, a mechanism to sustain beneficial biofilms at a biomass that can be supported by the plant. Moreover, <i>B. subtilis</i> biofilms formed by mutants resistant to indole derivatives become deleterious to the plants due to their capacity to consume and recycle plant polysaccharides. These results demonstrate how a dynamic metabolite-based dialogue can promote homeostasis between plant hosts and their beneficial biofilm communities.
