Botanical pesticides are one of the sources of third-generation pesticides, which have received much attention at home and abroad in recent years due to their degradable and pollution-free advantages in nature. This article explored a concise approach toward synthesizing a series of novel L-pyroglutamic acid analogues from L-hydroxyproline. Furthermore, bioassay studies of these sulfonyl ester derivatives against <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i>, <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, <i>Alternaria brassicae</i>, <i>Valsa mali</i>, and <i>Alternaria alternariae</i> showed moderate antifungal activity. For instance, <b>C08a</b> and <b>C08l</b> provide potential lead agents for controlling <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> because of their inhibitory activity.
