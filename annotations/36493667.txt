Stomata, tiny epidermal spores, control gas exchange between plants and their external environment, thereby playing essential roles in plant development and physiology. Stomatal development requires rapid regulation of components in signaling pathways to respond flexibly to numerous intrinsic and extrinsic signals. In support of this, reversible phosphorylation, which is particularly suitable for rapid signal transduction, has been implicated in this process. This review highlights the current understanding of the essential roles of reversible phosphorylation in the regulation of stomatal development, most of which comes from the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. Protein phosphorylation tightly controls the activity of SPEECHLESS (SPCH)-SCREAM (SCRM), the stomatal lineage switch, and the activity of several mitogen-activated protein kinases and receptor kinases upstream of SPCH-SCRM, thereby regulating stomatal cell differentiation and patterning. In addition, protein phosphorylation is involved in the establishment of cell polarity during stomatal asymmetric cell division. Finally, cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation plays essential roles in cell cycle control during stomatal development.
