['27122350', 'Eukaryotes harbor mitochondria obtained via ancient symbiosis events. The  successful evolution of energy production in mitochondria has been dependent on  the control of mitochondrial gene expression by the nucleus. In flowering plants,  the nuclear-encoded pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) superfamily proteins are  widely involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. Here, we show that an  Arabidopsis nuclear-encoded RNA-binding protein, Restorer-of-fertility-like PPR  protein 2 (RFL2), is required for RNA degradation of the mitochondrial orf291  transcript via endonucleolytic cleavage of the transcript in the middle of its  reading frame. Both in vivo and in vitro, this RNA cleavage requires the activity  of mitochondrial proteinaceous RNase P, which is possibly recruited to the site  by RFL2. The site of RNase P cleavage likely forms a tRNA-like structure in the  orf291 transcript. This study presents an example of functional collaboration  between a PPR protein and an endonuclease in RNA cleavage. Furthermore, we show  that the RFL2-binding region within the orf291 gene is hypervariable in the  family Brassicaceae, possibly correlated with the rapid evolution of the  RNA-recognition interfaces of the RFL proteins.', '2016 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13185', 'Shikanai']
