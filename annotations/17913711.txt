['17913711', 'PII is a highly conserved regulatory protein found in organisms across the three  domains of life. In cyanobacteria and plants, PII relieves the feedback  inhibition of the rate-limiting step in arginine biosynthesis catalyzed by  N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK). To understand the molecular structural basis of  enzyme regulation by PII, we have determined a 2.5-A resolution crystal structure  of a complex formed between two homotrimers of PII and a single hexamer of NAGK  from Arabidopsis thaliana bound to the metabolites N-acetylglutamate, ADP, ATP,  and arginine. In PII, the T-loop and Trp(22) at the start of the alpha1-helix,  which are both adjacent to the ATP-binding site of PII, contact two beta-strands  as well as the ends of two central helices (alphaE and alphaG) in NAGK, the  opposing ends of which form major portions of the ATP and N-acetylglutamate  substrate-binding sites. The binding of Mg(2+).ATP to PII stabilizes a  conformation of the T-loop that favors interactions with both open and closed  conformations of NAGK. Interactions between PII and NAGK appear to limit the  degree of opening and closing of the active-site cleft in opposition to a  domain-separating inhibitory effect exerted by arginine, thus explaining the  stimulatory effect of PII on the kinetics of arginine-inhibited NAGK.', '2007 Dec 7', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M707127200', 'Ng']
