The distribution of genomic variation across landscapes can provide insights into the complex interactions between the environment and the genome that influence the distribution of species, and mediate phenotypic adaptation to local conditions. High throughput sequencing technologies now offer unprecedented power to explore these interactions, allowing powerful inferences about historical processes of colonization, gene flow and divergence, as well as the identification of loci that mediate local adaptation. These 'landscape genomic' approaches have been validated in model species and are now being applied to nonmodel organisms, including foundation species that have substantial effects on ecosystem processes. Here we review the growing field of landscape genomics from a very broad perspective. In particular, we describe the inferential power that is gained by taking a genome-wide view of genetic variation, strategies for study design to best capture adaptive variation, and how to apply this information to practical challenges, such as restoration.
