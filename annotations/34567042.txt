Eggplant (<i>Solanum melongena</i> L.) is the third most important crop in the family of Solanaceae. Prickles are considered as the undesirable traits during the plantation of eggplant and the transportation of fruits. In this study, we constructed a high-quality genetic linkage Bin map derived from the re-sequencing analysis on a cross of a prickly wild landrace, 17C01, and a cultivated variety, 17C02. The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling the development of prickles on the calyx (explained 30.42% of the phenotypic variation), named as <i>qPC.12</i>, was identified on a ~7 kb region on chromosome 12. A gene within <i>qPC.12</i>, which encodes a WUSCHEL-related homeobox-like protein, with higher expression levels in 17C01 calyx and 22-bp deletion in 17C02 was probably the functional gene for prickle formation. Results from this study would ultimately facilitate uncovering the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the development of a prickle in eggplant.

QTL: !controls! Prickle formation
WUSCHEL-related homeobox-like protein: !encodes! qPC.12
22-bp deletion: !inhibits! Expression levels
17C01 calyx: !has higher! Expression levels
