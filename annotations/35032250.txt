Domestication traits particularly fruit size and plant architecture and flowering are critical in transforming a progenitor's wild stature into a super improved plant. The latest advancements in the CRISPR system, as well as its rapid adoption, are speeding up plant breeding. Solanaceae has a varied range of important crops, with a few model crops, such as tomato and, more recently, groundcherry, serving as a foundation for developing molecular techniques, genome editing tools, and establishing standards for other crops. Domestication traits in agricultural plants are quantified and widely adopted under modern plant breeding to improve small-fruited and bushy crop species like goji berry. The molecular mechanisms of the FW2.2, FW3.2, FW11.3, FAS/CLV3, LC/WUS, SP, SP5G, and CRISPR genome editing technology have been described in detail here. Furthermore, special focus has been placed on CRISPR gene editing achievements for revolutionizing Solanaceae breeding and changing the overall crop landscape. This review seeks to provide a thorough overview of the CRISPR technique's ongoing advancements, particularly in Solanaceae, in terms of domesticated features, future prospects, and regulatory risks. We believe that this vigorous discussion will lead to a broader understanding of CRISPR gene editing as a tool for achieving key breeding goals in other Solanaceae minor crops with significant industrial value.
