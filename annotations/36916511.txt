Ethylene induces anthocyanin biosynthesis in most fruits, including apple (Malus domestica) and plum (Prunus spp.). By contrast, ethylene inhibits anthocyanin biosynthesis in pear (Pyrus spp.), but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized an ethylene-induced ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) transcription factor, PpERF9, which functions as a transcriptional repressor. Our analyses indicated PpERF9 can directly inhibit expression of the MYB transcription factor gene PpMYB114 by binding to its promoter. Additionally, PpERF9 inhibits the expression of the transcription factor gene PpRELATED TO APETALA2.4 (PpRAP2.4), which activates PpMYB114 expression, by binding to its promoter, thus forming a PpERF9-PpRAP2.4-PpMYB114 regulatory circuit. Furthermore, PpERF9 interacts with the co-repressor PpTOPLESS1 (PpTPL1) via EAR motifs to form a complex that removes the acetyl group on histone H3 and maintains low levels of acetylated H3 in the PpMYB114 and PpRAP2.4 promoter regions. The resulting suppressed expression of these two genes leads to decreased anthocyanin biosynthesis in pear. Collectively, these results indicate that ethylene inhibits anthocyanin biosynthesis by a mechanism that involves PpERF9-PpTPL1 complex-mediated histone deacetylation of PpMYB114 and PpRAP2.4. The data presented herein will be useful for clarifying the relationship between chromatin status and hormone signaling, with implications for plant biology research.
