['12213958', 'Tocopherol (vitamin E) is a plant chloroplast lipid presumed to be involved in  the response to oxidative stress. A tocopherol-deficient mutant (vte1) was  isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana by using a TLC-based screening approach.  Mutant plants lacked all four tocopherol forms and were deficient in tocopherol  cyclase activity. Genetic mapping of vte1 and a genomics-based approach led to  the identification of the ORF At4g32770 as a candidate gene for tocopherol  cyclase. In vte1, At4g32770 contains a splicing site mutation and the  corresponding mRNA expression is reduced. Expression of VTE1 in Escherichia coli  resulted in the production of a protein with high tocopherol cyclase and  tocotrienol cyclase activity. The VTE1 sequence shows no similarities to genes  with known function, but is similar to that of SXD1, a gene that was recently  isolated based on the availability of the sucrose export defective1 maize mutant  (sxd1). Growth of the vte1 mutant, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic  quantum yield were similar to wild type under optimal growth conditions.  Therefore, absence of tocopherol has no large impact on photosynthesis or plant  viability, suggesting that other antioxidants can compensate for the loss of  tocopherol. During photo-oxidative stress, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic  quantum yield were slightly reduced in vte1 as compared with wild type indicating  a potential role for tocopherol in maintaining an optimal photosynthesis rate  under high-light stress.', '2002 Sep 17', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.182330899', 'Dormann']
