In hot pepper, the sesquiterpene phytoalexin capsidiol is catalyzed by the two final-step enzymes, a sesquiterpene cyclase (EAS) and a hydroxylase (EAH), which are genetically linked and present as head-to-head orientation in the genome. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that a subset of <i>EAS</i> and <i>EAH</i> is highly induced following pathogen infection, suggesting the coregulation of <i>EAS</i> and <i>EAH</i> by a potential bidirectional activity of the promoter (pCaD). A series of the nested deletions of pCaD in both directions verified the bidirectional promoter activity of the pCaD. Promoter deletion analysis revealed that the 226 bp of the adjacent promoter region of <i>EAS</i> and GCC-box in <i>EAH</i> orientation were determined as critical regulatory elements for the induction of each gene. Based on promoter analyses, we generated a set of synthetic promoters to maximize reporter gene expression within the minimal length of the promoter in both directions. We found that the reporter gene expression was remarkably induced upon infection with <i>Phytophthora capsici</i>, <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, and bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. tomato DC3000 but not with necrotrophic fungi <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Our results confirmed the bidirectional activity of the pCaD located between the head-to-head oriented phytoalexin biosynthetic genes in hot pepper. Furthermore, the synthetic promoter modified in pCaD could be a potential tool for pathogen-inducible expression of target genes for developing disease-resistant crops.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).
