['20952636', 'Xylem consists of three types of cells: tracheary elements (TEs), parenchyma  cells, and fiber cells. TE differentiation includes two essential processes,  programmed cell death (PCD) and secondary cell wall formation. These two  processes are tightly coupled. However, little is known about the molecular  mechanisms underlying these processes. Here, we show that VASCULAR-RELATED  NAC-DOMAIN6 (VND6), a master regulator of TEs, regulates some of the downstream  genes involved in these processes in a coordinated manner. We first identified  genes that are expressed downstream of VND6 but not downstream of SECONDARY  WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1), a master regulator of xylem fiber  cells, using transformed suspension culture cells in microarray experiments. We  found that VND6 and SND1 governed distinct aspects of xylem formation, whereas  they regulated a number of genes in common, specifically those related to  secondary cell wall formation. Genes involved in TE-specific PCD were upregulated  only by VND6. Moreover, we revealed that VND6 directly regulated genes that  harbor a TE-specific cis-element, TERE, in their promoters. Thus, we found that  VND6 is a direct regulator of genes related to PCD as well as to secondary wall  formation.', '2010 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.075036', 'Fukuda']
