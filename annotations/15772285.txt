['15772285', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1 (snc1) mutant  contains a gain-of-function mutation in a Toll Interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide  binding-Leu-rich repeat-type resistance gene (R-gene), which leads to  constitutive activation of disease resistance response against pathogens. In a  screen for suppressors of snc1, a recessive mutation, designated mos3 (for  modifier of snc1,3), was found to suppress the constitutive pathogenesis-related  gene expression and resistance to virulent Pseudomonas syringae maculicola ES4326  and Peronospora parasitica Noco2 in snc1. In addition, mos3 is also compromised  in resistance mediated by Resistance to Peronospora parasitica 4 (RPP4),  Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola (RPM1), and Resistance to  Pseudomonas syringae 4 (RPS4). Single mutant mos3 plants exhibited enhanced  disease susceptibility to P. s. pv maculicola ES4326, suggesting that MOS3 is  required for basal resistance to pathogens as well. mos3-1 was identified by  map-based cloning, and it encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to  human nucleoporin 96. Localization of the MOS3-green fluorescent protein fusion  to the nuclear envelope further indicates that MOS3 may encode a nucleoporin,  suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic trafficking plays an important role in  both R-gene-mediated and basal disease resistance.', '2005 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.029926', 'Li']
