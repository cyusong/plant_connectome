Plant growth and development is coordinated by complex networks of interacting hormones, and cross-talk between ethylene and auxin signaling is essential for a wide range of plant developmental processes. Nevertheless, the molecular links underlying the interaction between the two hormones remain poorly understood. In order to decipher the cross-talk between the Ethylene Response Factor Sl-ERF.B3 and Sl-IAA27, mediating ethylene and auxin signaling, respectively, we combined reverse genetic approaches, physiological methods, transactivation experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Sl-ERF.B3 is responsive to both ethylene and auxin and ectopic expression of its dominant repressor version (ERF.B3-SRDX) results in impaired sensitivity to auxin with phenotypes recalling those previously reported for Sl-IAA27 downregulated tomato lines. The expression of Sl-IAA27 is dramatically reduced in the ERF.B3-SRDX lines and Sl-ERF.B3 is shown to regulate the expression of Sl-IAA27 via direct binding to its promoter. The data support a model in which the ethylene-responsive Sl-ERF.B3 integrates ethylene and auxin signaling via regulation of the expression of the auxin signaling component Sl-IAA27. The study uncovers a molecular mechanism that links ethylene and auxin signaling in tomato.
