The NYC-like (NOL) enzyme is considered as an essential enzyme for chlorophyll <i>b</i> degradation, which catalyzes the formation of 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a from chlorophyll <i>b</i>. The <i>ZjNOL</i> gene was cloned from <i>Zoysia japonica</i> with a completed coding sequence of 981-bp in length, encoding 326 amino acids. ZjNOL was localized on the stroma side of the thylakoid membrane, and co-localized with ZjNYC in the chloroplasts. Multiple photoregulatory elements and hormone regulatory elements were identified in the promoter region of the ZjNOL gene, and the expression level of the <i>ZjNOL</i> gene was dramatically up-regulated in senescence leaves, which were regulated by a variety of plant hormones. <i>ZjNOL</i>'s ectopic expression in creeping bentgrass produced yellow leaves, thicker cortex, and smaller vascular column cells. Additionally, transgenic plants exhibited morphological alterations in their chloroplast structure, and the number of grana and thylakoids per grana stack reduced dramatically. Transgenic plants also had a lower photosynthetic rate and Fm/Fv than the control. The transgenic plants displayed a decreased chlorophyll content and a greater rate of ion leakage. The properties and activities of <i>ZjNOL</i> will serve as a foundation for future research into gene functions and regulatory processes.
