['32374882', 'Sporophytic pollen coat proteins (sPCPs) derived from the anther tapetum are  deposited into pollen wall cavities and function in pollen-stigma interactions,  pollen hydration, and environmental protection. In Arabidopsis, 13 highly  abundant proteins have been identified in pollen coat, including seven major  glycine-rich proteins GRP14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and GRP-oleosin; two  caleosin-related family proteins (AT1G23240 and AT1G23250); three lipase proteins  EXL4, EXL5 and EXL6, and ATA27/BGLU20. Here, we show that GRP14, 17, 18, 19, and  EXL4 and EXL6 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) are translated in the  tapetum and then accumulate in the anther locule following tapetum degeneration.  The expression of these sPCPs is dependent on two essential tapetum transcription  factors, MALE STERILE188 (MS188) and MALE STERILITY 1 (MS1). The majority of sPCP  genes are up-regulated within 30 h after MS1 induction and could be restored by  MS1 expression driven by the MS188 promoter in ms188, indicating that MS1 is  sufficient to activate their expression; however, additional MS1 downstream  factors appear to be required for high-level sPCP expression. Our ChIP, in vivo  transactivation assay, and EMSA data indicate that MS188 directly activates MS1.  Together, these results reveal a regulatory cascade whereby outer pollen wall  formation is regulated by MS188 followed by synthesis of sPCPs controlled by MS1.', '2020 Aug 6', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eraa219', 'Yang']
