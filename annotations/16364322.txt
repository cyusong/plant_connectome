MSN1 is a putative yeast transcriptional activator involved in chromium (Cr) accumulation. Here we show that overexpression of MSN1 enhances Cr and sulfur accumulation and Cr tolerance in transgenic tobacco. In addition, we found that expression of NtST1 (Nicotiana tabacum sulfate transporter 1) was elevated in MSN1- expressing transgenic tobacco, suggesting that chromate and sulfate are taken up via the sulfate transporter in plants. Supporting this, expression of NtST1 increased levels of Cr and S in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our findings suggest that yeast transcriptional activators can be used for developing effective metal remediators, and for improving the nutritional status of plants.
