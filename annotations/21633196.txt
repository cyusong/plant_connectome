Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), that causes bacterial speck disease on tomato, produces a non-host-specific virulence effector, coronatine (COR). COR functions as a jasmonic acid (JA)-isoleucine mimic in planta and has multiple roles in the pathogenicity of Pst DC3000. One of the hallmarks of bacterial speck disease on tomato is the formation of necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis and COR is required for disease development. However, the molecular basis of COR-mediated disease symptom development including chlorosis and necrosis is still largely unknown. In our recent publication in New Phytologist, using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) based reverse genetics screen, we demonstrated that SGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) is required for COR-induced chlorosis in Nicotiana benthamiana. SGT1-silenced tomato leaves showed a complete loss of COR-induced chlorosis and reduced disease symptom development after the inoculation with Pst DC3000. Furthermore, Arabidopsis sgt1b mutant was less sensitive to COR-induced root growth inhibition and showed delayed Pst DC3000 disease symptoms. In this addendum, we discuss the possible contribution of SGT1 to COR-mediated signal transduction pathway leading to disease symptom development during Pst DC3000 pathogenesis in tomato and Arabidopsis.
