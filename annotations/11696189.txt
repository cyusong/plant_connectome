['11696189', 'Serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) proteins have traditionally been assigned  roles in the hydrolytic processing of proteins; however, several SCPL proteins  have recently been identified as catalysts in transacylation reactions of plant  secondary metabolism. The novel functions of these enzymes suggest a catalytic  diversity for plant SCPL proteins that extends beyond simple hydrolysis  reactions. Characterization of the Arabidopsis sng2 (sinapoylglucose accumulator  2) mutant has identified another SCPL protein involved in plant secondary  metabolism. The sng2 mutant was isolated by screening seed extracts for altered  levels of sinapate esters, a group of phenylpropanoid compounds found in  Arabidopsis and some other members of the Brassicaceae. Homozygous sng2 seeds  accumulate sinapoylglucose instead of sinapoylcholine, and have increased levels  of choline and decreased activity of the enzyme sinapoylglucose:choline  sinapoyltransferase (SCT). Cloning of the SNG2 gene by a combination of map-based  and candidate gene approaches demonstrates that SCT is another member of the  growing class of SCPL acyltransferases involved in plant secondary metabolism.', '2001 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01123.x', 'Chapple']
