As an adaptive innovation in plant terrestrialization, cuticle covers the plant surface and greatly contributes to the development and stress tolerance in land plants. Although past decades have seen great progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of cuticle biosynthesis in flowering plants with the contribution of cuticle biosynthesis mutants and advanced cuticle composition profiling techniques, origins and evolution of cuticle biosynthesis are poorly understood. Recent chemical, phylogenomic, and molecular genetic studies on cuticle biosynthesis in early-diverging extant land plant lineages, the bryophytes, shed novel light on the origins and evolution of plant cuticle biosynthesis. In this mini-review, we highlighted these recent advances in the molecular biology of cuticle biosynthesis in bryophytes, and provided evolutionary insights into plant cuticle biosynthesis.
