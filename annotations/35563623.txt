Maize (<i>Zea</i><i>mays</i> L.) is an essential food crop worldwide, but it is highly susceptible to salt stress, especially at the seedling stage. In this study, we conducted physiological and comparative transcriptome analyses of seedlings of maize inbred lines An'nong876 paternal (cmh15) and An'nong876 maternal (CM37) under salt stress. The cmh15 seedlings were more salt-tolerant and had higher relative water content, lower electrolyte leakage, and lower malondialdehyde levels in the leaves than CM37. We identified 2559 upregulated and 1770 downregulated genes between salt-treated CM37 and the controls, and 2757 upregulated and 2634 downregulated genes between salt-treated cmh15 and the controls by RNA sequencing analysis. Gene ontology functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that photosynthesis-related and oxidation-reduction processes were deeply involved in the responses of cmh15 and CM37 to salt stress. We also found differences in the hormone signaling pathway transduction and regulation patterns of transcription factors encoded by the differentially expressed genes in both cmh15 and CM37 under salt stress. Together, our findings provide insights into the molecular networks that mediate salt stress tolerance of maize at the seedling stage.
