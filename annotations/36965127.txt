Amylose content (AC) is the main factor determining the palatability, viscosity, transparency, and digestibility of rice (Oryza sativa) grains. AC in rice grains is mainly controlled by different alleles of the Waxy (Wx) gene. The AP2/EREBP transcription factor OsEBP89 interacts with the MYC-like protein OsBP5 to synergistically regulate the expression of Wx. Here, we determined that the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 5 (OsGSK5, also named SHAGGY-like kinase 41 [OsSK41]) inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of OsEBP89 in rice grains during amylose biosynthesis. The loss of OsSK41 function enhanced Wx expression and increased AC in rice grains. By contrast, the loss of function of OsEBP89 reduced Wx expression and decreased AC in rice grains. OsSK41 interacts with OsEBP89 and phosphorylates four of its sites (Thr-28, Thr-30, Ser-238, and Thr-257), which makes OsEBP89 unstable and attenuates its interaction with OsBP5. Wx promoter activity was relatively weak when regulated by the phosphomimic variant OsEBP89<sup>E</sup> -OsBP5 but relatively strong when regulated by the nonphosphorylatable variant OsEBP89<sup>A</sup> -OsBP5. Therefore, OsSK41-mediated phosphorylation of OsEBP89 represents an additional layer of complexity in the regulation of amylose biosynthesis during rice grain development. In addition, our findings provide four possible sites for regulating rice grain AC via precise gene editing.
