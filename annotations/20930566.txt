Transition to the flowering stage is precisely controlled by a few classes of regulatory molecules. BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT) is a member of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) family, an important class of flower development regulators with unidentified biochemical function. BFT has a TFL1-like activity and plays a role in axillary inflorescence development. To elucidate the expression pattern of BFT, we analyzed the subcellular localization and conditional expression of BFT in this study. We generated 35S::BFT:GFP plants to investigate the subcellular localization of BFT protein. 35S::BFT:GFP plants showed late flowering, similarly as did 35S::BFT plants. BFT:GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus and the plasma membrane, which was different from the localization pattern of FT and TFL1. BFT expression was induced by abiotic stress conditions. ABA, drought, and osmotic stress treatments induced BFT expression, whereas cold, salt, and heat stress conditions did not, suggesting that BFT plays a role in regulating flowering time and inflorescence structure under drought conditions. The induction pattern of BFT was different from those of other FT/TFL1 family genes. Our studies indicated that BFT showed a distinct expression pattern from its homologous genes during the vegetative growth in Arabidopsis.
