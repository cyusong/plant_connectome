Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is an important primary metabolite of plants that functions as an antioxidant, an enzyme cofactor, and a cell-signalling modulator in a wide array of crucial physiological processes, including biosynthesis of the cell wall, secondary metabolites and phytohormones, stress resistance, photoprotection, cell division, and growth. Plants synthesize ascorbic acid via de novo and salvage pathways, but the regulation of its biosynthesis and the mechanisms behind ascorbate homeostasis are largely unknown. Jasmonic acid and its methyl ester (jasmonates) mediate plant responses to many biotic and abiotic stresses by triggering a transcriptional reprogramming that allows cells to cope with pathogens and stress. By using 14C-mannose radiolabelling combined with HPLC and transcript profiling analysis, it is shown that methyl jasmonate treatment increases the de novo synthesis of ascorbic acid in Arabidopsis and tobacco Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) suspension cells. In BY-2 cells, this stimulation coincides with enhanced transcription of at least two late methyl jasmonate-responsive genes encoding enzymes for vitamin C biosynthesis: the GDP-mannose 3'',5''-epimerase and a putative L-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase/oxidase. As far as is known, this is the first report of a hormonal regulation of vitamin C biosynthesis in plants. Finally, the role of ascorbic acid in jasmonate-regulated stress responses is reviewed.
