['34799443', 'Stomatal pores close rapidly in response to low-air-humidity-induced leaf-to-air  vapor pressure difference (VPD) increases, thereby reducing excessive water loss.  The hydroactive signal-transduction mechanisms mediating high VPD-induced  stomatal closure remain largely unknown. The kinetics of stomatal high-VPD  responses were investigated by using time-resolved gas-exchange analyses of  higher-order mutants in guard-cell signal-transduction branches. We show that the  slow-type anion channel SLAC1 plays a relatively more substantial role than the  rapid-type anion channel ALMT12/QUAC1 in stomatal VPD signaling. VPD-induced  stomatal closure is not affected in mpk12/mpk4GC double mutants that completely  disrupt stomatal CO(2) signaling, indicating that VPD signaling is independent of  the early CO(2) signal-transduction pathway. Calcium imaging shows that osmotic  stress causes cytoplasmic Ca(2+) transients in guard cells. Nevertheless,  osca1-2/1.3/2.2/2.3/3.1 Ca(2+)-permeable channel quintuple, osca1.3/1.7-channel  double, cngc5/6-channel double, cngc20-channel single, cngc19/20crispr-channel  double, glr3.2/3.3-channel double, cpk-kinase quintuple, cbl1/4/5/8/9 quintuple,  and cbl2/3rf double mutants showed wild-type-like stomatal VPD responses. A  B3-family Raf-like mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase kinase kinase,  M3Kdelta5/RAF6, activates the OST1/SnRK2.6 kinase in plant cells. Interestingly, B3  Raf-kinase m3kdelta5 and m3kdelta1/delta5/delta6/delta7 (raf3/6/5/4) quadruple mutants, but not a  14-gene raf-kinase mutant including osmotic stress-linked B4-family Raf-kinases,  exhibited slowed high-VPD responses, suggesting that B3-family Raf-kinases play  an important role in stomatal VPD signaling. Moreover, high VPD-induced stomatal  closure was impaired in receptor-like pseudokinase GUARD CELL HYDROGEN  PEROXIDE-RESISTANT1 (GHR1) mutant alleles. Notably, the classical transient  "wrong-way" VPD response was absent in ghr1 mutant alleles. These findings reveal  genes and signaling mechanisms in the elusive high VPD-induced stomatal closing  response pathway.', '2021 Nov 23', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2107280118', 'Schroeder']
