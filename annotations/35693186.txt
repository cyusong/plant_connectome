Sugarcane (<i>Saccharum</i> spp.) is an efficient crop mainly used for sugar and bioethanol production. High yield and high sucrose of sugarcane are always the fundamental demands in sugarcane growth worldwide. Leaf angle and size of sugarcane can be attributed to planting density, which was associated with yield. In this study, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with a panel of 216 sugarcane core parents and their derived lines (natural population) to determine the genetic basis of leaf angle and key candidate genes with +2, +3, and +4 leaf at the seedling, elongation, and mature stages. A total of 288 significantly associated loci of sugarcane leaf angle at different developmental stages (eight phenotypes) were identified by GWAS with 4,027,298 high-quality SNP markers. Among them, one key locus and 11 loci were identified in all three stages and two stages, respectively. An InDel marker (SNP Ss6A_102766953) linked to narrow leaf angle was obtained. Overall, 4,089 genes were located in the confidence interval of significant loci, among which 3,892 genes were functionally annotated. Finally, 13 core parents and their derivatives tagged with SNPs were selected for marker-assisted selection (MAS). These candidate genes are mainly related to MYB transcription factors, auxin response factors, serine/threonine protein kinases, etc. They are directly or indirectly associated with leaf angle in sugarcane. This research provided a large number of novel genetic resources for the improvement of leaf angles and simultaneously to high yield and high bioethanol production.
