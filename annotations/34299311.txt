Aquaporins (AQPs) are essential membrane proteins involved in seed maturation and germination, stomata movement, photosynthesis, and regulation of plant flowering processes. Pitaya flowers are open at night and wither at daybreak, which shows an obvious circadian rhythm. In this study, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of <i>AQPs</i> in <i>Hylocereus undantus</i> was conducted to screen key genes associated with flowering processes. A total of 33 <i>HuAQP</i> genes were identified from the <i>H. undantus</i> genome. The 33 <i>HuAQPs</i> were grouped into four subfamilies: 10 PIPs, 13 TIPs, 8 NIPs, and 2 SIPs, which were distributed on 9 out of 11 pitaya chromosomes (Chr) (except for Chr7 and Chr10). Results from expression profiles showed that <i>HuNIP6;1</i> may be involved in pitaya's floral opening. <i>HuNIP6;1</i> was localized exclusively in the cell membrane. Overexpression of <i>HuNIP6;1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> significantly promoted early flowering through regulating negative flowering regulators of <i>MJM30</i>, <i>COL9</i>, and <i>PRR5</i>, suggesting that <i>HuNIP6;1</i> plays key roles in regulating flowering time. The present study provides the first genome-wide analysis of the <i>AQP</i> gene family in pitaya and valuable information for utilization of <i>HuAQPs</i>.
