Orange protein (OR) is known to interact with phytoene synthase (PSY) that commits the first step in carotenoid biosynthesis, and functions as a major post-transcriptional regulator on PSY. We here tried to reveal enzymatic characteristics of OR, that is, protein disulfide reductase (PDR) activity of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> OR protein (AtOR) was analyzed using dieosin glutathione disulfide (Di-E-GSSG) as a substrate. The AtOR part containing only the zinc (Zn)-finger motif was found to show PDR activity, with an apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 12,632 nM, <i>K</i><sub>cat</sub> of 11.85 min<sup>-1</sup>, and <i>K</i><sub>cat</sub><i>K</i><sub>m</sub><sup>-1</sup> of 15.6 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>. To evaluate the significance of the N-terminal region of AtOR, we examined the kinetic parameters of a fusion protein composed of the N-terminal region and the Zn-finger motif from AtOR. Consequently, the fusion protein had lower values for <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> (2,074 nM) and <i>K</i><sub>cat</sub> (3.18 min<sup>-1</sup>) and higher catalytic efficiency (25.9 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>) than that of only the Zn-finger motif part, suggesting that the N-terminal region of AtOR should be important for substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of PDR activity. Complementation experiments with <i>E. coli</i> further demonstrated that AtOR containing the N-terminal region and the Zn-finger motif increases phytoene synthase activity of AtPSY especially under reduced circumstances retaining a NADPH- and H<sup>+</sup>-regeneration system.
