Rates of hybridization vary among angiosperm taxa. Among-taxon variation in hybridization rate has been used to compare the importance of pre- and post-zygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms. Variation in rates of hybridization within a single-species pair would suggest that local conditions also affect reproductive isolation within a single taxonomic context. In this study, contact sites of Ipomopsis aggregata-Ipomopsis tenuituba were surveyed for variation in frequency of hybrids, and spatial structure. Floral morphology was used to identify parent species and hybrids in seven contact sites in the western Rocky Mountains, USA. Contact sites varied widely in elevational range, the degree to which morphological variation was clinal rather than mosaic and the frequency of hybrids. Two sites provided a strong contrast between a clinal, unimodal site and a mosaic, bimodal site. This natural variation among contact sites of the same species pair provides an opportunity to assess the effect of local ecological conditions and spatial structure of parent populations on reproductive isolation, while controlling for between-taxon variation.
