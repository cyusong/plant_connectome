Plant responses to pathogen attacks and high-temperature stress (HTS) are distinct in nature but generally share several signaling components. How plants produce specific responses through these common signaling intermediates remains elusive. With the help of reverse-genetics approaches, we describe here the mechanism underlying trade-offs in pepper (Capsicum annuum) between growth, immunity, and thermotolerance. The NAC-type transcription factor CaNAC2c was induced by HTS and Ralstonia solanacearum infection (RSI). CaNAC2c-inhibited pepper growth, promoted immunity against RSI by activating jasmonate-mediated immunity and H2O2 accumulation, and promoted HTS responses by activating Heat shock factor A5 (CaHSFA5) transcription and blocking H2O2 accumulation. We show that CaNAC2c physically interacts with CaHSP70 and CaNAC029 in a context-specific manner. Upon HTS, CaNAC2c-CaHSP70 interaction in the nucleus protected CaNAC2c from degradation and resulted in the activation of thermotolerance by increasing CaNAC2c binding and transcriptional activation of its target promoters. CaNAC2c did not induce immunity-related genes under HTS, likely due to the degradation of CaNAC029 by the 26S proteasome. Upon RSI, CaNAC2c interacted with CaNAC029 in the nucleus and activated jasmonate-mediated immunity but was prevented from activating thermotolerance-related genes. In non-stressed plants, CaNAC2c was tethered outside the nucleus by interaction with CaHSP70, and thus was unable to activate either immunity or thermotolerance. Our results indicate that pepper growth, immunity, and thermotolerance are coordinately and tightly regulated by CaNAC2c via its inducible expression and differential interaction with CaHSP70 and CaNAC029.
