The specificity between pathotypes of <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> and genera of gramineous plants is governed by gene-for-gene interactions. Here, we show that avirulence genes involved in this host specificity have undergone different modes of functional losses dependent on or affected by genomic compartments harboring them. The avirulence of an <i>Eleusine</i> pathotype on wheat is controlled by five genes, including <i>PWT3</i>, which played a key role in the evolution of the <i>Triticum</i> pathotype (the wheat blast fungus). We cloned another gene using an association of its presence or absence with pathotypes and designated it as <i>PWT6. PWT6</i> was widely distributed in a lineage composed of <i>Eleusine</i> and <i>Eragrostis</i> isolates but was completely absent in a lineage composed of <i>Lolium</i> and <i>Triticum</i> isolates. On the other hand, <i>PWT3</i> homologs were present in all isolates, and their loss of function in <i>Triticum</i> isolates was caused by insertions of transposable elements or nucleotide substitutions. Analyses of whole-genome sequences of representative isolates revealed that these two genes were located in different genomic compartments; <i>PWT6</i> was located in a repeat-rich region, while <i>PWT3</i> was located in a repeat-poor region. These results suggest that the course of differentiation of the pathotypes in <i>P. oryzae</i> appears to be illustrated as processes of functional losses of avirulence genes but that modes of the losses are affected by genomic compartments in which they reside.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
