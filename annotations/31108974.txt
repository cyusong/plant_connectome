Soil salinity represents a major constraint in the growth of chrysanthemum. Therefore, improving salinity tolerance of chrysanthemum has become an important research direction in tolerance breeding. Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is an evolutionarily highly conserved transcriptional co-activator in archaea and eukaryotes and has been reported to play important roles to respond to abiotic stresses. Here, a MBF1 gene induced by salt stress was isolated and functionally characterized from <i>Dendranthema grandiflorum</i> and name as <i>DgMBF1</i>. Overexpression of <i>DgMBF1</i> in chrysanthemum increased the tolerance of plants to high salt stress compared to wild type (WT). It also showed fewer accumulations of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), higher activities of antioxidant enzymes, more content of proline and soluble sugar (SS) and more favorable K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio than those of WT under salt stress. In addition, the expression level of genes related to antioxidant biosynthesis, proline biosynthesis, glyco-metabolism and K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis was statistically significant higher in the <i>DgMBF1</i>-overexpressed lines than that in WT. These results demonstrated that <i>DgMBF1</i> is a positive regulator in response to salt stress and could serve as a new candidate gene for salt-tolerant plant breeding.
