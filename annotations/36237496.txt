Salinity severely inhibits growth and reduces yield of salt-sensitive plants like wheat, and this effect can be alleviated by plant growth regulators and phytohormones, among which abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in response to various stressful environments. ABA is highly photosensitive to light disruption, which this limits its application. Here, based on pyrabactin (a synthetic ABA agonist), we designed and synthesized a functional analog of ABA and named B2, then evaluated its role in salt resistance using winter wheat seedlings. The phenotypes showed that B2 significantly improved the salt tolerance of winter wheat seedlings by elevating the biomass. The physiological analysis found that B2 treatment reduced the generation rate of O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>, electrolyte leakage, the content of proline, and the accumulation of malonaldehyde (MDA) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and also significantly increased the contents of endogenous hormones zeatin riboside (ZA) and gibberellic acid (GA). Further biochemical analysis revealed that the activities of various antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), were enhanced by B2, and the activities of antioxidase isozymes SOD3, POD1/2, and APX1/2 were particularly increased, largely resembling ABA treatment. The abiotic stress response-related gene <i>TaSOS1</i> was significantly upregulated by B2, while the <i>TaTIP2;2</i> gene was suppressed. In conclusion, an ABA analog B2 was capable to enhance salt stress tolerance in winter wheat seedlings by stimulating the antioxidant system, providing a novel regulator for better survival of crops in saline soils and improving crop yield.
