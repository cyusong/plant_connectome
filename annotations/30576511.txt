Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived phytohormones that are known to influence various aspects of plant growth and development. As root-derived signals, SLs can enhance symbiosis between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, little is known about the roles of SLs in plant defense against soil-borne pathogens. Here, we determined that infection with root-knot nematodes (RKNs; Meloidogyne incognita) induced SL biosynthesis in roots of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Silencing of SL biosynthesis genes compromised plant defense against RKNs, whilst application of the SL analog racGR24 enhanced it. Accumulation of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the roots in response to RKN infection was enhanced by silencing of SL biosynthetic genes and was suppressed by application of racGR24. Genetic evidence showed that JA was a positive regulator of defense against RKNs while ABA was a negative regulator. In addition, racGR24 enhanced the defense against nematode in a JA-deficient mutant but not in an ABA-deficient mutant. Silencing of SL biosynthetic genes resulted in up-regulation of MYC2, which negatively regulated defense against RKNs. Our results demonstrate that SLs play a positive role in nematode defense in tomato and that MYC2 negatively regulates this defense, potentially by mediating hormone crosstalk among SLs, ABA and JA.
