['27479325', 'Classical hormone receptors reversibly and non-covalently bind active hormone  molecules, which are generated by biosynthetic enzymes, to trigger signal  transduction. The alpha/beta hydrolase DWARF14 (D14), which hydrolyses the plant  branching hormone strigolactone and interacts with the F-box protein D3/MAX2, is  probably involved in strigolactone detection. However, the active form of  strigolactone has yet to be identified and it is unclear which protein directly  binds the active form of strigolactone, and in which manner, to act as the  genuine strigolactone receptor. Here we report the crystal structure of the  strigolactone-induced AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex, reveal that Arabidopsis thaliana  (At)D14 undergoes an open-to-closed state transition to trigger strigolactone  signalling, and demonstrate that strigolactone is hydrolysed into a covalently  linked intermediate molecule (CLIM) to initiate a conformational change of AtD14  to facilitate interaction with D3. Notably, analyses of a highly branched  Arabidopsis mutant d14-5 show that the AtD14(G158E) mutant maintains enzyme  activity to hydrolyse strigolactone, but fails to efficiently interact with  D3/MAX2 and loses the ability to act as a receptor that triggers strigolactone  signalling in planta. These findings uncover a mechanism underlying the  allosteric activation of AtD14 by strigolactone hydrolysis into CLIM, and define  AtD14 as a non-canonical hormone receptor with dual functions to generate and  sense the active form of strigolactone.', '2016 Aug 25', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature19073', 'Xie']
