Apomixis in <i>Hieracium praealtum</i> follows a developmental pathway of apospory, where an unreduced embryo sac develops from a somatic ovule cell without meiosis. The avoidance of meiosis together with fertilization-independent seed formation leads to clonal progeny genetically identical to the maternal plant. We have previously described the initial developmental steps of aposporous embryo sac formation in <i>H. praealtum</i> and here, we cytologically observed more than 500 ovules with a focus on the later stages of embryo sac maturation. Aposporous embryo sac maturation is a stochastic process in <i>H. praealtum</i> with single or multiple embryo sacs formed, in addition to off-types and embryo sac abortion. The frequency of twin embryo sacs growing at the same rate is a rare event and, in most ovules, the additional embryo sac undergoes developmental arrest suggesting dominance or growth promotion of a single embryo sac. Observed deviations from the <i>Polygonum</i>-type embryo sac in <i>H. praealtum</i> indicate developmental plasticity during embryo sac maturation. Nevertheless, fertilization-independent seed formation successfully occurs.
