Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles found in most types of cells in the tissues of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants, as well as in bacteria and yeast. They differ from other organelles in binding a unique complement of proteins and lacking an aqueous core but share aspects of protein trafficking with secretory membrane compartments. In this minireview, we focus on recent evidence supporting an endoplasmic reticulum origin for LD formation and discuss recent findings regarding LD maturation and fusion.
