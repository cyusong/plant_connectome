Plant peroxisomes function collaboratively with other subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts and mitochondria, in several metabolic processes. To comprehensively investigate the impact of peroxisomal function on photosynthesis, especially under conditions that are more relevant to natural environments, a systematic screen of over 150 Arabidopsis mutants of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins was conducted using the automated Dynamic Environment Photosynthesis Imager (DEPI). Dynamic and high-light (HL) conditions triggered significant photosynthetic defects in a subset of the mutants, including those of photorespiration (PR) and other peroxisomal processes, some of which may also be related to PR. Further analysis of the PR mutants revealed activation of cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I and higher accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) under HL conditions. We hypothesize that impaired PR disturbs the balance of ATP and NADPH, leading to the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> that activates CEF to produce ATP to compensate for the imbalance of reducing equivalents. The identification of peroxisomal mutants involved in PR and other peroxisomal functions in the photometric screen will enable further investigation of regulatory links between photosynthesis and PR and interorganellar interaction at the mechanistic level.
