Many species of rhizobial bacteria can invade their plant hosts and induce development of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing nodules only if they are able to produce an acidic exopolysaccharide (EPS) with certain structural and molecular weight characteristics.1-3Sinorhizobium meliloti that produces the functional form of the exopolysaccharide succinoglycan induces formation of invasion structures called infection threads in the root hair cells of its plant hosts alfalfa and Medicago truncatula. However, S. meliloti mutants that cannot produce succinoglycan are not able to induce infection thread formation, resulting in an early arrest of nodule development and in nitrogen starvation of the plant. Mounting evidence has suggested that succinoglycan acts as a signal to these host plants to permit the entry of S. meliloti. Now, our microarray screen and functional category analysis of differentially-expressed genes show that M. truncatula plants inoculated with wild type S. meliloti receive a signal to increase their translation capacity, alter their metabolic activity and prepare for invasion, while those inoculated with a succinoglycan-deficient mutant do not receive this signal, and also more strongly express plant defense genes.

Sinorhizobium meliloti: !produces! succinoglycan 
succinoglycan: !signals! M. truncatula 
M. truncatula: !increases translation capacity! in response to signal 
M. truncatula: !alters metabolic activity! in response to signal 
M. truncatula: !prepares for invasion! in response to signal 
succinoglycan-deficient mutant: !does not signal! M. truncatula 
M. truncatula: !expresses plant defense genes! in response to lack of signal
