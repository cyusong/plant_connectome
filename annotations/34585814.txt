Whole genome duplication (WGD) in plants is typically followed by genomic downsizing, where large portions of the new genome are lost. Whether this downsizing is accompanied by increased or decreased evolutionary rates of the remaining genes is poorly known, not least because homeolog pairings are often obscured by chromosomal rearrangement. Here, we use the newly published genome from a sedge, namely Kobresia littledalei, and CRISPR/Cas-9 editing to investigate how the Rho WGD event 70 million years ago (MYA) affected transcription factor evolutionary rates, fates, and function in rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). We focus on the 30-member DNA-binding with one zinc finger (Dof) transcription factor family in both crops due to their agronomic importance. Using the known speciation dates of rice from Kobresia (97 MYA) and sorghum (50 MYA), we find that rates of amino acid substitution in the critical Dof domain region were over twofold higher during the 20-million-year period following the WGD than before or afterward. Through comparison of synteny blocks, we report that at least 11% of Dof genes were purged from 70 to 50 MYA, while only 6% have been lost in the most recent 50-million-year interval. CRISPR/Cas9 editing revealed widespread fitness-related defects in flowering and lack of redundancy of paired members, as well as significant differences in expression between gene pairs. Together these findings demonstrate the strength of Dof genes as a model for deep evolutionary study and offer one of the most detailed portraits yet of the Rho WGD impact on a gene lineage.
