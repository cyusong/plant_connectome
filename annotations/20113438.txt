['20113438', 'Iron-deficiency responses comprise molecular, physiological and developmental  adjustments, ultimately leading to an improved cellular Fe homeostasis. By using  a proteomic approach, we identified the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 as  being highly responsive to the Fe regime at the post-transcriptional level in the  tips of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) roots. UBC13 has been shown to catalyze  non-canonical Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, playing important roles in signal  transduction among eukaryotes. Ectopic expression of the cucumber UBC13 gene in  Arabidopsis thaliana led to a more pronounced and Fe-responsive formation of  branched root hairs, a key response of Arabidopsis roots to Fe deficiency. Plants  carrying a mutation in the Arabidopsis ortholog UBC13A were unable to form  branched root hairs upon Fe deficiency and showed a perturbed expression of  Fe-regulated genes. Mutants defective in both Arabidopsis UBC13 genes, UBC13A and  UBC13B, showed a marked reduction in root hair density. Mutations in the cognate  E3 ligases RGLG2 and RGLG1 caused the constitutive formation of branched root  hairs independent of the Fe supply, indicating the involvement of  polyubiquitination in the altered differentiation of rhizodermal cells. It is  concluded that UBC13, probably via the formation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin  chains, has a critical function in epidermal cell differentiation and is crucial  for the regulation of Fe-responsive genes and developmental responses to Fe  deficiency.', '2010 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04150.x', 'Schmidt']
