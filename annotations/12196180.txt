['12196180', 'Copper chaperones, soluble copper-binding proteins, are essential for ensuring  proper distribution of copper to cellular compartments and to proteins requiring  copper prosthetic groups. They are found in all eukaryotic organisms. Orthologues  of the three copper chaperones characterized in yeast, ATX1, CCS and COX17, are  present in Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants are faced with unique challenges to  maintain metal homoeostasis, and thus their copper chaperones have evolved by  diversifying and gaining additional functions. In this paper we present our  current knowledge of copper chaperones in A. thaliana based on the information  available from the complete sequence of its genome.', '2002 Aug', 'Biochem Soc Trans', '10.1042/bst0300732', 'Vulpe']
