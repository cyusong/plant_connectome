Cold damage is one of the most important environmental factors influencing crop growth, development, and production. In this study, we generated a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs), Towada and ZL31, and Towada showed more cold sensitivity than ZL31 in the rice seedling stage. To explore the transcriptional regulation mechanism and the reason for phenotypic divergence of the two lines in response to cold stress, an in-depth comparative transcriptome study under cold stress was carried out. Our analysis uncovered that rapid and high-amplitude transcriptional reprogramming occurred in the early stage of cold treatment. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that genes of the response to stress, environmental adaptation, signal transduction, metabolism, photosynthesis, and the MAPK signaling pathway might form the main part of the engine for transcriptional reprogramming in response to cold stress. Furthermore, we identified four core genes, <i>OsWRKY24</i>, <i>OsCAT2</i>, <i>OsJAZ9,</i> and <i>OsRR6,</i> that were potential candidates affecting the cold sensitivity of Towada and ZL31. Genome re-sequencing analysis between the two lines revealed that only <i>OsWRKY24</i> contained sequence variations which may change its transcript abundance. Our study not only provides novel insights into the cold-related transcriptional reprogramming process, but also highlights the potential candidates involved in cold stress.
