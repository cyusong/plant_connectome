The root systems of plants have developed adaptive architectures to exploit soil resources. The formation of lateral roots (LRs) contributes to root system architecture. Roots of plants with a lower cytokinin status form LR primordia (LRP) in unusually close proximity, indicating a role for the hormone in regulating the positioning of LRs along the main root axis. Data obtained from cytokinin-synthesis mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana combined with gene expression analysis indicate that cytokinin synthesis by IPT5 and LOG4 occurring early during LRP initiation generates a local cytokinin signal abbreviating LRP formation in neighbouring pericycle cells. In addition, IPT3, IPT5, and IPT7 contribute to cytokinin synthesis in the vicinity of existing LRP, thus suppressing initiation of new LRs. Interestingly, mutation of CYP735A genes required for trans-zeatin biosynthesis caused strong defects in LR positioning, indicating an important role for this cytokinin metabolite in regulating LR spacing. Further it is shown that cytokinin and a known regulator of LR spacing, the receptor-like kinase ARABIDOPSIS CRINKLY4 (ACR4), operate in a non-hierarchical manner but might exert reciprocal control at the transcript level. Taken together, the results suggest that cytokinin acts as a paracrine hormonal signal in regulating root system architecture.
