Tomato is an important crop for its high nutritional and medicinal properties. The role of salicylic acid (SA) in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS), sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHX1), salt overly sensitive 1 (sos1) and high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter (HKT1;2) transcripts, and ACS enzyme activity and ethylene (ET) production, and growth and physiological attributes was evaluated in tomato cv. Pusa Ruby under salinity stress. Thirty days-old seedlings treated with 0 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaCl plus 100 µM SA were assessed for different growth and physiological parameters at 45 DAS. Results showed ACS, NHX1, sos1 and HKT1;2 transcripts were significantly changed in SA treated plants. The ACS enzyme activity and ET content were considerably decreased in SA treated plants. Shoot length (SL), root length (RL), number of leaves (NL), leaf area per plant (LA), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and root fresh weight (RFW) were also improved under SA treatment. Conversely, the electrolyte leakage and sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) content were significantly reduced in SA treated plants. In addition, the endogenous proline and potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) content, and K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio were considerably increased under SA treatment. Likewise, antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX and GR) profile were better in SA treated plant. The present findings suggest that SA reverse the negative effects of salinity stress and stress induced ET production by modulating ACS, NHX, sos1 and HKT1;2 transcript level, and improving various growth and physiological parameters, and antioxidants enzymes profile. This will contribute to a better understanding of salinity stress tolerance mechanisms of tomato plants involving SA and ET cross talk and ions homeostasis to develop more tolerant plant.
