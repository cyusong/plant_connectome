Inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability is a major factor determining growth and consequently the productivity of crops. However, it is one of the least available macronutrients due to its high fixation in the rhizospheres. To overcome this constraint, plants have developed adaptive responses to better acquire, utilize, and recycle Pi. Molecular determinants of these adaptive mechanisms include transcription factors (TFs) that play a major role in transcriptional control, thereby regulating genome-scale networks. In this study, we have characterized the biological role of Arabidopsis thaliana Ethylene Response Factor070 (AtERF070), a Pi starvation-induced TF belonging to the Apetala2/Ethylene Response Factor family of TFs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). It is localized to the nucleus and induced specifically in Pi-deprived roots and shoots. RNA interference-mediated suppression of AtERF070 led to augmented lateral root development resulting in higher Pi accumulation, whereas there were reductions in both primary root length and lateral root number in 12-d-old transgenic seedlings overexpressing AtERF070. When the overexpressing lines were grown to maturity under greenhouse conditions, they revealed a stunted bushy appearance that could be rescued by gibberellic acid application. Furthermore, a number of Pi starvation-responsive genes were modulated in AtERF070-overexpressing and RNA interference lines, thereby suggesting a potential role for this TF in maintaining Pi homeostasis.
