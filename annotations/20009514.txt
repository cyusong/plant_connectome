Plants exposed to abiotic stress show a range of morphogenetic responses, sometimes termed the stress-induced morphogenetic response (SIMR). SIMR is principally composed of three components: inhibition of cell elongation, alterations in cell differentiation, and stimulus of cell division in localized areas. An explanation proposed for SIMR has been increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alterations in hormone signaling. Mutations in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1)</i> gene have altered abiotic stress responses and ROS accumulation. Even in the absence of exogenous stress, these plants show many morphological changes also seen in SIMR. In the September issue of <i>Plant Physiology</i> we reported an in depth analysis of the phenotype of <i>rcd1-3</i> plants as well as the phenotype of a mutations in the previously uncharacterized paralog of <i>RCD1, SIMILAR TO RCD ONE1 (SRO1). sro1-1</i> plants have mild morphological changes and abiotic stress response defects while <i>rcd1-3; sro1-1</i> double mutant plants have severe developmental defects, including less cell elongation. In this Addendum, we hypothesize that <i>rcd1, sro1</i> and <i>rcd1; sro1</i> mutant plants are under constitutive stress, and that this stress is responsible for at least some of the developmental defects seen in these plants.
