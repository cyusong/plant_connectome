['18705666', 'Leaf senescence is a form of programmed cell death, and involves regulated  expression of a specific set of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). In  Arabidopsis, three UBA2 genes, UBA2a, UBA2b, and UBA2c, encode heterogeneous  nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-type RNA-binding proteins. Previously, it has  been demonstrated that expression of UBA2 genes is induced by mechanical wounding  in a splice variant-dependent manner. Constitutive overexpression of the UBA2  genes proved lethal. Accordingly, a conditional gain-of-function system was used  here to assess phenotypes related to UBA2 overexpression. Overexpression of each  of the three UBA2 genes leads to a leaf yellowing/cell death-like phenotype in  Arabidopsis plants. Expression levels of a number of SAGs, such as SAG13, SAG14,  SAG15, SAG101, WRKY6, WRKY53, WRKY70, ACS2, ACS6, CML38 and SIRK, were elevated  upon induction of UBA2 overexpression, as were transcripts of multiple wounding-  and defense-related genes, including EDS1, CK1, JR1, WR3 and MPK3. Elevated  ethylene biosynthesis and hypersensitive-like patterns of cell death and callose  deposition, shown by Trypan blue and aniline blue staining, respectively, were  also observed following induced overexpression of UBA2a, UBA2b, and UBA2c. These  results indicate that induction of UBA2 gene expression stimulates leaf yellowing  and cell death phenotypes through senescence and defense response pathways.', '2008', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02557.x', 'Assmann']
