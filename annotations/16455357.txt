CENTRORADIALIS/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (CEN/TFL1) genes play an important role in the phase transition of plant flowering. Here we characterized the expression pattern of a CEN/TFL1-like gene, Ljcen1, from Lotus japonicus. Sequence analysis revealed that Ljcen1 shared 67-76% identity to its homologs from a variety of plant species. Ljcen1 transcripts could be detected at the young root tip and reproductive shoot apical meristem of L. japonicus. RNA in situ hybridization analysis revealed that Ljcen1 was continuously expressed in the sub-domain of the primary inflorescence meristem and transiently expressed in the secondary inflorescence meristem. The ectopic expression of Ljcen1 in Arabidopsis driven by double CaMV 35S promoter delayed the flowering. These results suggested that Ljcen1 gene was involved in a conserved CEN/TFL1 pathway that functions in phase transition of shoot apical meristem in L. japonicus.
