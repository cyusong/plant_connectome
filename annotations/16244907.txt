A sub-cellular proteomic approach was carried out to monitor membrane-associated protein modifications in response to the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Membrane proteins were extracted from Medicago truncatula roots either inoculated or not with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices. Comparative two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that 36 spots were differentially displayed in response to the fungal colonization including 15 proteins induced, 3 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated. Among them, seven proteins were found to be commonly down-regulated in AM-colonized and phosphate-fertilized roots. Twenty-five spots out of the 36 of interest could be identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight and/or tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Excepting an acid phosphatase and a lectin, none of them was previously reported as being regulated during AM symbiosis. In addition, this proteomic approach allowed us for the first time to identify AM fungal proteins in planta.
