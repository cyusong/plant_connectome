['16055687', 'Cation levels within the cytosol are coordinated by a network of transporters.  Here, we examine the functional roles of calcium exchanger 1 (CAX1), a vacuolar  H+/Ca2+ transporter, and the closely related transporter CAX3. We demonstrate  that like CAX1, CAX3 is also localized to the tonoplast. We show that CAX1 is  predominately expressed in leaves, while CAX3 is highly expressed in roots.  Previously, using a yeast assay, we demonstrated that an N-terminal truncation of  CAX1 functions as an H+/Ca2+ transporter. Here, we use the same yeast assay to  show that full-length CAX1 and full-length CAX3 can partially, but not fully,  suppress the Ca2+ hypersensitive yeast phenotype and coexpression of full-length  CAX1 and CAX3 conferred phenotypes not produced when either transporter was  expressed individually. In planta, CAX3 null alleles were modestly sensitive to  exogenous Ca2+ and also displayed a 22% reduction in vacuolar H+-ATPase activity.  cax1/cax3 double mutants displayed a severe reduction in growth, including leaf  tip and flower necrosis and pronounced sensitivity to exogenous Ca2+ and other  ions. These growth defects were partially suppressed by addition of exogenous  Mg2+. The double mutant displayed a 42% decrease in vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transport,  and a 47% decrease in H+-ATPase activity. While the ionome of cax1 and cax3 lines  were modestly perturbed, the cax1/cax3 lines displayed increased PO4(3-), Mn2+,  and Zn2+ and decreased Ca2+ and Mg2+ in shoot tissue. These findings suggest  synergistic function of CAX1 and CAX3 in plant growth and nutrient acquisition.', '2005 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.061218', 'Hirschi']
