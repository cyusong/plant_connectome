Duckweeds, plants of the Lemnaceae family, have the distinction of being the smallest angiosperms in the world with the fastest doubling time. Together with its naturally ability to thrive on abundant anthropogenic wastewater, these plants hold tremendous potential to helping solve critical water, climate and fuel issues facing our planet this century. With the conviction that rapid deployment and optimization of the duckweed platform for biomass production will depend on close integration between basic and applied research of these aquatic plants, the first International Conference on Duckweed Research and Applications (ICDRA) was organized and took place in Chengdu, China, from October 7th to 10th of 2011. Co-organized with Rutgers University of New Jersey (USA), this Conference attracted participants from Germany, Denmark, Japan, Australia, in addition to those from the US and China. The following are concise summaries of the various oral presentations and final discussions over the 2.5 day conference that serve to highlight current research interests and applied research that are paving the way for the imminent deployment of this novel aquatic crop. We believe the sharing of this information with the broad Plant Biology community is an important step toward the renaissance of this excellent plant model that will have important impact on our quest for sustainable development of the world.
