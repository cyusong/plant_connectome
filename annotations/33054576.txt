<i>Pyrenophora teres</i> is the causal agent of net blotch, the most devastating foliar disease of barley. In nature, net blotch is seen in two forms, net form net blotch, caused by <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>teres</i>, and spot form net blotch, caused by <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>maculata</i>. To date, 11 <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>teres</i> genomes have been sequenced and deposited in publicly available repositories, but only one <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>maculata</i> genome has been publicly deposited. Here, we present four additional reference-quality full-genome sequences of <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>maculata</i> isolates with good geographical and phenotypic diversity, with accompanying RNA sequencing-based genome annotations. These additional <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>maculata</i> genomes will aid in the understanding of the genomic complexities of this important barley pathogen.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
