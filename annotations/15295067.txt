['15295067', 'A 38-bp pollen-specific cis-acting region of the AVP1 gene is involved in the  expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana V-PPase during pollen development. Here,  we report the isolation and structural characterization of AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2,  novel transcription factors that bind to the 38-bp cis-acting region of A.  thaliana V-PPase gene, AVP1. AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 show 53% amino acid sequence  similarity. Homologs of AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 are found in various vascular plants as  well as a moss, Physcomitrella patens. Promoter-beta-glucuronidase reporter  analysis shows that AtVOZ1 is specifically expressed in the phloem tissue and  AtVOZ2 is strongly expressed in the root. In vivo transient effector-reporter  analysis in A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells demonstrates that AtVOZ1 and  AtVOZ2 function as transcriptional activators in the Arabidopsis cell. Two  conserved regions termed Domain-A and Domain-B were identified from an alignment  of AtVOZ proteins and their homologs of O. sativa and P. patens. AtVOZ2 binds as  a dimer to the specific palindromic sequence, GCGTNx7ACGC, with Domain-B, which  is comprised of a functional novel zinc coordinating motif and a conserved basic  region. Domain-B is shown to function as both the DNA-binding and the  dimerization domains of AtVOZ2. From highly the conservative nature among all  identified VOZ proteins, we conclude that Domain-B is responsible for the DNA  binding and dimerization of all VOZ-family proteins and designate it as the  VOZ-domain.', '2004 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pch101', 'Sato']
