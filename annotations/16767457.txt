We examined the changes in the orientation of cortical microtubules during the hypergravity-induced modification of growth anisotropy (inhibition of elongation growth and promotion of lateral growth) in azuki bean (Vigna angularis Ohwi et Ohashi) epicotyls. The percentage of cells with transverse microtubules was decreased, while that with longitudinal microtubules was increased, in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of gravity. The percentage of cells with longitudinal microtubules showed an increase within 0.5 h of transfer of the 1g-grown seedlings to a 300g-hypergravity condition. Lanthanum and gadolinium, blockers of calcium channels, nullified the modification of growth anisotropy and reorientation of microtubules by hypergravity. Horizontal and acropetal hypergravity modified growth anisotropy and reorientation of microtubules, as did basipetal hypergravity, and these changes were not seen in the presence of lanthanum or gadolinium. These results suggest that hypergravity changes activities of lanthanum- and gadolinium-sensitive calcium channels independently of its direction, which may lead to reorientation of cortical microtubules and modification of growth anisotropy in azuki bean epicotyls.
