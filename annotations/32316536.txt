To understand how the class 1 phytoglobin is involved in germination process via the modulation of the nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, we performed the analysis of physiological and molecular parameters in the embryos of transgenic barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L. cv Golden Promise) plants differing in expression levels of the phytoglobin (<i>Pgb1</i>) gene during the first 48 h of germination. Overexpression of <i>Pgb1</i> resulted in a higher rate of germination, higher protein content and higher ATP/ADP ratios. This was accompanied by a lower rate of NO emission after radicle protrusion, as compared to the wild type and downregulating line, and a lower rate of <i>S</i>-nitrosylation of proteins in the first hours postimbibition. The rate of fermentation estimated by the expression and activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was significantly higher in the <i>Pgb1</i> downregulating line, the same tendency was observed for nitrate reductase expression. The genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits were more actively expressed in embryos of the seeds overexpressing <i>Pgb1</i>. It is concluded that <i>Pgb1</i> expression in embryo is essential for the maintenance of redox and energy balance before radicle protrusion, when seeds experience low internal oxygen concentration and exerts the effect on metabolism during the initial development of seedlings.
