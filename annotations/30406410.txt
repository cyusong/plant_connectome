Detrimental pleiotropic effects of resistance mutation(s) were observed for multiple-resistant phenotypes (resistant to both atrazine and dicamba). The multiple-resistant phenotypes had lower growth rates and less capacity for vegetative growth compared to the phenotypes only resistant to atrazine. The fitness costs that are conferred by herbicide resistance alleles can affect the rate of herbicide resistance evolution within populations. We evaluated the direct fitness costs involved with multiple resistance to dicamba and atrazine (R1 and R2) in Chenopodium album by comparing the performance of multiple-resistant phenotypes to those phenotypes that were only resistant to atrazine (S1 and S2). The R1 and R2 phenotypes were consistently shorter and produced less dry matter than the S1 and S2 phenotypes. The R1 and R2 phenotypes were shown to have lower relative growth rates (RGR) and net assimilation rates (NAR) than the S1 and S2 phenotypes at an early stage of growth. However, there was no significant difference in RGR between the R1 and R2 and, S1 and S2 phenotypes at a later stage of growth, though the R1 and R2 phenotypes still had a lower NAR at this later stage. Further investigations using a neighbouring crop competition approach showed that the R1 and R2 phenotypes were weaker competitors, and exhibited significantly less capacity for vegetative growth compared to the S1 and S2 phenotypes during competition. Overall, the results of this study revealed multiple- resistance to atrazine and dicamba endowed a significant fitness penalty to C. album, and it is possible that the frequency of multiple-resistant individuals would gradually decline once selection pressure from herbicides was discontinued.
