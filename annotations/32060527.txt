As a plant hormone, salicylic acid (SA) plays essential roles in plant defense against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens. Significant progress has been made in understanding the SA biosynthesis pathways and SA-mediated defense signaling networks in the past two decades. Plant defense responses involve rapid and massive transcriptional reprogramming upon the recognition of pathogens. Plant transcription factors and their co-regulators are critical players in establishing a transcription regulatory network and boosting plant immunity. A multitude of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators have been discovered, and their roles in SA-mediated defense responses have been reported. However, our understanding of plant transcriptional networks is still limited. As such, novel genomic tools and bioinformatic techniques will be necessary if we are to fully understand the mechanisms behind plant immunity. Here, we discuss current knowledge, provide an update on the SA biosynthesis pathway, and describe the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of SA-mediated plant immune responses.
