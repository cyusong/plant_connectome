['21239645', 'Flowering plant reproduction requires precise delivery of the sperm cells to the  ovule by a pollen tube. Guidance signals from female cells are being identified;  however, how pollen responds to those cues is largely unknown. Here, we show that  two predicted cation/proton exchangers (CHX) in Arabidopsis thaliana, CHX21 and  CHX23, are essential for pollen tube guidance. Male fertility was unchanged in  single chx21 or chx23 mutants. However, fertility was impaired in chx21 chx23  double mutant pollen. Wild-type pistils pollinated with a limited number of  single and double mutant pollen producing 62% fewer seeds than those pollinated  with chx23 single mutant pollen, indicating that chx21 chx23 pollen is severely  compromised. Double mutant pollen grains germinated and grew tubes down the  transmitting tract, but the tubes failed to turn toward ovules. Furthermore,  chx21 chx23 pollen tubes failed to enter the micropyle of excised ovules. Green  fluorescent protein-tagged CHX23 driven by its native promoter was localized to  the endoplasmic reticulum of pollen tubes. CHX23 mediated K(+) transport, as  CHX23 expression in Escherichia coli increased K(+) uptake and growth in a  pH-dependent manner. We propose that by modifying localized cation balance and  pH, these transporters could affect steps in signal reception and/or transduction  that are critical to shifting the axis of polarity and directing pollen growth  toward the ovule.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.080499', 'Sze']
