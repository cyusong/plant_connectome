['19033528', 'Phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate 5-kinases produce phosphatidylinositol  (4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] and have been implicated in vesicle  trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Here, we adopted a reverse genetics  approach to investigate the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana pollen-expressed  gene encoding phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate 5-kinase 4 (PIP5K4). Pollen  germination, tube growth, and polarity were significantly impaired in homozygous  mutant plants lacking PIP5K4 transcript. In vitro, supplementation with  PtdIns(4,5)P(2) rescued these phenotypes. In vivo, mutant pollen fertilized  ovules, leading to normal seed set and silique length. However, fertilization  took longer than in wild-type plants, and the pip5k4 null mutant allele was  transmitted through the pollen at a reduced frequency. Analysis of endocytic  events using FM1-43 (or FM4-64) suggested a reduction in endocytosis and membrane  recycling in pip5k4 null mutant pollen tubes. Imaging of elongating tobacco  (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes transiently transformed with a PIP5K4-green  fluorescent protein fusion construct revealed that the protein localized to the  plasma membrane, particularly in the subapical region. Overexpression of  PIP5K4-GFP delocalized the protein to the apical region of the plasma membrane,  perturbed pollen tube growth, and caused apical cell wall thickening. Thus,  PIP5K4 plays a crucial role in regulating the polarity of pollen tubes. This  study supports a model for membrane secretion and recycling where the apical and  subapical regions appear to contain the components required to promote and  sustain growth.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.058826', 'Malho']
