Lincomycin (LIN)-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis in chloroplasts prevents the greening of seedlings, represses the activity of photosynthesis-related genes in the nucleus, including LHCB1.2, and induces the phenylpropanoid pathway, resulting in the production of anthocyanins. In genomes uncoupled (gun) mutants, LHCB1.2 expression is maintained in the presence of LIN or other inhibitors of early chloroplast development. In a screen using concentrations of LIN lower than those employed to isolate gun mutants, we have identified happy on lincomycin (holi) mutants. Several holi mutants show an increased tolerance to LIN, exhibiting de-repressed LHCB1.2 expression and chlorophyll synthesis in seedlings. The mutations responsible were identified by whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping, and most were found to affect the phenylpropanoid pathway; however, LHCB1.2 expression does not appear to be directly regulated by phenylpropanoids, as indicated by the metabolic profiling of mutants. The most potent holi mutant is defective in a subunit of cellulose synthase encoded by IRREGULAR XYLEM 3, and comparative analysis of this and other cell-wall mutants establishes a link between secondary cell-wall integrity and early chloroplast development, possibly involving altered ABA metabolism or sensing.
