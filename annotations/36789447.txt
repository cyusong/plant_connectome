Grapevine (Vitis ssp.) is a deciduous perennial fruit crop, and the canes and buds of grapevine should withstand low temperatures annually during winter. However, the widely cultivated Vitis vinifera is cold-sensitive and cannot survive the severe winter in regions with extremely low temperatures, such as viticulture regions in northern China. By contrast, a few wild Vitis species like V. amurensis and V. riparia exhibit excellent freezing tolerance. However, the mechanisms underlying grapevine cold tolerance remain largely unknown. In recent years, much progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms, owing to the advances in sequencing and molecular biotechnology. Assembly of grapevine genomes together with resequencing and transcriptome data enable researchers to conduct genomic and transcriptomic analyses in various grapevine genotypes and populations to explore genetic variations involved in cold tolerance. In addition, a number of pivotal genes have been identified and functionally characterized. In this review, we summarize recent major advances in physiological and molecular analyses of cold tolerance in grapevine and put forward questions in this field. We also discuss the strategies for improving the tolerance of grapevine to cold stress. Understanding grapevine cold tolerance will facilitate the development of grapevines for adaption to global climate change.
