Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are extracellular proteoglycans involved in plant growth and development. The addition of beta-D-glucosyl Yariv reagent (betaGlcY), a synthetic phenylglycoside that specifically reacts with AGPs, to the culture medium notably disturbed microspore embryogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. The initiation of microspore embryogenesis was clearly inhibited by 30 microM betaGlcY and completely inhibited by 50 microM betaGlcY. The transfer of microspore-derived embryos at different developmental stages into NLN6 medium containing 50 microM betaGlcY prohibited their normal development, as approximately 21.24, 43.99, and 59.73%, respectively, of the treated globular-, heart-, and torpedo-stage embryos exhibited numerous root hair-like structures. Both heart-stage and torpedo-stage embryos showed a rapid growth of roots with a large number of clustered root hairs. Some root hair-like structures were also observed on the apical portions of embryos. Microscopy of the treated embryos revealed that the basic patterns of cells at both the radial and apical-basal axes were greatly altered, such that the cells lost their ability to carry out programmed embryogenesis. These results show that the betaGlcY-AGP interaction modulates the developmental fate of embryonic cells, especially epidermal cells, and thereby strongly affects root generation and development. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both JIM8 and JIM13 binding to AGP co-localize with betaGlcY-binding sites. Thus, AGPs binding to betaGlcY, co-localized with Jim8- and Jim13-binding protein, appear to play a crucial role in the initiation of Brassica microspore embryogenesis and the maintenance of cell differentiation during embryonic development. In addition, these proteins may also be involved in the regulation of root generation.
