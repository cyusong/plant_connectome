['30409857', 'The shoot apical meristem (SAM) enables the formation of new organs throughout  the life of a plant. ERECTA family (ERf) receptors restrict SAM size and promote  initiation of leaves while simultaneously supporting establishment of correct  phyllotaxy. In the epidermis and during organ elongation ERf activity is  regulated by a family of Epidermal Patterning Factor-Like (EPFL) secreted  Cys-rich small proteins. Here we show that ERfs play a critical role in  communication between the SAM leaf boundary and the central zone in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Ectopic expression of ERECTA in the central zone using  the CLAVATA3 promoter is sufficient to restrict meristem size and promote leaf  initiation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that four putative ligands: EPFL1,  EPFL2, EPFL4, and EPFL6 function redundantly in the SAM. These genes are  expressed at the SAM-leaf boundary and in the peripheral zone. Previously EPFL4  and EPFL6 have been linked with elongation of aboveground organs. Here we  demonstrate that EPFL1 and EPFL2 promote organ elongation as well. In addition,  we show that expression of ERECTA in the central zone of the SAM has a strong  impact on elongation of internodes and pedicels and growth of leaves. These  results suggest that ERfs can stimulate organ growth cell nonautonomously.', '2019 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00714', 'ORCID:']
