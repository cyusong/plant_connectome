We examined the responses of sound-treated arabidopsis adult plants to water deprivation and the associated changes on gene expression. The survival of drought-induced plants was significantly higher in the sound treated plants (24,8%) compared with plants kept in silence (13,3%). RNA-seq revealed significant upregulation of 87 genes including 32 genes involved in abiotic stress responses, 31 involved in pathogen responses, 11 involved in oxidation-reduction processes, 5 involved in the regulation of transcription, 2 genes involved in protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and 13 involved in jasmonic acid or ethylene synthesis or responses. In addition, 2 genes involved in the responses to mechanical stimulus were also induced by sound, suggesting that touch and sound have at least partially common perception and signaling events.
