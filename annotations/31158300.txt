Source-sink communication is one of the key regulators of senescence; however, the mechanisms underlying such regulation are largely unknown. We analysed senescence induced by the lack of grain sink in maize, termed source-sink regulated senescence (SSRS), and compared the associated physiological and metabolic changes with those accompanying natural senescence. Phenotypic characterization of 31 diverse field-grown inbreds revealed substantial variation for both SSRS and natural senescence. Partitioning of excess carbohydrates to alternative sinks, mainly internodes and husks, emerged as a critical mechanism underlying both SSRS and stay-green. Time-course analyses of SSRS sensitive (B73) and resistant (PHG35) inbreds confirmed the role of sugar partitioning in SSRS and stay-green. Elevated hemicellulose content in PHG35 internodes highlighted the role of the cell wall as a significant alternative sink. Sugar signalling emerged as an important regulator of SSRS as evident from an increased accumulation of trehalose-6-phosphate and decreased transcript levels of snf1-related protein kinase1, two signalling components associated with senescence, in B73. These findings demonstrate a crucial role of sugar partitioning, signalling, and utilization in SSRS. Available genetic variation for SSRS and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms would help modify sugar partitioning and senescence to enhance the productivity of maize and related grasses.
