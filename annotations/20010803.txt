['20010803', 'RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants requires two RNA polymerase (Pol)  II-related RNA polymerases, namely Pol IV and Pol V. A genetic screen designed to  reveal factors that are important for RdDM in a developmental context in  Arabidopsis identified DEFECTIVE IN MERISTEM SILENCING 4 (DMS4). Unlike other  mutants defective in RdDM, dms4 mutants have a pleiotropic developmental  phenotype. The DMS4 protein is similar to yeast IWR1 (interacts with RNA  polymerase II), a conserved putative transcription factor that interacts with Pol  II subunits. The DMS4 complementary DNA partly complements the K1 killer toxin  hypersensitivity of a yeast iwr1 mutant, suggesting some functional conservation.  In the transgenic system studied, mutations in DMS4 directly or indirectly affect  Pol IV-dependent secondary short interfering RNAs, Pol V-mediated RdDM, Pol  V-dependent synthesis of intergenic non-coding RNA and expression of many Pol  II-driven genes. These data suggest that DMS4 might be a regulatory factor for  several RNA polymerases, thus explaining its diverse roles in the plant.', '2010 Jan', 'EMBO Rep', '10.1038/embor.2009.246', 'Matzke']
