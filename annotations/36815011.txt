Microbial-plant interactions protect plants from external stimuli, releasing various elicitor that activate the plants defense response and regulate its growth. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> BS-Z15 was screened from cotton inter-rhizosphere soil, antagonized various plant pathogens, and protected cotton against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. This study showed that the BS-Z15 lipopeptide mycosubtilin homologue could act as an elicitor to induce systemic resistance (ISR) in plants. Mycosubtilin homologue induced ROS burst and deposition, callose deposition, MAPK cascade phosphorylation, and up-regulated <i>PR1</i> and <i>PDF1.2</i> gene expression in <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings, moreover enhanced resistance of <i>Arabidopsis</i> to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>Tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) and <i>V. dahliae.</i> Transcriptome analysis was then used to evaluate the impact of mycosubtilin homologue on plant gene expression control. Mycosubtilin homologues activated <i>Arabidopsis</i> ISR on genes in metabolic pathways such as <i>Arabidopsis</i> plant-pathogen interactions, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, and phytohormone signaling. These analyses revealed that mycosubtilin homologues mediate the regulation of plant systemic resistance and growth and development by affecting related metabolites in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. These findings confirmed that a mycosubtilin homologue could trigger the initiation of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> ISR by interacting with a variety of PTI components and transcriptional metabolic signaling pathways.
