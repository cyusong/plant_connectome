ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are small GTP-binding proteins that regulate a wide variety of cell functions. Previously, we isolated a new ARF, ZmArf2, from maize (Zea mays). Sequence and expression characteristics indicated that ZmArf2 might play a critical role in the early stages of endosperm development. In this study, we investigated ZmArf2 function by analysis of its GTP-binding activity and subcellular localization. We also over-expressed ZmArf2 in Arabidopsis and measured organ and cell size and counted cell numbers. The expression levels of five organ size-associated genes were also determined in 35S::ZmArf2 transgenic and wild-type plants. Results showed that the recombinant ZmArf2 protein purified from Escherichia coli exhibited GTP-binding activity. Subcellular localization revealed that ZmArf2 was localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. ZmArf2 over-expression in Arabidopsis showed that 35S::ZmArf2 transgenic plants were taller and had larger leaves and seeds compared to wild-type plants, which resulted from cell expansions, not an increase in cell numbers. In addition, three cell expansion-related genes, AtEXP3, AtEXP5 and AtEXP10, were upregulated in 35S::ZmArf2 transgenic lines, while the expression levels of AtGIF1 and AtGRF5, were unchanged. Collectively, our studies suggest that ZmArf2 has an active GTP-binding function, and plays a crucial role in growth and development in Arabidopsis through cell expansion mediated by cell expansion genes.
