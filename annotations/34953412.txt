In this review, a central position of foliar sieve elements in linking leaf structure and function is explored. Results from studies involving plants grown under, and acclimated to, different growth regimes are used to identify significant, linear relationships between features of minor vein sieve elements and those of 1) leaf photosynthetic capacity that drives sugar synthesis, 2) overall leaf structure that serves as the platform for sugar production, 3) phloem components that facilitate the loading of sugars (companion & phloem parenchyma cells), and 4) the tracheary elements that import water to support photosynthesis (and stomatal opening) as well as mass flow of sugars out of the leaf. Despite comprising only a small fraction of physical space within the leaf, sieve elements represent a hub through which multiple functions of the leaf intersect. As the conduits for export of energy-rich carbohydrates, essential mineral nutrients, and information carriers, sieve elements play a central role in fueling and orchestrating development and function of the plant as well as, by extension, of natural and human communities that depend on plants as producers and partners in the global carbon cycle.
