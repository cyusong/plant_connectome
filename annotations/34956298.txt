The rice NAC transcriptional factor family harbors 151 members, and some of them play important roles in rice immunity. Here, we report the function and molecular mechanism of a pathogen-inducible NAC transcription factor, ONAC096, in rice immunity against <i>Magnaprothe oryzae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>. Expression of <i>ONAC096</i> was induced by <i>M. oryzae</i> and by abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate. ONAC096 had the DNA binding ability to NAC recognition sequence and was found to be a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator whose activity depended on its C-terminal. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of <i>ONAC096</i> attenuated rice immunity against <i>M. oryzae</i> and <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> as well as suppressed chitin- and flg22-induced reactive oxygen species burst and expression of PTI marker genes <i>OsWRKY45</i> and <i>OsPAL4</i>; by contrast, overexpression of <i>ONAC096</i> enhanced rice immunity against these two pathogens and strengthened chitin- or flg22-induced PTI. RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling and qRT-PCR analysis identified a small set of defense and signaling genes that are putatively regulated by ONAC096, and further biochemical analysis validated that ONAC096 could directly bind to the promoters of <i>OsRap2.6</i>, <i>OsWRKY62</i>, and <i>OsPAL1</i>, three known defense and signaling genes that regulate rice immunity. ONAC096 interacts with ONAC066, which is a positive regulator of rice immunity. These results demonstrate that ONAC096 positively contributes to rice immunity against <i>M. oryzae</i> and <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> through direct binding to the promoters of downstream target genes including <i>OsRap2.6</i>, <i>OsWRKY62</i>, and <i>OsPAL1</i>.
