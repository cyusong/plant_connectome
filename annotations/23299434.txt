Coumarin effects on gravitropic responses of Arabidopsis thaliana roots were here evaluated. Coumarin alone did not cause any alteration on gravitropic response showing a behavior similar to control plants. In contrast, TIBA and NPA, two auxin transport inhibitors, strongly modified root gravitropic responses. The addition of coumarin to the medium together with TIBA or NPA partially restored the effect of both inhibitors. Simultaneously, a semi-quantitative evaluation of ROS distribution was performed on root tips. TIBA and NPA caused a wide distribution of O 2(-), ROS oxidant species, around the root tip which disappeared with coumarin addition to both treatments, restoring ROS localized distribution. These results indicated a strong correlation between ROS distribution and coumarin-mediated recovery of root gravitropism.
