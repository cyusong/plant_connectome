Root chemical traits play a critical role in plant resource use strategies and ecosystem nutrient cycling; however, the chemical diversity of multiple elements of fine root and community chemical assembly belowground are poorly understood. Here, we measured 13 elements (C, N, K, Ca, Mg, S, P, Al, Fe, Na, Mn, Zn, and Cu) in the fine roots of 204 plant species along elevational transect from 540 to 2357 m of Changbai Mountain, China to explore the variation, diversity, and community assembly of root chemical traits. At the species level, the concentrations of macronutrients (N, K, Ca, Mg, S, and P) decreased, whereas the trace metals (Fe, Mn, and Zn) increased with elevation. Root chemical traits at the community level systematically shifted along elevational gradients showing a pattern similar to that at the species level, which were mainly influenced by climate and soil rather than species diversity. In general, the interactions of climate and soil were the main drivers of root chemical assembly for woody layers, whereas soil factors played significant role for root chemical assembly for herb layer. The chemical assembly of rock-derived element P was mainly driven by soil factors. Meanwhile, root chemical diversities were mainly regulated by species diversity, the interactions of climate and soil, and soil factors in the tree, shrub, and herb layers, respectively. A better understanding of plant root chemical diversity and community chemical assembly will help to reveal the role of chemical traits in ecosystem functioning.
