['23444357', 'The timing and extent of cell division is particularly important for the growth  and development of multicellular organisms. Roots of the model organism  Arabidopsis thaliana have been widely studied as a paradigm for organ development  in plants. In the Arabidopsis root, the plant-specific GRAS family transcription  factors SHORT-ROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) are key regulators of root growth  and of the asymmetric cell divisions that separate the ground tissue into two  separate layers: the endodermis and cortex. To elucidate the role of SHR in root  development, we identified 17 SHR-interacting proteins. Among those isolated was  At5g24740, which we named SHRUBBY (SHBY). SHBY is a vacuolar sorting protein with  similarity to the gene responsible for Cohen syndrome in humans. Hypomorphic  alleles of shby caused poor root growth, decreased meristematic activity and  defects in radial patterning that are characterized by an increase in the number  of cell divisions in the ground tissue that lead to extra cells in the cortex and  endodermis, as well as additional cell layers. Analysis of genetic and molecular  markers indicates that SHBY acts in a pathway that partially overlaps with SHR,  SCR, PLETHORA1 and PLETHORA2 (PLT1 and PLT2). The shby-1 root phenotype was  partially phenocopied by treatment of wild-type roots with the proteosome  inhibitor MG132 or the gibberellic acid (GA) synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol  (PAC). Our results indicate that SHBY controls root growth downstream of GA in  part through the regulation of SHR and SCR.', '2013 Mar', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.090761', 'Gallagher']
