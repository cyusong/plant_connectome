The process of grape berry ripening follows three phases with distinct metabolic processes and complex regulations via phytohormones. The physiological ripening disorder berry shrivel (BS) is characterized by reduced sugar accumulation, low anthocyanin contents, and high acidity in affected berries. The processes leading to BS induction are unknown, but recent transcriptional data on reduced expression of switch genes hint towards a disturbed ripening onset. Herein we investigated the phytohormone composition throughout grape berry ripening in healthy and BS berries in Vitis vinifera L. cultivar Blauer Zweigelt. Thereby we hypothesize that phytohormones are key players for BS induction and suppress the expression of switch genes at veraison. The presented metabolomics and RNAseq data describe two distinct phytohormone profiles in BS berries, differing between pre- and post-veraison with a clear ethylene precursor (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, ACC) peak before veraison. Exogenous application of ACC led to BS symptoms, while ethephone application led to berry abscission. During post-veraison, we observed high ABA-glucose ester (ABA-GE) and low indole-3-acetate aspartate (IAA-Asp) and isopentenyladenine (iP) contents in BS berries and the transcriptional induction of several phytohormone pathways. The presented descriptive data provide valuable knowledge to further decipher the role of phytohormones in BS induction and BS symptom development.
