Plant-associated organisms secrete proteins and other molecules to modulate plant defense circuitry and enable colonization of plant tissue. Understanding the molecular function of these secreted molecules, collectively known as effectors, became widely accepted as essential for a mechanistic understanding of the processes underlying plant colonization. This review summarizes recent findings in the field of effector biology and highlights the common concepts that have emerged from the study of cellular plant pathogen effectors.
