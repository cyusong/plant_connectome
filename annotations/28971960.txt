['28971960', "In a genetic screen for mutants showing modified splicing of an alternatively  spliced GFP reporter gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified mutations in  genes encoding the putative U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) factors  RBM25 and PRP39a. The latter has not yet been studied for its role in  pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in plants. Both proteins contain predicted  RNA-binding domains and have been implicated in 5' splice site selection in yeast  and metazoan cells. In rbm25 mutants, splicing efficiency of GFP pre-mRNA was  reduced and GFP protein levels lowered relative to wild-type plants. By contrast,  prp39a mutants exhibited preferential splicing of a U2-type AT-AC intron in GFP  pre-mRNA and elevated levels of GFP protein. These opposing findings indicate  that impaired function of either RBM25 or PRP39a can differentially affect the  same pre-mRNA substrate. Given a prior genome-wide analysis of alternative  splicing in rbm25 mutants, we focused on examining the alternative splicing  landscape in prp39a mutants. RNA-seq experiments performed using two independent  prp39a alleles revealed hundreds of common genes undergoing changes in  alternative splicing, including PRP39a itself, a second putative U1 snRNP  component PRP40b, and genes encoding a number of general transcription-related  proteins. The prp39a mutants displayed somewhat delayed flowering, shorter  stature, and reduced seed set but no other obvious common defects under normal  conditions. Mutations in PRP39b, the paralog of PRP39a, did not visibly alter GFP  expression, indicating the paralogs are not functionally equivalent in this  system. Our study provides new information on the contribution of PRP39a to  alternative splicing and expands knowledge of plant splicing factors.", '2017 Dec', 'Genetics', '10.1534/genetics.117.300149', 'Matzke']
