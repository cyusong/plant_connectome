Unlike most plant cell walls, the five consecutive walls laid down during spermatogenesis in the model fern Ceratopteris contain sparse cellulose, lack pectin and are enriched with callose and hemicelluloses. Seed-free plants like bryophytes and pteridophytes produce swimming male gametes for sexual reproduction. During spermatogenesis, unique walls are formed that are essential to the appropriate development and maturation of the motile gametes. Other than the detection of callose and general wall polysaccharides in scattered groups, little is known about the sequence of wall formation and the composition of these walls during sperm cell differentiation in plants that produce swimming sperm. Using histochemistry and immunogold localizations, we examined the distribution of callose, cellulose, mannan and xylan-containing hemicelluloses, and homogalacturonan (HG) pectins in the special walls deposited during spermatogenesis in Ceratopteris. Five walls are produced in sequence and each has a unique fate. The first wall (W1) contains callose and sparse xylan-containing hemicelluloses. Wall two (W2) is thin and composed of cellulose crosslinked by xylan-containing hemicelluloses. The third wall (W3) is thick and composed entirely of callose, and the fourth wall (W4) is built of cellulose heavily crosslinked by galactoxyloglucan hemicelluloses. Wall five (W5) is an arabinogalactan protein (AGP)-rich matrix in which the gamete changes shape and multiple flagella elongate. We detected no esterified or unesterified HG pectins in any of the walls laid down during spermatogenesis. To consider evolutionary modifications in cell walls associated with motile gametes, comparisons are presented with male gametophyte and spermatogenous cell walls across plant groups.
