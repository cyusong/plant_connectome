Development of high yield rice varieties is critical to ensuring global food security. However, the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) from paddy fields threatens environmental sustainability. In this study, we selected overexpressed high-affinity nitrate transporters (NRT2.3 along with their partner protein NAR2.1) cultivars, which are effective nitrogen use efficient transgenic lines <i>pOsNAR2.1: OsNAR2.1</i> (Ox2) and <i>p35S:OsNRT2.3b</i> (O8). We used high (270 kg N/ha) and low (90 kg N/ha) nitrogen (N) fertilizers in paddy fields to evaluate morphophysiological traits, including GHG emission. We found that Ox2 and O8 reduced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by 40% and 60%, respectively, compared to their wild type (WT). During growth stages, there was no consistent N<sub>2</sub>O discharge pattern between WT and transgenics (Ox2, O8) in low and high N application. However, total cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O in a cropping season reduced in O8 and increased in Ox2 cultivars, compared to WT. Root aerenchyma formation reduced by 30-60% in transgenic lines. Methanogens like <i>mcrA</i> in low and high N were also reduced by up to 50% from rhizosphere of Ox2 and O8. However, the nitrifying bacterial population such as <i>nosZ</i> reduced in both transgenics significantly, but <i>nirK</i> and <i>nirS</i> did not show a consistent variation. The high yield of transgenic rice with limited aerenchyma mitigates the discharge of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O by reducing root exudates that provide substrates for GHG. Our results improve understanding for breeders to serve the purpose of sustainable development.
