Nuclear pore complex (NPC), the sole exchange channel between nucleus and cytoplasm, is composed of several subcomplexes, among which, the central barrier determines the permeability/selectivity of NPC to dominate the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking essential for many important signaling events in yeast and mammals. How plant NPC central barrier controls selective transport is a crucial question remaining to be elucidated. Here, we uncovered that phase separation of the central barrier is critical for the permeability and selectivity of plant NPC to regulate various biotic stresses. Phenotypic assay of nup62 mutants and complementary lines showed that NUP62 positively regulates plant defense to Botrytis cinerea, one of the world's most disastrous plant pathogens. Furthermore, both in vivo imaging and in vitro biochemical evidence revealed that plant NPC central barrier undergoes phase separation to regulate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport of immune regulators, as exemplified by MPK3 essential for plant resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Moreover, genetic analysis demonstrated that NPC phase separation plays an important role in plant defense against fungal and bacterial infection as well as insect attack. These findings reveal that phase separation of the NPC central barrier serves as an important mechanism to mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport of immune regulators and activate plant defense against a broad range of biotic stresses.
