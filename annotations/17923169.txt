Two types of aspartic proteinase (AP) genes have been isolated from the cDNA library of developing buckwheat seeds. Analysis of their sequences showed that one of these, FeAP9, resembled the structure and shared high homology with the so-called typical plant APs characterized by the presence of a plant-specific insert (PSI), an element unique among APs. The other cDNA, FeAPL1, encoded an AP-like protein lacking that domain. Different expression profiles were observed for FeAP9 and FeAPL1. FeAPL1 mRNAs were restricted to the seeds only, whereas FeAP9 mRNAs were also present in the other plant tissues - leaves, roots, and flowers. Higher levels of FeAP9 were observed in senescent leaves compared with green leaves. The differential expression pattern of these two unique APs raises the interesting possibility that these proteinases have unique substrate specificity and may have different roles in plant development and other physiological processes.
