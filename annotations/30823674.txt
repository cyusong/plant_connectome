The Poaceae family, known as grasses, is distributed worldwide and is considered the most important group of monocotyledonous crops. Salt stress is multifactorial, therefore to survive, halophytes evolved a variety of adaptations, which include the biosynthesis of different primary and secondary metabolites. This trait enhances the accumulation of important families of compounds crucial to the prevention of a variety of chronic diseases. Besides, if proven edible, these species could cope with the increased soil salinity responsible for the decline of arable land due to their high nutritional/nutraceutical value. Herein, the phytochemical investigations performed in halophytes from the Poaceae family as well as their biological properties were explored. Among the 65 genera and 148 species of known halophytic grasses, only 14% of the taxa were studied phytochemically and 10% were subjected to biological evaluation. Notably, in the studied species, a variety of compound families, as well as bioactivities, were demonstrated, highlighting the potential of halophytic grasses.
