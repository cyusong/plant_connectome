Environmental adaptation of crops is essential for reliable agricultural production and an important breeding objective. Genebanks provide genetic variation for the improvement of modern varieties, but the selection of suitable germplasm is frequently impeded by incomplete phenotypic data. We address this bottleneck by combining a Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) with core collection methodology to select soybean (Glycine max) germplasm for Central European breeding from a collection of >17,000 accessions. By focussing on adaptation to high-latitude cold regions, we selected an "environmental precore" of 3,663 accessions using environmental data and compared the Donor opulation of Environments (DPE) in Asia and the Target Population of Environments (TPE) in Central Europe in the present and 2070. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms, we reduced the precore into two diverse core collections of 183 and 366 accessions to serve as diversity panels for evaluation in the TPE. Genetic differentiation between precore and non-precore accessions revealed genomic regions that control maturity, and novel candidate loci for environmental adaptation, demonstrating the potential of diversity panels for studying adaptation. Objective-driven core collections have the potential to increase germplasm utilization for abiotic adaptation by breeding for a rapidly changing climate, or de novo adaptation of crops to expand cultivation ranges.
