Transcription potential is determined by the accessibility of DNA sequences within the context of chromatin, which is coordinately controlled by various epigenetic modifications. Chemical inhibition of epigenetic regulators provides a quick and effective approach to investigate the roles of epigenetic modifications in controlling many biological processes, especially for species in which genetic information is limited. This mini-review provides a brief overview of epigenetic regulators in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana and summarizes compounds that have been applied in plant epigenetics studies, with highlights in the applications of these chemical probes in mechanistic and functional investigations.
