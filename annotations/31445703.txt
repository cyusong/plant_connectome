['31445703', 'Plant growth, development and interaction with the environment involve the action  of transcription factor. bHLH proteins play an essential and often conserved role  in the plant kingdom. However, bHLH proteins that participate in the cell  division process are less well known. Here, we report that the bHLH transcription  factor gene AtUPB1 is involved in mediating cell cycle progression and root  development. In yeast cells, AtUPB1 inhibits cells proliferation and the cells  had increased numbers of nuclei. UPB1 overexpression decreased the expression of  the cell division marker CYCB1-1, and CDKA1 expression could overcome the defect  of UPB1 overexpression. Moreover, UPB1 could directly bind to the promoter region  of the SIM and SMR1 genes to regulate cell cycle. These results support a new  role for AtUPB1 regulating root meristem development by mediating the expression  of SIM/SMR1 genes.', '2019 Oct 20', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.08.088', 'Lin']
