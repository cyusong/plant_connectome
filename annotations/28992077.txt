The endomembrane trafficking network is highly complex and dynamic, with both conventional and so-called unconventional routes which are in essence recently discovered pathways that are poorly understood in plants. One approach to dissecting endomembrane pathways that we have pioneered is the use of chemical biology. Classical genetic manipulations often deal with indirect pleiotropic phenotypes resulting from the perturbation of key players of the trafficking routes. Many of these difficulties can be circumvented using small molecules to modify or disrupt the function or localization of key proteins regulating these pathways. In this review, we summarize how small molecules have been used as probes to define these pathways, and how they could be used to increase current knowledge of unconventional protein secretion pathways.
