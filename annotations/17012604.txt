['17012604', 'Circadian gating of light signaling limits the timing of maximum responsiveness  to light to specific times of day. The fhy3 (for far-red elongated hypocotyl3)  mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is involved in independently gating signaling from  a group of photoreceptors to an individual response. fhy3 shows an enhanced  response to red light during seedling deetiolation. Analysis of two independent  fhy3 alleles links enhanced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in response to red  light with an arrhythmic pattern of hypocotyl elongation. Both alleles also show  disrupted rhythmicity of central-clock and clock-output gene expression in  constant red light. fhy3 exhibits aberrant phase advances under red light pulses  during the subjective day. Release-from-light experiments demonstrate clock  disruption in fhy3 during the early part of the subjective day in constant red  light, suggesting that FHY3 is important in gating red light signaling for clock  resetting. The FHY3 gating function appears crucial in the early part of the day  for the maintenance of rhythmicity under these conditions. However, unlike  previously described Arabidopsis gating mutants that gate all light signaling,  gating of direct red light-induced gene expression in fhy3 is unaffected. FHY3  appears to be a novel gating factor, specifically in gating red light signaling  to the clock during daytime.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.037358', 'Devlin']
