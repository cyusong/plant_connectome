Molecular identification of mutant alleles responsible for certain phenotypic alterations is a central goal of genetic analyses. In this study we describe a rapid procedure suitable for the identification of induced recessive and dominant mutations applied to two Zea mays mutants expressing a dwarf and a pale green phenotype, respectively, which were obtained through pollen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. First, without prior backcrossing, induced mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) segregating in a (M<sub>2</sub> ) family derived from a heterozygous (M<sub>1</sub> ) parent were identified using whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of a small number of (M<sub>2</sub> ) individuals with mutant and wild-type phenotypes. Second, the state of zygosity of the mutation causing the phenotype was determined for each sequenced individual by phenotypic segregation analysis of the self-pollinated (M<sub>3</sub> ) offspring. Finally, we filtered for segregating EMS-induced SNPs whose state of zygosity matched the determined state of zygosity of the mutant locus in each sequenced (M<sub>2</sub> ) individuals. Through this procedure, combining sequencing of individuals and Mendelian inheritance, three and four SNPs in linkage passed our zygosity filter for the homozygous dwarf and heterozygous pale green mutation, respectively. The dwarf mutation was found to be allelic to the an1 locus and caused by an insertion in the largest exon of the AN1 gene. The pale green mutation affected the nuclear W2 gene and was caused by a non-synonymous amino acid exchange in encoded chloroplast DNA polymerase with a predicted deleterious effect. This coincided with lower cpDNA levels in pale green plants.
