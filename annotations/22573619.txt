['22573619', 'Appropriate pollen germination is crucial for plant reproduction. Previous  studies have revealed the importance of dehydration in maintaining pollen  dormancy; here, we show that phosphatidylinositol pathway-controlled  Ins(1,4,5)P(3)/Ca(2+) levels are crucial for maintaining pollen dormancy in  Arabidopsis thaliana. An interesting phenotype, precocious pollen germination  within anthers, results from a disruption of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase  12 (5PT12). The knockout mutant 5pt12 has normal early pollen development and  pollen dehydration, and exhibits hypersensitive ABA responses, indicating that  precocious pollen germination is not caused either by abnormal dehydration or by  suppressed ABA signaling. Deficiency of 5PT13 (a close paralog of 5PT12)  synergistically enhances precocious pollen germination. Both basal Ins(1,4,5)P(3)  levels and endogenous Ca(2+) levels are elevated in pollen from 5pt12 mutants,  and 5pt12 5pt13 double mutants show an even higher precocious germination rate  along with much higher levels of Ins(1,4,5)P(3)/Ca(2+). Strikingly, exogenous  Ca(2+) stimulates the germination of wild-type pollen at floral stage 12, even in  very low humidity, both in vitro and in vivo, and treatment with BAPTA, a  [Ca(2+)](cyt) inhibitor, reduces the precocious pollen germination rates of  5pt12, 5pt13 and 5pt12 5pt13 mutants. These results indicate that the increase in  the levels of Ins(1,4,5)P(3)/Ca(2+) caused by deficiency of inositol  polyphosphate 5-phosphatases is sufficient to break pollen dormancy and to  trigger early germination. The study reveals that independent of dehydration, the  control of Ins(1,4,5)P(3)/Ca(2+) levels by Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases  is crucial for maintaining pollen dormancy.', '2012 Jun', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.081224', 'Xue']
