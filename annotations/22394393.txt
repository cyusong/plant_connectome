Plasmodiophora brassicae (clubroot) infection leads to reprogramming of host development resulting in the formation of characteristic galls. In this work we explored the cellular events that underly gall formation in Arabidopsis thaliana with the help of molecular markers of cell division (CYCB1:GUS) and meristematic activity (ANT:GUS). Our results show that gall development involved the amplification of existing meristematic activities within the vascular cambium (VC) and phloem parenchyma (PP) cells in the region of the hypocotyl. Additionally we found that the increase in VC activity and prolonged maintenance of cambial-derived cells in a meristematic state was crucial for gall formation; disruption of the VC activity significantly decreased the gall size. Gall formation also perturbed vascular development with a significant reduction in xylem and increase in PP in infected plants. This situation was reflected in a decrease in transcripts of key factors promoting xylogenesis (VND6, VND7 and MYB46) and an increase in those promoting phloem formation and function (APL, SUC2). Finally we show, using the cell cycle inhibitor ICK1/KRP1 and a cle41 mutant with altered regulation of cambial stem cell maintenance and differentiation, that a decrease in gall formation did not prevent pathogen development. This finding demonstrates that although gall formation is a typical symptom of the disease and influences numbers of spores produced, it is not required for completion of the pathogen life cycle. Together, these results provide an insight into the relationship of the cellular events that accompany Plasmodiophora infection and their role in disease progression.
