Plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) mutualistic interactions are essential for sustainable agriculture production. Although it is shown that AMF inoculation improves cassava physiological performances and yield traits, the molecular mechanisms involved in AM symbiosis remain largely unknown. Herein, we integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses of symbiotic (Ri) and asymbiotic (CK) cassava roots and explored AM-induced biochemical and transcriptional changes. Three weeks (3w) after AMF inoculations, proliferating fungal hyphae were observable, and plant height and root length were significantly increased. In total, we identified 1,016 metabolites, of which 25 were differentially accumulated (DAMs) at 3w. The most highly induced metabolites were 5-aminolevulinic acid, L-glutamic acid, and lysoPC 18:2. Transcriptome analysis identified 693 and 6,481 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparison between CK (3w) against Ri at 3w and 6w, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses of DAMs and DEGs unveiled transport, amino acids and sugar metabolisms, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interactions as the most differentially regulated pathways. Potential candidate genes, including nitrogen and phosphate transporters, transcription factors, phytohormone, sugar metabolism-related, and SYM (symbiosis) signaling pathway-related, were identified for future functional studies. Our results provide molecular insights into AM symbiosis and valuable resources for improving cassava production.
