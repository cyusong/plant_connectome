['19837819', "SIZ1 (for yeast SAP and MIZ1) encodes the sole ortholog of mammalian PIAS (for  protein inhibitor of activated STAT) and yeast SIZ SUMO (for small  ubiquitin-related modifier) E3 ligases in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  Four conserved motifs in SIZ1 include SAP (for scaffold attachment factor  A/B/acinus/PIAS domain), PINIT (for  proline-isoleucine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine), SP-RING (for SIZ/PIAS-RING),  and SXS (for serine-X-serine, where X is any amino acid) motifs. SIZ1 contains,  in addition, a PHD (for plant homeodomain) typical of plant PIAS proteins. We  determined phenotypes of siz1-2 knockout mutants transformed with SIZ1 alleles  carrying point mutations in the predicted domains. Domain SP-RING is required for  SUMO conjugation activity and nuclear localization of SIZ1. Salicylic acid (SA)  accumulation and SA-dependent phenotypes of siz1-2, such as diminished plant  size, heightened innate immunity, and abscisic acid inhibition of cotyledon  greening, as well as SA-independent basal thermotolerance were not complemented  by the altered SP-RING allele of SIZ1. The SXS domain also controlled SA  accumulation and was involved in greening and expansion of cotyledons of  seedlings germinated in the presence of abscisic acid. Mutations of the PHD zinc  finger domain and the PINIT motif affected in vivo SUMOylation. Expression of the  PHD and/or PINIT domain mutant alleles of SIZ1 in siz1-2 promoted hypocotyl  elongation in response to sugar and light. The various domains of SIZ1 make  unique contributions to the plant's ability to cope with its environment.", '2009 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.143719', 'Yun']
