The slow vacuolar (SV) channel, a Ca2+-regulated vacuolar cation conductance channel, in Arabidopsis thaliana is encoded by the single-copy gene AtTPC1. Although loss-of-function tpc1 mutants were reported to exhibit a stoma phenotype, knowledge about the underlying guard cell-specific features of SV/TPC1 channels is still lacking. Here we demonstrate that TPC1 transcripts and SV current density in guard cells were much more pronounced than in mesophyll cells. Furthermore, the SV channel in motor cells exhibited a higher cytosolic Ca2+ sensitivity than in mesophyll cells. These distinct features of the guard cell SV channel therefore probably account for the published stomatal phenotype of tpc1-2.

AtTPC1: !encodes! SV channel 
tpc1 mutants: !exhibit! stoma phenotype 
TPC1 transcripts: !localize to! guard cells 
SV current density: !higher in! guard cells 
SV channel: !exhibits higher! cytosolic Ca2+ sensitivity 
stomatal phenotype: !accounted for by! distinct features of guard cell SV channel
