['17522887', 'Mtm1p is essential for the posttranslational activation of manganese-containing  superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; however, whether the  same holds true for Arabidopsis thaliana is unknown. In this study, by using the  yeast mtm1 mutant complementation method, we identified a putative MTM gene  (AtMTM1, At4g27940) that is necessary for SOD2 activation. Further, analysis of  SOD activity revealed that an SOD2 defect is rescued in the yeast mutant Y07288  harboring the AtMTM1 gene. Related mRNA-level analysis showed the AtMTM1 gene is  induced by paraquat but not by hydrogen peroxide, which indicates that this gene  is related to the superoxide scavenger SOD. In addition, an AtMTM1::GFP fusion  construct was transiently expressed in the protoplasts, and it was localized to  the mitochondria. Furthermore, sequence deletion analysis of AtMTM1 revealed that  the code region (amino acid (aa) 60-198) of Mtm1p plays an important role in  localization of the protein to the mitochondria. Regulation of AtMTM1 gene  expression was analyzed using a fusion construct of the 1,766 bp AtMTM1 promoter  and the GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene. The screen identified GUS  reporter gene expression in the developing cotyledons, leaves, roots, stems, and  flowers but not in the siliques. Our results suggest that AtMTM1 encodes a  mitochondrial protein that may be playing an important role in activation of  MnSOD1 in Arabidopsis.', '2007 Sep', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-007-0547-6', 'Wang']
