['23335616', 'Plant inflorescence meristems and floral meristems possess specific boundary  domains that result in proper floral organ separation and specification. HANABA  TARANU (HAN) encodes a boundary-expressed GATA3-type transcription factor that  regulates shoot meristem organization and flower development in Arabidopsis  thaliana, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Through time-course  microarray analyses following transient overexpression of HAN, we found that HAN  represses hundreds of genes, especially genes involved in hormone responses and  floral organ specification. Transient overexpression of HAN also represses the  expression of HAN and three other GATA3 family genes, HANL2 (HAN-LIKE 2), GNC  (GATA, NITRATE-INDUCIBLE, CARBON-METABOLISM-INVOLVED), and GNL (GNC-LIKE),  forming a negative regulatory feedback loop. Genetic analysis indicates that HAN  and the three GATA3 family genes coordinately regulate floral development, and  their expression patterns are partially overlapping. HAN can homodimerize and  heterodimerize with the three proteins encoded by these genes, and HAN directly  binds to its own promoter and the GNC promoter in vivo. These findings, along  with the fact that constitutive overexpression of HAN produces an even stronger  phenotype than the loss-of-function mutation, support the hypothesis that HAN  functions as a key repressor that regulates floral development via regulatory  networks involving genes in the GATA3 family, along with genes involved in  hormone action and floral organ specification.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.107854', 'Meyerowitz']
