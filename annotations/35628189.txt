['35628189', 'Root hair cells are important sensors of soil conditions. They grow towards and  absorb water-soluble nutrients. This fast and oscillatory growth is mediated by  continuous remodeling of the cell wall. Root hair cell walls contain  polysaccharides and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, including extensins  (EXTs). Class-III peroxidases (PRXs) are secreted into the apoplastic space and  are thought to trigger either cell wall loosening or polymerization of cell wall  components, such as Tyr-mediated assembly of EXT networks (EXT-PRXs). The precise  role of these EXT-PRXs is unknown. Using genetic, biochemical, and modeling  approaches, we identified and characterized three root-hair-specific putative  EXT-PRXs, PRX01, PRX44, and PRX73. prx01,44,73 triple mutation and PRX44 and  PRX73 overexpression had opposite effects on root hair growth, peroxidase  activity, and ROS production, with a clear impact on cell wall thickness. We use  an EXT fluorescent reporter with contrasting levels of cell wall insolubilization  in prx01,44,73 and PRX44-overexpressing background plants. In this study, we  propose that PRX01, PRX44, and PRX73 control EXT-mediated cell wall properties  during polar expansion of root hair cells.', '2022 May 11', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms23105375', 'ORCID:']
