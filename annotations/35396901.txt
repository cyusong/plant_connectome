Iron and zinc are critical micronutrients for human health. Approximately two billion people suffer from iron and zinc deficiencies worldwide, most of whom rely on rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) as staple foods. Therefore, biofortifying rice and wheat with iron and zinc is an important and economical approach to ameliorate these nutritional deficiencies. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to iron and zinc uptake, translocation, storage, and signaling pathways in rice and wheat. We then discuss current progress in efforts to biofortify rice and wheat with iron and zinc. Finally, we provide future perspectives for the biofortification of rice and wheat with iron and zinc.
