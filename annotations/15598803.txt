['15598803', 'Six genes of the Arabidopsis thaliana monosaccharide transporter-like (MST-like)  superfamily share significant homology with polyol transporter genes previously  identified in plants translocating polyols (mannitol or sorbitol) in their phloem  (celery [Apium graveolens], common plantain [Plantago major], or sour cherry  [Prunus cerasus]). The physiological role and the functional properties of this  group of proteins were unclear in Arabidopsis, which translocates sucrose and  small amounts of raffinose rather than polyols. Here, we describe POLYOL  TRANSPORTER5 (AtPLT5), the first member of this subgroup of Arabidopsis MST-like  transporters. Transient expression of an AtPLT5-green fluorescent protein fusion  in plant cells and functional analyses of the AtPLT5 protein in yeast and Xenopus  oocytes demonstrate that AtPLT5 is located in the plasma membrane and  characterize this protein as a broad-spectrum H+-symporter for linear polyols,  such as sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, or glycerol. Unexpectedly, however, AtPLT5  catalyzes also the transport of the cyclic polyol myo-inositol and of different  hexoses and pentoses, including ribose, a sugar that is not transported by any of  the previously characterized plant sugar transporters. RT-PCR analyses and AtPLT5  promoter-reporter gene plants revealed that AtPLT5 is most strongly expressed in  Arabidopsis roots, but also in the vascular tissue of leaves and in specific  floral organs. The potential physiological role of AtPLT5 is discussed.', '2005 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.026641', 'Sauer']
