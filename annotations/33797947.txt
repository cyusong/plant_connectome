Gummy stem blight (GSB), which is caused by three related species of <i>Stagonosporopsis</i>, is a worldwide devastating disease of cucurbit crops including watermelon. Previously <i>S. cucurbitacearum</i> was reported to be the major fungal cause of watermelon GSB in Southern China, where it causes a significant decrease in watermelon yield. Here, we present the draft whole genome sequence, gene prediction and annotation of <i>S. cucurbitacearum</i> strain DBTL4, isolated from diseased watermelon plants. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available genome sequence of this species, and knowledge of this genome sequence will help further understand the pathogenic mechanism of <i>S. cucurbitacearum</i> to cucurbit plants.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
