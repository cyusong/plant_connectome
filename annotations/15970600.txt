The sex pheromone protoplast release-inducing protein (PR-IP) inducer and a sexual cell division-inducing pheromone-minus (SCD-IP-minus) that mediates the sexual reproduction of the heterothallic Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale (C. psl) complex were investigated in this study. Recombinant PR-IP inducer produced by yeast cells was prepared and assayed for production of PR-IP and induction of SCD. Both biological activities were observed after treating mating-type plus (mt+) cells with the recombinant pheromone. SCD was induced by exposure to a lower concentration of the same pheromone and by a shorter treatment period with the pheromone than was production of PR-IP. This indicates that the previously characterized PR-IP inducer has both PR-IP-inducing and SCD-inducing activities with mt+ cells, although the inducing mechanisms of the two pheromones differ.

PR-IP inducer: !induces! PR-IP
PR-IP inducer: !induces! SCD
mt+ cells: !respond to! PR-IP inducer
SCD: !induced by! lower concentration of PR-IP inducer
SCD: !induced by! shorter treatment period with PR-IP inducer
