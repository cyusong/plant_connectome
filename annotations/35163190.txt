WRKYs, a large family of transcription factors, are involved in plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses, but the role of them in tomato resistance to <i>Oidium neolycopersici</i> is still unclear. In this study, we evaluate the role of <i>WRKYs</i> in powdery mildew-resistant wild tomato (<i>Solanum habrochaites</i>) LA1777 defense against <i>O. neolycopersici</i> strain lz (<i>On</i>-lz) using a combination of omics, classical plant pathology- and cell biology-based approaches. A total of 27 <i>WRKYs</i>, belonging to group I, II, and III, were identified as differentially expressed genes in LA1777 against <i>On</i>-lz. It was found that expression of <i>ShWRKY41</i> was increased after <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. tomato (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000, <i>On</i>-lz and <i>Botrytis</i><i>cinerea</i> B05 inoculation or ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) treatment. GUS staining of <i>ShWRKY41</i> promoter indicated that the expression of <i>ShWRKY41</i> could be induced by SA and ethylene. Furthermore, <i>ShWRKY41</i> gene silencing reduced the resistance to <i>On</i>-lz infection by decreasing the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HR in LA1777 seedlings. Overall, our research suggests that <i>ShWRKY41</i> plays a positive role in defense activation and host resistance to <i>O. neolycopersici</i> in wild tomato (<i>S. habrochaites</i>) LA1777.
