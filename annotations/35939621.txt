Ascochyta blight (AB) caused by the filamentous fungus <i>Ascochyta rabiei</i> is a major threat to global chickpea production. The mechanisms underlying chickpea response to <i>A. rabiei</i> remain elusive to date. Here, we investigated the comparative transcriptional dynamics of AB-resistant and -susceptible chickpea genotypes upon <i>A. rabiei</i> infection, to understand the early host defense response. Our findings revealed that AB-resistant plants underwent rapid and extensive transcriptional reprogramming compared with a susceptible host. At the early stage (24 h postinoculation [hpi]), mainly cell-wall remodeling and secondary metabolite pathways were highly activated, while differentially expressed genes related to signaling components, such as protein kinases, transcription factors, and hormonal pathways, show a remarkable upsurge at 72 hpi, especially in the resistant genotype. Notably, our data suggest an imperative role of jasmonic acid, ethylene, and abscisic acid signaling in providing immunity against <i>A. rabiei</i>. Furthermore, gene co-expression networks and modules corroborated the importance of cell-wall remodeling, signal transduction, and phytohormone pathways. Hub genes such as MYB14, PRE6, and MADS-SOC1 discovered in these modules might be the master regulators governing chickpea immunity. Overall, we not only provide novel insights for comprehensive understanding of immune signaling components mediating AB resistance and susceptibility at early <i>Cicer-Ascochyta</i> interactions but, also, offer a valuable resource for developing AB-resistant chickpea.
