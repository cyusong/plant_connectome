['19074624', 'Endoreduplication, a modified cell cycle that allows cells to increase ploidy  without subsequent cell division, is a key component of plant growth and  development. In this work, we show that some, but not all, of the  endoreduplication of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is mediated by the  expression of a WD40 gene, FIZZY-RELATED2 (FZR2). Loss-of-function alleles show  reduced endoreduplication and reduced expansion in trichomes and other leaf  cells. Misexpression of FZR2 is sufficient to drive ectopic or extra  endoreduplication in leaves, roots, and flowers, leading to alteration of cell  sizes and, sometimes, organ size and shape. Our data, which suggest that reduced  cell size can be compensated by increased cell proliferation to allow normal leaf  morphology, are discussed with respect to the so-called compensation mechanism of  plant development.', '2009 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.132449', 'Day']
