Herbivores and mycorrhizal fungi interactively influence growth, resource utilization, and plant defense responses. We studied these interactions in a tritrophic system comprising <i>Quercus robur</i>, the herbivore <i>Lymantria dispar</i>, and the ectomycorrhizal fungus <i>Piloderma croceum</i> under controlled laboratory conditions at the levels of gene expression and carbon and nitrogen (C/N) allocation. Taking advantage of the endogenous rhythmic growth displayed by oak, we thereby compared gene transcript abundances and resource shifts during shoot growth with those during the alternating root growth flushes. During root flush, herbivore feeding on oak leaves led to an increased expression of genes related to plant growth and enriched gene ontology terms related to cell wall, DNA replication, and defense. C/N-allocation analyses indicated an increased export of resources from aboveground plant parts to belowground. Accordingly, the expression of genes related to the transport of carbohydrates increased upon herbivore attack in leaves during the root flush stage. Inoculation with an ectomycorrhizal fungus attenuated these effects but, instead, caused an increased expression of genes related to the production of volatile organic compounds. We conclude that oak defense response against herbivory is strong in root flush at the transcriptomic level but this response is strongly inhibited by inoculation with ectomycorrhizal fungi and it is extremely weak at shoot flush.
