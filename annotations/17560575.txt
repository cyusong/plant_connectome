['17560575', 'Polyamines are involved in many fundamental cellular processes. Common polyamines  are putrescine, spermidine and spermine. Spermine is synthesized by transfer of  an aminopropyl residue derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to  spermidine. Thermospermine is an isomer of spermine and assumed to be synthesized  by an analogous mechanism. However, none of the recently described spermine  synthases was investigated for their possible activity as thermospermine  synthases. In this work, putative spermine synthases from the diatom  Thalassiosira pseudonana and from Arabidopsis thaliana could be identified as  thermospermine synthases. These findings may explain the previous result that two  putative spermine synthase genes in Arabidopsis produce completely different  phenotypes in knock-out experiments. Likely, part of putative spermine synthases  identifiable by sequence comparisons represents in fact thermospermine synthases.', '2007 Jun 26', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.05.074', 'Sumper']
