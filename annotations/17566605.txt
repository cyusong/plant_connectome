The three poikilohydric and homoiochlorophyllous moss species Campylopus savannarum (C. Muell.) Mitt., Racocarpus fontinaloides (C. Muell.) Par. and Ptychomitrium vaginatum Besch. grow on sun-exposed rocks of a tropical inselberg in Brazil subject to regular drying and wetting cycles. Effective photo-oxidative protection in the light-adapted desiccated state in all three species is achieved by a reduction of ground chlorophyll fluorescence, F', to almost zero. Upon rewatering, the kinetics of the recovery of F' in air dry cushions to higher values is very fast in the first 5 min, but more than 80 min are needed until an equilibrium is reached gradually. The kinetics were not different between the three species. The three moss species, have a distinct niche occupation and form a characteristic zonation around soil vegetation islands on the rock outcrops, where C. savannarum and R. fontinaloides form an inner and outer belt, respectively, around vegetation islands and P. vaginatum occurs as small isolated cushions on bare rock. However, they were not distinguished by the reduction of F' in the dry state and the rewetting recovery kinetics and only slightly different in their photosynthetic capacity. Stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) indicate that liquid films of water limiting diffusion of CO(2) are important in determining carbon acquisition and suggest that limitation of CO(2) fixation by water films must be more pronounced over time in P. vaginatum than in the latter species. This is determined by both the micro site occupied and the form of the moss cushions.
