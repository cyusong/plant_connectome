A Lycopersicon esculentum mutant (rmc) is resistant to colonization by most arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), but one Glomus intraradices isolate (WFVAM 23) develops arbuscules and vesicles in the rmc cortex. It is unknown whether the symbiotic phosphate (Pi)-uptake pathway is operational in this interaction. Hyphal uptake of (32)Pi and expression of plant Pi transporter genes were investigated in the rmc mutant and its wild-type progenitor (76R) associated with three AMF. Hyphae transferred (32)Pi in all symbioses with 76R and in the rmc-G. intraradices WFVAM 23 symbiosis. The other AMF did not colonize rmc. The Pi transporter-encoding LePT1 and LePT2 were expressed constitutively or in P-starved roots, respectively. The mycorrhiza-inducible Pi transporters LePT3 and LePT4 were expressed only in plants with AMF colonization and symbiotic (32)Pi transfer. LePT3 and LePT4 transcripts were reliable markers for a functional mycorrhizal uptake pathway in rmc. Our novel approach to the physiology and molecular biology of P transport can be applied to other arbuscular-mycorrhizal symbioses, irrespective of the size of plant responses.

Hyphae: !transfer! (32)Pi 
LePT1/2: !expressed constitutively/in P-starved roots! 76R 
LePT3/4: !expressed in AMF colonization! symbiotic (32)Pi transfer 
LePT3/4: !markers for functional mycorrhizal uptake pathway! rmc
