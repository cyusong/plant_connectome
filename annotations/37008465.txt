The intercropping practice has been regarded as a practical land-use selection to improve the management benefits of <i>Bletilla striata</i> plantations. The reports about the variety of economic and functional traits of Bletilla pseudobulb under intercropping systems were limited. The present study investigated the variation of economic and functional traits of Bletilla pseudobulb under different intercropping systems (the deep-rooted intercropping system: <i>B. striata</i> - <i>Cyclocarya paliurus</i>, CB; and the shallow-rooted intercropping system: <i>B. striata</i> - <i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>, PB). The functional traits were analyzed through non-targeted metabolomics based on GC-MS. The results indicated that the PB intercropping system significantly decreased the yield of Bletilla pseudobulb while significantly increasing the total phenol and flavonoids compared with the control (CK). However, there were no significant differences in all economic traits between CB and CK. The functional traits among CB, PB, and CK were separated and exhibited significant differences. Under different intercropping systems, <i>B. striata</i> may adopt different functional strategies in response to interspecific competition. The functional node metabolites (D-galactose, cellobiose, raffinose, D-fructose, maltose, and D-ribose) were up-regulated in CB, while the functional node metabolites (L-valine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, methionine, L-lysine, serine, D-glucose, cellobiose, trehalose, maltose, D-ribose, palatinose, raffinose, xylobiose, L-rhamnose, melezitose, and maltotriose) were up-regulated in PB. The correlation between economic and functional traits depends on the degree of environmental stress. Artificial neural network models (ANNs) accurately predicted the variation in economic traits <i>via</i> the combination of functional node metabolites in PB. The correlation analysis of environmental factors indicated that Ns (including TN, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>-, and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-), SRI (solar radiation intensity), and SOC were the main factors that affected the economic traits (yield, total phenol, and total flavonoids). TN, SRI, and SOC were the main factors affecting the functional traits of the Bletilla pseudobulb. These findings strengthen our understanding of the variation of economic and functional traits of Bletilla pseudobulb under intercropping and clarify the main limiting environmental factors under <i>B. striata</i> intercropping systems.
