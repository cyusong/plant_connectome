['29581511', 'Continuous organ initiation and outgrowth in plants relies on the proliferation  and differentiation of stem cells maintained by the CLAVATA (CLV)-WUSCHEL (WUS)  negative-feedback loop(1-3). Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases  (LRR-RLKs), including CLV1, BARELY ANY MERISTEMS and RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE  2 (RPK2), a receptor-like protein CLV2 and a pseudokinase CORYNE (CRN) are  involved in the perception of the CLV3 signal to repress WUS expression(4-10).  WUS, a homeodomain transcription factor, in turn directly activates CLV3  expression and promotes stem cell activity in the shoot apical meristem(11,12).  However, the signalling mechanism immediately following the perception of CLV3 by  its receptors is poorly understood. Here, we show that a group of LRR-RLKs,  designated as CLAVATA3 INSENSITIVE RECEPTOR KINASES (CIKs), have essential roles  in regulating CLV3-mediated stem cell homeostasis. The cik1 2 3 4 quadruple  mutant exhibits a significantly enlarged SAM, resembling clv mutants. Genetic  analyses and biochemical assays demonstrated that CIKs function as co-receptors  of CLV1, CLV2/CRN and RPK2 to mediate CLV3 signalling through phosphorylation.  Our findings not only widen the understanding of the underlying mechanism of CLV3  signal transduction in regulating stem cell fate but also reveal a novel group of  RLKs that function as co-receptors to possibly mediate multiple extrinsic and  intrinsic signals during plant growth and development.', '2018 Apr', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-018-0123-z', 'ORCID:']
