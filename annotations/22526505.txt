The physiological and molecular mechanisms leading to the competitive interactions between phosphorus (P) and metal elements are a matter of debate. In this study, we found that P deficiency can alleviate cadmium (Cd) toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0). Under P deficiency (-P), less Cd was accumulated in the plants and the root cell walls, indicating the operation of a P-deficiency-induced Cd exclusion mechanism. However, organic acid efflux was similar under -P+Cd and +Cd treatments, suggesting that organic acid efflux is not responsible for the Cd exclusion. Interestingly, P deficiency significantly decreased cell wall polysaccharides (pectin and hemicellulose) contents and pectin methylesterase activity, and decreased the Cd retained by the extracted root cell wall. Therefore, we conclude that the modification of cell wall composition is responsible for the Cd exclusion of the root under P deficiency.
