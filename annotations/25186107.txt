Gibberellins (GAs) are key regulators of plant growth and development and recent studies suggest also a role during arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) formation. Here, complementary approaches have been used to obtain a clearer picture that correlates AM fungal development inside roots with GA metabolism. An extensive analysis of genes associated with GA metabolism as well as a quantification of GA content in roots was made. Application of GA3 and its biosynthesis inhibitor prohexadione calcium (PrCa) combined with a GA-constitutive response mutant (procera) were used to determine whether fungal colonization is altered by the level of these hormones or by changes in the GA-signaling pathway. The increased levels of specific GAs from the 13-hydroxylation pathway in mycorrhizal roots correlate closely with the increased expression of genes coding enzymes from the GA biosynthetic trail. The imbalance of GAs in tomato roots caused by exogenous applications of GA3 or PrCa affects arbuscules in both negative and positive ways, respectively. In addition, procera plants were adversely affected by the mycorrhization process. Our findings demonstrate that an imbalance in favor of an increased amount of GAs negatively affects the frequency of mycorrhization and particularly the arbuscular abundance in tomato mycorrhizal roots and the results point out that AM formation is associated with a change in the 13-hydroxylation pathway of GAs.
