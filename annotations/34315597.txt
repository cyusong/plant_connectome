['34315597', 'Signal molecule hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) plays critical roles in various  processes of plant development. However, H(2)O(2) signaling network, especially  the responders that sense and respond to the H(2)O(2) signal remain largely  unknown. Here we report two homologous genes H(2)O(2) Response Gene 1 and 2  (HRG1/2) in Arabidopsis that could quickly respond to exogenous or endogenous  H(2)O(2). Knockdown of HRG1/2 facilitated seed germination while overexpression  of HRG1/2 greatly retarded seed germination. ROS level in HRG1 overexpression  roots was significantly lower than that in HRG1/2 mutants after H(2)O(2)  treatment. The expression level of enzymatic antioxidant DHAR3 was upregulated in  HRG1 overexpression plants, suggesting that DHAR3 is downstream of HRG1. That the  root meristem length and cell number were significantly reduced in hrg1-1 and  hrg2-1 plants upon H(2)O(2) treatment compared to that of HRG1 overexpression  plants also approves the idea that HRGs function in H(2)O(2) removal. Further  evolutionary analysis indicates that this is a dicotyledon-specific pathway  responsive to H(2)O(2). Together, this work reveals HRG1/2 as novel H(2)O(2)  responders involved in ROS scavenging to ensure embryonic root meristem activity.  These findings provide valuable clues for the of H(2)O(2) signaling and root  meristem regulation.', '2021 Sep', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.110981', 'Peng']
