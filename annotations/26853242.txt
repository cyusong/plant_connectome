Local burning is known to generate and propagate variation potential (VP) in plants. VP affects different physiological processes, including reducing heat-related damage to photosystem I (PSI). We investigated mechanisms of the process. Photosynthesis parameters were measured with Dual-PAM-100 and GFS-3000. VP was induced by burning the first mature leaf and then waiting 5, 10, 15, or 20 min to initiate heating of the second mature leaf. Photosystems activities in the second leaf were investigated at 15 and 135 min after heating. In the absence of VP induction, when incubation in hot water (5 min) was used for heating the intact second leaf, PSI and PSII activities decreased after incubation at both exposure temperatures (45°C and 50°C). When local burning of the first leaf induced VP propagation into the second leaf, reduced photosynthesis (PSI) was observed. Arrival of VP in the second leaf prior to hot water incubation at 50°C decreased heating-induced suppression of PSI activity when measured 15 and 135 min later. Dependence of PSI activity on the time interval (5, 10, 15, or 20 min) between VP induction and heating of the second leaf was dissimilar at 15 and 135 min. Heat-induced suppression of PSII activity in the second leaf was stimulated after VP induction. In contrast, the effect of VP on PSI and PSII damage was weak when leaf 2 was heated at 45°C. VP-induced decrease of PSI activity suppression at 15 min after heating was correlated with stimulation of PSII activity suppression, but increase of PSI activity at 135 min after heating was not related to PSII activity. Thus, our results suggest the possibility of 2 different pathways of VP-induced decrease of heat-related PSI damage.
