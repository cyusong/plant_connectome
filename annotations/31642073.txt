Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a key technique used in plant biotechnology. The complex molecular changes associated with SE are uncharacterized in many crop species, and therefore, logically, formulating the culture conditions that induce these changes is difficult. In a study published in this issue of Physiologia Plantarum, Marimuthu et al. (2019) performed a proteomic study to characterize the molecular reprogramming during SE of an elite banana cultivar. Based on the results, they could customize culture conditions for optimal SE efficiency in several cultivars.
