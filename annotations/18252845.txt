['18252845', 'We show that a previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana basic  helix-loop-helix (bHLH) phytochrome interacting factor (PIF), designated PIF7,  interacts specifically with the far-red light-absorbing Pfr form of phyB through  a conserved domain called the active phyB binding motif. Similar to PIF3, upon  light exposure, PIF7 rapidly migrates to intranuclear speckles, where it  colocalizes with phyB. However, in striking contrast to PIF3, this process is not  accompanied by detectable light-induced phosphorylation or degradation of PIF7,  suggesting that the consequences of interaction with photoactivated phyB may  differ among PIFs. Nevertheless, PIF7 acts similarly to PIF3 in prolonged red  light as a weak negative regulator of phyB-mediated seedling deetiolation.  Examination of pif3, pif4, and pif7 double mutant combinations shows that their  moderate hypersensitivity to extended red light is additive. We provide evidence  that the mechanism by which these PIFs operate on the phyB signaling pathway  under prolonged red light is through maintaining low phyB protein levels, in an  additive or synergistic manner, via a process likely involving the proteasome  pathway. These data suggest that the role of these phyB-interacting bHLH factors  in modulating seedling deetiolation in prolonged red light may not be as  phy-activated signaling intermediates, as proposed previously, but as direct  modulators of the abundance of the photoreceptor.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.052142', 'Quail']
