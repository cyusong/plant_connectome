Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is a vital perennial aquatic ornamental plant. Its flower shape determines the horticultural and ornamental values. However, the mechanisms underlying lotus flower development are still elusive. MADS-box transcription factors are crucial in various features of plant development, especially in floral organogenesis and specification. It is still unknown how the MADS-box transcription factors regulate the floral organogenesis in lotus. To obtain a comprehensive insight into the functions of MADS-box genes in sacred lotus flower development, we systematically characterized members of this gene family based on the available genome information. A total of 44 MADS-box genes were identified, of which 16 type I and 28 type II genes were categorized based on the phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, the structure of MADS-box genes and their expressional patterns were also systematically analyzed. Additionally, subcellular localization analysis showed that they are mainly localized in the nucleus, of which a SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) homolog NnMADS14 was proven to be involved in the floral organogenesis. These results provide some fundamental information about the MADS-box gene family and their functions, which might be helpful in not only understanding the mechanisms of floral organogenesis but also breeding of high ornamental value cultivars in lotus.
