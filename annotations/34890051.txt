Shoot morphogenetic plasticity is crucial to the adaptation of plants to their fluctuating environments. Major insights into shoot morphogenesis have been compiled studying meristems, especially the shoot apical meristem (SAM), through a methodological effort in multiscale systems biology and biophysics. However, morphogenesis at the SAM is robust to environmental changes. Plasticity emerges later on during post-SAM development. The purpose of this review is to show that multiscale systems biology and biophysics is insightful for the shaping of the whole plant as well. More specifically, we review the shaping of axes and crowns through tropisms and elasticity, combining the recent advances in morphogenetic control using physical cues and by genes. We focus mostly on land angiosperms, but with growth habits ranging from small herbs to big trees. We show that generic (universal) morphogenetic processes have been identified, revealing feedforward and feedback effects of global shape on the local morphogenetic process. In parallel, major advances have been made in the analysis of the major genes involved in shaping axes and crowns, revealing conserved genic networks among angiosperms. Then, we show that these two approaches are now starting to converge, revealing exciting perspectives.
