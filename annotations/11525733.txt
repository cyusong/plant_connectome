['11525733', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates important stress and  developmental responses. We have isolated a recessive ABA hypersensitive mutant,  abh1, that shows hormone specificity to ABA. ABH1 encodes the Arabidopsis homolog  of a nuclear mRNA cap binding protein and functions in a heterodimeric complex to  bind the mRNA cap structure. DNA chip analyses show that only a few transcripts  are down-regulated in abh1, several of which are implicated in ABA signaling.  Consistent with these results, abh1 plants show ABA-hypersensitive stomatal  closing and reduced wilting during drought. Interestingly, ABA-hypersensitive  cytosolic calcium increases in abh1 guard cells demonstrate amplification of  early ABA signaling. Thus, ABH1 represents a modulator of ABA signaling proposed  to function by transcript alteration of early ABA signaling elements.', '2001 Aug 24', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(01)00460-3', 'Schroeder']
