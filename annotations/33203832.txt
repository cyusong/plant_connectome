Fruit firmness is a target trait in tomato breeding because it facilitates transportation and storage. However, it is also a complex trait and uncovering the molecular genetic mechanisms controlling fruit firmness has proven challenging. Here, we report the map-based cloning and functional characterization of qFIRM SKIN 1 (qFIS1), a major quantitative trait locus that partially determines the difference in compression resistance between cultivated and wild tomato accessions. FIS1 encodes a GA2-oxidase, and its mutation leads to increased bioactive gibberellin content, enhanced cutin and wax biosynthesis, and increased fruit firmness and shelf life. Importantly, FIS1 has no unfavorable effect on fruit weight or taste, making it an ideal target for breeders. Our study demonstrates that FIS1 mediates gibberellin catabolism and regulates fruit firmness, and it offers a potential strategy for tomato breeders to produce firmer fruit.
