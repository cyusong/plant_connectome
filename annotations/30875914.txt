Plant-derived smoke has effects on plant growth. To find the molecular mechanism of plant-derived smoke on maize, a gel-free/label-free proteomic technique was used. The length of root and shoot were increased in maize by plant-derived smoke. Proteomic analysis revealed that 2000 ppm plant-derived smoke changed the abundance of 69 proteins in 4-days old maize shoot. Proteins in cytoplasm, chloroplast, and cell membrane were altered by plant-derived smoke. Catalytic, signaling, and nucleotide binding proteins were changed. Proteins related to sucrose synthase, nucleotides, signaling, and glutathione were significantly increased; however, cell wall, lipids, photosynthetic, and amino acid degradations related proteins were decreased. Based on proteomic and immunoblot analyses, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) was decreased; however, RuBisCO activase was not changed by plant-derived smoke in maize shoot. Ascorbate peroxidase was not affected; however, peroxiredoxin was decreased by plant-derived smoke. Furthermore, the results from enzyme-activity and mRNA-expression analyses confirmed regulation of ascorbate peroxidase and the peroxiredoxinin reactive oxygen scavenging system. These results suggest that increases in sucrose synthase, nucleotides, signaling, and glutathione related proteins combined with regulation of reactive oxygen species and their scavenging system in response to plant-derived smoke may improve maize growth.
