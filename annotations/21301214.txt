A primary function of the spindle apparatus is to segregate chromosomes into two equal sets in a dividing cell. It is unclear whether spindles in different cell types play additional roles in cellular regulation. As a first step in revealing new functions of spindles, we investigated spindle morphology in different cell types in Arabidopsis roots in the wild-type and the cytokinesis defective1 (cyd1) mutant backgrounds. cyd1 provides cells larger than those of the wild type for testing the cell size effect on spindle morphology. Our observations indicate that cell type (shape), not cell size, is likely a factor affecting spindle morphology. At least three spindle types were observed, including small spindles with pointed poles in narrow cells, large barrel-shaped spindles (without pointed poles) in wide cells, and spindles intermediate in pole focus and size in other cells. We hypothesize that the cell-type-associated spindle diversity may be an integral part of the cell differentiation processes.
