Aquaporins can improve the ability of plants to resist abiotic stresses, but the mechanism is still not completely clear. In this research, overexpression of <i>MaPIP1;1</i> in banana improved tolerance to multiple stresses. The transgenic plants resulted in lower ion leakage and malondialdehyde content, while the proline, chlorophyll, soluble sugar, and abscisic acid (ABA) contents were higher. In addition, under high salt and recovery conditions, the content of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> is higher, also under recovery conditions, the ratio of K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> is higher. Finally, under stress conditions, the expression levels of ABA biosynthesis and response genes in the transgenic lines are higher than those of the wild type. In previous studies, we proved that the MaMADS3 could bind to the promoter region of <i>MaPIP1;1</i>, thereby regulating the expression of <i>MaPIP1;1</i> and affecting the drought tolerance of banana plants. However, the mechanism of <i>MaPIP1;1</i> gene response to stress under different adversity conditions might be regulated differently. In this study, we proved that some transcription factor genes, including MaERF14, MaDREB1G, MaMYB1R1, MaERF1/39, MabZIP53, and MaMYB22, showed similar expression patterns with <i>MaPIP1;1</i> under salt or cold stresses, and their encoded proteins could bind to the promoter region of <i>MaPIP1;1</i>. Here we proposed a novel <i>MaPIP1;1</i>-mediated mechanism that enhanced salt and cold tolerance in bananas. The results of this study have enriched the stress-resistant regulatory network of aquaporins genes and are of great significance for the development of molecular breeding strategies for stress-resistant fruit crops.
