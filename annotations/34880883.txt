Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is a prevalent pathogen of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Pyramiding multiple SMV-resistance genes into one individual is tedious and difficult, and even if successful, the obtained multiple resistance might be broken by pathogen mutation, while targeting viral genome <i>via</i> host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) has potential to explore broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) to SMV. We identified five conserved target fragments (CTFs) from <i>S1</i> to <i>S5</i> using multiple sequence alignment of 30 SMV genome sequences and assembled the corresponding target-inverted-repeat constructs (TIRs) from S1-TIR to S5-TIR. Since the inefficiency of soybean genetic transformation hinders the function verification of batch TIRs in SMV-resistance, the <i>Nicotiana benthamiana-</i>chimeric-SMV and <i>N. benthamiana-</i>pSMV-GUS pathosystems combined with <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transient expression assays were invented and used to test the efficacy of these TIRs. From that, S1-TIR assembled from 462 bp CTF-<i>S1</i> with 92% conservation rate performed its best on inhibiting SMV multiplication. Accordingly, S1-TIR was transformed into SMV-susceptible soybean <i>NN1138-2</i>, the resistant-healthy transgenic T<sub>1</sub>-plants were then picked out <i>via</i> detached-leaf inoculation assay with the stock-plants continued for progeny reproduction (T<sub>1</sub> dual-utilization). All the four T<sub>3</sub> transgenic progenies showed immunity to all the inoculated 11 SMV strains under individual or mixed inoculation, achieving a strong BSR. Thus, optimizing target for HIGS <i>via</i> transient <i>N. benthamiana-</i>chimeric-SMV and <i>N. benthamiana-</i>pSMV-GUS assays is crucial to drive robust resistance to SMV in soybean and the transgenic S1-TIR-lines will be a potential breeding source for SMV control in field.
