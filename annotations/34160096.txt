Hybrid breakdown (HB) functions as a common reproductive barrier and reduces hybrid fitness in many species, including cotton. However, the related genes and the underlying genetic mechanisms of HB in cotton remain unknown. Here, we found that the photosensitive genetic male sterile line CCRI9106 was a hybrid progeny of Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense and probably a product of HB. Fine mapping with F<sub>2</sub> s (CCRI9106 × G. hirsutum/G. barbadense lines) identified a pair of male sterility genes GoFLA19s (encoding fasciclin-like arabinogalactan family protein) located on chromosomes A12 and D12. Crucial variations occurring in the fasciclin-like domain and the arabinogalactan protein domain were predicted to cause the non-functionalization of GbFLA19-D and GhFLA19-A. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout assay confirmed the effects of GhFLA19s on male sterility. Sequence alignment analyses showed that variations in GbFLA19-D and GhFLA19-A likely occurred after the formation of allotetraploid cotton species. GoFLA19s are specifically expressed in anthers and contribute to tapetal development, exine assembly, intine formation, and pollen grain maturation. RNA-sequencing and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses illustrated that genes related to these biological processes were significantly downregulated in the mutant. Our research on male sterility genes, GoFLA19s, improves the understanding of the molecular characteristics and evolutionary significance of HB in interspecific hybrid breeding.
