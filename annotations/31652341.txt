Leaf shape, a spectacularly diverse plant trait, varies across taxonomic levels, geography and in response to environmental differences. However, comprehensive intraspecific analyses of leaf shape variation across variable environments is surprisingly absent. Here, we performed a multilevel analysis of leaf shape using diverse accessions of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and uncovered the role of genetics, environment, and G×E on this important trait. We examined leaf shape using a variety of morphometric analyses, and complement this with a transcriptomic survey to identify gene expression changes associated with shape variation. Additionally, we examined the role of genetics and environment on leaf shape by performing field studies in two geographically separate common gardens. We showed that extensive leaf shape variation exists within I. batatas, and identified promising candidate genes associated with this variation. Interestingly, when considering traditional measures, we found that genetic factors are largely responsible for most of leaf shape variation, but that the environment is highly influential when using more quantitative measures via leaf outlines. This extensive and multilevel examination of leaf shape shows an important role of genetics underlying a potentially important agronomic trait, and highlights that the environment can be a strong influence when using more quantitative measures of leaf shape.
