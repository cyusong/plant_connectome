['11706176', 'The current model of gibberellin (GA) signal transduction is based on a  derepressible system and a number of candidate negative regulators have been  identified in Arabidopsis. We previously have reported the identification of the  Arabidopsis gene SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) that causes suppression of GA responses  when constitutively activated. In this paper, we show by using reporter gene  analysis that the SHI gene is expressed in young organs, e.g. shoot apices and  root tips. The model predicts a suppressor of GA responses to be active in these  tissues to prevent premature growth or development. To study the effect of SHI on  GA signaling, we used a functional assay that measures effects of signaling  components on a well-defined GA response; the up-regulation of alpha-amylase in  barley (Hordeum vulgare) aleurones in response to GA treatment. We found that SHI  was able to specifically block the activity of a high-isoelectric point  alpha-amylase promoter following GA(3) treatment, which further supports that SHI  is a suppressor of GA responses. We have identified two putative loss-of-function  insertion alleles of SHI and lines homozygous for either of the new alleles show  no phenotypic deviations from wild type. Because SHI belongs to a gene family  consisting of nine members, we suggest that SHI and the SHI-related genes are  functionally redundant. We also show that a functional ERECTA allele is able to  partly suppress the dwarfing effect of the shi gain-of-function mutation,  suggesting that the erecta mutation harbored by the Landsberg erecta ecotype is  an enhancer of the shi dwarf phenotype.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '6908', 'Sundberg']
