Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as secondary messengers that can be sensed by specific redox-sensitive proteins responsible for the activation of signal transduction culminating in altered gene expression. The subcellular site, in which modifications in the ROS/oxidation state occur, can also act as a specific cellular redox network signal. The chemical identity of ROS and their subcellular origin is actually a specific imprint on the transcriptome response. In recent years, a number of transcriptomic studies related to altered ROS metabolism in plant peroxisomes have been carried out. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of these transcriptomic findings to identify common transcriptional footprints for plant peroxisomal-dependent signaling at early and later time points. These footprints highlight the regulation of various metabolic pathways and gene families, which are also found in plant responses to several abiotic stresses. Major peroxisomal-dependent genes are associated with protein and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protection at later stages of stress while, at earlier stages, these genes are related to hormone biosynthesis and signaling regulation. Furthermore, in silico analyses allowed us to assign human orthologs to some of the peroxisomal-dependent proteins, which are mainly associated with different cancer pathologies. Peroxisomal footprints provide a valuable resource for assessing and supporting key peroxisomal functions in cellular metabolism under control and stress conditions across species.
