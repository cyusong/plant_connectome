Ear length (EL) is a key trait that contributes greatly to grain yield in maize (Zea mays). While numerous quantitative trait loci for EL have been identified, few causal genes have been studied in detail. Here we report the characterization of ear apical degeneration1 (ead1) exhibiting strikingly shorter ears and the map-based cloning of the casual gene EAD1. EAD1 is preferentially expressed in the xylem of immature ears and encodes an aluminum-activated malate transporter localizing to the plasma membrane. We show that EAD1 is a malate efflux transporter and loss of EAD1 leads to lower malate contents in the apical part of developing inflorescences. Exogenous injections of malate rescued the shortened ears of ead1. These results demonstrate that EAD1 plays essential roles in regulating maize ear development by delivering malate through xylem vessels to the apical part of the immature ear. Overexpression of EAD1 led to greater EL and kernel number per row and the EAD1 genotype showed a positive association with EL in two different genetic segregating populations. Our work elucidates the critical role of EAD1 in malate-mediated female inflorescence development and provides a promising genetic resource for enhancing maize grain yield.
