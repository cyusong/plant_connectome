A cDNA encoding chalcone isomerase (CHI) was isolated from the petals of Nicotiana tabacum and the effect of its suppression on flavonoid biosynthesis was analyzed in transgenic tobacco plants. CHI-suppression by RNA interference (RNAi) showed reduced pigmentation and change of flavonoid components in flower petals. The plants also accumulated high levels of chalcone in pollen, showing a yellow coloration. Our results first demonstrated that suppression of CHI by genetic transformation is possible in higher plants. This suggests that CHI plays a major part in the cyclization reaction from chalcone to flavanone, and that spontaneous reactions are few, if any, in tobacco plants.
