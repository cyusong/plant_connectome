Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are low-molecular-mass proteins whose biological function still remains elusive. They are synthesized with a signal peptide that drives them to the secretory pathway. We have previously described the occurrence of an apoplastic LTP named Ha-AP10, present in sunflower seeds. Using a biochemical approach we now demonstrate that a fraction of Ha-AP10 is perispherically bound to membranes of germinating seeds. Purification of plasma membranes revealed the presence of Ha-AP10 in this fraction. Fluorimmunolocalization studies on germinating sunflower seeds demonstrated that in addition to the apoplastic and plasma membrane localization, Ha-AP10 is also present intracellularlly associated to unidentified structures. This varied distribution of Ha-AP10 in sunflower seeds may give novel clues to understand the role of LTPs in seed physiology.
