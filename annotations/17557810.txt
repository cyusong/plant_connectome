['17557810', 'Plant lateral organs are initiated as small protrusions on the flanks of shoot  apical meristems. Organ primordia are separated from the remainder of the  meristem by distinct cell types that create a morphological boundary. The  Arabidopsis thaliana gain-of-function mutant jagged lateral organs-D (jlo-D)  develops strongly lobed leaves, indicative of KNOX gene misexpression, and the  shoot apical meristem arrests organ initiation prematurely, terminating in a  pin-like structure. The JLO gene, a member of the LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY DOMAIN  gene family, is expressed in boundaries between meristems and organ primordia and  during embryogenesis. Inducible JLO misexpression activates expression of the  KNOX genes SHOOT MERISTEMLESS and KNAT1 in leaves and downregulates the  expression of PIN auxin export facilitators. Consequently, bulk auxin transport  through the inflorescence stem is drastically reduced. During embryogenesis, JLO  is required for the initiation of cotyledons and development beyond the globular  stage. Converting JLO into a transcriptional repressor causes organ fusions,  showing that during postembryonic development, JLO function is required to  maintain the integrity of boundaries between cell groups with indeterminate or  determinate fates.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047159', 'Simon']
