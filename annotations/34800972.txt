NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) transcription factors (TFs) play vital roles in plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. Salt stress is one of the most limiting factors for rice growth and production. However, the mechanism underlying salt tolerance in rice is still poorly understood. In this study, we functionally characterized a rice NAC TF OsNAC3 for its involvement in ABA response and salt tolerance. ABA and NaCl treatment induced OsNAC3 expression in roots. Immunostaining showed that OsNAC3 was localized in all root cells. OsNAC3 knockout decreased rice plants' sensitivity to ABA but increased salt stress sensitivity, while OsNAC3 overexpression showed an opposite effect. Loss of OsNAC3 also induced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in the shoots. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify the key OsNAC3 regulated genes related to ABA response and salt tolerance, such as OsHKT1;4, OsHKT1;5, OsLEA3-1, OsPM-1, OsPP2C68, and OsRAB-21. This study shows that rice OsNAC3 is an important regulatory factor in ABA signal response and salt tolerance.
