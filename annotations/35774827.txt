Phytophthora root and stem rot is a yield-limiting soybean disease caused by the soil-borne oomycete <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>. Although multiple quantitative disease resistance loci (QDRL) have been identified, most explain <10% of the phenotypic variation (PV). The major QDRL explaining up to 45% of the PV <i>were</i> previously identified on chromosome 18 and represent a valuable source of resistance for soybean breeding programs. Resistance alleles from plant introductions 427105B and 427106 significantly increase yield in disease-prone fields and result in no significant yield difference in fields with less to no disease pressure. In this study, high-resolution mapping reduced the QDRL interval to 3.1 cm, and RNA-seq analysis of near-isogenic lines (NILs) varying at <i>QDRL-18</i> pinpointed a single gene of interest which was downregulated in inoculated NILs carrying the resistant allele compared to inoculated NILs with the susceptible allele. This gene of interest putatively encodes a serine-threonine kinase (STK) related to the <i>AtCR4</i> family and may be acting as a susceptibility factor, based on the specific increase of jasmonic acid concentration in inoculated NILs. This work facilitates further functional analyses and marker-assisted breeding efforts by prioritizing candidate genes and narrowing the targeted region for introgression.
