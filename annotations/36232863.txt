It has been demonstrated that the phosphorylation pathway of L-serine (Ser) biosynthesis (PPSB) is very important in plant growth and development, but whether and how PPSB affects nitrogen metabolism and starch accumulation has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we took the energy plant duckweed (strain <i>Lemna turionifera</i> 5511) as the research object and used a stable genetic transformation system to heterologously over-expressing Arabidopsis <i>AtPSAT1</i> (the gene encoding phosphoserine aminotransferase, the second enzyme of PPSB). Our results showed that, under nitrogen starvation, the transgenic plants grew faster, with higher values of Fv/Fm, rETR, and Y(II), as well as fresh and dry weight, than the wild-type. More promisingly, the accumulation of starch was also found to be significantly improved when over-expressing <i>AtPSAT1</i> in the transgenic plants. qRT-PCR analysis results showed that the expression of genes related to nitrogen assimilation, carbon metabolism, and starch biosynthesis was up-regulated, while the expression of starch degradation-related genes was down-regulated by <i>AtPSAT1</i> over-expression. We propose that the increased starch accumulation caused by <i>AtPSAT1</i> over-expression may result from both elevated photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen utilization efficiency. This research sheds new light on the mechanism underlying the ability of PPSB to coordinate nitrogen and carbon metabolism, and provides a feasible way to improve starch production, that is, through engineering PPSB in crops.
