<i>Erigeron breviscapus</i> (Vant.) Hand.-Mazz. is a famous traditional Chinese medicine that has positive effects on the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. With the increase of market demand (RMB 500 million per year) and the sharp decrease of wild resources, it is an urgent task to cultivate high-quality and high-yield varieties of <i>E. breviscapus</i>. However, it is difficult to obtain homozygous lines in breeding due to the self-incompatibility (SI) of <i>E. breviscapus</i>. Here, we first proved that <i>E. breviscapus</i> has sporophyte SI (SSI) characteristics. Characterization of the ARC1 gene in <i>E. breviscapus</i> showed that <i>EbARC1</i> is a constitutive expression gene located in the nucleus. Overexpression of <i>EbARC1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> L. (Col-0) could cause transformation of transgenic lines from self-compatibility (SC) into SI. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays indicated that EbARC1 and EbExo70A1 interact with each other in the nucleus, and the EbARC1-ubox domain and EbExo70A1-N are the key interaction regions, suggesting that EbARC1 may ubiquitinate EbExo70A to regulate SI response. This study of the SSI mechanism in <i>E. breviscapus</i> has laid the foundation for further understanding SSI in Asteraceae and breeding <i>E. breviscapus</i> varieties.
