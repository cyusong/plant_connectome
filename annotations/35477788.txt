Light-dependent chloroplast movements are an actin-dependent cellular response to changes in the light environment that help plants maximize photosynthetic potential and reduce photodamage. Over a dozen proteins are known to be required for normal chloroplast movements, but the molecular mechanisms regulating the transformation of light perception into chloroplast motility are not fully understood. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) the actin-bundling plasma membrane-associated proteins THRUMIN1, PLASTID MOVEMENT IMPAIRED1 (PMI1), and KINESIN-LIKE PROTEIN FOR ACTIN-BASED CHLOROPLAST MOVEMENT1 (KAC1) interact through the 14-3-3 proteins KAPPA and OMEGA. We also show that the interaction of PMI1 with 14-3-3 KAPPA and OMEGA is regulated by blue light activation of the Phototropin2 photoreceptor. Live-cell confocal microscopy revealed light-induced dynamic changes in the cellular localizations of PMI1 and KAC1. In particular, PMI1 was relocated away from irradiated areas of the plasma membrane in less than a minute after blue light exposure, consistent with PMI1 playing a critical role in initiating light-dependent chloroplast movements. We present a modified conceptual model for high light-dependent chloroplast movements in which PMI1 acts as the mobile signal that initiates a coordinated sequence of changes in protein-protein and protein-plasma membrane interactions that initiate the chloroplast movement response and determine where in the cell chloroplasts are able to anchor to the plasma membrane.
