['28381503', 'Pectin, a major component of the primary cell wall, is synthesized in the Golgi  apparatus and exported to the cell wall in a highly methylesterified form, then  is partially demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; EC 3.1.1.11).  PME activity on the status of pectin methylesterification profoundly affects the  properties of pectin and, thereby, is critical for plant development and the  plant defense response, although the roles of PMEs under heat stress (HS) are  poorly understood. Functional genome annotation predicts that at least 66  potential PME genes are contained in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  Thermotolerance assays of PME gene T-DNA insertion lines revealed two null mutant  alleles of PME34 (At3g49220) that both consistently showed reduced  thermotolerance. Nevertheless, their impairment was independently associated with  the expression of HS-responsive genes. It was also observed that PME34  transcription was induced by abscisic acid and highly expressed in guard cells.  We showed that the PME34 mutation has a defect in the control of stomatal  movement and greatly altered PME and polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) activity,  resulting in a heat-sensitive phenotype. PME34 has a role in the regulation of  transpiration through the control of the stomatal aperture due to its cell  wall-modifying enzyme activity during the HS response. Hence, PME34 is required  for regulating guard cell wall flexibility to mediate the heat response in  Arabidopsis.', '2017 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00335', 'ORCID:']
