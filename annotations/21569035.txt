['21569035', 'Peptidases are known to play key roles in multiple biological processes in all  living organisms. In higher plants, the vast majority of putative aminopeptidases  remain uncharacterized. In this study, we performed functional and expression  analyses of the Arabidopsis LAP2 through cDNA cloning, isolation of T-DNA  insertional mutants, characterization of the enzymatic activity, characterization  of gene expression and transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of the mutants.  Loss of function of LAP2, one of the 28 aminopeptidases in Arabidopsis, reduced  vegetative growth, accelerated leaf senescence and rendered plants more sensitive  to various stresses. LAP2 is highly expressed in the leaf vascular tissue and the  quiescent center region. Integration of global gene expression and metabolite  analyses suggest that LAP2 controlled intracellular amino acid turnover. The  mutant maintained free leucine by up-regulating key genes for leucine  biosynthesis. However, this influenced the flux of glutamate strikingly. As a  result, gamma-aminobutyric acid, a metabolite that is derived from glutamate, was  diminished in the mutant. Decrements in these nitrogen-rich compounds are  associated with morphological alterations and stress sensitivity of the mutant.  The results indicate that LAP2 is indeed an enzymatically active aminopeptidase  and plays key roles in senescence, stress response and amino acid turnover.', '2011 Sep', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03758.x', 'Tsujimoto']
