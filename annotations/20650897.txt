['20650897', 'Three sequential methylations of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) are required for the  synthesis of phosphocholine (PCho) in plants. A cDNA encoding an  N-methyltransferase that catalyzes the last two methylation steps was cloned from  Arabidopsis by heterologous complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cho2,  opi3 mutant. The cDNA encodes phosphomethylethanolamine N-methyltransferase  (PMEAMT), a polypeptide of 475 amino acids that is organized as two tandem  methyltransferase domains. PMEAMT shows 87% amino acid identity to a related  enzyme, phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase, an enzyme in plants that  catalyzes all three methylations of PEA to PCho. PMEAMT cannot use PEA as a  substrate, but assays using phosphomethylethanolamine as a substrate result in  both phosphodimethylethanolamine and PCho as products. PMEAMT is inhibited by the  reaction products PCho and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, a property reported for  phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase from various plants. An Arabidopsis  mutant with a T-DNA insertion associated with locus At1g48600 showed no  transcripts encoding PMEAMT. Shotgun lipidomic analyses of leaves of atpmeamt and  wild-type plants generated phospholipid profiles showing the content of  phosphatidylmethylethanolamine to be altered relative to wild type with the  content of a 34:3 lipid molecular species 2-fold higher in mutant plants. In S.  cerevisiae, an increase in PtdMEA in membranes is associated with reduced  viability. This raises a question regarding the role of PMEAMT in plants and  whether it serves to prevent the accumulation of PtdMEA to potentially  deleterious levels.', '2010 Sep 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110.112151', 'Weretilnyk']
