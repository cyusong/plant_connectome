The relationship between nitric oxide (NO) and salicylic acid (SA) was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here it is shown that SA is able to induce NO synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in Arabidopsis. NO production was detected by confocal microscopic analysis and spectrofluorometric assay in plant roots and cultured cells. To identify the metabolic pathways involved in SA-induced NO synthesis, genetic and pharmacological approaches were adopted. The analysis of the nia1,nia2 mutant showed that nitrate reductase activity was not required for SA-induced NO production. Experiments performed in the presence of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor suggested the involvement of NOS-like enzyme activity in this metabolic pathway. Moreover, the production of NO by SA treatment of Atnos1 mutant plants was strongly reduced compared with wild-type plants. Components of the SA signalling pathway giving rise to NO production were identified, and both calcium and casein kinase 2 (CK2) were demonstrated to be involved. Taken together, these results suggest that SA induces NO production at least in part through the activity of a NOS-like enzyme and that calcium and CK2 activity are essential components of the signalling cascade.
