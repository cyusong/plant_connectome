Plant cells sheath themselves in a complex lattice of polysaccharides, proteins and enzymes forming an integral matrix known as the cell wall. Cellulose microfibrils, the primary component of cell walls, are synthesized at the plasma membrane by CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins throughout cellular growth and are responsible for turgor-driven anisotropic expansion. Associations between hormone signaling and cell wall biosynthesis have long been suggested, but recently direct links have been found revealing hormones play key regulatory roles in cellulose biosynthesis. The radially swollen 1 (rsw1) allele of Arabidopsis thaliana CESA1 harbors a single amino acid change that renders the protein unstable at high temperatures. We used the conditional nature of rsw1 to investigate how auxin contributes to isotropic growth. We found that exogenous auxin treatment reduces isotropic swelling in rsw1 roots at the restrictive temperature of 30�C. We also discovered decreases in auxin influx between rsw1 and wild-type roots via confocal imaging of AUX1-YFP, even at the permissive temperature of 19�C. Moreover, rsw1 displayed mis-expression of auxin-responsive and CESA genes. Additionally, we found altered auxin maxima in rsw1 mutant roots at the onset of swelling using DII-VENUS and DR5:vYFP auxin reporters. Overall, we conclude disrupted cell wall biosynthesis perturbs auxin transport leading to altered auxin homeostasis impacting both anisotropic and isotropic growth that affects overall root morphology.
