A soybean E3 ubiquitin ligase, GmRNF1a, may affect pod dehiscence and seed development through MADS family genes. These results would be useful for the study of soybean pod and seed development. Pod dehiscence is one of the critical causes of yield loss in cultivated soybeans, and it is of great significance to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pod dehiscence in soybeans. In this study, we identified a new RING family member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, GmRNF1a, which was observed to interact with the MADS-box protein GmAGL1 to regulate siliques dehiscence. Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that GmRNF1a was mainly expressed in flowers and pods in soybean. The subcellular localization assay showed the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of GmRNF1a. In addition, it was found that GmRNF1a exhibits higher promoter activity in soybean hairy roots as well as in Arabidopsis leaves, flowers, and siliques. Heterologous expression of GmRNF1a in Arabidopsis showed that the transgenic Arabidopsis siliques had a faster maturation rate and cracked earlier than the wild-type plants. The functional and nucleotide diversity analysis suggests that GmRNF1a might play an important role in pod maturation and dehiscence and has been strongly selected for during soybean domestication.
