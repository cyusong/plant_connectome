['23771893', 'This study characterizes the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis (PPSB) in  Arabidopsis thaliana by targeting phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP1), the last  enzyme of the pathway. Lack of PSP1 activity delayed embryo development, leading  to aborted embryos that could be classified as early curled cotyledons. The  embryo-lethal phenotype of psp1 mutants could be complemented with PSP1 cDNA  under the control of Pro35S (Pro35S:PSP1). However, this construct, which was  poorly expressed in the anther tapetum, did not complement mutant fertility.  Microspore development in psp1.1/psp1.1 Pro35S:PSP1 arrested at the polarized  stage. The tapetum from these lines displayed delayed and irregular development.  The expression of PSP1 in the tapetum at critical stages of microspore  development suggests that PSP1 activity in this cell layer is essential in pollen  development. In addition to embryo death and male sterility, conditional psp1  mutants displayed a short-root phenotype, which was reverted in the presence of  Ser. A metabolomic study demonstrated that the PPSB plays a crucial role in plant  metabolism by affecting glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the  biosynthesis of amino acids. We provide evidence of the crucial role of the PPSB  in embryo, pollen, and root development and suggest that this pathway is an  important link connecting primary metabolism with development.', '2013 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.112359', 'Ros']
