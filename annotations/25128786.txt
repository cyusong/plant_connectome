Quantitative PCR studies need proper reference genes with expression stability exclusively validated under certain experimental conditions. The expression stability of several genes commonly used as references was tested under 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) and temperature treatment. Different statistical approaches (qBase(PLUS), BestKeeper, NormFinder) were used to prepare rankings of expression stability in two species of an economic importance: common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Candidate reference genes were shown to be regulated differentially in these two plant species. The maximum stability values indicated that the expression stability was higher in T. aestivum. Taking into account of all ranks it seems that TBP-1 and UBI in ryegrass and ACT, ADP and EF1A in wheat should be used as reference genes in the brassinosteroids and temperature involving studies.
