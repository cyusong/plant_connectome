Aluminum (Al) and proton (H(+)) are 2 coexisting rhizotoxicities limiting plant growth in acid soils. Sensitive to Proton Rhizotoxicity (STOP) 1-like zinc finger transcription factors play important roles in regulating expression of downstream genes involved in tolerance mechanism of either stress. In this mini-review, we summarized recent advances in characterizing STOP1-like proteins with respect to plant Al and H(+) tolerance. The possible involvement of structure-function of STOP1-like proteins in differential regulation of Al and H(+) tolerance are discussed. In addition, we also direct research in this area to protein phosphorylation.
