['17726025', 'There is much uncertainty as to whether plants use arogenate, phenylpyruvate, or  both as obligatory intermediates in Phe biosynthesis, an essential dietary amino  acid for humans. This is because both prephenate and arogenate have been reported  to undergo decarboxylative dehydration in plants via the action of either  arogenate (ADT) or prephenate (PDT) dehydratases; however, neither enzyme(s) nor  encoding gene(s) have been isolated and/or functionally characterized. An in  silico data mining approach was thus undertaken to attempt to identify the  dehydratase(s) involved in Phe formation in Arabidopsis, based on sequence  similarity of PDT-like and ACT-like domains in bacteria. This data mining  approach suggested that there are six PDT-like homologues in Arabidopsis, whose  phylogenetic analyses separated them into three distinct subgroups. All six genes  were cloned and subsequently established to be expressed in all tissues examined.  Each was then expressed as a Nus fusion recombinant protein in Escherichia coli,  with their substrate specificities measured in vitro. Three of the resulting  recombinant proteins, encoded by ADT1 (At1g11790), ADT2 (At3g07630), and ADT6  (At1g08250), more efficiently utilized arogenate than prephenate, whereas the  remaining three, ADT3 (At2g27820), ADT4 (At3g44720), and ADT5 (At5g22630)  essentially only employed arogenate. ADT1, ADT2, and ADT6 had k(cat)/Km values of  1050, 7650, and 1560 M(-1) S(-1) for arogenate versus 38, 240, and 16 M(-1) S(-1)  for prephenate, respectively. By contrast, the remaining three, ADT3, ADT4, and  ADT5, had k(cat)/Km values of 1140, 490, and 620 M(-1) S(-1), with prephenate not  serving as a substrate unless excess recombinant protein (>150 microg/assay) was  used. All six genes, and their corresponding proteins, are thus provisionally  classified as arogenate dehydratases and designated ADT1-ADT6.', '2007 Oct 19', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M702662200', 'Lewis']
