['20807215', 'Two different gene families have been proposed to act as sorting receptors for  vacuolar storage cargo in plants: the vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs) and the  receptor homology-transmembrane-RING H2 domain proteins (RMRs). However,  functional data on these genes is scarce and the identity of the sorting receptor  for storage proteins remains controversial. Through a genetic screen we have  identified the mtv2 mutant, which is defective in vacuolar transport of the  storage cargo VAC2 in shoot apices. Map-based cloning revealed that mtv2 is a  loss of function allele of the VSR4 gene. We show that VSR1, VSR3 and VSR4, but  not the remaining VSRs or RMRs, participate in vacuolar sorting of VAC2 in  vegetative tissues, and 12S globulins and 2S albumins in seeds, an activity that  is essential for seedling germination vigor. Finally, we demonstrate that the  functional diversification in the VSR family results from divergent expression  patterns and also from distinct sorting activities of the family members.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04349.x', 'Rojo']
