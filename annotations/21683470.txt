Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants were transformed with an antisense construct of a cDNA encoding tomato telomere-binding protein (LeTBP1) to describe the role of a telomere-binding protein at the whole plant level. Fruit size decreased corresponding to the degree of suppression of LeTBP1 expression. This inhibition of fruit development was likely due to a decrease in the number of seeds in the LeTBP1 antisense plants. Pollen fertility and pollen germination rate decreased in accordance with the degree of suppression of LeTBP1 expression. Ovule viability was also reduced in the LeTBP1 antisense plants. Although plant height was somewhat reduced in the antisense plants compared to the control plants, the number and weight of leaves were unaffected by LeTBP1 suppression. The number and morphology of flowers were also normal in the antisense plants. These indicate that reduced fertility in the antisense plants is not an indirect effect of altered vegetative growth. LeTBP1 expression was sensitive to temperature stress in wild-type plants. We conclude that LeTBP1 plays a critical role in seed and fruit development rather than vegetative growth and flower formation.
