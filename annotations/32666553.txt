Crop domestication and improvement often concurrently affect plant resistance to pests and production of secondary metabolites, creating challenges for isolating the ecological implications of selection for specific metabolites. Cucurbitacins are bitter triterpenoids with extreme phenotypic differences between Cucurbitaceae lineages, yet we lack integrated models of herbivore preference, cucurbitacin accumulation, and underlying genetic mechanisms. In Cucurbita pepo, we dissected the effect of cotyledon cucurbitacins on preference of a specialist insect pest (Acalymma vittatum) for multiple tissues, assessed genetic loci underlying cucurbitacin accumulation in diverse germplasm and a biparental F<sub>2</sub> population (from a cross between two independent domesticates), and characterized quantitative associations between gene expression and metabolites during seedling development. Acalymma vittatum affinity for cotyledons is mediated by cucurbitacins, but other traits contribute to whole-plant resistance. Cotyledon cucurbitacin accumulation was associated with population structure, and our genetic mapping identified a single locus, Bi-4, containing genes relevant to transport and regulation - not biosynthesis - that diverged between lineages. These candidate genes were expressed during seedling development, most prominently a putative secondary metabolite transporter. Taken together, these findings support the testable hypothesis that breeding for plant resistance to insects involves targeting genes for regulation and transport of defensive metabolites, in addition to core biosynthesis genes.
