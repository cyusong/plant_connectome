['11114524', 'Genes of the FERTILISATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) class regulate cell  proliferation during reproductive development in Arabidopsis [1-5]. The FIS genes  FERTILISATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MEDEA (MEA) encode homologs of  animal Polycomb group (Pc-G) proteins, transcriptional regulators that modify  chromatin structure and are thought to form multimeric complexes [3-11]. To test  whether similarities in fis mutant phenotypes reflect interactions between their  protein products, we characterised FIE RNA and protein localisation in vivo, and  FIE protein interactions in yeast and in vitro. Expression of FIE mRNA overlaps  with that of MEA during embryo sac and seed development and is unaffected in mea  mutants. Results from the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro pull-down assay  indicate that MEA and FIE proteins interact. The relevance of this interaction in  vivo is supported by the finding that FIE and MEA co-localise in the nucleus in  transfected plant cells. Interaction of MEA and FIE is mediated by the  amino-terminal region of MEA. Despite sequence divergence in this domain, MEA can  interact with its corresponding animal partner Extrasexcombs (ESC) in the yeast  two-hybrid system. We conclude that FIE and MEA act together as part of a  multimeric complex and that this accounts for the similarities in mutant  phenotypes. We propose that an ancient mechanism for chromatin modification has  been independently recruited to different developmental processes in the two  kingdoms.', '2000 Nov 30', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00839-3', 'Goodrich']
