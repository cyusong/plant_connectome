['21801251', 'CtBP/BARS is a unique protein family in having quite diversified cellular  functions, intercellular localizations, and developmental roles. ANGUSTIFOLIA  (AN) is the sole homolog of CtBP/BARS from Arabidopsis thaliana, although it has  plant AN-specific motifs and a long C-terminus. Previous studies suggested that  AN would function in the nucleus as a transcriptional co-repressor, as CtBPs  function in animals; however, precise verification has been lacking. In this  paper, we isolated a homologous gene (MAN) of AN from liverwort, Marchantia  polymorpha. Transformation of the Arabidopsis an-1 mutant with 35S-driven MAN  completely complemented the an-1 phenotype, although it lacks the putative  nuclear localization signal (NLS) that exists in AN proteins isolated from other  plant species. We constructed several plasmids for expressing modified ANs with  amino acid substitutions in known motifs. The results clearly indicated that  modified AN with mutations in the putative NLS-like domain could complement the  an-1 phenotype. Therefore, we re-examined localization of AN using several  techniques. Our results demonstrated that AN localizes on punctuate structures  around the Golgi, partially overlapping with a trans-Golgi network resident,  which highlighted an unexpected link between leaf development and membrane  trafficking. We should reconsider the roles and evolutionary traits of AN based  on these findings.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04731.x', 'Tsukaya']
