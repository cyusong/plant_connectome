['23377040', 'We identify an Arabidopsis pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase, VAS1,  whose loss-of-function simultaneously increases amounts of the phytohormone auxin  and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate. VAS1 uses the  ethylene biosynthetic intermediate methionine as an amino donor and the auxin  biosynthetic intermediate indole-3-pyruvic acid as an amino acceptor to produce  L-tryptophan and 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid. Our data indicate that VAS1  serves key roles in coordinating the amounts of these two vital hormones.', '2013 Apr', 'Nat Chem Biol', '10.1038/nchembio.1178', 'Chory']
