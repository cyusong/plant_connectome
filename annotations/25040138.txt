Plant salinity tolerance is a physiologically complex trait, with numerous mechanisms contributing to it. In this work, we show that the ability of leaf mesophyll to retain K(+) represents an important and essentially overlooked component of a salinity tolerance mechanism. The strong positive correlation between mesophyll K(+) retention ability under saline conditions (quantified by the magnitude of NaCl-induced K(+) efflux from mesophyll) and the overall salinity tolerance (relative fresh weight and/or survival or damage under salinity stress) was found while screening 46 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes contrasting in their salinity tolerance. Genotypes with intrinsically higher leaf K(+) content under control conditions were found to possess better K(+) retention ability under salinity and, hence, overall higher tolerance. Contrary to previous reports for barley roots, K(+) retention in mesophyll was not associated with an increased H(+) -pumping in tolerant varieties but instead correlated negatively with this trait. These findings are explained by the fact that increased H(+) extrusion may be needed to charge balance the activity and provide the driving force for the high affinity HAK/KUP K(+) transporters required to restore cytosolic K(+) homeostasis in salt-sensitive genotypes.
