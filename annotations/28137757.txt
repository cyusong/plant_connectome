['28137757', 'Factors regulating dynamics of chromatin structure have direct impact on  expression of genetic information. Cohesin is a multi-subunit protein complex  that is crucial for pairing sister chromatids during cell division, DNA repair  and regulation of gene transcription and silencing. In non-plant species, cohesin  is loaded on chromatin by the Scc2-Scc4 complex (also known as the NIBPL-MAU2  complex). Here, we identify the Arabidopsis homolog of Scc4, which we denote  Arabidopsis thaliana (At)SCC4, and show that it forms a functional complex with  AtSCC2, the homolog of Scc2. We demonstrate that AtSCC2 and AtSCC4 act in the  same pathway, and that both proteins are indispensable for cell fate  determination during early stages of embryo development. Mutant embryos lacking  either of these proteins develop only up to the globular stage, and show the  suspensor overproliferation phenotype preceded by ectopic auxin maxima  distribution. We further establish a new assay to reveal the AtSCC4-dependent  dynamics of cohesin loading on chromatin in vivo Our findings define the  Scc2-Scc4 complex as an evolutionary conserved machinery controlling cohesin  loading and chromatin structure maintenance, and provide new insight into the  plant-specific role of this complex in controlling cell fate during  embryogenesis.', '2017 Mar 15', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.196865', 'ORCID:']
