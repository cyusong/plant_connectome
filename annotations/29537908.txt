Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) is an efficient cover forage that controls weeds, pathogens and nematodes, and the non-protein amino acid L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is its main allelochemical. The effects of 3 g L<sup>-1</sup> of an aqueous extract of velvet bean seeds, along with 0.5 mM L-DOPA for comparison, were evaluated in roots, stems and leaves of soybean (Glycine max). The activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) were determined, along with the lignin content and its monomeric composition. The results revealed similar effects caused by L-DOPA and the aqueous extract. Both treatments reduced PAL and CAD activities, lignin, and lignin monomer contents in roots; PAL and CAD activities in stems, and CAD activity in leaves. These findings provide further evidence that the effects of velvet bean cover forage on root lignification were due to the L-DOPA, its major allelochemical.
