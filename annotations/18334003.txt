Acid phosphatase (ACP) activity has been detected in roots of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Phoenix canariensis. This enzyme was ultrastructurally localized in arbusculate coils for the first time. This localization was carried out using a cerium-based method, which minimizes non-specific precipitation. The ACP was localized in inter- and intracellular hyphae, in the fungal cytoplasm as well as at the interface and the fungal cell wall and the periarbuscular membrane limiting it. The novel localization of an ACP in the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) interface of arbusculate coils suggests that this enzyme may be involved in the phosphorus efflux from the mycorrhizal fungus to the host. The results presented in this article indicate that the role played by ACP in AM symbiosis may be more important than was previously thought and that arbusculate coils are highly relevant when considering nutrient transfer through AM symbiosis.
