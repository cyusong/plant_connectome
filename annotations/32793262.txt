Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are non-autonomous class II transposons which have been shown to influence genome evolution. <i>Brassica nigra</i> L. (B-genome) is one of three <i>Brassica</i> diploids cultivated primarily as an oil crop, which harbors novel alleles important for breeding. Two new high copy hAT MITE families (BniHAT-1 and BniHAT-2) from the B-genome were characterized and their prevalence assessed in the genomes of the related diploids, <i>rapa</i> L. (A) and <i>Brassica oleracea</i> L. (C). Both novel MITE families were present at high copy numbers in the B-genome with 434 and 331 copies of BniHAT-1 and BniHAT-2, respectively. Yet less than 20 elements were identified in the genome assemblies of the A, and C -genomes, supporting B-genome specific proliferation of these MITE families. Although apparently randomly distributed across the genome, 68 and 70% of the B-genome MITEs were present within 2 kb flanking regions of annotated genes suggesting they might influence gene expression and/or function. In addition, MITE derived microRNAs and transcription factor binding sites suggested a putative role in gene regulation. Age of insertion analysis revealed that the major proliferation of these elements occurred during 2-3 million years ago. Additionally, site-specific polymorphism analyses showed that 44% MITEs were undergoing active amplification into the B-genome. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of two high copy MITE families, which were specifically amplified in the B-genome, suggesting a potential role in shaping the <i>Brassica</i> B-genome.
