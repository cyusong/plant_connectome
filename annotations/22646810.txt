Although there is now a considerable literature on the inhibition of leaf respiration (CO(2) evolution) by light, little is known about the effect of other environmental conditions on day respiratory metabolism. In particular, CO(2) and O(2) mole fractions are assumed to cause changes in the tricarboxylic acid pathway (TCAP) but the amplitude and even the direction of such changes are still a matter of debate. Here, we took advantage of isotopic techniques, new simple equations and instant freeze sampling to follow respiratory metabolism in illuminated cocklebur leaves (Xanthium strumarium L.) under different CO(2) /O(2) conditions. Gas exchange coupled to online isotopic analysis showed that CO(2) evolved by leaves in the light came from 'old' carbon skeletons and there was a slight decrease in (13) C natural abundance when [CO(2) ] increased. This suggested the involvement of enzymatic steps fractionating more strongly against (13) C and thus increasingly limiting for the metabolic respiratory flux as [CO(2) ] increased. Isotopic labelling with (13) C(2) -2,4-citrate lead to (13) C-enriched Glu and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), clearly demonstrating poor metabolism of citrate by the TCAP. There was a clear relationship between the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate oxygenation-to-carboxylation ratio (v(o) /v(c) ) and the (13) C commitment to 2OG, demonstrating that 2OG and Glu synthesis via the TCAP is positively influenced by photorespiration.
