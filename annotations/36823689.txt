Excessive softening during fleshy fruit ripening leads to physical damage and infection that reduce quality and cause massive supply chain losses. Changes in cell wall (CW) metabolism, involving loosening and disassembly of the constituent macromolecules, are the main cause of softening. Several genes encoding CW metabolizing enzymes have been targeted for genetic modification to attenuate softening. At least nine genes encoding CW modifying proteins have increased expression during ripening. Any alteration of these genes could modify CW structure and properties and contribute to softening, but evidence for their relative importance is sparse. The results of studies with transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the model for fleshy fruit ripening, investigations with strawberry (Fragaria spp.) and apple (Malus domestica), and results from naturally occurring textural mutants provide direct evidence of gene function and the contribution of CW biochemical modifications to fruit softening. Here we review the revised CW structure model and biochemical and structural changes in CW components during fruit softening and then focus on and integrate the results of changes in CW characteristics derived from studies on transgenic fruits and mutants. Potential strategies and future research directions to understand and control the rate of fruit softening are also discussed.
