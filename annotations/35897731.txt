<i>Myrothamnus flabellifolia</i> is the only woody resurrection plant found in the world and can survive from long-term desiccation. Therefore, <i>M. flabellifolia</i> could be considered as a valuable resource for study of plant adaptation to abiotic stress. However, few genes related to its drought tolerance have been functionally characterized and the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress tolerance of <i>M. flabellifolia</i> are largely unknown. The phytochrome interacting factor (PIF) family is a group of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and functions as the core regulator in plant growth and development. However, less is known of its participation in abiotic stress response. In this study, we isolated and characterized a dehydration-inducible PIF gene <i>MfPIF8</i> from <i>M. flabellifolia</i>. Heterologous expression of <i>MfPIF8</i> in Arabidopsis enhanced tolerance to drought and salinity stresses at seedling and adult stages. It significantly increased primary root length and stomatal aperture (ration of length/width) under stress treatments and decreased water loss rate. Compared with WT, the transgenic lines overexpressing <i>MfPIF8</i> exhibited higher chlorophyll content and lower malondialdehyde accumulation. The abilities of osmotic adjustment and reactive oxygen species scavenging were also enhanced in <i>MfPIF8</i> transgenic lines. These results suggest that MfPIF8 may participate in the positive regulation of abiotic stress responses. Additional investigation of its mechanism is needed in the future.
