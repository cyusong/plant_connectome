We have characterized four novel constitutive promoters ARP1, H3F3, HSP and H2BF3 that are active in all tissues/stages of transgenic plants and stable over two homozygous generations. Gene promoters that are active and stable over several generations in transgenic plants are valuable tools for plant research and biotechnology. In this study, we characterized four putative constitutive promoters (ARP1, H3F3, HSP and H2BF3) in transgenic rice plants. Promoter regions were fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene and transformed into rice. Single-copy transgenic lines were then selected and promoter activity was analyzed in various organs and tissues of two successive homozygous generations. All four promoters showed a broad expression profile in most tissues and developmental stages, and indeed the expression of the ARP1 and H3F3 promoters was even greater than that of the PGD1 promoter, a previously described constitutive promoter that has been used in transgenic rice. This observation was based on expression levels in leaves, roots, dry seeds and flowers in both the T2 and T3 generations. Each promoter exhibited comparable levels of activity over two homozygous generations with no sign of transgene silencing, which is an important characteristic of promoters to be used in crop biotechnology applications. These promoters therefore have considerable potential value for the stable and constitutive expression of transgenes in monocotyledonous crops.
