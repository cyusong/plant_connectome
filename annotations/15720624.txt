The present study aimed to investigate the effects of root surface iron plaque on the uptake kinetics of arsenite and arsenate by excised roots of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings. The results demonstrated that the presence of iron plaque enhanced arsenite and decreased arsenate uptake. Arsenite and arsenate uptake kinetics were adequately fitted by the Michaelis-Menten function in the absence of plaque, but produced poor fits to this function in the presence of plaque. Phosphate in the uptake solution did not have a significant effect on arsenite uptake irrespective of the presence of iron plaque; however phosphate had a significant effect on arsenate uptake. Without iron plaque, phosphate inhibited arsenate uptake. The presence of iron plaque diminished the effect of phosphate on arsenate uptake, possibly through a combined effect of arsenate desorption from iron plaque.
