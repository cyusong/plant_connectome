Plant architecture plays a major role in canopy photosynthesis and biomass production, and plants adjust their growth (and thus architecture) in response to changing environments. Leaf angle is one of the most important traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.) plant architecture, because leaf angle strongly affects leaf direction and rice production, with more-erect leaves being advantageous for high-density plantings. The degree of leaf bending depends on the morphology of the lamina joint, which connects the leaf and the sheath. In this review, we discuss cell morphology in different lamina joint tissues and describe the underlying genetic network that governs this morphology and thus regulates leaf direction. Furthermore, we focus on the mechanism by how environmental factors influence rice leaf angle. Our review provides a theoretical framework for the future genetic improvement of rice leaf orientation and plant architecture.
