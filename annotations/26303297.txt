['26303297', 'We studied the role of Arabidopsis thaliana TCP15, a member of the TEOSINTE  BRANCHED1-CYCLOIDEA-PCF (TCP) transcription factor family, in gynoecium  development. Plants that express TCP15 from the 35S CaMV promoter (35S:TCP15)  develop flowers with defects in carpel fusion and a reduced number of stigmatic  papillae. In contrast, the expression of TCP15 fused to a repressor domain from  its own promoter causes the development of outgrowths topped with stigmatic  papillae from the replum. 35S:TCP15 plants show lower levels of the auxin  indoleacetic acid and reduced expression of the auxin reporter DR5 and the auxin  biosynthesis genes YUCCA1 and YUCCA4, suggesting that TCP15 is a repressor of  auxin biosynthesis. Treatment of plants with cytokinin enhances the developmental  effects of expressing TCP15 or its repressor form. In addition, treatment of a  knock-out double mutant in TCP15 and the related gene TCP14 with cytokinin causes  replum enlargement, increased development of outgrowths, and the induction of the  auxin biosynthesis genes YUCCA1 and YUCCA4. A comparison of the phenotypes  observed after cytokinin treatment of plants with altered expression levels of  TCP15 and auxin biosynthesis genes suggests that TCP15 modulates gynoecium  development by influencing auxin homeostasis. We propose that the correct  development of the different tissues of the gynoecium requires a balance between  auxin levels and cytokinin responses, and that TCP15 participates in a feedback  loop that helps to adjust this balance.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12992', 'Gonzalez']
