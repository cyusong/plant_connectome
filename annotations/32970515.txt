The oxygen-evolving complex is integrated into photosystem (PSII). An essential part of oxygenic photosynthetic apparatus, embedded in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. The OEC is a super catalyst to split water into molecular oxygen in the presence of light. The OEC consist of four Mn atoms, one Ca atom and five oxygen atoms (CaMn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and this cluster is maintained by its surrounding proteins <i>viz</i>., PsbQ, PsbP, PsbO, PsbR. The function of this super catalyst with a high turnover frequency of 500 s<sup>-1</sup> in standard condition. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (OJIP transients) are used to understand structural and functional cohesion of photosynthetic apparatus. A further K-peak in OJIP curve reflects damage at the OEC donor site in response to salinity, drought, and high temperature. The decline in performance indices (PI, SFI) also revealed structural damage of photosynthetic apparatus that leads to disruption of electron transport rate under abiotic conditions. This review discusses the structural and function cohesion of the OEC in plant against variable abiotic conditions.
