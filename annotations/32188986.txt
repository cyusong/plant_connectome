The light-harvesting phycobilisome complex is an important component of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and red algae. Phycobilisomes are composed of phycobiliproteins, including the blue phycobiliprotein phycocyanin, that are considered high-value products with applications in several industries. Remarkably, several cyanobacteria and red algal species retain the capacity to harvest light and photosynthesise under highly selective environments such as hot springs, and flourish in extremes of pH and elevated temperatures. These thermophilic organisms produce thermostable phycobiliproteins, which have superior qualities much needed for wider adoption of these natural pigment-proteins in the food, textile, and other industries. Here we review the available literature on the thermostability of phycobilisome components from thermophilic species and discuss how a better appreciation of phycobiliproteins from extreme environments will benefit our fundamental understanding of photosynthetic adaptation and could provide a sustainable resource for several industrial processes.
