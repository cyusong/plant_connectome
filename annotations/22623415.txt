We isolated Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with incurved vegetative leaves. Positional cloning of incurvata8 (icu8), icu9 and icu15 has identified them as new loss-of-function alleles of the HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) and HUA ENHANCER1 (HEN1) genes, respectively, which encode known components of the microRNA pathway. The morphological and histological characterization of these mutants and of dicer-like1-9 indicates that small RNAs participate in the proximal-distal and adaxial-abaxial patterning of leaves, as well as in stomatal number establishment. The abnormal vasculature of ago1 and hyl1 leaves also suggests a role for AGO1 and HYL1 in venation patterning. Our mutants expand the allelic series of AGO1, HYL1 and HEN1, and might help to understand the developmental and cellular significance of miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation.
