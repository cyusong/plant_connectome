Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel class of endogenous long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and participates in diverse physiological process in plants. From the dataset obtained by high-throughput RNA sequencing, we identified a circRNA encoded by the sense strand of the exon regions spanning two RuBisCO small subunit genes, <i>RBCS2B</i> and <i>RBCS3B</i>, in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We further applied the single specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing techniques to verify this circRNA and named it <i>ag-circRBCS</i> (<i>antisense and across genic-circular</i> RNA <i>RBCS</i>). Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that <i>ag-circRBCS</i> shares a similar rhythmic expression pattern with other <i>RBCS</i> genes. The expression level of <i>ag-circRBCS</i> is 10-40 times lower than the expression levels of <i>RBCS</i> genes in the photosynthetic organs in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, whereas the <i>Arabidopsis</i> root lacked <i>ag-circRBCS</i> expression. Furthermore, we used the delaminated layered double hydroxide lactate nanosheets (LDH-lactate-NS) to deliver <i>in vitro</i> synthesized <i>ag-circRBCS</i> into <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings. Our results indicate that <i>ag-circRBCS</i> could significantly depress the expression of <i>RBCS</i>. Given that <i>ag-circRBCS</i> was expressed at low concentration <i>in vivo</i>, we suggest that <i>ag-circRBCS</i> may represent a fine-tuning mechanism to regulating the expression of <i>RBCS</i> genes and protein content in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
