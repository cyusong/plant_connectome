Plants have developed sophisticated strategies to coordinate growth and immunity, but our understanding of the underlying mechanism remains limited. In this study, we identified a novel molecular module that regulates plant growth and defense in both compatible and incompatible infections. This module consisted of BZR1, a key transcription factor in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, and EDS1, an essential positive regulator of plant innate immunity. We found that EDS1 interacts with BZR1 and suppresses its transcriptional activities. Consistently, upregulation of EDS1 function by a virulent Pseudomonas syringae strain or salicylic acid treatment inhibited BZR1-regulated expression of BR-responsive genes and BR-promoted growth. Furthermore, we showed that the cytoplasmic fraction of BZR1 positively regulates effector-triggered immunity (ETI) controlled by the TIR-NB-LRR protein RPS4, which is attenuated by BZR1's nuclear translocation. Mechanistically, cytoplasmic BZR1 facilitated AvrRps4-triggered dissociation of EDS1 and RPS4 by binding to EDS1, thus leading to efficient activation of RPS4-controlled ETI. Notably, transgenic expression of a mutant BZR1 that accumulates exclusively in the cytoplasm improved pathogen resistance without compromising plant growth. Collectively, these results shed new light on plant growth-defense coordination and reveal a previously unknown function for the cytoplasmic fraction of BZR1. The BZR1-EDS1 module may be harnessed for the simultaneous improvement of crop productivity and pathogen resistance.
