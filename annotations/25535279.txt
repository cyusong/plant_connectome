['25535279', 'Cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) at the plasma membrane (PM) are aligned with  cortical microtubules (MTs) and direct the biosynthesis of cellulose. The  mechanism of the interaction between CSCs and MTs, and the cellular determinants  that control the delivery of CSCs at the PM, are not yet well understood. We  identified a unique small molecule, CESA TRAFFICKING INHIBITOR (CESTRIN), which  reduces cellulose content and alters the anisotropic growth of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls. We monitored the distribution and mobility of  fluorescently labeled cellulose synthases (CESAs) in live Arabidopsis cells under  chemical exposure to characterize their subcellular effects. CESTRIN reduces the  velocity of PM CSCs and causes their accumulation in the cell cortex. The  CSC-associated proteins KORRIGAN1 (KOR1) and POM2/CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE  PROTEIN1 (CSI1) were differentially affected by CESTRIN treatment, indicating  different forms of association with the PM CSCs. KOR1 accumulated in bodies  similar to CESA; however, POM2/CSI1 dissociated into the cytoplasm. In addition,  MT stability was altered without direct inhibition of MT polymerization,  suggesting a feedback mechanism caused by cellulose interference. The selectivity  of CESTRIN was assessed using a variety of subcellular markers for which no  morphological effect was observed. The association of CESAs with vesicles  decorated by the trans-Golgi network-localized protein SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS61  (SYP61) was increased under CESTRIN treatment, implicating SYP61 compartments in  CESA trafficking. The properties of CESTRIN compared with known CESA inhibitors  afford unique avenues to study and understand the mechanism under which  PM-associated CSCs are maintained and interact with MTs and to dissect their  trafficking routes in etiolated hypocotyls.', '2015 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.249003', 'Drakakaki']
