Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5PTases) function in inositol signaling by regulating the catabolism of phosphoinositol derivatives. Previous reports showed that 5PTases play a critical role in plant development and stress responses. In this study, we identified a novel 5PTase gene, <i>Gs5PTase8</i>, from the salt-tolerance locus of chromosome 3 in wild soybean (<i>Glycine</i> <i>soja</i>). <i>Gs5PTase8</i> is highly up-regulated under salt treatment. It is localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane with a strong signal in the apoplast. Ectopic expression of <i>Gs5PTase8</i> significantly increased salt tolerance in transgenic BY-2 cells, soybean hairy roots and Arabidopsis, suggesting Gs5PTase8 could increase salt tolerance in plants. The overexpression of <i>Gs5PTase8</i> significantly enhanced the activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase under salt stress. The seeds of <i>Gs5PTase8</i>-transgenic Arabidopsis germinated earlier than the wild type under abscisic acid treatment, indicating Gs5PTase8 would alter ABA sensitivity. Besides, transcriptional analyses showed that the stress-responsive genes, <i>AtRD22</i>, <i>AtRD29A</i> and <i>AtRD29B</i>, were induced with a higher level in the <i>Gs5PTase8</i>-transgenic Arabidopsis plants than in the wild type under salt stress. These results reveal that Gs5PTase8 play a positive role in salt tolerance and might be a candidate gene for improving soybean adaptation to salt stress.
