Grain aphid (<i>Sitobion miscanthi</i>) is one of the most dominant and devastating insect pests in wheat, which causes substantial losses to wheat production each year. Engineering transgenic plants expressing double strand RNA (dsRNA) targeting an insect-specific gene has been demonstrated to provide an alternative environmentally friendly strategy for aphid management through plant-mediated RNA interference (RNAi). Here we identified and characterized a novel potential RNAi target gene (<i>SmDSR33</i>) which was a gene encoding a putative salivary protein. We then generated stable transgenic wheat lines expressing dsRNA for targeted silencing of <i>SmDSR33</i> in grain aphids through plant-mediated RNAi. After feeding on transgenic wheat plants expressing <i>SmDSR33</i>-dsRNA, the attenuated expression levels of <i>SmDSR33</i> in aphids were observed when compared to aphids feeding on wild-type plants. The decreased <i>SmDSR33</i> expression levels thus resulted in significantly reduced fecundity and survival, and decreased reproduction of aphids. We also observed altered aphid feeding behaviors such as longer duration of intercellular stylet pathway and shorter duration of passive ingestion in electroneurography assays. Furthermore, both the surviving aphids and their offspring exhibited decreased survival rates and fecundity, indicating that the silencing effect could be persistent and transgenerational in grain aphids. The results demonstrated that <i>SmDSR33</i> can be selected as an effective RNAi target for wheat aphid control. Silencing of an essential salivary protein gene involved in ingestion through plant-mediated RNAi could be exploited as an effective strategy for aphid control in wheat.
