RCY1, which encodes a coiled coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class R protein, confers the hypersensitive response (HR) to a yellow strain of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV[Y]) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Nicotiana benthamiana transformed with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged RCY1 (RCY1-HA) also exhibited a defense response accompanied by HR cell death and induction of defense-related gene expression in response to CMV(Y). Following transient expression of RCY1-HA by agroinfiltration, the defense reaction was induced in N. benthamiana leaves infected with CMV(Y) but not in virulent CMV(B2)-infected N. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing RCY1-HA or CMV(Y)-infected N. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing HA-tagged RPP8 (RPP8-HA), which is allelic to RCY1. This result suggests that Arabidopsis RCY1-conferred resistance to CMV(Y) could be reproduced in N. benthamiana leaves in a gene-for-gene manner. Expression of a series of chimeric constructs between RCY1-HA and RPP8-HA in CMV(Y)-infected N. benthamiana indicated that induction of defense responses to CMV(Y) is regulated by the LRR domain of RCY1. Interestingly, in CMV(Y)-infected N. benthamiana manifesting the defense response, the levels of both RCY1 and chimeric proteins harboring the RCY1 LRR domain were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data indicate that the RCY1-conferred resistance response to CMV(Y) is regulated by an LRR domain-mediated interaction with CMV(Y) and seems to be tightly associated with the degradation of RCY1 in response to CMV(Y).
