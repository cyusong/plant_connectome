['15953472', 'PSI-G is an 11 kDa subunit of PSI in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Arabidopsis  thaliana plants devoid of PSI-G have a decreased PSI content and an increased  activity of NADP(+) photoreduction in vitro but otherwise no obvious phenotype.  To investigate the biochemical basis for the increased activity, the kinetic  parameters of the reaction between PSI and plastocyanin were determined. PSI-G  clearly plays a role in the affinity for plastocyanin since the dissociation  constant (K(D)) is only 12 muM in the absence of PSI-G compared to 32 muM for the  wild type. On the physiological level, plants devoid of PSI-G have a more reduced  Q(A). This indicates that the decreased PSI content is due to unstable PSI rather  than an adaptation to the increased activity. In agreement with this indication  of decreased stability, plants devoid of PSI-G were found to be more  photo-inhibited both at low temperature and after high light treatment. The  decreased PSI stability was confirmed in vitro by measuring PSI activity after  illumination of a thylakoid suspension which clearly showed a faster decrease in  PSI activity in the thylakoids lacking PSI-G. Light response of the P700 redox  state in vivo showed that in the absence of PSI-G, P700 is more reduced at low  light intensities. We conclude that PSI-G is involved in the binding dynamics of  plastocyanin to PSI and that PSI-G is important for the stability of the PSI  complex.', '2005 Jun 30', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbabio.2005.02.003', 'Scheller']
