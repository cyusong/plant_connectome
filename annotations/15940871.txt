Hypocotyl segments of 7-day old seedlings of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) cultivars Atalante, Flanders, Jitka, Szegedi 30 and Super were screened for organogenesis (shoot and root induction) and embryo-like structure production. A non-destructive assay for hydroxyl radicals (*OH), utilising DMSO as a radical trap, was used to determine *OH formation during tissue culture and morphogenesis. Desferrioxamine, an inhibitor of Fenton reaction, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, a cytotoxic Lipid peroxidation product, were exogenously applied to flax cultures to determine the effect of antioxidative and prooxidative status on morphogenetic responses induced through the exogenous application of plant growth regulators. Flax genotypes varied in their response to treatments after exposure to different plant hormones. Hydroxyl radical (*OH) formation correlated with morphogenetic responses and this was affected by plant hormones. Desferrioxamine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal also moderated morphogenetic responses and influenced hydroxyl radical formation during in vitro propagation.
