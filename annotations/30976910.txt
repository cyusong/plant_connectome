Isolation of high-quality RNA, including miRNA, from microscopic woody apple bud meristem using laser capture microdissection-based method. It is often challenging to study the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) or genes in less accessible inner tissues of tree species rich in polyphenols or polysaccharides. Here, we report a laser capture microdissection (LCM)-based method for efficient and cost-effective isolation and expression analysis of miRNAs and genes in the meristem tissue of woody apple bud. The tissue fixation, processing, infiltration, and sectioning steps were optimized for LCM-based excision and subsequent RNA isolation. Further, we have confirmed that RNA isolated from LCM-derived apple bud meristem contained miRNAs and was of good quantity and quality, sufficient for downstream expression analysis.
