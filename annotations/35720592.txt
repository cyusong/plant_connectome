Vegetable oils composed of triacylglycerols (TAG) are a major source of calories in human diets. However, the fatty acid compositions of these oils are not ideal for human nutrition and the needs of the food industry. Saturated fatty acids contribute to health problems, while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can become rancid upon storage or processing. In this review, we first summarize the pathways of fatty acid metabolism and TAG synthesis and detail the problems with the oil compositions of major crops. Then we describe how transgenic expression of desaturases and downregulation of the plastid <i>FatB</i> thioesterase have provided the means to lower oil saturates. The traditional solution to PUFA rancidity uses industrial chemistry to reduce PUFA content by partial hydrogenation, but this results in the production of <i>trans</i> fats that are even more unhealthy than saturated fats. We detail the discoveries in the biochemistry and molecular genetics of oil synthesis that provided the knowledge and tools to lower oil PUFA content by blocking their synthesis during seed development. Finally, we describe the successes in breeding and biotechnology that are giving us new, high-oleic, low PUFA varieties of soybean, canola and other oilseed crops.
