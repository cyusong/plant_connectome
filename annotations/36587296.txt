Tocopherols are potent membrane-bound antioxidant molecules that are paramount for plant physiology and also important for human health. In the past years, chlorophyll catabolism was identified as the primary source of phytyl diphosphate for tocopherol synthesis by the action of two enzymes, PHYTOL KINASE (VTE5) and PHYTHYL PHOSPHATE KINASE (VTE6) that are able to recycle the chlorophyll-derived phytol. While VTE5 and VTE6 were proven essential for tocopherol metabolism in tomato fruits, it remains unknown whether they are rate-limiting steps in this pathway. To address this question, transgenic tomato plants expressing AtVTE5 and AtVTE6 in a fruit-specific manner were generated. Although ripe transgenic fruits exhibited higher amounts of tocopherol, phytol recycling revealed a more intimate association with chlorophyll than with tocopherol content. Interestingly, protein-protein interactions assays showed that VTE5 and VTE6 are complexed, channeling free phytol and phytyl-P, thus mitigating their cytotoxic nature. Moreover, the analysis of tocopherol accumulation dynamics in roots, a chlorophyll-devoid organ, revealed VTE5-dependent tocopherol accumulation, hinting at the occurrence of shoot-to-root phytol trafficking. Collectively, these results demonstrate that phytol recycling is essential for tocopherol biosynthesis, even in chlorophyll-devoid organs, yet it is not the rate-limiting step for this pathway under normal growth conditions.
