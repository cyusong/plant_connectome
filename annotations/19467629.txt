['19467629', 'The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II  functions as a scaffold for RNA processing machineries that recognize  differentially phosphorylated conserved (YSPTSPS)(n) repeats. Evidence indicates  that proteins that regulate the phosphorylation status of the CTD are  determinants of growth, development, and stress responses of plants; however,  little is known about the mechanisms that translate the CTD phosphoarray into  physiological outputs. We report the bioinformatic identification of a family of  three phospho-CTD-associated proteins (PCAPs) in Arabidopsis and the  characterization of the AtPRP40 (Arabidopsis thaliana PRE-mRNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN  40) family as PCAPs. AtPRP40s-CTD/CTD-PO(4) interactions were confirmed using the  yeast two-hybrid assay and far-Western blotting. WW domains at the N-terminus of  AtPRP40b mediate the AtPRP40b-CTD/CTD-PO(4) interaction. Although AtPRP40s  interact with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CTD in vitro, there is a  strong preference for the phosphorylated form in Arabidopsis cell extract.  AtPRP40s are ubiquitously expressed and localize to the nucleus. These results  establish that AtPRP40s are specific PCAPs, which is consistent with the  predicted function of the AtPRP40 family in pre-mRNA splicing.', '2009 Apr 1', 'Arch Biochem Biophys', '10.1016/j.abb.2009.01.004', 'Koiwa']
