Plants display a tremendous diversity of developmental and physiological features, resulting from gains and losses of functional innovations across the plant phylogeny. Among those, the most impactful have been undoubtedly the ones that allowed plant terrestrializations, the transitions from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment. Although the embryophyte terrestrialization has been particularly scrutinized, others occurred across the plant phylogeny with the involvement of mutualistic symbioses as a common theme. Here, we review the current pieces of evidence supporting that the repeated colonization of land by plants has been facilitated by interactions with mutualistic symbionts. In that context, we detail two of these mutualistic symbioses: the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in embryophytes and the lichen symbiosis in chlorophyte algae. We suggest that associations with bacteria should be revisited in that context, and we propose that overlooked symbioses might have facilitated the emergence of other land plant clades.
