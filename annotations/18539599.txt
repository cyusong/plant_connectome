Ascorbic acid (Asc) is a major antioxidant involved in photoprotection and photosynthetic function in plants. Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) catalyzes the regeneration of Asc from its oxidized state and serves as an important regulator of Asc recycling. In this work, we used a molecular biochemical approach to investigate how the efficiency of Asc recycling affects non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Suppression of DHAR expression resulted in a lower induction of NPQ that correlated with reductions in chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigments, quantum yield of photosystem II, and CO(2) assimilation, whereas the level of reactive oxygen species increased. The quickly reversible component of NPQ decreased and the slowly reversible or irreversible component of NPQ increased following a reduction in DHAR expression. Significant photoinhibition was also observed following exposure to high light. Direct feeding with Asc restored the appropriate induction of NPQ in DHAR-suppressed leaves. In contrast, increasing DHAR expression increased the pool size of xanthophyll and chlorophyll pigments as well as the rate of CO(2) assimilation, particularly at high light intensities, whereas the level of reactive oxygen species was reduced. Leaves with increased DHAR expression experienced less photoinhibition than did wild-type plants following exposure to high light. DHAR activity, therefore, can affect the appropriate induction of NPQ and level of photoprotection during exposure to high light.
