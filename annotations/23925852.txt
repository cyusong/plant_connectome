We investigated the relation between auxin-induced gene expression and the rapid auxin-induced growth inhibition in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. The natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) induced a strong activation of gene expression as visualized by the DR5rev::GFP reporter gene technique. This effect was specific for active auxins and was abolished in knockout mutants of the F-box auxin receptors. We measured the IAA-induced growth inhibition at high time resolution and show that the F-box auxin receptor mutants failed to display this effect. We conclude that the F-box auxin receptors are needed for the response. In hypocotyls, auxin induces an increase in elongation growth, and this effect has been earlier shown to be independent of the F-box receptors. Based on these findings, we discuss differences in the growth control modes in roots and shoots. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin-induced root growth inhibition, unlike the induction of growth in hypocotyls, requires the presence of the F-box auxin receptors.
