In planta, a vital regulatory complex, MYB-basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-WD40 (MBW), is involved in trichome development and synthesis of anthocyanin and proanthocyanin in Arabidopsis. Usually, WD40 proteins provide a scaffold for protein-protein interaction between MYB and bHLH proteins. Members of subgroup 9 of the R2R3 MYB transcription factors, which includes MYBMIXTA-Like (MML) genes important for plant cell differentiation, are unable to interact with bHLH. In this study, we report that a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) seed trichome or lint fiber-related GhMML factor, GhMML4_D12, interacts with a diverged WD40 protein (GhWDR) in a process similar to but different from that of the MBW ternary complex involved in Arabidopsis trichome development. Amino acids 250-267 of GhMML4_D12 and the first and third WD40 repeat domains of GhWDR determine their interaction. GhWDR could rescue Arabidopsis ttg1 to its wild type, confirming its orthologous function in trichome development. Our findings shed more light towards understanding the key role of the MML and WD40 families in plants and in the improvement of cotton fiber production.
