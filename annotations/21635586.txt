['21635586', 'The histone H3 variant (CENH3) of centromeric nucleosomes is essential for  kinetochore assembly and thus for chromosome segregation in eukaryotes. The  mechanism(s) that determine centromere identity, assembly and maintenance of  kinetochores are still poorly understood. Although the role of CENH3 during  mitosis has been studied in several organisms, little is known about its meiotic  function. We show that RNAi-mediated CENH3 knockdown in Arabidopsis thaliana  caused dwarfism as the result of a reduced number of mitotic divisions. The  remaining mitotic divisions appeared to be error-free. CENH3 RNAi transformants  had reduced fertility because of frequently disturbed meiotic chromosome  segregation. N-terminally truncated EYFP-CENH3(C) is deposited to and functional  within Arabidopsis centromeres of mitotic chromosomes, but cannot be loaded onto  centromeres of meiotic nuclei. Thus the N-terminal part is apparently required  for CENH3 loading during meiosis. EYFP-CENH3(C) expression reduces the amount of  endogenous CENH3, thus mimicking the effect of RNAi. The consequences of reduced  endogenous CENH3 and lack of meiotic incorporation of EYFP-CENH3(C) are reduced  fertility caused by insufficient CENH3 loading to the centromeres of meiotic  chromosomes, subsequent lagging of chromosomes and formation of micronuclei.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04664.x', 'Schubert']
