Eutrophication, dredging, agricultural and urban runoffs, and epiphyte overgrowth could reduce light availability for seagrass. This may affect "blue carbon" stocks in seagrass beds. However, little research is available on the effect of light intensities on carbon sequestration capacity in seagrass beds, especially small-bodied seagrasses. The dominant seagrass <i>Halophila beccarii</i>, a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List, was cultured in different light intensities to examine the response of vegetation and sediment carbon in seagrass beds. The results showed that low light significantly reduced leaf length and above-ground biomass, while carbon content in both above-ground and below-ground tissues were not affected. Low light reduced both the above-ground biomass carbon and the total biomass carbon. Interestingly, while under saturating light conditions, the subsurface and surface carbon content was similar, under low light conditions, subsurface sediment carbon was significantly lower than the surface content. The reduction of subsurface sediment carbon might be caused by less release flux of dissolved organic carbon from roots in low light. Taken together, these results indicate that reduced light intensities, to which these meadows are exposed to, will reduce carbon sequestration capacity in seagrass beds. Measures should be taken to eliminate the input of nutrients on seagrass meadows and dredging activities to maintain the "blue carbon" storage service by enhancing light penetration into seagrass.
