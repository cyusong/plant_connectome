In most oilseeds, two evolutionarily unrelated acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2, are the main contributors to the acylation of diacylglycerols in the synthesis of triacylglycerol. DGAT1 and DGAT2 are both present in the important crop oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>), with each type having four isoforms. We studied the activities of DGAT isoforms during seed development in microsomal fractions from two oilseed rape cultivars: edible, low-erucic acid (22:1) MONOLIT and nonedible high-erucic acid MAPLUS. Whereas the specific activities of DGATs were similar with most of the tested acyl-CoA substrates in both cultivars, MAPLUS had 6- to 14-fold higher activity with 22:1-CoA than did MONOLIT. Thus, DGAT isoforms with different acyl-CoA specificities are differentially active in the two cultivars. We characterized the acyl-CoA specificities of all DGAT isoforms in oilseed rape in the microsomal fractions of yeast cells heterologously expressing these enzymes. All four DGAT1 isoforms showed similar and broad acyl-CoA specificities. However, DGAT2 isoforms had much narrower acyl-CoA specificities: two DGAT2 isoforms were highly active with 22:1-CoA, while the ability of the other two isoforms to use this substrate was impaired. These findings elucidate the importance, which a DGAT isoform with suitable acyl-CoA specificity may have, when aiming for high content of a particular fatty acid in plant triacylglycerol reservoirs.
