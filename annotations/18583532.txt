['18583532', 'Prenylated Rab acceptor 1 (PRA1) domain proteins are small transmembrane proteins  that regulate vesicle trafficking as receptors of Rab GTPases and the vacuolar  soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor protein VAMP2.  However, little is known about PRA1 family members in plants. Sequence analysis  revealed that higher plants, compared with animals and primitive plants, possess  an expanded family of PRA1 domain-containing proteins. The Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) PRA1 (AtPRA1) proteins were found to homodimerize and  heterodimerize in a manner corresponding to their phylogenetic distribution.  Different AtPRA1 family members displayed distinct expression patterns, with a  preference for vascular cells and expanding or developing tissues. AtPRA1 genes  were significantly coexpressed with Rab GTPases and genes encoding vesicle  transport proteins, suggesting an involvement in the vesicle trafficking process  similar to that of their animal counterparts. Correspondingly, AtPRA1 proteins  were localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and  endosomes/prevacuolar compartments, hinting at a function in both secretory and  endocytic intracellular trafficking pathways. Taken together, our data reveal a  high functional diversity of AtPRA1 proteins, probably dealing with the various  demands of the complex trafficking system.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.122226', 'De']
