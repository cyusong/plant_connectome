Phosphorus (P) is an essential mineral, required for crucial plant genetic, metabolic and signaling functions. Under P deficiency, normal physiological function can be disrupted, especially photosynthetic metabolism. The majority of photosynthetic studies of P stress has been on model organisms, and very little is known about plants that evolved on P deficient soils. Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R.Dahlgren, a native to the Mediterranean ecosystem of South Africa was used to study the photosynthetic responses during short-term P limitation. A. linearis seedlings were cultured under glasshouse conditions and exposed to short-term P stress. Leaf photosynthetic gas exchange was coupled with metabolic analyses. In spite of the decline in leaf cellular Pi, the photosynthetic rates remained unchanged. These leaves also maintained their levels of light harvesting and reaction center pigments. The efficiency of the light reactions' utilization of ATP and NADPH increased during P-stress. Leaf glucose levels decreased during P-stress, while sucrose concentrations remained unaffected. These results show that during short-term P-stress, A. linearis can maintain its photosynthetic rates by altering the structural and functional components of the light reactions.
