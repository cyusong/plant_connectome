['21477080', 'The evolution of roots and root hairs was a crucial innovation that contributed  to the adaptation of plants to a terrestrial environment. Initiation of root  hairs involves transcriptional cues that in part determine cell patterning of the  root epidermis. Once root hair initiation has occurred, elongation of the root  hair takes place. Although many genes have been identified as being involved in  root hair development, many contributors remain uncharacterized. In this study we  report on the involvement of a member (here dubbed maMYB) of the plant-specific  R2R3-MYB family of transcription factors in root hair elongation in Arabidopsis.  We show that maMYB is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with the  transcription factor domain exposed to the cytosol, suggesting that it may  function as a membrane-tethered transcription factor. We demonstrate that a  truncated form of maMYB (maMYB(8)(4)(-)(3)(0)(9)), which contains the R2R3-MYB transcription  factor domain, is localized and retained in the nucleus, where it regulates gene  expression. Silencing of maMyb resulted in plants with significantly shorter root  hairs but similar root hair density compared with wild type, implying a role of  the protein in root hair elongation. 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), an  exogenous auxin analog that promotes root hair elongation, rescued the short root  hair phenotype and maMyb mRNA was induced in the presence of 2,4-D and IAA  (indole-3-acetic acid). These results indicate a functional role of maMYB, which  is integrated with auxin, in root hair elongation in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04602.x', 'Brandizzi']
