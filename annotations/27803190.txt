['27803190', 'The outermost cell layer of plants, the epidermis, and its outer (lateral)  membrane domain facing the environment are continuously challenged by biotic and  abiotic stresses. Therefore, the epidermis and the outer membrane domain provide  important selective and protective barriers. However, only a small number of  specifically outer membrane-localized proteins are known. Similarly, molecular  mechanisms underlying the trafficking and the polar placement of outer membrane  domain proteins require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that ACTIN7  (ACT7) mediates trafficking of the PENETRATION3 (PEN3) outer membrane protein  from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in the root epidermis  of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and that actin function contributes to PEN3  endocytic recycling. In contrast to such generic ACT7-dependent trafficking from  the TGN, the EXOCYST84b (EXO84b) tethering factor mediates PEN3 outer-membrane  polarity. Moreover, precise EXO84b placement at the outer membrane domain itself  requires ACT7 function. Hence, our results uncover spatially and mechanistically  distinct requirements for ACT7 function during outer lateral membrane cargo  trafficking and polarity establishment. They further identify an exocyst  tethering complex mediator of outer lateral membrane cargo polarity.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.01252', 'ORCID:']
