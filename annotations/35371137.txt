Auxin is a central phytohormone and controls almost all aspects of plant development and stress response. Auxin homeostasis is coordinately regulated by biosynthesis, catabolism, transport, conjugation, and deposition. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized MAIGO2 (MAG2) complex mediates tethering of arriving vesicles to the ER membrane, and it is crucial for ER export trafficking. Despite important regulatory roles of MAG2 in vesicle trafficking, the <i>mag2</i> mutant had mild developmental abnormalities. MAG2 has one homolog protein, MAG2-Like (MAL), and the <i>mal-1</i> mutant also had slight developmental phenotypes. In order to investigate MAG2 and MAL regulatory function in plant development, we generated the <i>mag2-1 mal-1</i> double mutant. As expected, the double mutant exhibited serious developmental defects and more alteration in stress response compared with single mutants and wild type. Proteomic analysis revealed that signaling, metabolism, and stress response in <i>mag2-1 mal-1</i> were affected, especially membrane trafficking and auxin biosynthesis, signaling, and transport. Biochemical and cell biological analysis indicated that the <i>mag2-1 mal-1</i> double mutant had more serious defects in vesicle transport than the <i>mag2-1</i> and <i>mal-1</i> single mutants. The auxin distribution and abundance of auxin transporters were altered significantly in the <i>mag2-1</i> and <i>mal-1</i> single mutants and <i>mag2-1 mal-1</i> double mutant. Our findings suggest that MAG2 and MAL regulate plant development and auxin homeostasis by controlling membrane trafficking, with functional redundancy.
