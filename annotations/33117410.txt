The use of new agricultural technologies such as soilless and aeroponic cultivation systems is a valuable approach to medicinal plant production. The present study investigated the prospects of enhancing yield and secondary metabolite production in <i>Valeriana jatamansi</i> under aeroponic cultivation using elicitors, such as yeast extract and methyl jasmonate. Plants were evaluated by measuring growth parameters, photosynthetic rate, and secondary metabolites contents (on a dry weight basis). Maximum plant height (36.83 cm), leaf number (17.67), rootlet number (37.33), and rootlet length (6.90 cm) were observed at 0.5 mg/L yeast extract treatment; whereas treatment levels of 1.5 mg/L yeast extract and 150 µM methyl jasmonate resulted in maximum leaf length (6.95 cm) and leaf width (5.43 cm), respectively. Maximum photosynthetic rate (5.4053 µmol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) and stomatal conductance (0.0656 mmol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) were recorded at treatment levels of 0.5 mg/L and 1.5 mg/L yeast extract respectively, whereas at 150 µM methyl jasmonate treatment, transpiration rate was 0.9046 mmol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. In aeroponic cultivation, the maximum content of valerenic acid and hydroxy valerenic acid was detected in leaf (2.47 and 8.37 mg/g) and root (1.78 and 7.89 mg/g) at treatment levels of 100 µM and 150 µM methyl jasmonate, respectively. Acetoxy valerenic acid was highest in leaf (1.02 mg/g) at 1.5 mg/L yeast extract, and in the root (2.38 mg/g) at 150 µM methyl jasmonate. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified twenty-eight volatile compounds in roots, of which three-isovaleric acid (6.72-50.81%), patchouli alcohol (13.48-25.31%) and baldrinal (0.74-25.26%)-were the major constituents. The results revealed that, besides roots, leaves could also be utilized as a prominent alternative source for targeted secondary metabolites. In conclusion, aeroponic cultivation offers year-round quality biomass production and ease to access subsequent roots harvest in <i>V. jatamansi</i>, to meet the demand of the pharmaceutical industries.
