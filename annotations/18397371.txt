['18397371', 'Cryptochromes (CRY) are one of the two major classes of photoreceptors that  perceive light stimuli in the UV-A to blue light region and they are involved in  multiple aspects of plant growth and development. However, knowledge regarding  their signaling transduction components and mechanisms remains limited. Here, we  report that a MYB transcription factor Blue Insensitive Trait 1 (BIT1), plays an  important role in controlling blue light responses. Hypocotyl growth responses  indicate that BIT1 functions as a positive element in blue light signaling, since  BIT1 antisense and knock-out lines show a reduced light response in blue light.  BIT1 controls blue light-dependent expression of various genes such as PsbS, a  member of the light-harvesting complex gene family. A transactivation assay  showed that BIT1 regulates promoter activity of PsbS in a blue light-dependent  manner and that it requires CRY1 for activation of the PsbS promoter. BIT1  undergoes degradation in darkness and CRY1 functions to stabilize BIT1 in a blue  light-dependent manner. In contrast, COP1 binds to BIT1 and mediates its  degradation. We propose that the PsbS promoter is activated in blue light via the  blue light-dependent stabilization of BIT1 by CRY1, while in darkness BIT1 is  degraded by COP1-mediated proteolysis.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03508.x', 'Nam']
