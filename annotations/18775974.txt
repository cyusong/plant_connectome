['18775974', 'The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cation calcium exchangers (CCXs) were  recently identified as a subfamily of cation transporters; however, no plant CCXs  have been functionally characterized. Here, we show that Arabidopsis AtCCX3  (At3g14070) and AtCCX4 (At1g54115) can suppress yeast mutants defective in Na(+),  K(+), and Mn(2+) transport. We also report high-capacity uptake of (86)Rb(+) in  tonoplast-enriched vesicles from yeast expressing AtCCX3. Cation competition  studies showed inhibition of (86)Rb(+) uptake in AtCCX3 cells by excess Na(+),  K(+), and Mn(2+). Functional epitope-tagged AtCCX3 fusion proteins were localized  to endomembranes in plants and yeast. In Arabidopsis, AtCCX3 is primarily  expressed in flowers, while AtCCX4 is expressed throughout the plant.  Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of AtCCX3 increased  in plants treated with NaCl, KCl, and MnCl(2). Insertional mutant lines of AtCCX3  and AtCCX4 displayed no apparent growth defects; however, overexpression of  AtCCX3 caused increased Na(+) accumulation and increased (86)Rb(+) transport.  Uptake of (86)Rb(+) increased in tonoplast-enriched membranes isolated from  Arabidopsis lines expressing CCX3 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S  promoter. Overexpression of AtCCX3 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) produced  lesions in the leaves, stunted growth, and resulted in the accumulation of higher  levels of numerous cations. In summary, these findings suggest that AtCCX3 is an  endomembrane-localized H(+)-dependent K(+) transporter with apparent Na(+) and  Mn(2+) transport properties distinct from those of previously characterized plant  transporters.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.118810', 'Hirschi']
