Rhizosphere interactions between microorganisms and plants have great influence on plant health. <i>Bacillus cereus</i> C1L, an induced systemic resistance (ISR)-eliciting rhizobacterium from <i>Lilium formosanum</i>, can protect monocot and dicot plants from disease challenges. To identify the ISR-involved bacterial genes, the systemic protection effect of transposon-tagged mutants of <i>B. cereus</i> C1L against southern corn leaf blight (SCLB) was surveyed, and a mutant of the <i>ptsG</i> gene encoding glucose-specific permease of the phosphotransferase system was severely impaired in the abilities of disease suppression and root colonization. The <i>ptsG</i> mutant lost the preferential utilization of glucose and showed reduction of glucose-assisted growth in minimal medium. A promoter-based reporter assay revealed that <i>ptsG</i> expression could be activated by certain sugar constituents of maize root exudates, among which <i>B. cereus</i> C1L exhibited the highest chemotactic response toward glucose, whereas neither of them could attract the <i>ptsG</i> mutant. Additionally, <i>ptsG</i> deficiency almost completely abolished glucose uptake of <i>B. cereus</i> C1L. Metabolite analysis indicated that the lack of <i>ptsG</i> undermined glucose-induced accumulation of acetoin and 2,3-butanediol in <i>B. cereus</i> C1L, both eliciting maize ISR against SCLB. Pretreatments with <i>B. cereus</i> C1L, <i>ptsG</i> mutant, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol enhanced defense-related reactive oxygen species accumulation and callose deposition at different levels that were positively correlated to their ISR-eliciting activities. Thus, glucose uptake-mediating <i>ptsG</i> participates in ISR elicitation by endowing <i>B. cereus</i> C1L with the full capacities for root colonization and beneficial glucose metabolite production, providing a clue regarding how ISR-mediating rhizobacteria create a mutually beneficial relationship with various plant species.
