Fruit skin color play important role in commercial value of cucumber, which is mainly determined by the content and composition of chlorophyll and anthocyanins. Therefore, understanding the related genes and metabolomics involved in composition of fruit skin color is essential for cucumber quality and commodity value. The results showed that chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid content in fruit skin were higher in Lv (dark green skin) than Bai (light green skin) on fruit skin. Cytological observation showed more chloroplast existed in fruit skin cells of Lv. A total of 162 significantly different metabolites were found between the fruit skin of the two genotypes by metabolome analysis, including 40 flavones, 9 flavanones, 8 flavonols, 6 anthocyanins, and other compounds. Crucial anthocyanins and flavonols for fruit skin color, were detected significantly decreased in fruit skin of Bai compared with Lv. By RNA-seq assay, 4516 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between two cultivars. Further analyses suggested that low expression level of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes, such as chlM, por and NOL caused less chlorophylls or chloroplast in fruit skin of Bai. Meanwhile, a predicted regulatory network of anthocyanin biosynthesis was established to illustrate involving many DEGs, especially 4CL, CHS and UFGT. This study uncovered significant differences between two cucumber genotypes with different fruit color using metabolome and RNA-seq analysis. We lay a foundation to understand molecular regulation mechanism on formation of cucumber skin color, by exploring valuable genes, which is helpful for cucumber breeding and improvement on fruit skin color.

Lv: !has higher! chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid content
Bai: !has lower! anthocyanins and flavonols
chlM: !represses! chlorophylls or chloroplast in Bai
4CL: !interacts with! CHS and UFGT
