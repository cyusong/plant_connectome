In order to solve the problems of nitrogen (N) losses and fruit quality degradation caused by excessive N fertilizer application, different dosages of the nitrification inhibitor, 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> soil), were applied during the later stage of 'Red Fuji' apple (<i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh.) fruit expansion in 2017 and 2018. The effects of DMPP on soil N transformation, carbon (C)-N nutrition of tree, and fruit quality were investigated. Results revealed that DMPP decreased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) <i>amoA</i> gene, increased the retention of NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>-N, and decreased NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-N concentration and its vertical migration in soil. DMPP reduced <sup>15</sup>N loss rates and increased <sup>15</sup>N residual and recovery rates compared to the control. <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N double isotope labeling results revealed that DMPP reduced the capacity of <sup>15</sup>N absorption and regulation in fruits, decreased <sup>15</sup>N accumulation in fruits and whole plant, and increased the distribution of <sup>13</sup>C from vegetative organs to fruits. DMPP increased fruit anthocyanin and soluble sugar contents, and had no significant effect on fruit yield. The comprehensive analysis revealed that the application of 1 mg DMPP kg<sup>-1</sup> soil during the later stage of fruit expansion effectively reduced losses due to N and alleviated quality degradation caused by excessive N fertilizer application.
