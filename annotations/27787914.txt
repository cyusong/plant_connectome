Miscanthus is a vigorous perennial Gramineae genus grown throughout the world as a promising bioenergy crop and generally regarded as heavy metal tolerant due to its ability to absorb heavy metals. However, little is known about the mechanism for heavy metal tolerance in Miscanthus. In this study, two Miscanthus species (Miscanthus sacchariflorus and Miscanthus floridulus) exhibiting different cadmium (Cd) sensitivity were used to address the mechanisms of Cd tolerance. Under the same Cd stress, M. sacchariflorus showed higher Cd tolerance with better growth and lower Cd accumulation in both shoots and roots than M. floridulus. The malate (MA) content significantly increased in root exudates of M. sacchariflorus following Cd treatment while it was almost unchanged in M. floridulus. Cellular Cd analysis and flux data showed that exogenous MA application markedly restricted Cd influx and accumulation while an anion-channel inhibitor (phenylglyoxal) effectively blocked Cd-induced MA secretion and increased Cd influx in M. sacchariflorus, indicating that MA secretion could alleviate Cd toxicity by reducing Cd uptake. The genes of malate dehydrogenases (MsMDHs) and Al-activated malate transporter 1 (MsALMT1) in M. sacchariflorus were highly upregulated under Cd stress, compared with that in M. floridulus. The results indicate that Cd-induced MA synthesis and secretion efficiently alleviate Cd toxicity by reducing Cd influx in M. sacchariflorus.
