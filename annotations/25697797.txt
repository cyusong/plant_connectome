['25697797', 'Organogenesis in plants involves differential growth. Rapidly growing primordia  are distinguished from the meristem and each other by slower growing boundaries.  PETAL LOSS (PTL) is a trihelix transcription factor of Arabidopsis that represses  growth in boundaries between newly arising sepals. To identify partners involved  in this growth limitation, a young inflorescence cDNA library was screened by  yeast two-hybrid technology with PTL as bait. The most frequent prey identified  was AKIN10, the catalytic alpha-subunit of the Snf1-related kinase1 (SnRK1).  Interaction was mapped to the C-terminal (non-kinase) half of AKIN10 and the  N-terminal portion of PTL. Binding of PTL was specific to AKIN10 as there was  little binding to the related AKIN11. The interaction was confirmed by  co-immunoprecipitation in vitro. Fluorescently tagged products of 35S:YFP-AKIN10  and 35S:CFP-PTL also interacted when transiently expressed together in leaf cells  of Nicotiana benthamiana. In this case, most of the cytoplasmic AKIN10 was  preferentially moved to the nucleus where PTL accumulated, possibly because a  nuclear export sequence in AKIN10 was now masked. During these experiments, we  observed that AKIN10 could variably accumulate in the Golgi, shown by its  co-localization with a tagged Golgi marker and through its dispersal by brefeldin  A. Tests of phosphorylation of PTL by AKIN10 gave negative results. The  functional significance of the PTL-AKIN10 interaction remains open, although a  testable hypothesis is that AKIN10 senses lower energy levels in inter-sepal  zones and, in association with PTL, promotes reduced cell division.', '2015 May', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erv032', 'Smyth']
