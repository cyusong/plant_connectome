Although the 6 magnitude and pattern of correlation among floral traits (phenotypic integration) is usually conceived as an adaptation for successful pollination and reproduction, studies on the evolution of plant reproductive systems have generally focused on one or a few characters. If evolutionary transitions between reproductive systems involve morphological floral adjustments, changes in the magnitude and pattern of phenotypic integration of floral traits may be expected. In this study, we focused on the evolutionary dynamics of a complex adaptive trait, the extent of reciprocity (reciprocal placement) among sexual organs in a heterostylous species, and explored the associated changes in phenotypic floral integration during the transition from tristyly to distyly. The extent of reciprocity and both the magnitude and pattern of floral integration were characterized in 12 populations of Oxalis alpina representing the tristyly-distyly gradient. Although the extent of reciprocity increased along the tristyly-distyly transition, the flower size diminished. These adjustments did not affect the magnitude, but did affect the pattern, of floral integration. *Changes in the pattern of floral integration suggested that allometric, functional and pleiotropic relationships among floral traits were affected during this evolutionary transition.

extent of reciprocity: !increases! tristyly-distyly transition
flower size: !diminishes! tristyly-distyly transition
magnitude of floral integration: !unchanged! tristyly-distyly transition
pattern of floral integration: !affected! tristyly-distyly transition
