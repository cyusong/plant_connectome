Abiotic stresses have significant impacts on crop yield and quality. Even though significant efforts during the past decade have been devoted to uncovering the core signaling pathways associated with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stress in plants, abiotic stress signaling mechanisms in most crops remain largely unclear. The core components of the ABA signaling pathway, including early events in the osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation network, have recently been elucidated in Arabidopsis with the aid of phosphoproteomics technologies. We now know that SNF1-related kinases 2 (SnRK2s) are not only inhibited by the clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) through dephosphorylation, but also phosphorylated and activated by upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks). Through describing the course of studies to elucidate abiotic stress and ABA signaling, we will discuss how we can take advantage of the latest innovations in mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics and structural proteomics to boost our investigation of plant regulation and responses to ABA and abiotic stress.
