Feeding an increasing global population as well as reducing environmental impact of crops is the challenge for the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) management could represent a suitable method but elucidation of their action mechanisms is essential for a proper and effective utilization. Furthermore, ethylene is involved in growth and response to environmental stimuli but little is known about the implication of ethylene perception in PGPB activity. The ethylene-insensitive tomato never ripe and its isogenic wild-type cv. Pearson lines inoculated with Bacillus megaterium or Enterobacter sp. C7 strains were grown until mature stage to analyze growth promotion, and bacterial inoculation effects on root proteomic profiles. Enterobacter C7 promoted growth in both plant genotypes, meanwhile Bacillus megaterium PGPB activity was only noticed in wt plants. Moreover, PGPB inoculation affected proteomic profile in a strain- and genotype-dependent manner modifying levels of stress-related and interaction proteins, and showing bacterial inoculation effects on antioxidant content and phosphorus acquisition capacity. Ethylene perception is essential for properly recognition of Bacillus megaterium and growth promotion mediated in part by increased levels of reduced glutathione. In contrast, Enterobacter C7 inoculation improves phosphorus nutrition keeping plants on growth independently of ethylene sensitivity.
