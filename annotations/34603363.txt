Gray leaf spot (GLS), caused by different species of <i>Cercospora</i>, is a fungal, non-soil-borne disease that causes serious reductions in maize yield worldwide. The identification of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for GLS resistance in maize is essential for developing marker-assisted selection strategies in maize breeding. Previous research found a significant difference (<i>P</i> < 0.01) in GLS resistance between T32 (highly resistant) and J51 (highly susceptible) genotypes of maize. Initial QTL analysis was conducted in an F<sub>2 : 3</sub> population of 189 individuals utilizing genetic maps that were constructed using 181 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. One QTL (<i>qGLS8</i>) was detected, defined by the markers umc1130 and umc2354 in three environments. The <i>qGLS8</i> QTL detected in the initial analysis was located in a 51.96-Mb genomic region of chromosome 8 and explained 7.89-14.71% of the phenotypic variation in GLS resistance in different environments. We also developed a near isogenic line (NIL) BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population with 1,468 individuals and a BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>-Micro population with 180 individuals for fine mapping. High-resolution genetic and physical maps were constructed using six newly developed SSRs. The QTL-<i>qGLS8</i> was narrowed down to a 124-kb region flanked by the markers ym20 and ym51 and explained up to 17.46% of the phenotypic variation in GLS resistance. The QTL-<i>qGLS8</i> contained seven candidate genes, such as an <i>MYB-related transcription factor 24</i> and a <i>C</i> <sub>3</sub> <i>H transcription factor 347</i>), and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). The present study aimed to provide a foundation for the identification of candidate genes for GLS resistance in maize.
