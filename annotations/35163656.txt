Cadmium (Cd) pollution in cultivated land is caused by irresistible geological factors and human activities; intense diffusion and migration have seriously affected the safety of food crops. Plants have evolved mechanisms to control excessive influx of Cd in the environment, such as directional transport, chelation and detoxification. This is done by some specific metalloproteins, whose key amino acid motifs have been investigated by scientists one by one. The application of powerful cell biology, crystal structure science, and molecular probe targeted labeling technology has identified a series of protein families involved in the influx, transport and detoxification of the heavy metal Cd. This review summarizes them as influx proteins (NRAMP, ZIP), chelating proteins (MT, PDF), vacuolar proteins (CAX, ABCC, MTP), long-distance transport proteins (OPT, HMA) and efflux proteins (PCR, ABCG). We selected representative proteins from each family, and compared their amino acid sequence, motif structure, subcellular location, tissue specific distribution and other characteristics of differences and common points, so as to summarize the key residues of the Cd binding target. Then, we explain its special mechanism of action from the molecular structure. In conclusion, this review is expected to provide a reference for the exploration of key amino acid targets of Cd, and lay a foundation for the intelligent design and breeding of crops with high/low Cd accumulation.
