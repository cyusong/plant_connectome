Arabidopsis Nup160 and Seh1, encoding two predicted nucleoporins of the Nup107-160 nuclear pore sub-complex, were identified in a reverse genetics screen based on their requirement for basal disease resistance. Both genes also contribute to immunity conferred by Toll interleukin 1 receptor/nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (TNL)-type R proteins and constitutive resistance activated in the deregulated TNL mutant, snc1. Protein amounts of EDS1, a central regulator of TNL-triggered resistance, are reduced in seh1 and severely depleted in nup160 single mutants. Here, we investigate the impact of mutations in Nup160, Seh1 and a third complex member, MOS3/Nup96, on EDS1 protein accumulation in the snc1 auto-immune mutant background. In addition, we examine the subcellular localization of Seh1 in root tissues.

Nup160: !affects! Basal disease resistance
Seh1: !affects! Basal disease resistance
TNL-type R proteins: !activate! Constitutive resistance
EDS1: !reduced in! seh1 
EDS1: !severely depleted in! nup160
MOS3/Nup96: !impacts! EDS1 protein accumulation
Seh1: !localizes to! Root tissues
