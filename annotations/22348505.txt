Rice prolamins, a group of seed storage proteins, are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and form type I protein bodies (PB-Is) in endosperm cells. Rice prolamins are encoded by a multigene family. In this study, the spatial accumulation patterns of various prolamin species in rice endosperm cells were investigated to determine the mechanism of formation of the internal structure of PB-Is. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of mature endosperm cells showed that the 10 kDa prolamin is mainly localized in the core of the PB-Is, the 13b prolamin is localized in the inner layer surrounding the core and the outermost layer, and the 13a and 16 kDa prolamins are localized in the middle layer. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of the mRNA for 10 kDa prolamin precedes expression of 13a, 13b-1 and 16 kDa prolamin in the developing stages. mRNA expression for 13b-2 prolamin occurred after that of the other prolamin species. Immunoelectron microscopy of developing seeds showed that the 10 kDa prolamin polypeptide initially accumulates in the ER, and then 13b, 13a, 16 kDa and 13b prolamins are stacked in layers within the ER. Studies with transgenic rice seeds expressing prolamin-GFP fusion proteins under the control of native and constitutive promoters indicated that the temporal expression pattern of prolamin genes influenced the localization of prolamin proteins within the PB-Is. These findings indicate that the control of gene expression of prolamin species contributes to the internal structure of PB-Is.
