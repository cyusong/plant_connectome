Many eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms enhance their carbon uptake by supplying concentrated CO<sub>2</sub> to the CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzyme Rubisco in an organelle called the pyrenoid. Ongoing efforts seek to engineer this pyrenoid-based CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism (PCCM) into crops to increase yields. Here we develop a computational model for a PCCM on the basis of the postulated mechanism in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our model recapitulates all Chlamydomonas PCCM-deficient mutant phenotypes and yields general biophysical principles underlying the PCCM. We show that an effective and energetically efficient PCCM requires a physical barrier to reduce pyrenoid CO<sub>2</sub> leakage, as well as proper enzyme localization to reduce futile cycling between CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Importantly, our model demonstrates the feasibility of a purely passive CO<sub>2</sub> uptake strategy at air-level CO<sub>2</sub>, while active HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake proves advantageous at lower CO<sub>2</sub> levels. We propose a four-step engineering path to increase the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in the plant chloroplast up to threefold at a theoretical cost of only 1.3 ATP per CO<sub>2</sub> fixed, thereby offering a framework to guide the engineering of a PCCM into land plants.
