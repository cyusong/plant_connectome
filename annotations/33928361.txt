Salicylic acid (SA) and brassinosteroids (BRs) are well known to regulate diverse processes of plant development and stress responses, but the mechanisms by which these phytohormones mediate the growth and defense trade-off are largely unclear. In addition, little is known about the roles of DEHYDRATION RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING transcription factors, especially in biotic stress and plant growth. Here, we identified a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR gene GhTINY2 that is strongly induced by Verticillium dahliae. Overexpression of GhTINY2 in cotton and Arabidopsis enhanced tolerance to V. dahliae, while knockdown of expression increased the susceptibility of cotton to the pathogen. GhTINY2 was found to promote SA accumulation and SA signaling transduction by directly activating expression of WRKY51. Moreover, GhTINY2-overexpressing cotton and Arabidopsis showed retardation of growth, increased sensitivity to inhibitors of BR biosynthesis, down-regulation of several BR-induced genes, and up-regulation of BR-repressed genes, while GhTINY2-RNAi cotton showed the opposite effects. We further determined that GhTINY2 negatively regulates BR signaling by interacting with BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and restraining its transcriptional activation of the expression of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 19 (IAA19). These findings indicate that GhTINY2 fine-tunes the trade-off between immunity and growth via indirect crosstalk between WRKY51-mediated SA biosynthesis and BZR1-IAA19-regulated BR signaling.
