['33004618', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) is an essential membrane signature for  both autophagy and endosomal sorting that is synthesized in plants by the class  III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, consisting of the VPS34 kinase,  together with ATG6, VPS15, and either VPS38 or ATG14 as the fourth subunit.  Although Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants missing the three core  subunits are infertile, vps38 mutants are viable but have aberrant leaf, root,  and seed development, Suc sensing, and endosomal trafficking, suggesting that  VPS38 and ATG14 are nonredundant. Here, we evaluated the role of ATG14 through a  collection of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  (CRISPR)/Cas9 and T-DNA insertion mutants disrupting the two Arabidopsis  paralogs. atg14a atg14b double mutants were relatively normal phenotypically but  displayed pronounced autophagy defects, including reduced accumulation of  autophagic bodies and cargo delivery during nutrient stress. Unexpectedly,  homozygous atg14a atg14b vps38 triple mutants were viable but showed severely  compromised rosette development and reduced fecundity, pollen germination, and  autophagy, consistent with a need for both ATG14 and VPS38 to fully actuate PI3P  biology. However, the triple mutants still accumulated PI3P, but they were  hypersensitive to the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, indicating that the ATG14/VPS38  component is not essential for PI3P synthesis. Collectively, the ATG14/VPS38  mutant collection now permits the study of plants altered in specific aspects of  PI3P biology.', '2020 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.20.00285', 'ORCID:']
