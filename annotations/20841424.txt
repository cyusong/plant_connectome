['20841424', 'Plant immune receptors belonging to the receptor-like protein (RLP) family  contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a short cytoplasmic tail  linked by a single transmembrane motif. Here, we report the identification of  snc2-1D (for suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 2), a semidominant Arabidopsis  thaliana mutant with constitutively activated defense responses. Map-based  cloning of snc2-1D showed that it encodes an RLP. The point mutation in snc2-1D  leads to substitution of the second Gly for Arg in the conserved GXXXG motif of  the transmembrane helix, suggesting that this residue is important for negative  regulation of the protein. Epistasis analysis revealed that the snc2-1D mutant  phenotype is not affected by mutations in genes known to be required for the  nucleotide binding (NB)-LRR Resistance (R) protein signaling. A suppressor screen  of snc2-1D was performed, and map-based cloning of one suppressor revealed that  mutations in WRKY70 suppress the constitutive defense responses in snc2-1D,  suggesting that WRKY70 functions downstream of snc2-1D. The identification of  snc2-1D provides us with a unique system for genetic analysis of resistance  pathways downstream of RLPs, which may be distinct from those downstream of  NB-LRR type R proteins.', '2010 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074120', 'Zhang']
