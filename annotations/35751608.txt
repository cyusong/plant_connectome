Cyanobacteria are phototrophic bacteria that perform oxygenic photosynthesis. They use a supermolecular light-harvesting antenna complex, the phycobilisome (PBS), to capture and transfer light energy to photosynthetic reaction centers. Certain cyanobacteria alter the absorption maxima and/or overall structure of their PBSs in response to the ambient light wavelength-a process called chromatic acclimation (CA). One of the most well-known CA types is the response to green and red light, which is controlled by either the RcaEFC or CcaSR photosensory system. Here, we characterized a hybrid type of CA in the cyanobacterium Pleurocapsa sp. Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC) 7319 that uses both RcaEFC and CcaSR systems. In vivo spectroscopy suggested that strain PCC 7319 alters the relative composition of green-absorbing phycoerythrin and red-absorbing phycocyanin in the PBS. RNA sequencing and promoter motif analyses suggested that the RcaEFC system induces a gene operon for phycocyanin under red light, whereas the CcaSR system induces a rod-membrane linker gene under green light. Induction of the phycoerythrin genes under green light may be regulated through a yet unidentified photosensory system called the Cgi system. Spectroscopy analyses of the isolated PBSs suggested that hemidiscoidal and rod-shaped PBSs enriched with phycoerythrin were produced under green light, whereas only hemidiscoidal PBSs enriched with phycocyanin were produced under red light. PCC 7319 uses the RcaEFC and CcaSR systems to regulate absorption of green or red light (CA3) and the amount of rod-shaped PBSs (CA1), respectively. Cyanobacteria can thus flexibly combine diverse CA types to acclimate to different light environments.
