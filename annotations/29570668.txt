Worldwide, drought affects crop yields; therefore, understanding plants' strategies to adapt to drought is critical. Chloroplasts are key regulators of plant responses, and signals from chloroplasts also regulate nuclear gene expression during drought. However, the interactions between chloroplast-initiated retrograde signals and ion channels under stress are still not clear. In this review, we summarise the retrograde signals that participate in regulating plant stress tolerance. We compare chloroplastic transporters that modulate retrograde signalling through retrograde biosynthesis or as critical components in retrograde signalling. We also discuss the roles of important plasma membrane and tonoplast ion transporters that are involved in regulating stomatal movement. We propose how retrograde signals interact with ion transporters under stress.

Chloroplasts: !regulate! Nuclear gene expression
Chloroplastic transporters: !modulate! Retrograde signalling
Plasma membrane: !involved in! Regulating stomatal movement
Tonoplast ion transporters: !involved in! Regulating stomatal movement
Retrograde signals: !interact with! Ion transporters
