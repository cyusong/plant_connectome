['25628629', 'Plant adaptation to abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity involves  complex regulatory processes. Deciphering the signaling components that are  involved in stress signal transduction and cellular responses is of importance to  understand how plants cope with salt stress. Accumulation of osmolytes such as  proline is considered to participate in the osmotic adjustment of plant cells to  salinity. Proline accumulation results from a tight regulation between its  biosynthesis and catabolism. Lipid signal components such as phospholipases C and  D have previously been shown to be involved in the regulation of proline  metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we demonstrate that proline  metabolism is also regulated by class-III Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),  VPS34, which catalyses the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)  from phosphatidylinositol. Using pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we  show that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, affects PI3P levels in vivo and that it  triggers a decrease in proline accumulation in response to salt treatment of A.  thaliana seedlings. The lower proline accumulation is correlated with a lower  transcript level of Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1 (P5CS1) biosynthetic  enzyme and higher transcript and protein levels of Proline dehydrogenase 1  (ProDH1), a key-enzyme in proline catabolism. We also found that the ProDH1  expression is induced in a pi3k-hemizygous mutant, further demonstrating that  PI3K is involved in the regulation of proline catabolism through transcriptional  regulation of ProDH1. A broader metabolomic analysis indicates that LY294002 also  reduced other metabolites, such as hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids and  sugars like raffinose.', '2014', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2014.00772', 'Savoure']
