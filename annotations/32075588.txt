Autotetraploid rice is a useful germplasm for polyploid rice breeding. Our previous research showed that non-coding RNAs might be associated with low fertility in autotetraploid rice. However, little information is available on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in the low fertility of autotetraploid rice. In the present study, RNA-seq was employed to detect the differentially expressed meiosis-related lncRNAs in autotetraploid rice, and gene overexpression and knock out experiments were used to validate the potential function of candidate lncRNA. A total of 444 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DEL) were detected during anther and ovary meiosis in autotetraploid rice. Of these, 328 DEL were associated with the transposable elements, which displayed low expression levels during meiosis in autotetraploid rice. We used rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) assay to validate 10 DEL and found that the lncRNAs were not assembly artifacts, and six of them were conserved in tetraploid rice. Moreover, 237 and 20 lncRNAs were associated with pollen mother cell (PMC) and embryo sac mother cell (EMC) meiosis in autotetraploid rice, respectively. The differential expressions of some meiosis-related targets and its DEL regulator, including MEL1 regulated by TCONS_00068868, LOC_Os12g41350 (meiotic asynaptic mutant 1) by TCONS_00057811 in PMC, and LOC_Os12g39420 by TCONS_00144592 in EMC, were confirmed by qRT-PCR. TCONS_00057811, TCONS_00055980 and TCONS_00130461 showed anther specific expression patterns and were found to be highly expressed during meiosis. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of lncRNA57811 displayed similar morphology compared to wild type. The overexpression of lncRNA57811 resulted in low pollen fertility (29.70%) and seed setting (33%) in rice. The differential expression levels of lncRNAs, associated with transposable elements and meiosis-regulated targets, might be endogenous noncoding regulators of pollen/embryo sac development that cause low fertility in autotetraploid rice. The results enhance our understanding about rice lncRNAs, and facilitate functional research in autotetraploid rice.
