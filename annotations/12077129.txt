['12077129', 'Searches with the human Omega glutathione transferase (GST) identified two  outlying groups of the GST superfamily in Arabidopsis thaliana which differed  from all other plant GSTs by containing a cysteine in place of a serine at the  active site. One group consisted of four genes, three of which encoded active  glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs). Two DHARs were  predicted to be cytosolic, whereas the other contained a chloroplast targeting  peptide. The DHARs were also active as thiol transferases but had no glutathione  conjugating activity. Unlike most other GSTs, DHARs were monomeric. The other  class of GST comprised two genes termed the Lambda GSTs (GSTLs). The recombinant  GSTLs were also monomeric and had glutathione-dependent thiol transferase  activity. One GSTL was cytosolic, whereas the other was chloroplast-targeted.  When incubated with oxidized glutathione, the putative active site cysteine of  the GSTLs and cytosolic DHARs formed mixed disulfides with glutathione, whereas  the plastidic DHAR formed an intramolecular disulfide. DHAR S-glutathionylation  was consistent with a proposed catalytic mechanism for dehydroascorbate  reduction. Roles for the cytosolic DHARs and GSTLs as antioxidant enzymes were  also inferred from the induction of the respective genes following exposure to  chemicals and oxidative stress.', '2002 Aug 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M202919200', 'Edwards']
