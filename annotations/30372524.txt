The Kok and Laisk techniques can both be used to estimate light respiration R<sub>light</sub> . We investigated whether responses of R<sub>light</sub> to short- and long-term changes in leaf temperature depend on the technique used to estimate R<sub>light</sub> . We grew Eucalyptus tereticornis in whole-tree chambers under ambient temperature (AT) or AT + 3°C (elevated temperature, ET). We assessed dark respiration R<sub>dark</sub> and light respiration with the Kok (R<sub>Kok</sub> ) and Laisk (R<sub>Laisk</sub> ) methods at four temperatures to determine the degree of light suppression of respiration using both methods in AT and ET trees. The ET treatment had little impact on R<sub>dark</sub> , R<sub>Kok</sub> or R<sub>Laisk</sub> . Although the thermal sensitivities of R<sub>Kok</sub> or R<sub>Laisk</sub> were similar, R<sub>Kok</sub> was higher than R<sub>Laisk</sub> . We found negative values of R<sub>Laisk</sub> at the lowest measurement temperatures, indicating positive net CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, which we propose may be related to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity. Light suppression of R<sub>dark</sub> decreased with increasing leaf temperature, but the degree of suppression depended on the method used. The Kok and Laisk methods do not generate the same estimates of R<sub>light</sub> or light suppression of R<sub>dark</sub> between 20 and 35°C. Negative rates of R<sub>Laisk</sub> imply that this method may become less reliable at low temperatures.
