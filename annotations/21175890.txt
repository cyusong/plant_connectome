['21175890', 'MADS-box genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate diverse  developmental programs in plants. The present work shows the regulation of  flowering time by AGL6 through control of the transcription of both a subset of  the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) family genes and FT, two key regulators of flowering  time. The agl6-1D mutant, in which AGL6 was activated by the 35S enhancer, showed  an early flowering phenotype under both LD and SD conditions. Its early flowering  was additively accelerated by CONSTANS (CO) overexpression. The agl6-1D mutation  strongly suppressed the late flowering of fve-4 and fca-9 mutants. Endogenous  AGL6 transcript accumulation was photoperiod-independent and the AGL6:GFP protein  was preferentially localized in the nucleus. In agl6-1D plants, the expression of  FLC, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING (MAF) 4, and MAF5 was downregulated. Interestingly,  late flowering of a functional FRIGIDA (FRI) FLC allele was dramatically  suppressed by the agl6-1D mutation. AGL6 activation in the flc-3 background  further enhanced FT expression, suggesting that AGL6 also regulates FT expression  independently of FLC mRNA level. A near RNA-null ft-10 mutation completely  suppressed early flowering of the agl6-1D plants, suggesting that FT is a major  downstream output of AGL6. Transgenic plants overexpressing an artificial  microRNA targeting AGL6 showed a late-flowering phenotype. In these plants, FT  expression was downregulated, whereas FLC expression was upregulated. The present  results suggest that AGL6 acts as a floral promoter with a dual role, the  inhibition of the transcription of the FLC/MAF genes and the promotion of FT  expression in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04402.x', 'Ahn']
