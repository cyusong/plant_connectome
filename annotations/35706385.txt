Plant diseases are an important threat to food production. While major pathogenicity determinants required for disease have been extensively studied, less is known on how pathogens thrive during host colonization, especially at early infection stages. Here, we used randomly barcoded-transposon insertion site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) to perform a genome-wide screen and identify key bacterial fitness determinants of the vascular pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (Xcc) during infection of the cauliflower host plant (Brassica oleracea). This high-throughput analysis was conducted in hydathodes, the natural entry site of Xcc, in xylem sap and in synthetic media. Xcc did not face a strong bottleneck during hydathode infection. In total, 181 genes important for fitness were identified in plant-associated environments with functional enrichment in genes involved in metabolism but only few genes previously known to be involved in virulence. The biological relevance of 12 genes was independently confirmed by phenotyping single mutants. Notably, we show that XC_3388, a protein with no known function (DUF1631), plays a key role in the adaptation and virulence of Xcc possibly through c-di-GMP-mediated regulation. This study revealed yet unsuspected social behaviors adopted by Xcc individuals when confined inside hydathodes at early infection stages.
