['11828016', 'Glyoxysomes, a group of specialized peroxisomes, are organelles that degrade  fatty acids by the combination of fatty acid beta-oxidation and glyoxylate cycle.  However, the mechanism underlying the transport of the fatty acids across the  peroxisomal membrane is still obscure in higher plant cells. We identified and  analyzed the PED3 gene and its gene product, Ped3p. The phenotype of the  Arabidopsis ped3 mutant indicated that the mutation in the PED3 gene inhibits the  activity of fatty acid beta-oxidation. Ped3p is a 149-kDa protein that exists in  peroxisomal membranes. The amino acid sequence of Ped3p had a typical  characteristic for "full-size" ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter consisting  of two transmembrane regions and two ATP-binding regions. This protein was  divided into two parts, that had 32% identical amino acid sequences. Each part  showed a significant sequence similarity with peroxisomal "half" ABC transporters  so far identified in mammals and yeast. Ped3p may contribute to the transport of  fatty acids and their derivatives across the peroxisomal membrane.', '2002 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcf023', 'Nishimura']
