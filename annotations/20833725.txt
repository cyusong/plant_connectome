['20833725', 'Many GTPases regulate intracellular transport and signaling in eukaryotes.  Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate GTPases by catalyzing the  exchange of their GDP for GTP. Here we present crystallographic and biochemical  studies of a GEF reaction with four crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana  ARA7, a plant homolog of Rab5 GTPase, in complex with its GEF, VPS9a, in the  nucleotide-free and GDP-bound forms, as well as a complex with aminophosphonic  acid-guanylate ester and ARA7.VPS9a(D185N) with GDP. Upon complex formation with  ARA7, VPS9 wedges into the interswitch region of ARA7, inhibiting the  coordination of Mg(2+) and decreasing the stability of GDP binding. The aspartate  finger of VPS9a recognizes GDP beta-phosphate directly and pulls the P-loop lysine  of ARA7 away from GDP beta-phosphate toward switch II to further destabilize GDP for  its release during the transition from the GDP-bound to nucleotide-free  intermediates in the nucleotide exchange reaction.', '2010 Nov 19', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110.152132', 'Wakatsuki']
