['25442716', "Pollen germination may occur via the so-called germination pores or directly  through the pollen wall at the site of contact with the stigma. In this study, we  addressed what processes take place during pollen hydration (i.e. before tube  emergence), in a species with extra-poral pollen germination, Arabidopsis  thaliana. A T-DNA mutant population was screened by segregation distortion  analysis. Histological and electron microscopy techniques were applied to examine  the wild-type and mutant phenotypes. Within 1 h of the start of pollen hydration,  an intine-like structure consisting of cellulose, callose and at least partly  de-esterified pectin was formed at the pollen wall. Subsequently, this  'germination plaque' gradually extended and opened up to provide passage for the  cytoplasm into the emerging pollen tube. BURSTING POLLEN (BUP) was identified as  a gene essential for the correct organization of this plaque and the tip of the  pollen tube. BUP encodes a novel Golgi-located glycosyltransferase related to the  glycosyltransferase 4 (GT4) subfamily which is conserved throughout the plant  kingdom. Extra-poral pollen germination involves the development of a germination  plaque and BUP defines the correct plastic-elastic properties of this plaque and  the pollen tube tip by affecting pectin synthesis or delivery.", '2015 Apr', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13200', 'Rieu']
