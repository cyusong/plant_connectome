The AP2/ERF gene family is a superfamily of transcription factors that are important in the response of plants to abiotic stress and development. However, comprehensive research of the AP2/ERF genes in the Solanaceae family is lacking. Here, we updated the annotation of AP2/ERF genes in the genomes of eight Solanaceae species, as well as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We identified 2,195 AP2/ERF genes, of which 368 (17%) were newly identified. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we observed expansion of the copy number of these genes, especially those belonging to specific Ethylene-Responsive Factor (ERF) subgroups of the Solanaceae. From the results of chromosomal location and synteny analyses, we identified that the AP2/ERF genes of the pepper (Capsicum annuum), the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and the potato (Solanum tuberosum) belonging to ERF subgroups form a tandem array and most of them are species-specific without orthologs in other species, which has led to differentiation of AP2/ERF gene repertory among Solanaceae. We suggest that these genes mainly emerged through recent gene duplication after the divergence of these species. Transcriptome analyses showed that the genes have a putative function in the response of the pepper and tomato to abiotic stress, especially those in ERF subgroups. Our findings will provide comprehensive information on AP2/ERF genes and insights into the structural, evolutionary, and functional understanding of the role of these genes in the Solanaceae.
