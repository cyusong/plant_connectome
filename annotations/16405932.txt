['16405932', "The biosynthesis of coumarins in plants is not well understood, although these  metabolic pathways are often found in the plant kingdom. We report here the  occurrence of coumarins in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia. Considerably  high levels of scopoletin and its beta-d-glucopyranoside, scopolin, were found in  the wild-type roots. The scopolin level in the roots was approximately  1200nmol/gFW, which was approximately 180-fold of that in the aerial parts. Calli  accumulated scopolin at a level of 70nmol/gFW. Scopoletin and scopolin formation  were induced in shoots after treatment with either 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  (at 100microM) or a bud-cell suspension of Fusarium oxysporum. In order to gain  insight into the biosynthetic pathway of coumarins in A. thaliana, we analyzed  coumarins in the mutants obtained from the SALK Institute collection that carried  a T-DNA insertion within the gene encoding the cytochrome P450, CYP98A3, which  catalyzes 3'-hydroxylation of p-coumarate units in the phenylpropanoid pathway.  The content of scopoletin and scopolin in the mutant roots greatly decreased to  approximately 3% of that in the wild-type roots. This observation suggests that  scopoletin and scopolin biosynthesis in A. thaliana are strongly dependent on the  3'-hydroxylation of p-coumarate units catalyzed by CYP98A3. We also found that  the level of skimmin, a beta-d-glucopyranoside of umbelliferone, was slightly  increased in the mutant roots.", '2006 Feb', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.11.006', 'Sakata']
