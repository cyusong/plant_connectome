In the recent years, multiple ways of interaction between the fields of nanotechnology and biology have been opened, mainly in the biomedical research, with the development of tools for diagnosis and controlled delivery of substances. (1,2) On the other hand, in the field of plant biology, the interaction between both disciplines has been less frequent. Most of the published work on this field has focus in the environmental impact of nanoparticles on crop growth and development; (3,4) and also on the bio production of nanoparticles using plant extracts (reviewed in (5) , as an example see also (6,7,8)). Much less attention has taken other possible aspects of the interrelationship between nanotechnology and plant biology, such as the development of nanodevices for controlled delivery of drugs or different kind of substances, (9,10) in a similar way to that already developed in the medical research.
