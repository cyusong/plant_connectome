Vegetable and ornamental plants represent a very wide group of heterogeneous plants, both herbaceous and woody, generally without relevant salinity-tolerant mechanisms. The cultivation conditions-almost all are irrigated crops-and characteristics of the products, which must not present visual damage linked to salt stress, determine the necessity for a deep investigation of the response of these crops to salinity stress. Tolerance mechanisms are linked to the capacity of a plant to compartmentalize ions, produce compatible solutes, synthesize specific proteins and metabolites, and induce transcriptional factors. The present review critically evaluates advantages and disadvantages to study the molecular control of salt tolerance mechanisms in vegetable and ornamental plants, with the aim of distinguishing tools for the rapid and effective screening of salt tolerance levels in different plants. This information can not only help in suitable germplasm selection, which is very useful in consideration of the high biodiversity expressed by vegetable and ornamental plants, but also drive the further breeding activities.
