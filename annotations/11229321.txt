['11229321', 'N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnTII, EC 2.4.1.143) is a Golgi enzyme  involved in the biosynthesis of glycoprotein-bound N-linked oligosaccharides,  catalysing an essential step in the conversion of oligomannose-type to complex  N-glycans. GnTII activity has been detected in both animals and plants. However,  while cDNAs encoding the enzyme have already been cloned from several mammalian  sources no GnTII homologue has been cloned from plants so far. Here we report the  molecular cloning of an Arabidopsis thaliana GnTII cDNA with striking homology to  its animal counterparts. The predicted domain structure of A. thaliana GnTII  indicates a type II transmembrane protein topology as it has been established for  the mammalian variants of the enzyme. Upon expression of A. thaliana GnTII cDNA  in the baculovirus/insect cell system, a recombinant protein was produced that  exhibited GnTII activity.', '1999 Dec', 'Glycoconj J', '10.1023/a:1007127815012', 'Mucha']
