<i>IbMYB1</i> was one of the major anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory genes that has been identified and utilized in purple-fleshed sweet potato breeding. At least three members of this gene, namely, <i>IbMYB1-1</i>, <i>-2a</i>, and <i>-2b</i>, have been reported. We found that <i>IbMYB1-2a</i> and <i>-2b</i> are not necessary for anthocyanin accumulation in a variety of cultivated species (hexaploid) with purple shoots or purplish rings/spots of flesh. Transcriptomic and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses revealed that persistent and vigorous expression of <i>IbMYB1</i> is essential to maintain the purple color of leaves and storage roots in this type of cultivated species, which did not contain <i>IbMYB1-2</i> gene members. Compared with <i>IbbHLH2</i>, <i>IbMYB1</i> is an early response gene of anthocyanin biosynthesis in sweet potato. It cannot exclude the possibility that other <i>MYBs</i> participate in this gene regulation networks. Twenty-two <i>MYB-like</i> genes were identified from 156 <i>MYBs</i> to be highly positively or negatively correlated with the anthocyanin content in leaves or flesh. Even so, the <i>IbMYB1</i> was most coordinately expressed with anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Differences in flanking and coding sequences confirm that <i>IbMYB2s</i>, the highest similarity genes of <i>IbMYB1</i>, are not the members of <i>IbMYB1</i>. This phenomenon indicates that there may be more members of <i>IbMYB1</i> in sweet potato, and the genetic complementation of these members is involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. The 3' flanking sequence of <i>IbMYB1-1</i> is homologous to the retrotransposon sequence of <i>TNT1-94</i>. Transposon movement is involved in the formation of multiple members of <i>IbMYB1</i>. This study provides critical insights into the expression patterns of <i>IbMYB1</i>, which are involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the leaf and storage root. Notably, our study also emphasized the presence of a multiple member of <i>IbMYB1</i> for genetic improvement.
