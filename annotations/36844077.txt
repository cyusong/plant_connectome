Drought is a severe environmental condition that restricts the vegetative growth and reduces the yield of grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera L.</i>). However, the mechanisms underlying grapevine response and adaptation to drought stress remain unclear. In the present study, we characterized an ANNEXIN gene, <i>VvANN1</i>, which plays a positive role in the drought stress response. The results indicated that <i>VvANN1</i> was significantly induced by osmotic stress. Expression of <i>VvANN1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> enhanced osmotic and drought tolerance through modulating the level of MDA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub> <sup>·-</sup> at the seedling stage, implying that <i>VvANN1</i> might be involved in the process of ROS homeostasis under drought or osmotic stress conditions. Moreover, we used yeast one-hybridization and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to show that VvbZIP45 could regulate <i>VvANN</i>1 expression by directly binding to the promoter region of <i>VvANN</i>1 in response to drought stress. We also generated transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> that constitutively expressed the <i>VvbZIP45</i> gene (35S::<i>VvbZIP45</i>) and further produced <i>VvANN1Pro</i>::GUS/35S::<i>VvbZIP45 Arabidopsis</i> plants <i>via</i> crossing. The genetic analysis results subsequently indicated that VvbZIP45 could enhance GUS expression <i>in vivo</i> under drought stress. Our findings suggest that VvbZIP45 may modulate <i>VvANN1</i> expression in response to drought stress and reduce the impact of drought on fruit quality and yield.
