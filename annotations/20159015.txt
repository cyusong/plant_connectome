Two-pore channels (TPCs or TPCNs) are novel members of the large superfamily of voltage-gated cation channels with slightly higher sequence homology to the pore-forming subunits of voltage-gated Ca(2+) and Na(+) channels than most other members. Recent studies demonstrate that TPCs locate to endosomes and lysosomes and form Ca(2+) release channels that respond to activation by the Ca(2+) mobilizing messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). With multiple endolysosomal targeted NAADP receptors now identified, important new insights into the regulation of endolysosomal function in health and disease will therefore be unveiled.
