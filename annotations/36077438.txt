Saline-alkaline stress suppresses rice growth and threatens crop production. Despite substantial research on rice's tolerance to saline-alkaline stress, fewer studies have examined the impact of magnetic water treatments on saline-alkaline-stressed rice plants. We explored the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in saline-alkaline stress tolerance enhancement via irrigation with magnetized water using Nipponbare. The growth of Nipponbare plants was inhibited by saline-alkaline stress, but this inhibition was alleviated by irrigating the plants with magnetized water, as evidenced by greater plant height, biomass, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rates, and root system in plants irrigated with magnetized water compared to those irrigated with non-magnetized water. Plants that were irrigated with magnetized water were able to acquire more total nitrogen. In addition, we proved that rice seedlings irrigated with magnetized water had a greater root NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-nitrogen concentration and root NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-nitrogen concentration than plants irrigated with non-magnetized water. These findings suggest that treatment with magnetized water could increase nitrogen uptake. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression levels of genes involved in nitrogen acquisition. The expression levels of <i>OsNRT1;1</i>, <i>OsNRT1;2</i>, <i>OsNRT2;1</i>, <i>OsAMT1;2</i>, <i>OsAMT2;1</i>, <i>OsAMT2;2</i>, <i>OsAMT2;3</i>, <i>OsAMT3;1</i>, <i>OsAMT3;2</i>, and <i>OsAMT3;3</i> were higher in plants exposed to magnetized water medium compared to those exposed to non-magnetized water media. We further demonstrated that treatment with magnetized water increases available nitrogen, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-nitrogen content, and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-nitrogen content in soil under saline-alkaline stress. Our results revealed that the increased resistance of rice seedlings to saline-alkaline stress may be attributable to a very effective nitrogen acquisition system enhanced by magnetized water.
