Gene and genome duplications have been rampant during the evolution of flowering plants. Unlike small-scale gene duplications, whole-genome duplications (WGDs) copy entire pathways or networks, and as such create the unique situation in which such duplicated pathways or networks could evolve novel functionality through the coordinated sub- or neofunctionalization of its constituent genes. Here, we describe a remarkable case of coordinated gene expression divergence following WGDs in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> We identified a set of 92 homoeologous gene pairs that all show a similar pattern of tissue-specific gene expression divergence following WGD, with one homoeolog showing predominant expression in aerial tissues and the other homoeolog showing biased expression in tip-growth tissues. We provide evidence that this pattern of gene expression divergence seems to involve genes with a role in cell polarity and that likely function in the maintenance of cell wall integrity. Following WGD, many of these duplicated genes evolved separate functions through subfunctionalization in growth/development and stress response. Uncoupling these processes through genome duplications likely provided important adaptations with respect to growth and morphogenesis and defense against biotic and abiotic stress.
