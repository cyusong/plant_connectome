['17971045', 'The Arabidopsis AtMYB41 gene encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor whose  expression is not detectable under normal growth conditions in any organ or at  any developmental stage analysed. It is expressed at high levels in response to  drought, ABA and salt treatments, suggesting a possible role in stress responses.  Transgenic lines over-expressing this transcription factor showed a pleiotropic  phenotype similar to that exhibited by some mutants that affect cuticle  biosynthesis. This includes a dwarf appearance, dependent on smaller cells with  abnormal morphology, enhanced sensitivity to desiccation, and enhanced  permeability of leaf surfaces, suggesting discontinuity in the cuticle. The  expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, in cell-wall  modifications and cell expansion, genes coding for membrane-associated proteins  and genes specifically involved in cuticle metabolism was differentially  modulated between wild-type and transgenic plants, suggesting a direct or  indirect role of AtMYB41 in the regulation of their transcription. Taken  together, our results suggest that AtMYB41 is part of a complex network of  transcription factors controlling cell expansion and cuticle deposition in  response to abiotic stress.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03310.x', 'Tonelli']
