The ability to measure the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in plants is important when they are exposed to stressful environments. To this end, we developed a unique and versatile biosensor-reporter system to indicate the activation of UPR in living plant cells. The small cytoplasmically spliced intron from the <i>bZIP60</i> locus was incorporated into the 5' end of the GFP gene, creating the 35S::<i>bZIP60</i> intron:GFP construct. When this construct is transiently expressed in <i>Arabidopsis</i> protoplasts, the presence of the <i>bZIP60</i> intron prevents GFP mRNA from being translated under non-UPR conditions. However, when UPR is activated, the IRE1 kinase/ribonuclease splices this intron from the GFP mRNA and its translation proceeds, generating GFP fluorescence. We demonstrated the utility of the system in <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf protoplasts treated with DTT, which is a chemical inducer of UPR, followed by visualization and quantification using confocal microscopy. The 35S::<i>bZIP60</i> intron:GFP construct was also expressed in protoplasts from an overexpressor line containing the coding sequence for the UPR-induced, protein folding chaperone, protein disulfide isomerase-9 (PDI9). PDI9 also influences the strength of the UPR signaling pathway. Protoplasts from WT and <i>PDI9</i> overexpressor plants treated with DTT exhibited significantly higher GFP fluorescence relative to untreated protoplasts, indicating that the <i>bZIP60</i> intron was spliced from the GFP mRNA in response to activation of UPR. RT-PCR further confirmed the higher induction of <i>PDI9</i> and <i>bZIP60</i> (total and spliced) mRNA levels in DTT-treated protoplasts relative to controls. This system can be adapted for monitoring crop stress and for basic studies dissecting the UPR signaling pathway.
