The plant LIMs comprise two sub-families with one (DA1/DAR) and two (2LIM) LIM domains. This review comprehensively discussed the structure and potential role of this protein family in diverse area of plant biology. The description of first eukaryote lineage-specific plant LIM domain (LIN11, ISL1, and MEC3) proteins was observed in Helianthus long back. The successive study of LIM proteins in diverse plants has shown its vital relation to development, metabolism and defence. This nascent gene family has been worked out for their role in actin dynamics, organ size determination and transcription regulation. On grounds of protein architecture, two sub-families have been delineated as DA1/DAR (one LIM domain) and 2LIMs (two LIM domains). The genomic and expression study guides to the identification of diverse sub-categories. The significance of 2LIMs in regulation of actin dynamics leading to pollen growth and development has prospects to understand the plant reproductive behaviour. Interestingly, new facet of these LIMs as a transcriptional regulator in biological pathway/biosynthesis was also reported. Recently, the cumulative contribution of these features was also recognized for obtaining good quality fibre, thus giving translational outlook to this family. The DA1/DAR proteins are orchestrated with additional domains and provide a key role in regulation of organ size and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. This review will focus the journey of plant LIMs till date and will cover details of its structure, type, classification and functional relevance. This will provide insight to identify the potential of this gene family in the improvement of desired crop features.
