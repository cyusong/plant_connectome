['27137927', "Isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) and 3-(2'-methylthio)ethylmalate  dehydrogenase catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of different beta-hydroxyacids  in the leucine- and methionine-derived glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways,  respectively, in plants. Evolution of the glucosinolate biosynthetic enzyme from  IPMDH results from a single amino acid substitution that alters substrate  specificity. Here, we present the x-ray crystal structures of Arabidopsis  thaliana IPMDH2 (AtIPMDH2) in complex with either isopropylmalate and Mg(2+) or  NAD(+) These structures reveal conformational changes that occur upon ligand  binding and provide insight on the active site of the enzyme. The x-ray  structures and kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants are consistent with a  chemical mechanism in which Lys-232 activates a water molecule for catalysis.  Structural analysis of the AtIPMDH2 K232M mutant and isothermal titration  calorimetry supports a key role of Lys-232 in the reaction mechanism. This study  suggests that IPMDH-like enzymes in both leucine and glucosinolate biosynthesis  pathways use a common mechanism and that members of the beta-hydroxyacid reductive  decarboxylase family employ different active site features for similar reactions.", '2016 Jun 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M116.730358', 'Jez']
