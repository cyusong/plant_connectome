['19448033', 'The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway plays an important role in the regulation  of Na+/K+ ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previously,  we reported that the calcium binding proteins SOS3 and SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING  PROTEIN8 (SCaBP8) nonredundantly activate the protein kinase SOS2. Here, we show  that SOS2 phosphorylates SCaBP8 at its C terminus but does not phosphorylate  SOS3. In vitro, SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8 was enhanced by the bimolecular  interaction of SOS2 and SCaBP8 and did not require calcium ions. In vivo, this  phosphorylation was induced by salt stress, occurred at the membrane, stabilized  the SCaBP8-SOS2 interaction, and enhanced plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange  activity. When a Ser at position 237 in the SCaBP8 protein (the SOS2  phosphorylation target) was mutated to Ala, SCaBP8 was no longer phosphorylated  by SOS2 and the mutant protein could not fully rescue the salt-sensitive  phenotype of the scabp8 mutant. By contrast, when Ser-237 was mutated to Asp to  mimic the charge of a phosphorylated Ser residue, the mutant protein rescued the  scabp8 salt sensitivity. These data demonstrate that calcium sensor  phosphorylation is a critical component of SOS pathway regulation of salt  tolerance in Arabidopsis.', '2009 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.066217', 'Guo']
