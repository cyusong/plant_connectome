['21401745', "A temperature-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis, root initiation defective 2-1  (rid2-1), is characterized by peculiar defects in callus formation. To gain  insights into the requirements for the reactivation of cell division, we analyzed  this mutant and isolated the gene responsible, RID2. The phenotypes of rid2-1 in  tissue culture and in seedlings indicated that the rid2 mutation has various  (acute and non-acute) inhibitory effects on different aspects of cell  proliferation. This suggests that the RID2 function is not directly involved in  every cycle of cell division, but is related to 'vitality', supporting cell  proliferation. The rid2-1 mutation was shown to cause nucleolar vacuolation and  excessive accumulation of various intermediates of pre-rRNA processing.  Positional cloning of the RID2 gene revealed that it encodes an evolutionarily  conserved methyltransferase-like protein, which was found to localize in the  nucleus, with accumulation being most evident in the nucleolus. It can be  inferred from these findings that RID2 contributes to the nucleolar activity for  pre-rRNA processing, probably through some methylation reaction.", '2011 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04574.x', 'Sugiyama']
