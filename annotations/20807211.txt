['20807211', 'Immune responses in eukaryotes involve rapid and profound transcriptional  reprogramming. Although mechanisms regulating the amplitude of defense gene  expression have been extensively characterized, those controlling the speed of  defense gene induction are not well understood. Here, we show that the  Arabidopsis Elongator subunit 2 (AtELP2) regulates the kinetics of defense gene  induction. AtELP2 is required for rapid defense gene induction and the  establishment of full basal and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Surprisingly,  biological or chemical induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a  long-lasting plant immunity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, restores  pathogen resistance to Atelp2 mutant plants. Simultaneous removal of AtELP2 and  NPR1, a transcription coactivator essential for full-scale expression of a subset  of defense genes and the establishment of SAR, completely abolishes resistance to  two different ETI-inducing pathogens. These results demonstrate that AtELP2 is an  accelerator of defense gene induction, which functions largely independently of  NPR1 in establishing plant immunity.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04345.x', 'Mou']
