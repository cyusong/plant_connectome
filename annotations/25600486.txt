['25600486', 'Chromatin organization is essential for coordinated gene expression, genome  stability, and inheritance of epigenetic information. The main components  involved in chromatin assembly are specific complexes such as Chromatin Assembly  Factor 1 (CAF-1) and Histone Regulator (HIR), which deposit histones in a DNA  synthesis-dependent or -independent manner, respectively. Here, we characterize  the role of the plant orthologs Histone Regulator A (HIRA), Ubinuclein (UBN) and  Calcineurin Binding protein 1 (CABIN1), which constitute the HIR complex.  Arabidopsis loss-of-function mutants for the various subunits of the complex are  viable, but hira mutants show reduced fertility. We show that loss of HIRA  reduces extractable histone H3 protein levels and decreases nucleosome occupancy  at both actively transcribed genes and heterochromatic regions. Concomitantly,  HIRA contributes to maintenance of silencing of pericentromeric repeats and  certain transposons. A genetic analysis based on crosses between mutants  deficient in subunits of the CAF-1 and HIR complexes showed that simultaneous  loss of both the CAF-1 and HIR histone H3 chaperone complexes severely affects  plant survival, growth and reproductive development. Our results suggest that  HIRA partially rescues impaired histone deposition in fas mutants to preserve  nucleosome occupancy, implying plasticity in histone variant interaction and  deposition.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12758', 'Probst']
