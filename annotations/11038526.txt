['11038526', 'Cold acclimation in plants is associated with the expression of COR  (cold-regulated) genes that encode polypeptides of unknown function. It has been  widely speculated that products of these genes might have roles in freezing  tolerance. Here we provide direct evidence in support of this hypothesis. We show  that constitutive expression of COR15a, a cold-regulated gene of Arabidopsis  thaliana that encodes a chloroplast-targeted polypeptide, enhances the in vivo  freezing tolerance of chloroplasts in nonacclimated plants by almost 2 degrees C,  nearly one-third of the increase that occurs upon cold acclimation of wild-type  plants. Significantly, constitutive expression of COR15a also affects the in  vitro freezing tolerance of protoplasts. At temperatures between -5 and -8  degrees C, the survival of protoplasts isolated from leaves of nonacclimated  transgenic plants expressing COR15a was greater than that of protoplasts isolated  from leaves of nonacclimated wild-type plants. At temperatures between -2 and -4  degrees C, constitutive expression of COR15a had a slight negative effect on  survival. The implications of these data regarding possible modes of COR15a  action are discussed.', '1996 Nov 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.93.23.13404', 'Thomashow']
