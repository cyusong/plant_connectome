Polyamines are implicated in the regulation of many processes in the plant cell, including functioning of ion channels, DNA replication, gene transcription, mRNA translation, cell proliferation and programmed cell death. Plant polyamines occur either in free form, covalently bound to proteins, or conjugated to hydroxycinnamic acids forming phenol amides. <i>Ustilago maydis</i> is a dimorphic and biotrophic pathogenic fungus responsible for common smut or “huitlacoche” in maize; and it is considered an excellent model for the study of plant-pathogen interactions. Recently, we reported alterations in polyamine metabolism of maize tumors induced on leaf blades by <i>Ustilago maydis</i> infection. Our data revealed a striking increase in maize polyamine biosynthesis, mainly free and conjugated putrescine in the tumors and in the green plant tissue surrounding the tumor. In this addendum, we describe that changes in polyamine metabolism take place even in earlier stages of maize plant infection with <i>Ustilago maydis</i>.
