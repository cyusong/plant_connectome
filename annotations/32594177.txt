Drought is one of the most important environmental factors limiting plant growth and productivity. The molecular mechanisms underlying plant drought resistance are complex and not yet fully understood. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MADS-box transcription factor AGL16 acts as a negative regulator in drought resistance by regulating stomatal density and movement. Loss-of-AGL16 mutants were more resistant to drought stress and had higher relative water content, which was attributed to lower leaf stomatal density and more sensitive stomatal closure due to higher leaf ABA levels compared with the wild type. AGL16-overexpressing lines displayed the opposite phenotypes. AGL16 is preferentially expressed in guard cells and down-regulated in response to drought stress. The expression of CYP707A3 and AAO3 in ABA metabolism and SDD1 in stomatal development was altered in agl16 and overexpression lines, making them potential targets of AGL16. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, transient transactivation, yeast one-hybrid, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that AGL16 was able to bind the CArG motifs in the promoters of the CYP707A3, AAO3, and SDD1 and regulate their transcription, leading to altered leaf stomatal density and ABA levels. Taking our findings together, AGL16 acts as a negative regulator of drought resistance by modulating leaf stomatal density and ABA accumulation.
