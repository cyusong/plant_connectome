['24285794', 'Calmodulin N-methyltransferase (CaM KMT) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme in  eukaryotes that transfers three methyl groups to a highly conserved lysyl residue  at position 115 in calmodulin (CaM). We sought to elucidate whether the  methylation status of CaM plays a role in CaM-mediated signaling pathways by gene  expression analyses of CaM KMT and phenotypic characterization of Arabidopsis  thaliana lines wherein CaM KMT was overexpressed (OX), partially silenced, or  knocked out. CaM KMT was expressed in discreet spatial and tissue-specific  patterns, most notably in root tips, floral buds, stamens, apical meristems, and  germinating seeds. Analysis of transgenic plants with genetic dysfunction in CaM  KMT revealed a link between the methylation status of CaM and root length. Plants  with suppressed CaM methylation had longer roots and CaM KMT OX lines had shorter  roots than wild type (Columbia-0). CaM KMT was also found to influence the root  radial developmental program. Protein microarray analyses revealed a number of  proteins with specificity for methylated forms of CaM, providing candidate  functional intermediates between the observed phenotypes and the target pathways.  This work demonstrates that the functionality of the large CaM family in plants  is fine-tuned by an overarching methylation mechanism.', '2013 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.119115', 'Houtz']
