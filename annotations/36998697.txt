It is reported that the use of nanomaterials can extend the vase life of fresh-cut flowers. Graphene oxide (GO) is one of these nanomaterials that aid in promoting water absorption and antioxidation during the preservation of fresh-cut flowers. In this investigation, the three mainstream brands of preservatives commercially available on the market ("<i>Chrysal</i>," "<i>Floralife</i>," and "<i>Long Life</i>") in combination with low concentrations of GO (0.15 mg/L) were used to preserve fresh-cut roses. The results showed that the three brands of preservatives had different degrees of freshness retention. Compared to the preservatives used alone, the combination of low concentrations of GO with the preservatives, especially in the L+GO group (with 0.15 mg/L GO added in the preservative solution of "<i>Long life</i>"), further improved the preservation of cut flowers. L+GO group showed less level of antioxidant enzyme activities, lower ROS accumulation and cell death rate, and higher relative fresh weight than the other groups, implying a better antioxidant and water balance abilities. GO attached to the xylem duct of flower stem, and reduced the blockage of xylem vessels by bacteria, which were determined by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) analysis. XPS (X-ray photoenergy spectra) analysis results proved that GO could enter the interior of flower stem through xylem duct, and when combined with "<i>Long Life</i>," the anti-oxidation protection ability of GO was enhanced, thus delaying ageing, and greatly extending the vase life of fresh-cut flowers. The study provides new insights into cut flower preservation using GO.
