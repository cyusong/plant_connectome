['16367956', "Root-hair morphogenesis is a model for studying the genetic regulation of plant  cell development, and double-mutant analyses have revealed a complex genetic  network underlying the development of this type of cell. Therefore, to increase  knowledge of gene expression in root hairs and to identify new genes involved in  root-hair morphogenesis, the transcriptomes of the root-hair differentiation zone  of wild-type (WT) plants and a tip-growth defective root-hair mutant, rhd2-1,  were compared using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. A set of 606 genes with  significantly greater expression in WT plants defines the 'root-hair  morphogenesis transcriptome'. Compared with the whole genome, this set is highly  enriched in genes known to be involved in root-hair morphogenesis. The additional  gene families and functional groups enriched in the root-hair morphogenesis  transcriptome are cell wall enzymes, hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins  (extensins) and arabinogalactan proteins, peroxidases, receptor-like kinases and  proteins with predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. To discover  new root-hair genes, 159 T-DNA insertion lines identified from the root-hair  morphogenesis transcriptome were screened for defects in root-hair morphogenesis.  This identified knockout mutations in six genes (RHM1-RHM6) that affected  root-hair morphogenesis and that had not previously been identified at the  molecular level: At2g03720 (similar to Escherichia coli universal stress  protein); At3g54870 (armadillo-repeat containing kinesin-related protein);  At4g18640 (leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subfamily VI); At4g26690  (glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase-like GPI-anchored protein);  At5g49270 (COBL9 GPI-anchored protein) and At5g65090 (inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate  5-phosphatase-like protein). The mutants were transcript null, their root-hair  phenotypes were characterized and complementation testing with uncloned root-hair  genes was performed. The results suggest a role for GPI-anchored proteins and  lipid rafts in root-hair tip growth because two of these genes (At4g26690 and  At5g49270) encode predicted GPI-anchored proteins likely to be associated with  lipid rafts, and several other genes previously shown to be required for  root-hair development also encode proteins associated with sterol-rich lipid  rafts.", '2006 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02609.x', 'Smirnoff']
