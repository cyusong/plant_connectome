['22616989', 'Light-regulated protein kinases STN7 and STN8 phosphorylate thylakoid membrane  proteins and also affect expression of several chloroplast proteins via yet  unknown mechanisms. Comparative phosphoproteomics of acetic acid protein extracts  of chloroplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana wild type, stn7, stn8 and stn7stn8  mutants yielded two previously unknown findings: (i) neither STN7 nor STN8 kinase  was required for phosphorylation of Ser-48 in Lhcb1.1-1.3 proteins; and (ii)  phosphorylation of Thr-451 in pTAC16 protein was STN7-dependent. pTAC16 was found  distributed between thylakoids and nucleoid. Its knockout did not affect the  nucleoid protein composition and the Thr-451 phosphorylated protein was excluded  from the nucleoid. Thr-451 of pTAC16 is conserved in all studied plants and its  phosphorylation may regulate membrane-anchoring functions of the nucleoid.', '2012 May 7', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2012.03.061', 'Vener']
