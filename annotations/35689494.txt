Endocytosis, secretion, and endosomal trafficking are key cellular processes that control the composition of the plasma membrane. Through the coordination of these trafficking pathways, cells can adjust the composition, localization, and turnover of proteins and lipids in response to developmental or environmental cues. Upon being incorporated into vesicles and internalized through endocytosis, plant plasma membrane proteins are delivered to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At the TGN, plasma membrane proteins are recycled back to the plasma membrane or transferred to multivesicular endosomes (MVEs), where they are further sorted into intralumenal vesicles for degradation in the vacuole. Both types of plant endosomes, TGN and MVEs, act as sorting organelles for multiple endocytic, recycling, and secretory pathways. Molecular assemblies such as retromer, ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery, small GTPases, adaptor proteins, and SNAREs associate with specific domains of endosomal membranes to mediate different sorting and membrane-budding events. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the recognition and sorting of proteins at endosomes, membrane remodeling and budding, and their implications for cellular trafficking and physiological responses in plants.
