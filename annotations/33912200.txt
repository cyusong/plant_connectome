Ascorbate (ASC) plays a critical role in plant stress response. The antioxidant role of ASC has been well-studied, but there are still several confusing questions about the function of ASC in plant abiotic stress response. ASC can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and should be helpful for plant stress tolerance. But in some cases, increasing ASC content impairs plant abiotic stress tolerance, whereas, inhibiting ASC synthesis or regeneration enhances plant stress tolerance. This confusing phenomenon indicates that ASC may have multiple roles in plant abiotic stress response not just as an antioxidant, though many studies more or less ignored other roles of ASC in plant. In fact, ACS also can act as the cofactor of some enzymes, which are involved in the synthesis, metabolism, and modification of a variety of substances, which has important effects on plant stress response. In addition, ASC can monitor and effectively regulate cell redox status. Therefore, we believe that ASC has atleast triple roles in plant abiotic stress response: as the antioxidant to scavenge accumulated ROS, as the cofactor to involve in plant metabolism, or as the regulator to coordinate the actions of various signal pathways under abiotic stress. The role of ASC in plant abiotic stress response is important and complex. The detail role of ASC in plant abiotic stress response should be analyzed according to specific physiological process in specific organ. In this review, we discuss the versatile roles of ASC in the response of plants to abiotic stresses.
