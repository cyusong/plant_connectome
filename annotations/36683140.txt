Anthocyanins are health-promoting compounds with strong antioxidant properties that play important roles in disease prevention. Litchi chinensis Sonn. is a well-known and economically significant fruit due to its appealing appearance and nutritional value. The mature pericarp of litchi is rich in anthocyanins, whereas the aril (flesh) has an extremely low anthocyanin content. However, the mechanism of anthocyanin differential accumulation in litchi pericarp and aril remained unknown. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analysis were performed to unveil the cause of the deficiency of anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi aril. Numerous anthocyanin biosynthesis-related metabolites and their derivatives were found in the aril, and the levels of rutin and (-)-epicatechin in the aril were comparable to those found in the pericarp, while anthocyanin levels were negligible. This suggests that the biosynthetic pathway from phenylalanine to cyanidin was present but that a block in cyanidin glycosylation could result in extremely low anthocyanin accumulation in the aril. Furthermore, 54 candidate genes were screened using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and 9 genes (LcUFGT1, LcGST1, LcMYB1, LcSGR, LcCYP75B1, LcMATE, LcTPP, LcSWEET10, and LcERF61) might play a significant role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. The dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay revealed that LcMYB1 strongly activated the promoters of LcUFGT1, LcGST4, and LcSWEET10. The results imply that LcMYB1 is the primary qualitative gene responsible for the deficiency of anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi aril, which was confirmed by a transient transformation assay. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific anthocyanin accumulation and will help developing new red-fleshed litchi germplasm.
