['15178800', 'Stomata are epidermal structures that modulate gas exchange between a plant and  its environment. During development, stomata are specified and positioned  nonrandomly by the integration of asymmetric cell divisions and intercellular  signaling. The Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase gene,  YODA, acts as part of a molecular switch controlling cell identities in the  epidermis. Null mutations in YODA lead to excess stomata, whereas constitutive  activation of YODA eliminated stomata. Transcriptome analysis of seedlings with  altered YODA activity was used to identify potential stomatal regulatory genes. A  putative transcription factor from this set was shown to regulate the  developmental behavior of stomatal precursors.', '2004 Jun 4', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1096014', 'Somerville']
