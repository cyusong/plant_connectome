Anthocyanins are important pigments in plants and glycosylation plays an important role in the stability of anthocyanins. Anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5GT) can glycosylate anthocyanin at the 5-O-position. Till now, the enzymatic activity characteristics of 5GT had been studied in vitro in a variety of plants. However, the subcellular localization of 5GT protein still remained unclear, and little genetic evidence on the roles of 5GT in plants has been reported. The full-length Ph5GT gene from petunia (Petunia hybrida) was isolated in this study. Green fluorescent fusion protein assays revealed that Ph5GT protein was localized to the cytoplasm. Ph5GT was found to be highly expressed in flowers, with highest levels of expression occurring during the coloring stage of flower development. Furthermore, Ph5GT silencing led to the change in flower color from purple to light purple and a significant reduction in total anthocyanin content. The metabolome analysis revealed that the content of malvidins and petunidins modified by glycosylation at the 5-O-position was significantly reduced, while the content of their precursor without glycosylation was significantly increased, implying that Ph5GT could glycosylate malvidin and petunidin derivatives and that the substrate types of Ph5GT were expanded in comparison to previous studies.
