Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) around the world. FHB causes significant yield losses and reduces grain quality. The lack of resistance resources is a major bottleneck for wheat FHB resistance breeding. As a wheat relative, Thinopyrum elongatum contains many genes that can be used for wheat improvement. Although the novel gene Fhb-7EL was mapped on chromosome 7EL of Th. elongatum, successful transfer of the FHB resistance gene into commercial wheat varieties has not been reported. In this study, we developed 836 wheat-Th. elongatum translocation lines of various types by irradiating the pollen of the wheat-Th. elongatum addition line CS-7EL at the flowering stage, among which 81 were identified as resistant to FHB. By backcrossing the FHB-resistant lines with the main cultivar Jimai 22, three wheat-Th. elongatum translocation lines, Zhongke 1878, Zhongke 166, and Zhongke 545, were successfully applied in wheat breeding without yield penalty. Combining karyotype and phenotype analyses, we mapped the Fhb-7EL gene to the distal end of chromosome 7EL. Five molecular markers linked with the FHB resistance interval were developed, which facilitates molecular marker-assisted breeding. Altogether, we successfully applied alien chromatin with FHB resistance from Th. elongatum in wheat breeding without yield penalty. These newly developed FHB-resistant wheat-Th. elongatum translocation lines, Zhongke 1878, Zhongke 166, and Zhongke 545, can be used as novel resistance resources for wheat breeding.
