<i>Aegilops tauschii</i>, the D-genome donor of hexaploid wheat, provides a source of genetic variation that could be used for tetraploid (durum) wheat improvement. In addition to the genes for wheat quality on the D-genome, which differentiate between bread and durum wheats in terms of end-use properties, genes coding for resistances to biotic and abiotic stresses are also present on the D-genome which would be useful in durum wheat. The introgression of <i>Ae. tauschii</i> into durum wheat, however, requires cytogenetic manipulation to induce homoeologous chromosome pairing to promote recombination. For this purpose, the introgression of <i>Ae. tauschii</i> into durum wheat was performed through a bridge cross of the wild species to the Langdon 5D(5B) disomic substitution line that lacks the <i>Ph1</i> locus present on chromosome 5B, followed by a cross of the F<sub>1</sub> to the durum wheat cultivar Om Rabi 5. Subsequent generations were self-fertilized, and these were screened for D-genome introgressions using (i) D-genome-specific Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and (ii) KASP markers polymorphic between the 5D chromosomes of wheat, present in the Langdon 5D(5B) substitution line, and of <i>Ae. tauschii</i>. Homozygous introgression lines were confirmed using genomic and fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization. The results showed that the use of the Langdon 5D(5B) disomic substitution line did not promote D-genome introgression across all linkage groups with only a limited success in the introgression of <i>Ae. tauschii</i> 5D segments into durum wheat.
