Potassium homeostasis is essential for pollen development and pollen-pistil interactions during the sexual reproduction of flowering plants. Here, we described the role of a Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel, OsAKT1.2, in rice pollen germination and growth. OsAKT1.2 is specifically expressed in the tricellular pollen, mature pollen grains and growing pollen tubes. Using CRISPR gene editing, we found that knockout lines did not differ from wildtype in vegetative growth, but showed decreased pollen germination rate both in the germination medium and in vivo. OsAKT1.2-GFP fusion protein was localized in the plasma membrane and enriched at the pollen tube tip. OsAKT1.2 could complement the yeast strain which is deficient in K<sup>+</sup> intake. These findings suggest that OsAKT1.2 is associated with pollen germination and tube elongation in rice.
