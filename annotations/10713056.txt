['10713056', 'Protein kinases related to the family of mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) have  been established as signal transduction components in a variety of processes in  plants. For Arabidopsis thaliana, however, although one of the genetically best  studied plant species, biochemical data on activation of mitogen-activated  protein kinases are lacking. A. thaliana MAPK 6 (AtMPK6) is the Arabidopsis  orthologue of a tobacco MAPK termed salicylate-induced protein kinase, which is  activated by general and race-specific elicitors as well as by physical stress.  Using a C terminus-specific antibody, we show that AtMPK6 is activated in  elicitor-treated cell cultures of A. thaliana. Four different elicitors from  bacteria, fungi, and plants lead to a rapid and transient activation of AtMPK6,  indicating a conserved signaling pathway. The induction was equally rapid as  medium alkalinization, one of the earliest elicitor response observed in cell  cultures. A similarly rapid activation of AtMPK6 was observed in elicitor-treated  leaf strips, demonstrating that recognition of the elicitors and activation of  the MAPK pathway occurs also in intact plants. We demonstrate by in vivo labeling  that AtMPK6 is phosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine residues in elicited  cells.', '2000 Mar 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.275.11.7521', 'Boller']
