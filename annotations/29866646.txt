High-temperature (HT) stress induces male sterility, leading to yield reductions in crops. DNA methylation regulates a range of processes involved in plant development and stress responses, but its role in male sterility under HT remains unknown. Here, we investigated DNA methylation levels in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) anthers under HT and normal temperature (NT) conditions by performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to investigate the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in male fertility under HT. Global disruption of DNA methylation, especially CHH methylation (where H = A, C, or T), was detected in an HT-sensitive line. Changes in the levels of 24-nucleotide small-interfering RNAs were significantly associated with DNA methylation levels. Experimental suppression of DNA methylation led to pollen sterility in the HT-sensitive line under NT conditions but did not affect the normal dehiscence of anther walls. Further transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of genes in sugar and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic pathways were significantly modulated in anthers under HT, but auxin biosynthesis and signaling pathways were only slightly altered, indicating that HT disturbs sugar and ROS metabolism via disrupting DNA methylation, leading to microspore sterility. This study opens up a pathway for creating HT-tolerant cultivars using epigenetic techniques.
