['19625491', 'Despite constant threat of oxidative damage, sequence drift in mitochondrial and  chloroplast DNA usually remains very low in plant species, indicating efficient  defense and repair. Whereas the antioxidative defense in the different  subcellular compartments is known, the information on DNA repair in plant  organelles is still scarce. Focusing on the occurrence of uracil in the DNA, the  present work demonstrates that plant mitochondria possess a base excision repair  (BER) pathway. In vitro and in organello incision assays of double-stranded  oligodeoxyribonucleotides showed that mitochondria isolated from plant cells  contain DNA glycosylase activity specific for uracil cleavage. A major proportion  of the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) was associated with the membranes, in  agreement with the current hypothesis that the DNA is replicated, proofread and  repaired in inner membrane-bound nucleoids. Full repair, from uracil excision to  thymidine insertion and religation, was obtained in organello following import of  a uracil-containing DNA fragment into isolated plant mitochondria. Repair  occurred through single nucleotide insertion, which points to short-patch BER. In  vivo targeting and in vitro import of GFP fusions showed that the putative UDG  encoded by the At3g18 630 locus might be the first enzyme of this mitochondrial  pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2009 Sep', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkp606', 'Dietrich']
