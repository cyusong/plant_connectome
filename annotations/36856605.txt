Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are one of the most abundant DNA lesions and are mainly repaired by AP endonucleases (APEs). While most eukaryotic genomes encode two APEs, plants usually possess three APEs, namely APE1L, APE2, and ARP. To date, the biological relevance and functional divergence of plant APEs are unclear. Here, we show that the three plant APEs have ancient origins, with the APE1L clade being plant-specific. In Arabidopsis thaliana, simultaneously mutating APE1L and APE2, but not ARP alone or in combination with either APE1L or APE2, results in clear developmental defects linked to genotoxic stress. Genetic analyses indicated that the three plant APEs have different substrate preferences in vivo. ARP is mainly responsible for AP site repair, while APE1L and APE2 prefer to repair 3' blocked single-stranded DNA breaks. We further determined that APEs play an important role in DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic integrity in meiotic cells. The ape1l ape2 double mutant exhibited a greatly enhanced frequency of SPO11-1-dependent and -independent double-strand DNA breaks. The DNA damage response was activated in ape1l ape2 to trigger pollen abortion. Our findings suggest functional divergence of plant APEs and reveal important roles of plant APEs during vegetative and reproductive development.
