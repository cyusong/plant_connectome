Signaling networks are at the heart of almost all biological processes. Most of these networks contain large number of components, and often either the connections between these components are not known or the rate equations that govern the dynamics of soluble signaling components are not quantified. This uncertainty in network topology and parameters can make it challenging to formulate detailed mathematical models. Boolean networks, in which all components are either on or off, have emerged as viable alternatives to detailed mathematical models that contain rate constants and other parameters. Therefore, open-source platforms of Boolean models for community use are desirable. Here, we present Boolink, a freely available graphical user interface that allows users to easily construct and analyze existing Boolean networks. Boolink can be applied to any Boolean network. We demonstrate its application using a previously published network for abscisic acid (ABA)-driven stomatal closure in Arabidopsis spp. (Arabidopsis thaliana). We also show how Boolink can be used to generate testable predictions by extending the network to include CO2 regulation of stomatal movements. Predictions of the model were experimentally tested, and the model was iteratively modified based on experiments showing that ABA effectively closes Arabidopsis stomata at near-zero CO2 concentrations (1.5-ppm CO2). Thus, Boolink enables public generation and the use of existing Boolean models, including the prior developed ABA signaling model with added CO2 signaling components.
