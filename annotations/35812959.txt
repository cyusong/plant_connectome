The accumulation of the auxin precursor indole-3-acetamide (IAM) in the <i>ami1</i> mutant has recently been reported to reduce plant growth and to trigger abiotic stress responses in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The observed response includes the induction of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis through the promotion of <i>NCED3</i> expression. The mechanism by which plant growth is limited, however, remained largely unclear. Here, we investigated the transcriptional responses evoked by the exogenous application of IAM using comprehensive RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and reverse genetics approaches. The RNA-seq results highlighted the induction of a small number of genes, including the R2R3 MYB transcription factor genes <i>MYB74</i> and <i>MYB102</i>. The two MYB factors are known to respond to various stress cues and to ABA. Consistent with a role as negative plant growth regulator, conditional <i>MYB74</i> overexpressor lines showed a considerable growth reduction. RNA-seq analysis of <i>MYB74</i> mutants indicated an association of MYB74 with responses to osmotic stress, water deprivation, and seed development, which further linked MYB74 with the observed <i>ami1</i> osmotic stress and seed phenotype. Collectively, our findings point toward a role for MYB74 in plant growth control and in responses to abiotic stress stimuli.
