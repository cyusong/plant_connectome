Phytochrome A (phyA) is the primary plant photoreceptor responsible for perceiving and mediating various responses to far-red (FR) light and is essential for survival in canopy shade. In this study, we identified two <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants that grew longer hypocotyls in FR light. Genetic analyses showed that they were allelic and their FR phenotypes were caused by mutations in the gene named <i>TANDEM ZINC-FINGER/PLUS3</i> (<i>TZP</i>), previously shown to encode a nuclear protein involved in blue light signaling and phyB-dependent regulation of photoperiodic flowering. We show that the expression of <i>TZP</i> is dramatically induced by light and that TZP proteins are differentially modified in different light conditions. Furthermore, we show that TZP interacts with both phyA and FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL1 (FHY1) and regulates the abundance of phyA, FHY1, and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 proteins in FR light. Moreover, our data indicate that TZP is required for the formation of a phosphorylated form of phyA in the nucleus in FR light. Together, our results identify TZP as a positive regulator of phyA signaling required for phosphorylation of the phyA photoreceptor, thus suggesting an important role of phosphorylated phyA in inducing the FR light response.
