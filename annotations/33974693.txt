Recent studies have reported that plant-parasitic nematodes facilitate their infection by suppressing plant immunity via effectors, but the inhibitory mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study found that a novel effector MgMO289 is exclusively expressed in the dorsal esophageal gland of Meloidogyne graminicola and is up-regulated at parasitic third-/fourth-stage juveniles. In planta silencing of MgMO289 substantially increased plant resistance to M. graminicola. Moreover, we found that MgMO289 interacts with a new rice copper metallochaperone heavy metal-associated plant protein 04 (OsHPP04), and that rice cytosolic COPPER/ZINC -SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE 2 (cCu/Zn-SOD2) is the target of OsHPP04. Rice plants overexpressing OsHPP04 or MgMO289 exhibited an increased susceptibility to M. graminicola and a higher Cu/Zn-SOD activity, but lower O2•- content, when compared with wild-type plants. Meanwhile, immune response assays showed that MgMO289 could suppress host innate immunity. These findings reveal a novel pathway for a plant pathogen effector that utilizes the host O2•--scavenging system to eliminate O2•- and suppress plant immunity.
