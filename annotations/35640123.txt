Like many organisms, plants have evolved a genetic network, the circadian clock, to coordinate processes with day/night cycles. In plants, the clock is a pervasive regulator of development and modulates many aspects of physiology. Clock-regulated processes range from the correct timing of growth and cell division to interactions with the root microbiome. Recently developed techniques, such as single-cell time-lapse microscopy and single-cell RNA-seq, are beginning to revolutionize our understanding of this clock regulation, revealing a surprising degree of organ, tissue, and cell-type specificity. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our spatial view of the clock across the plant, both in terms of how it is regulated and how it regulates a diversity of output processes. We outline how understanding these spatially specific functions will help reveal the range of ways that the clock provides a fitness benefit for the plant.
