Heavy metals in industrial wastewaters are posing a serious threat to the environment and to human health. Microalgae are increasingly being seen as potential solutions to this problem as they can remove pollutants through biosorption. This process offers certain advantages over other more traditional metal removal techniques as it is simple, inexpensive, eco-friendly, and can be performed over a wide range of experimental conditions. Biosorption is possible due to the unique and complex structure of the microalgal cell wall. The variety of functional groups on the surface of the cell wall (such as carboxyl or amino groups) can act as binding sites for the heavy metals, thus removing them from the environment. This review focuses on the cell wall composition and structure of the most commonly used microalgae in heavy metal removal and shows the role of their cell wall in the biosorption process. This review also aims to report the most commonly used models to predict the velocity of microalgal biosorption and the removal capacities.
