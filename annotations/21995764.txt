Diffusible signal factor (DSF) family signal-mediated quorum sensing (QS) has been identified in many gram-negative bacteria. This QS pathway of Xanthomonas spp. consists of three major QS components: RpfF, RpfC, and RpfG. The rpfF gene encodes a putative enoyl-CoA hydratase that catalyzes the synthesis of the signal molecule. RpfC and RpfG serve as a two-component system for the perception and transduction of the extracellular DSF family signals. In order to further characterize the QS regulatory network in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, we investigated the RpfF, RpfC, and RpfG regulons by using transcriptome analyses. Comparison of the transcriptomes of the QS mutants (rpfF, rpfC, and rpfG) with that of the wild-type strain revealed a core group of genes controlled by all three QS components, suggesting that the RpfC-RpfG two-component system is a major and conserved signal perception and transduction system for DSF family signal-mediated QS in X. citri subsp. citri. The unique genes controlled by RpfF alone indicate the complexity of the QS pathway and the involvement of additional sensory mechanisms in X. citri subsp. citri. The unique genes controlled by RpfC and RpfG, respectively, support the possibility that RpfC and RpfG play broader roles in gene regulation other than transduction of DSF signals.
