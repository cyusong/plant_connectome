The cytidine analogue 5-azacytidine, which causes DNA demethylation, induced flowering in the non-vernalization-requiring plants Perilla frutescens var. crispa, Silene armeria and Pharbitis nil (synonym Ipomoea nil) under non-inductive photoperiodic conditions, suggesting that the expression of photoperiodic flowering-related genes is regulated epigenetically by DNA methylation. The flowering state induced by DNA demethylation was not heritable. Changes in the genome-wide methylation state were examined by methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. This analysis indicated that the DNA methylation state was altered by the photoperiodic condition. DNA demethylation also induced dwarfism, and the induced dwarfism of P. frutescens was heritable.
