Histone acetylation is controlled by HATs and HDACs, which are essential epigenetic elements that regulate plant response to environmental stresses. A previous study revealed that a deficiency in an HDAC isoform (HDA19) increases tolerance to high salinity stress in the Arabidopsis wild-type Col-0 background. Here, the increased tolerance of hda19 to drought and heat stresses is demonstrated. Results indicate that hda19 plants have greater tolerance than wild-type plants to stress conditions. The data indicate that the stress response pathway coordinated by HDA19 plays a pivotal role in increasing tolerance to a variety of different abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis, including salinity, drought, and heat. The greater level of tolerance of hda19 plants to several different environmental stresses suggests that HDA19 represents a promising target for pharmacological manipulation in order to enhance abiotic stress tolerance in plants.
