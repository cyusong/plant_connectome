Interactions between plants and microbes are ubiquitous. The outcomes of these interactions involve interkingdom communication, with myriad, diverse signals moving between microbes and their potential plant hosts. Years of biochemical, genetic, and molecular biology research have provided an overview of the landscape of the repertoires of effectors and elicitors encoded by microbes that allow them to stimulate and manipulate responses from their potential plant hosts. Similarly, considerable insight into the plant machinery and capacity for responding to microbes has been gained. The advent of new bioinformatics and modeling approaches has greatly contributed to our understanding of how these interactions occur, and it is expected that these tools, coupled with burgeoning genome sequencing data, will eventually allow the prediction of the outcome of these interactions and whether they will result in a relationship that benefits one or both partners. As a complement to these studies, cell biological studies are elucidating how cells in the plant hosts behave in response to microbial signals. Such studies have brought new attention to the indispensable role of the plant endomembrane system in determining the outcome of plant-microbe interactions. This Focus Issue addresses not only how the plant endomembrane acts locally to mediate responses to microbes but, also, the importance of the plant endomembrane beyond the plant cell borders for cross-kingdom effects.
