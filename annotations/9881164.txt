['9881164', 'Serine biosynthesis in plants proceeds by two pathways; a photorespiratory  pathway which is associated with photorespiration and a pathway from  phosphoglycerate. A cDNA encoding plastidic phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT)  which catalyzes the formation of phosphoserine from phosphohydroxypyruvate has  been isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana. Genomic DNA blot analysis indicated that  this enzyme is most probably encoded by a single gene and is mapped on the lower  arm of chromosome 4. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal extension  exhibiting the general features of a plastidic transit peptide, which was  confirmed by subcellular organelle localization using GFP (green flourescence  protein). Northern analysis indicated preferential expression of PSAT in roots of  light-grown plants, supporting the idea that the phosphorylated pathway may play  an important role in supplying the serine requirement of plants in non-green  tissues. In situ hybridization analysis of PSAT revealed that the gene is  generally expressed in all types of cells with a significantly higher amount in  the meristem tissue of root tips.', '1998 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1998.00313.x', 'Saito']
