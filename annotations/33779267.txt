<i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> is one of the most devastating pests of potato in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). Nematode-infected tubers develop external as well as internal defects, making the potato tubers unmarketable, and resulting in economic losses. Draft genome assemblies of three <i>M. chitwoodi</i> genotypes-race 1, race 2 and race 1 pathotype Roza-were generated using Illumina and PacBio Sequel RS II sequencing. The final assemblies consist of 30, 39, and 38 polished contigs for race 1, race 2 and race 1 pathotype Roza, respectively, with average N<sub>50</sub> of 2.37 Mb and average assembled genome size of approximately 47.41 Mb. On average, 10,508 genes were annotated for each genome. Benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog (BUSCO) analysis indicated that 69.80% of the BUSCOs were complete whereas 68.80, 0.93, and 12.67% were single copy, duplicated, and fragmented, respectively. These highly contiguous genomes will enrich resources to study potato-nematode interactions and enhance breeding efforts to develop nematode-resistant potato varieties for the PNW.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
