Resistance to downy mildew (DM) and powdery mildew (PM) contributes to sustainable vineyard management by reducing the diseases and the need for fungicide applications. Resistant varieties vary in their degree of resistance to DM and PM, and in their susceptibility to other diseases. As a consequence, fungicide use may differ among varieties depending on their "resistance patterns" (i.e., the resistance level of a variety toward all of the diseases in the vineyard). The resistance patterns of 16 grapevine varieties to DM, PM, black rot (BR), and gray mold (GM) were evaluated over a 4-year period under field conditions. Disease severity was assessed on leaves and bunches, and the AUDPC (Area Under Disease Progress Curve) was calculated to represent the epidemic progress. GM was found only on bunches and only at very low levels, irrespective of the year or variety, and was therefore excluded from further analyses. The varieties were then grouped into four resistance patterns: i) low resistance to DM and PM, intermediate resistance to BR; ii) high resistance to DM, intermediate resistance to PM, low resistance to BR; iii) intermediate resistance to DM and BR, low resistance to PM; and iv) high resistance to DM, PM, and BR. AUDPC values on leaves were positively correlated with AUDPC values on bunches for susceptible varieties but not for resistant ones, with the exception of PM. Therefore, bioassays with leaves can be used to predict the resistance of bunches to DM and BR for susceptible varieties but not for resistant ones. These results may facilitate both strategic and tactical decisions for the sustainable management of grapevine diseases.
