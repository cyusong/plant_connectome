Abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) both inhibit seed germination, but their interactions during this process remain elusive. Here, we report the identification of a 'SAPK10-bZIP72-AOC' pathway, through which ABA promotes JA biosynthesis to synergistically inhibit rice seed germination. Using biochemical interaction and phosphorylation assays, we show that SAPK10 exhibits autophosphorylation activity on the 177<sup>th</sup> serine, which enables it to phosphorylate bZIP72 majorly on 71<sup>st</sup> serine. The SAPK10-dependent phosphorylation enhances bZIP72 protein stability as well as the DNA-binding ability to the G-box cis-element of AOC promoter, thereby elevating the AOC transcription and the endogenous concentration of JA. Blocking of JA biosynthesis significantly alleviated the ABA sensitivity on seed germination, suggesting that ABA-imposed inhibition partially relied on the elevated concentration of JA. Our findings shed a novel insight into the molecular networks of ABA-JA synergistic interaction during rice seed germination.
