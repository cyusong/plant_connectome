Homologs of PUTATIVE RECOMBINATION INITIATION DEFECT 1 (PRD1) are known to be essential for meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation in mouse (Mus musculus), Arabidopsis, and rice (Oryza sativa). Recent research has shown that rice PRD1 also plays an unanticipated role in meiotic bipolar spindle assembly, revealing that PRD1 has multiple functions in plant meiosis. In this study, we characterize the meiotic function of PRD1 in maize (Zea mays; ZmPRD1). Our results show that Zmprd1 mutant plants display normal vegetative growth but have complete male and female sterility. Meiotic DSB formation is fully abolished in mutant meiocytes, leading to failure in homologous pairing, synapsis, and recombination. ZmPRD1 exhibits a different pattern of chromosome localization compared to its rice homologs. The ZmPRD1 protein interacts with several DSB-forming proteins, but does not directly interact with the kinetochore proteins REC8 and SGO1. Possibly as a result of this, there are no significant abnormalities of bipolar spindle assembly in Zmprd1 meiocytes. Overall, our results demonstrate that ZmPRD1 is essential for DSB formation and homologous recombination in maize meiosis. However, the recently-identified function of PRD1 in bipolar spindle assembly during rice meiosis is not conserved in maize.
