['17563365', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains five genes that encode two pore K+ (TPK)  channels. The most abundantly expressed isoform of this family, TPK1, is  expressed at the tonoplast where it mediates K+ -selective currents between  cytoplasmic and vacuolar compartments. TPK1 open probability depends on both  cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cytoplasmic pH but not on the tonoplast membrane voltage.  The channel shows intrinsic rectification and can be blocked by Ba2+,  tetraethylammonium, and quinine. TPK1 current was found in all shoot cell types  and shows all of the hallmarks of the previously described vacuolar K (VK)  tonoplast channel characterized in guard cells. Characterization of TPK1  loss-of-function mutants and TPK1-overexpressing plants shows that TPK1 has a  role in intracellular K+ homeostasis affecting seedling growth at high and low  ambient K+ levels. In stomata, TPK1 function is consistent with vacuolar K+  release, and removal of this channel leads to slower stomatal closure kinetics.  During germination, TPK1 contributes to the radicle development through vacuolar  K+ deposition to provide expansion growth or in the redistribution of essential  minerals.', '2007 Jun 19', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0702595104', 'Maathuis']
