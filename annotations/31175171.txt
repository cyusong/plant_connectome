['31175171', 'The dynamic trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) facilitates cargo sorting  and trafficking and plays a vital role in plant development and environmental  response. Transport protein particles (TRAPPs) are multi-protein complexes acting  as guanine nucleotide exchange factors and possibly as tethers, regulating  intracellular trafficking. TRAPPs are essential in all eukaryotic cells and are  implicated in a number of human diseases. It has been proposed that they also  play crucial roles in plants; however, our current knowledge about the structure  and function of plant TRAPPs is very limited. Here, we identified and  characterized AtTRAPPC11/RESPONSE TO OLIGOGALACTURONIDE2 (AtTRAPPC11/ROG2), a  TGN/EE-associated, evolutionarily conserved TRAPP protein in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 regulates TGN integrity, as evidenced by  altered TGN/EE association of several residents, including SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS61,  and altered vesicle morphology in attrappc11/rog2 mutants. Furthermore, endocytic  traffic and brefeldin A body formation are perturbed in attrappc11/rog2,  suggesting a role for AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 in regulation of endosomal function.  Proteomic analysis showed that AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 defines a hitherto uncharacterized  TRAPPIII complex in plants. In addition, attrappc11/rog2 mutants are  hypersensitive to salinity, indicating an undescribed role of TRAPPs in stress  responses. Overall, our study illustrates the plasticity of the endomembrane  system through TRAPP protein functions and opens new avenues to explore this  dynamic network.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00110', 'ORCID:']
