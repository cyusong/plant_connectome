Optimal stomatal theory predicts that stomata operate to maximise photosynthesis (A<sub>net</sub> ) and minimise transpirational water loss to achieve optimal intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE). We tested whether this theory can predict stomatal responses to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub> ), and whether it can capture differences in responsiveness among woody plant functional types (PFTs). We conducted a meta-analysis of tree studies of the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on iWUE and its components A<sub>net</sub> and stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ). We compared three PFTs, using the unified stomatal optimisation (USO) model to account for confounding effects of leaf-air vapour pressure difference (D). We expected smaller g<sub>s</sub> , but greater A<sub>net</sub> , responses to eCO<sub>2</sub> in gymnosperms compared with angiosperm PFTs. We found that iWUE increased in proportion to increasing eCO<sub>2</sub> in all PFTs, and that increases in A<sub>net</sub> had stronger effects than reductions in g<sub>s</sub> . The USO model correctly captured stomatal behaviour with eCO<sub>2</sub> across most datasets. The chief difference among PFTs was a lower stomatal slope parameter (g<sub>1</sub> ) for the gymnosperm, compared with angiosperm, species. Land surface models can use the USO model to describe stomatal behaviour under changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.
