Plant development requires regulation of both cell division and differentiation. The class 1 KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes such as knotted1 (kn1) in maize (Zea mays) and SHOOTMERISTEMLESS in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) play a role in maintaining shoot apical meristem indeterminacy, and their misexpression is sufficient to induce cell division and meristem formation. KNOX overexpression experiments have shown that these genes interact with the cytokinin, auxin, and gibberellin pathways. The L1 layer has been shown to be necessary for the maintenance of indeterminacy in the underlying meristem layers. This work explores the possibility that the L1 affects meristem function by disrupting hormone transport pathways. The semidominant Extra cell layers1 (Xcl1) mutation in maize leads to the production of multiple epidermal layers by overproduction of a normal gene product. Meristem size is reduced in mutant plants and more cells are incorporated into the incipient leaf primordium. Thus, Xcl1 may provide a link between L1 division patterns, hormonal pathways, and meristem maintenance. We used double mutants between Xcl1 and dominant KNOX mutants and showed that Xcl1 suppresses the Kn1 phenotype but has a synergistic interaction with gnarley1 and rough sheath1, possibly correlated with changes in gibberellin and auxin signaling. In addition, double mutants between Xcl1 and crinkly4 had defects in shoot meristem maintenance. Thus, proper L1 development is essential for meristem function, and XCL1 may act to coordinate hormonal effects with KNOX gene function at the shoot apex.
