In Arabidopsis thaliana, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades that contain MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 have been implicated in various aspects of developmental processes and stress responses. We identified an ethylene response factor (ERF104), which controls innate immunity, to be a specific substrate of MPK6 and showed that ethylene signaling regulates the release of the ERF104 substrate from its kinase. Implications and questions that arise from our findings are addressed. To promote discussions, previously unpublished data, that are rather confounding, are presented and possible explanation provided on how these may fit into our current model.

MPK3: !affects! MAPK signaling

ERF104: !localizes to! innate immunity
MPK6: !interacts with! ERF104
ethylene: !enhances! release of ERF104 substrate
ERF104: !represses! ethylene signaling
