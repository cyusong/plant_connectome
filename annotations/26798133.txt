['26798133', 'H3K9 methylation is usually associated with DNA methylation, and together they  symbolize transcriptionally silenced heterochromatin. A number of proteins  involved in epigenetic processes have been characterized. However, how the  stability of these proteins is regulated at the post-translational level is  largely unknown. Here, we show that an Arabidopsis JmjC domain protein, JMJ24,  possesses ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. JMJ24 directly targets a DNA  methyltransferase, CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), for proteasomal degradation to  initiate destabilization of the heterochromatic state of endogenous silenced  loci. Our results uncover an additional connection between two conserved  epigenetic modifications: histone modification and DNA methylation.', '2016 Feb 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.274647.115', 'Chua']
