Annexins belong to a multigene family of Ca(2+) dependent, phospholipid and cytoskeleton binding proteins. They have been shown to be upregulated under various stress conditions. We generated transgenic cotton plants expressing mustard annexin (AnnBj1), which showed enhanced tolerance towards different abiotic stress treatments like sodium chloride, mannitol, polyethylene glycol and hydrogen peroxide. The tolerance to these treatments was associated with decreased hydrogen peroxide levels and enhanced total peroxidase activity, enhanced content of osmoprotectants- proline and sucrose in transgenic plants. They showed higher retention of total chlorophyll and reduced TBARS in leaf disc assays with stress treatments, and decreased hydrogen peroxide accumulation in the stomatal guard cells when compared to their wild type counterparts. They also showed significantly enhanced fresh weight, relative water content, dry weight under stress. Treatment with sodium chloride resulted in enhanced expression of genes for Delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylase synthetase in leaves, and sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase and cellulose synthase A in the leaves and fibers of transgenic plants. The transgenic plants maintained normal seed development, fiber quality and cellulose content under stress.
