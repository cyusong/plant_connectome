External salinization can affect different steps of nitrogen (N) metabolism (ion uptake, N assimilation, and amino acid and protein synthesis) depending on the inorganic N source. Here, we assessed the net uptake of N supplied as nitrate or ammonium and N assimilation (combining metabolite analyses with molecular biological approaches) in grey poplar (Populus x canescens) plants grown under saline (75 mM NaCl) and control conditions. The specific (micromol N g(-1) dry weight fine roots h(-1)) and total plant (micromol N per plant h(-1)) N net uptake rates, total plant N content, total plant biomass and total leaf protein concentration were reduced under saline conditions when plants were supplied with ammonium. In both nutritional groups, salt treatment caused pronounced accumulation of soluble N compounds in the leaves. The mRNAs of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing rate-limiting steps of both proline synthesis and degradation (delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase and proline dehydrogenase) as well as for NADH-dependent glutamate synthase were accumulated under saline conditions. Whereas under control conditions the plant N status seemed to be superior when ammonium was supplied, the N balance of ammonium-fed plants was more severely affected by salt stress than that of plants supplied with nitrate. Possible metabolic implications of stress-related accumulation of particular amino acids are discussed.
