Mycotoxins are among the environmental stressors whose oxidative action is currently widely studied. The aim of this paper was to investigate the response of seedling leaves to zearalenone (ZEA) applied to the leaves (directly) and to the grains (indirectly) in tolerant and sensitive wheat cultivars. Biochemical analyses of antioxidant activity were performed for chloroplasts and showed a similar decrease in this activity irrespective of plant sensitivity and the way of ZEA application. On the other hand, higher amounts of superoxide radical (microscopic observations) were generated in the leaves of plants grown from the grains incubated in ZEA solution and in the sensitive cultivar. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies showed that upon ZEA treatment greater numbers of Mn - aqua complexes were formed in the leaves of the tolerant wheat cultivar than in those of the sensitive one, whereas the degradation of Fe-protein complexes occurred independently of the cultivar sensitivity. The changes in the quantity of stable, organic radicals formed by stabilizing reactive oxygen species on biochemical macromolecules, indicated greater potential for their generation in leaf tissues subjected to foliar ZEA treatment. This suggested an important role of these radical species in protective mechanisms mainly against direct toxin action. The way the defense mechanisms were activated depended on the method of the toxin application.
