ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) is a versatile plant-exclusive protein, initially described as a trithorax group (TrxG) factor that regulates transcriptional activation and counteracts polycomb group (PcG) repressor function. As part of TrxG, ULT1 interacts with ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX1 (ATX1) to regulate H3K4me3 activation mark deposition. However, our recent studies indicate that ULT1 can also act independently of ATX1. Moreover, the ULT1 ability to interact with transcription factors (TFs) and PcG proteins indicates that it is a versatile protein with other roles. Therefore, in this work we revised recent information about the function of Arabidopsis ULT1 to understand the roles of ULT1 in plant development. Furthermore, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of ULT1, highlighting its epigenetic role, in which ULT1 seems to have characteristics of an epigenetic molecular switch that regulates repression and activation processes via TrxG and PcG complexes.
