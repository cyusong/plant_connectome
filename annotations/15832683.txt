Common bean genotypes BAT477, COCOT, DOR364, Flamingo, and NAG310 were inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 and grown under phosphorus deficiency. This treatment induced a significant decrease in shoot and nodule growth that varied among genotypes from 35% to 57% and from 45% to 61%, respectively, whereas root biomass was less affected. Phosphorus deficiency affected differently the genotypes for nodule number and size, and the responses of nodulated-root O2 uptake (Conr) to raising rhizospheric PO2. From the later data, nodule conductance could be computed by dividing the slope of the regression of Conr as a function of external pO2 by nodule surface area. It is concluded that differences in nodule conductance are related to genotypic tolerance to P deficiency.
