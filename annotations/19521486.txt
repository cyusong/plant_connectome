Modern corn (Zea mays L.) varieties have been selected for their ability to maintain productivity in dense plantings. We have tested the possibility that the physiological consequence of the selection involves changes in responsiveness to light and auxin.Etiolated seedlings of two older corn hybrids 307 and 3306 elongated significantly more than seedlings of a modern corn hybrid 3394. The level of endogenous auxin and activity of PAT in 307 and 3394 were similar. Hybrid 3394 shows resistance to auxin- and light-induced responses at the seedling, cell and molecular levels. Intact 3394 plants exhibited less responsiveness to the inhibitory effect of R, FR and W, auxin, anti-auxin and inhibitors of PAT. In excised mesocotyl tissue 3394 seedlings also showed essentially low responsiveness to NAA. Cells of 3394 were insensitive to auxin- and light-induced hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. Expression of ABP4 was much less in 3394 than in 307, and in contrast to 307, it was not upregulated by NAA, R and FR. Preliminary analysis of abp mutants suggests that ABPs may be involved in development of leaf angle in corn.Our results confirm the understanding that auxin interacts with light in the regulation of growth and development of young seedlings and suggest that in corn ABPs may be involved in growth of maize seedlings and development of leaf angle. We hypothesize that ABP4 plays an important role in the auxin- and/or light-induced growth responses. We also hypothesize that in the modern corn hybrid 3394, ABP4 is "mutated," which may result in the observed 3394 phenotypes, including upright leaves.
