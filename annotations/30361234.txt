['30361234', 'Guard cells control the aperture of stomatal pores to balance photosynthetic  carbon dioxide uptake with evaporative water loss. Stomatal closure is triggered  by several stimuli that initiate complex signaling networks to govern the  activity of ion channels. Activation of SLOW ANION CHANNEL1 (SLAC1) is central to  the process of stomatal closure and requires the leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) GUARD CELL HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-RESISTANT1 (GHR1),  among other signaling components. Here, based on functional analysis of nine  Arabidopsis thaliana ghr1 mutant alleles identified in two independent  forward-genetic ozone-sensitivity screens, we found that GHR1 is required for  stomatal responses to apoplastic reactive oxygen species, abscisic acid, high  CO(2) concentrations, and diurnal light/dark transitions. Furthermore, we show  that the amino acid residues of GHR1 involved in ATP binding are not required for  stomatal closure in Arabidopsis or the activation of SLAC1 anion currents in  Xenopus laevis oocytes and present supporting in silico and in vitro evidence  suggesting that GHR1 is an inactive pseudokinase. Biochemical analyses suggested  that GHR1-mediated activation of SLAC1 occurs via interacting proteins and that  CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE3 interacts with GHR1. We propose that GHR1 acts  in stomatal closure as a scaffolding component.', '2018 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00441', 'ORCID:']
