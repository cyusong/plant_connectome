Microbial volatiles play an expedient role in the agricultural ecological system by enhancing plant growth and inducing systemic resistance against plant pathogens, without causing hazardous effects on the environment. To explore the effects of VOCs of Ralstonia solanacearum TBBS1 (Rs) on tobacco plant growth and on plant growth promoting efficiency of VOCs produced by Bacillus subtilis SYST2, experiments were conducted both in vitro and in planta. The VOCs produced by SYST2 significantly enhanced the plant growth and induced the systemic resistance (ISR) against wilt pathogen Rs in all experiments. The SYST2-VOCs significantly increased PPO and PAL activity and over-expressed the genes relating to expansin, wilt resistance, and plant defense while repressed the genes relating to ethylene production. More interestingly, VOCs produced by pathogen, Rs had no significant effect on plant growth; however, Rs-VOCs decreased the growth promoting potential of SYST2-VOCs when plants were exposed to VOCs produced by both SYST2 and Rs. The co-culture of SYST2 and Rs revealed that they inhibited the growth of each other; however, the inhibition of Rs by SYST2-VOCs appeared to be greater than that of SYST2 by Rs-VOCs. Our findings provide new insights regarding the interaction among SYST2-VOCs, Rs-VOCs and plant, resulting in growth promotion and induced systemic resistance against the bacterial wilt pathogen Rs. This is the first report of the effect of VOCs produced by pathogenic microorganism on plant growth and on plant growth-promoting and systemic resistance-inducing potential of PGPR strain SYST2.
