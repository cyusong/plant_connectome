['23336935', 'Peroxisomes are essential eukaryotic organelles that mediate various metabolic  processes. Peroxisome import depends on a group of peroxisome biogenesis factors  called peroxins, many of which are evolutionarily conserved. PEX2, PEX10, and  PEX12 are three RING-finger-domain-containing integral membrane peroxins crucial  for protein import. In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae), RING peroxins act as E3  ligases, facilitating the recycling of the peroxisome import receptor protein  PEX5 through ubiquitination. In plants, RING peroxins are essential to plant  vitality. To elucidate the mode of action of the plant RING peroxins, we employed  in vitro assays to show that the Arabidopsis RING peroxins also have E3 ligase  activities. We also identified a PEX2-interacting protein, DSK2b, which is a  member of the ubiquitin receptor family known to function as shuttle factors  ferrying polyubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for degradation. DSK2b  and its tandem duplicate DSK2a are localized in the cytosol and the nucleus, and  both interact with the RING domain of PEX2 and PEX12. DSK2 artificial microRNA  lines did not display obvious defects in plant growth or peroxisomal processes,  indicating functional redundancies among Arabidopsis ubiquitin receptor proteins.  Our results suggest that Arabidopsis RING peroxins can function as E3 ligases and  act together with the ubiquitin receptor protein DSK2 in the peroxisomal  membrane-associated protein degradation system.', '2013 Jan', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12014', 'Hu']
