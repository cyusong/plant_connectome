['17600708', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) are phytosteroid hormones controlling various  physiological processes critical for normal growth and development. BRs are  perceived by a protein complex containing two transmembrane receptor kinases,  BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1)  [1-3]. BRI1 null mutants exhibit a dwarfed stature with epinastic leaves, delayed  senescence, reduced male fertility, and altered light responses. BAK1 null  mutants, however, only show a subtle phenotype, suggesting that functionally  redundant proteins might be present in the Arabidopsis genome. Here we report  that BAK1-LIKE 1 (BKK1) functions redundantly with BAK1 in regulating BR  signaling. Surprisingly, rather than the expected bri1-like phenotype, bak1 bkk1  double mutants exhibit a seedling-lethality phenotype due to constitutive  defense-gene expression, callose deposition, reactive oxygen species (ROS)  accumulation, and spontaneous cell death even under sterile growing conditions.  Our detailed analyses demonstrate that BAK1 and BKK1 have dual physiological  roles: positively regulating a BR-dependent plant growth pathway, and negatively  regulating a BR-independent cell-death pathway. Both BR signaling and  developmentally controlled cell death are critical to optimal plant growth and  development, but the mechanisms regulating early events in these pathways are  poorly understood. This study provides novel insights into the initiation and  crosstalk of the two signaling cascades.', '2007 Jul 3', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.036', 'Li']
