Wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L., 2<i>n</i> = 6<i>x</i> = 42, AABBDD) is the world's most widely cultivated crop and an important staple food for humans, accounting for one-fifth of calories consumed. Proteins encoded by the <i>regulator of chromosome condensation 1</i> (<i>RCC1</i>) are highly conserved among eukaryotes and consist of seven repeated domains that fold into a seven-bladed propeller structure. In this study, a total of 76 <i>RCC1</i> genes of bread wheat were identified <i>via</i> a genome-wide search, and their phylogenetic relationship, gene structure, protein-conserved domain, chromosome localization, conserved motif, and transcription factor binding sites were systematically analyzed using the bioinformatics approach to indicate the evolutionary and functional features of these genes. The expression patterns of 76 <i>TaRCC1</i> family genes in wheat under various stresses were further analyzed, and RT-PCR verified that <i>RCC1-3A</i> (<i>TraesCS3A02G362800</i>), <i>RCC1-3B</i> (<i>TraesCS3B02G395200</i>), and <i>RCC1-3D</i> (<i>TraesCS3D02G35650</i>) were significantly induced by salt, cold, and drought stresses. Additionally, the co-expression network analysis and binding site prediction suggested that <i>Myb-7B</i> (<i>TraesCS7B02G188000</i>) and <i>Myb-7D</i> (<i>TraesCS7D02G295400</i>) may bind to the promoter of RCC1-3A/3B and upregulate their expression in response to abiotic stresses in wheat. The results have furthered our understanding of the wheat <i>RCC1</i> family members and will provide important information for subsequent studies and the use of <i>RCC1</i> genes in wheat.
