The R2R3-MYB transcription factor (TF) family regulates metabolism of phenylpropanoids in various plant lineages. Species-expanded or specific MYB TFs may regulate species-specific metabolite biosynthesis including phenylpropanoid-derived bioactive products. <i>Camellia sinensis</i> produces an abundance of specialized metabolites, which makes it an excellent model for digging into the genetic regulation of plant-specific metabolite biosynthesis. The most abundant health-promoting metabolites in tea are galloylated catechins, and the most bioactive of the galloylated catechins, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is specifically relative abundant in <i>C. sinensis</i>. However, the transcriptional regulation of galloylated catechin biosynthesis remains elusive. This study mined the R2R3-MYB TFs associated with galloylated catechin biosynthesis in <i>C. sinensis</i>. A total of 118 R2R3-MYB proteins, classified into 38 subgroups, were identified. R2R3-MYB subgroups specific to or expanded in <i>C. sinensis</i> were hypothesized to be essential to evolutionary diversification of tea-specialized metabolites. Notably, nine of these <i>R2R3-MYB</i> genes were expressed preferentially in apical buds (ABs) and young leaves, exactly where galloylated catechins accumulate. Three putative <i>R2R3-MYB</i> genes displayed strong correlation with key galloylated catechin biosynthesis genes, suggesting a role in regulating biosynthesis of epicatechin gallate (ECG) and EGCG. Overall, this study paves the way to reveal the transcriptional regulation of galloylated catechins in <i>C. sinensis</i>.
