The salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway plays an important role in plant salt stress; however, the transcriptional regulation of the genes in this pathway is unclear. In this study, we found that Linker histone variant HIS1-3 and WRKY1 oppositely regulate the salt stress response in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) through the transcriptional regulation of SOS genes. The expression of HIS1-3 was inhibited by salt stress, and the disruption of HIS1-3 resulted in enhanced salt tolerance. Conversely, the expression of WRKY1 was induced by salt stress, and the loss of WRKY1 function led to increased salt sensitivity. The expression of SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 was repressed and induced by HIS1-3 and WRKY1, respectively, and HIS1-3 regulated the expression of SOS1 and SOS3 by occupying the WRKY1 binding sites on their promoters. Moreover, WRKY1 and HIS1-3 acted upstream of the SOS pathway. Together, our results indicate that HIS1-3 and WRKY1 oppositely modulate salt tolerance in Arabidopsis through transcriptional regulation of SOS genes.
