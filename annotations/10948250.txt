['10948250', 'Serine carboxypeptidases contain a conserved catalytic triad of serine,  histidine, and aspartic acid active-site residues. These enzymes cleave the  peptide bond between the penultimate and C-terminal amino acid residues of their  protein or peptide substrates. The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative has revealed  that the Arabidopsis genome encodes numerous proteins with homology to serine  carboxypeptidases. Although many of these proteins may be involved in protein  turnover or processing, the role of virtually all of these serine  carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) proteins in plant metabolism is unknown. We  previously identified an Arabidopsis mutant, sng1 (sinapoylglucose accumulator  1), that is defective in synthesis of sinapoylmalate, one of the major  phenylpropanoid secondary metabolites accumulated by Arabidopsis and some other  members of the Brassicaceae. We have cloned the gene that is defective in sng1  and have found that it encodes a SCPL protein. Expression of SNG1 in Escherichia  coli demonstrates that it encodes sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase, an  enzyme that catalyzes a transesterification instead of functioning like a  hydrolase, as do the other carboxypeptidases. This finding suggests that SCPL  proteins have acquired novel functions in plant metabolism and provides an  insight into the evolution of secondary metabolic pathways in plants.', '2000 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.8.1295', 'Chapple']
