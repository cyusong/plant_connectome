Phytochromes play vital roles in the regulation of flowering time, but little is known in Panicoideae species, especially the C<sub>4</sub> model Setaria. Here, genomic variations of PHYTOCHROME C (PHYC) between wild and cultivated Setaria gene pools were analysed and three SiphyC mutants were identified. The function of SiPHYC was verified by CRISPR-Cas9 approach and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, efficiency of indoor cultivation of SiphyC mutants were systematically evaluated. An extreme purified selection of PHYC was detected in wild to cultivated domestication process of Setaria. SiphyC mutants and knockout transgenic plants showed an early heading date and a loss of response to short-day photoperiod. Furthermore, variable expression of SiFTa, SiMADS14 and SiMADS15 might be responsible for promoting flowering of SiphyC mutants. Moreover, SiphyC mutant was four times that of the indoor plot ratio of wild-type and produced over 200 seeds within 45 d per individual. Our results suggest that domestication-associated SiPHYC repressed flowering and determined Setaria as a short-day plant, and SiphyC mutants possess the potential for creating efficient indoor cultivation system suitable for research on Setaria as a model, and either for maize or sorghum as well.
