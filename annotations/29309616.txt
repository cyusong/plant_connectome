Fruits are an important part of the human diet and sugar content is a major criterion used to evaluate fruit quality. Melon fruit accumulate high sugar concentrations during their development; however, the mechanism through which these sugars are transported into the vacuoles of fruit cells for storage remains unclear. In this study, three tonoplast sugar transporters (TSTs), CmTST1, CmTST2, and CmTST3, were isolated from melon plants. Analysis of subcellular localization revealed that all these proteins were targeted to the tonoplast, and evaluation of spatial expression and promoter-GUS activity indicated that they had different expression patterns in the plant. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR results indicated that CmTST2 exhibited the highest expression level among the TST isoforms during melon fruit development. Histochemical and immunohistochemistry localization experiments were performed to identify the tissue- and cell-type localization of CmTST2 in the fruit, and the results indicated that both its transcription and translation were in the mesocarp and vascular cells. Overexpressing the CmTST2 gene in strawberry fruit and cucumber plants by transient expression and stable transformation, respectively, both increased sucrose, fructose, and glucose accumulation in the fruit. The results indicate that CmTST2 plays an important role in sugar accumulation in melon fruit.
