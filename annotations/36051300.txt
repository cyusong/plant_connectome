Abiotic stresses are major environmental conditions that reduce plant growth, productivity and quality. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) approaches can be used to screen stress-responsive proteins and reveal the mechanisms of protein response to various abiotic stresses. Biotin-based proximity labeling (PL) is a recently developed technique to label proximal proteins of a target protein. TurboID, a biotin ligase produced by directed evolution, has the advantages of non-toxicity, time-saving and high catalytic efficiency compared to other classic protein-labeling enzymes. TurboID-based PL has been successfully applied in animal, microorganism and plant systems, particularly to screen transient or weak protein interactions, and detect spatially or temporally restricted local proteomes in living cells. This review concludes classic PPI approaches in plant response to abiotic stresses and their limitations for identifying complex network of regulatory proteins of plant abiotic stresses, and introduces the working mechanism of TurboID-based PL, as well as its feasibility and advantages in plant abiotic stress research. We hope the information summarized in this article can serve as technical references for further understanding the regulation of plant adaptation to abiotic stress at the protein level.
