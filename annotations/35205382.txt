['35205382', "DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification required for the specific  regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genome stability in plants  and animals. However, the mechanism of DNA demethylation remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that two SGS3-like proteins, FACTOR OF DNA DEMETHYLATION 1 (FDDM1)  and FDDM2, negatively affect the DNA methylation levels at ROS1-dependend DNA  loci in Arabidopsis. FDDM1 binds dsRNAs with 5' overhangs through its XS (rice  gene X and SGS3) domain and forms a heterodimer with FDDM2 through its XH (rice  gene X Homology) domain. A lack of FDDM1 or FDDM2 increased DNA methylation  levels at several ROS1-dependent DNA loci. However, FDDM1 and FDDM2 may not have  an additive effect on DNA methylation levels. Moreover, the XS and XH domains are  required for the function of FDDM1. Taken together, these results suggest that  FDDM1 and FDDM2 act as a heterodimer to positively modulate DNA demethylation.  Our finding extends the function of plant-specific SGS3-like proteins.", '2022 Feb 12', 'Genes (Basel)', '10.3390/genes13020339', 'Yu']
