Polyamines are considered to participate in various processes of plant development. In this study, the possible implication of putrescine catabolism by the copper-containing amine oxidases (CuAOs, EC 1.4.3.6) in the development of roots and hypocotyls was examined. For this purpose, two cDNA clones of Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Williams, designated as GmCuAO1 and GmCuAO2, exhibiting extensive similarity with previously characterized CuAO clones from other plants, have been isolated and characterized. The expression of the GmCuAO1 gene is root- and hypocotyl-specific, while GmCuAO2 seems not to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Moreover, the GmCuAO1 gene is predominantly expressed in tissues which are characterized by rapid extension growth, such as the apical segments of etiolated hypocotyls. Using convex and concave segments of the etiolated hypocotyl apical hook it has been demonstrated that GmCuAO1 is strongly expressed in expanding cells of the concave part when exposed to light, while the same pattern is also followed by the activity of enzymes involved in putrescine catabolism. In dark and photoperiodically grown hypocotyls, activity measurements of the enzymes involved in putrescine catabolism have shown that the activity of these enzymes is several-fold higher in rapidly growing tissues. Furthermore, the cellular and tissue distribution of GmCuAO1 gene transcripts in the root axis and in hypocotyls confirmed their abundance in developing tissues and expanding cells. The results provide evidence suggesting that a tissue-specific gene coding for CuAO is correlated with cell expansion in fast-growing tissues of root and hypocotyls.
