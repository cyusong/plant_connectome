The beneficial root-colonizing fungus <i>Colletotrichum tofieldiae</i> mediates plant growth promotion (PGP) upon phosphate (Pi) starvation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. This activity is dependent on the Trp metabolism of the host, including indole glucosinolate (IG) hydrolysis. Here, we show that <i>C. tofieldiae</i> resolves several Pi starvation-induced molecular processes in the host, one of which is the downregulation of auxin signaling in germ-free plants, which is restored in the presence of the fungus. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated an <i>Arabidopsis</i> triple mutant lacking three homologous nitrilases (NIT1 to NIT3) that are thought to link IG-hydrolysis products with auxin biosynthesis. Retained <i>C. tofieldiae</i>-induced PGP in <i>nit1/2/3</i> mutant plants demonstrated that this metabolic connection is dispensable for the beneficial activity of the fungus. This suggests that either there is an alternative metabolic link between IG-hydrolysis products and auxin biosynthesis, or <i>C. tofieldiae</i> restores auxin signaling independently of IG metabolism. We show that <i>C. tofieldiae</i>, similar to pathogenic microorganisms, triggers <i>Arabidopsis</i> immune pathways that rely on IG metabolism as well as salicylic acid and ethylene signaling. Analysis of IG-deficient <i>myb</i> mutants revealed that these metabolites are, indeed, important for control of in planta <i>C. tofieldiae</i> growth: however, enhanced <i>C. tofieldiae</i> biomass does not necessarily negatively correlate with PGP. We show that Pi deficiency enables more efficient colonization of <i>Arabidopsis</i> by <i>C. tofieldiae</i>, possibly due to the MYC2-mediated repression of ethylene signaling and changes in the constitutive IG composition in roots.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
