NAC proteins constitute one of the largest transcription factor families and are involved in regulation of plant development and stress responses. Our previous transcriptome analyses of tobacco revealed a significant increase in the expression of <i>NtNAC028</i> during leaf yellowing. In this study, we found that <i>NtNAC028</i> was rapidly upregulated in response to high salinity, dehydration, and abscisic acid (ABA) stresses, suggesting a vital role of this gene in abiotic stress response. <i>NtNAC028</i> loss-of-function tobacco plants generated <i>via</i> CRISPR-Cas9 showed delayed leaf senescence and increased tolerance to drought and salt stresses. Meanwhile <i>NtNAC028</i> overexpression led to precocious leaf senescence and hypersensitivity to abiotic stresses in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, indicating that <i>NtNAC028</i> functions as a positive regulator of natural leaf senescence and a negative regulator of stress tolerance. Furthermore, <i>NtNAC028</i>-overexpressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants showed lower antioxidant enzyme activities, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS), and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation under high salinity, resulted in more severe oxidative damage after salt stress treatments. On the other hand, <i>NtNAC028</i> mutation in tobacco resulted in upregulated expression of ROS-scavenging and abiotic stress-related genes, higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and enhanced tolerance against abiotic stresses, suggesting that <i>NtNAC028</i> might act as a vital regulator for plant stress response likely by mediating ROS scavenging ability. Collectively, our results indicated that the <i>NtNAC028</i> plays a key regulatory role in leaf senescence and response to multiple abiotic stresses.
