Indole-3-carboxylic acid (I3CA) is an indolic compound that induces resistance in Arabidopsis adult plants against the necrotrophic fungus <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i> through primed callose accumulation. In this study, we confirm the relevance of <i>ATL31</i> and <i>SYP121</i> genes involved in vesicular trafficking in I3CA priming of defenses and we discard camalexin as a mediator of I3CA-induced resistance (IR) in adult plants. In addition, we observed that an intact I3CA biosynthetic pathway is necessary for I3CA-IR functionality.

ATL31: !involved in! Vesicular trafficking
SYP121: !involved in! Vesicular trafficking
