MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression that play crucial roles in the responses to diverse stresses. To explore jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent miRNA-mediated regulatory networks that are responsive to root-knot nematode (RKN), two small RNA libraries were constructed from wild-type (WT) and JA mutant (spr2) plants. A total of 263 known miRNAs and 441 novel miRNAs were significantly regulated under RKN stress in the two libraries. The spatio-temporal expression of candidate miRNAs and their corresponding targets were analysed by qRT-PCR under RKN stress. A clear negative correlation was observed between miR319 and its target TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PRO-LIFERATING CELL FACTOR 4 (TCP4) in leaf, stem, and root under RKN stress, implying that the miR319/TCP4 module is involved in the systemic defensive response. Reverse genetics demonstrated that the miR319/TCP4 module affected JA synthetic genes and the endogenous JA level in leaves, thereby mediating RKN resistance. These results suggested that the action of miR319 in serving as a systemic signal responder and regulator that modulated the RKN systemic defensive response was mediated via JA. The potential cross-talk between miR319/TCP4 and miR396/GRF (GROWTH RESPONDING FACTOR) in roots under RKN invasion is discussed, and a predictive model regarding miR319/TCP4-mediated RKN resistance is proposed.
