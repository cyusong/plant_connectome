['11161203', 'Cryptochromes and phytochromes are the major photosensory receptors in plants and  often regulate similar photomorphogenic responses. The molecular mechanisms  underlying functional interactions of cryptochromes and phytochromes remain  largely unclear. We have identified an Arabidopsis photomorphogenic mutant, sub1,  which exhibits hypersensitive responses to blue light and far-red light. Genetic  analyses indicate that SUB1 functions as a component of a cryptochrome signaling  pathway and as a modulator of a phytochrome signaling pathway. The SUB1 gene  encodes a Ca2+-binding protein that suppresses light-dependent accumulation of  the transcription factor HY5.', '2001 Jan 19', 'Science', '10.1126/science.291.5503.487', 'Lin']
