['22427336', 'Plant cells can be sensitized toward a subsequent pathogen attack by avirulent  pathogens or by chemicals such as beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA). This process is  called priming. Using a reverse genetic approach in Arabidopsis thaliana, we  demonstrate that the BABA-responsive L-type lectin receptor kinase-VI.2  (LecRK-VI.2) contributes to disease resistance against the hemibiotrophic  Pseudomonas syringae and the necrotrophic Pectobacterium carotovorum bacteria.  Accordingly, LecRK-VI.2 mRNA levels increased after bacterial inoculation or  treatments with microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). We also show that  LecRK-VI.2 is required for full activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI);  notably, lecrk-VI.2-1 mutants show reduced upregulation of PTI marker genes,  impaired callose deposition, and defective stomatal closure. Overexpression  studies combined with genome-wide microarray analyses indicate that LecRK-VI.2  positively regulates the PTI response. LecRK-VI.2 is demonstrated to act upstream  of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, but independently of reactive  oxygen production and Botrytis-induced kinase1 phosphorylation. In addition,  complex formation between the MAMP receptor flagellin sensing2 and its signaling  partner brassinosteroid insensitive1-associated kinase1 is observed in  flg22-treated lecrk-VI.2-1 mutants. LecRK-VI.2 is also required for full  BABA-induced resistance and priming of PTI. Our work identifies LecRK-VI.2 as a  novel mediator of the Arabidopsis PTI response and provides insight into  molecular mechanisms governing priming.', '2012 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.095778', 'Zimmerli']
