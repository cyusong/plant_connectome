Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in plant stress response. In <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, which is model species for molecular biology research on monocot plants, the histone deacetylase BdHD1, homologous to <i>AtHDAC1</i> of the RPD3/HDA1 class, functions as a positive regulator in the plant drought stress response. <i>AtHDAC1</i> has been found to interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. However, the drought-responsive transcription factors that interact with BdHD1 have not been identified yet. Previously, we identified BdWRKY24 and BdMYB22 as drought responsive transcription factors in <i>Brachypodium</i>. In this study, we used yeast two-hybrid (Y2 H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays to show that BdHD1 interacts with BdWRKY24 and BdMYB22. Our findings provides a base to investigate BdHD1-transcription factor complexes in the context of drought stress response in <i>Brachypodium</i>.
