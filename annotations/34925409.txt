Each plant cell has hundreds of copies of the chloroplast genome and chloroplast transgenes do not undergo silencing. Therefore, chloroplast transformation has many powerful potential agricultural and industrial applications. We previously succeeded in integrating exogenous genes into the chloroplast genome using peptide-DNA complexes composed of plasmid DNA and a fusion peptide consisting of a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) and a chloroplast transit peptide (cpPD complex). However, how cpPD complexes are transported into the chloroplast from outside the cell remains unclear. Here, to characterize the route by which these cpPD complexes move into chloroplasts, we tracked their movement from the extracellular space to the chloroplast stroma using a fluorescent label and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Upon infiltration of cpPD complexes into the extracellular space of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leaves, the complexes reached the chloroplast surface within 6h. The cpPD complexes reached were engulfed by the chloroplast outer envelope membrane and gradually integrated into the chloroplast. We detected several cpPD complexes localized around chloroplast nucleoids and observed the release of DNA from the cpPD. Our results thus define the route taken by the cpPD complexes for gene delivery from the extracellular space to the chloroplast stroma.
