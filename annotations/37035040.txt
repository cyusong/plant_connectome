The ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factors, which is one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, are involved in biological and abiotic stress response and play an important role in plant growth and development. In this study, the <i>GmABR1</i> gene from the soybean inbred line Zhonghuang24 (ZH24)×Huaxia 3 (HX3) was investigated its aluminum (Al) tolerance. GmABR1 protein has a conserved domain AP2, which is located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation ability. The results of real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the <i>GmABR1</i> gene presented a constitutive expression pattern rich in the root tip, stem and leaf tissues of HX3. After Al stress, the <i>GmABR1</i> transcript was significantly increased in the roots. The transcripts of <i>GmABR1</i> in the roots of HX3 treated with 50 µM AlCl<sub>3</sub> was 51 times than that of the control. The <i>GmABR1</i> was spatiotemporally specific with the highest expression levels when Al concentration was 50 µM, which was about 36 times than that of the control. The results of hematoxylin staining showed that the root tips of <i>GmABR1</i>-overexpression lines were stained the lightest, followed by the control, and the root tips of <i>GmABR1</i> RNAi lines were stained the darkest. The concentrations of Al<sup>3+</sup> in root tips were 207.40 µg/g, 147.74 µg/g and 330.65 µg/g in wild type (WT), overexpressed lines and RNAi lines, respectively. When AlCl<sub>3</sub> (pH4.5) concentration was 100 µM, all the roots of Arabidopsis were significantly inhibited. The taproot elongation of WT, <i>GmABR1</i> transgenic lines was 69.6%, 85.6%, respectively. When treated with Al, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in leaves of WT increased to 3.03 µg/g, while that of transgenic Arabidopsis increased from 1.66-2.21 µg/g, which was lower than that of WT. Under the Al stress, the Al stress responsive genes such as <i>AtALMT1</i> and <i>AtMATE</i>, and the genes related to ABA pathway such as <i>AtABI1</i>, <i>AtRD22</i> and <i>AtRD29A</i> were up-regulated. The results indicated that <i>GmABR1</i> may jointly regulate plant resistance to Al stress through genes related to Al stress response and ABA response pathways.
