Plant root-produced constitutive and inducible defences inhibit pathogenic microorganisms within roots and in the rhizosphere. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying host responses during root-pathogen interactions are largely unexplored. Using the model species Brachypodium distachyon (Bd), we studied transcriptional and metabolic responses altered in Bd roots following challenge with Fusarium graminearum (Fg), a fungal pathogen that causes diseases in diverse organs of cereal crops. Shared gene expression patterns were found between Bd roots and spikes during Fg infection associated with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). Overexpression of BdMYB78, an up-regulated transcription factor, significantly increased root resistance during Fg infection. We show that Bd roots recognize encroaching Fg prior to physical contact by altering transcription of genes associated with multiple cellular processes such as reactive oxygen species and cell development. These changes coincide with altered levels of secreted host metabolites detected by an untargeted metabolomic approach. The secretion of Bd metabolites was suppressed by Fg as enhanced levels of defence-associated metabolites were found in roots during pre-contact with a Fg mutant defective in host perception and the ability to cause disease. Our results help to understand root defence strategies employed by plants, with potential implications for improving the resistance of cereal crops to soil pathogens.
