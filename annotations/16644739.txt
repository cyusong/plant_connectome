['16644739', 'Plant genomes contain genetically encoded isoforms of most nucleotide sugar  interconversion enzymes. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana has five genes  encoding functional UDP-D-glucose/UDP-D-galactose 4-epimerase (named UGE1 to  UGE5). All A. thaliana UDP-d-glucose 4-epimerase isoforms are dimeric in  solution, maximally active in vitro at 30-40 degrees C, and show good activity  between pH 7 and pH 9. In vitro, UGE1, -3, and -5 act independently of externally  added NAD+, whereas cofactor addition stimulates the activity of UGE2 and is  particularly important for UGE4 activity. UGE1 and UGE3 are most efficiently  inhibited by UDP. The five isoforms display kcatUDP-Gal values between 23 and 128  s(-1) and KmUDP-Gal values between 0.1 and 0.3 mm. This results in enzymatic  efficiencies ranging between 97 and 890 mm(-1) s(-1) for UGE4 = UGE1 < UGE3 <  UGE5 < UGE2. The KmUDP-Glc values, derived from the Haldane relationship, were  0.76 mm for UGE1, 0.56 mm for UGE4, and between 0.13 and 0.23 mm for UGE2, -3,  and -5. The expression of UGE isoforms is ubiquitous and displays developmental  and cell type-dependent variations. UGE1 and -3 expression patterns globally  resemble enzymes involved in carbohydrate catabolism, and UGE2, -4, and -5  expression is more related to carbohydrate biosynthesis. UGE1, -2, and -4 are  present in the cytoplasm, whereasUGE4 is additionally enriched close to Golgi  stacks. All UGE genes tested complement the UGE4rhd1 phenotype, confer increased  galactose tolerance in planta, and complement the galactose metabolization  deficiency in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gal10 mutant. We suggest that plant  UGE isoforms function in different metabolic situations and that enzymatic  properties, gene expression pattern, and subcellular localization contribute to  the differentiation of isoform function.', '2006 Jun 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M512727200', 'Seifert']
