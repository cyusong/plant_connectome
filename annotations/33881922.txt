<i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> causes bacterial wilt disease in solanaceous crops. Identification of avirulence type III-secreted effectors recognized by specific disease resistance proteins in host plant species is an important step toward developing durable resistance in crops. In the present study, we show that <i>R. solanacearum</i> effector RipJ functions as an avirulence determinant in <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i> LA2093. In all, 10 candidate avirulence effectors were shortlisted based on the effector repertoire comparison between avirulent Pe_9 and virulent Pe_1 strains. Infection assays with transgenic strain Pe_1 individually carrying a candidate avirulence effector from Pe_9 revealed that only RipJ elicits strong bacterial wilt resistance in <i>S. pimpinellifolium</i> LA2093. Furthermore, we identified that several RipJ natural variants do not induce bacterial wilt resistance in <i>S. pimpinellifolium</i> LA2093. RipJ belongs to the YopJ family of acetyltransferases. Our sequence analysis indicated the presence of partially conserved putative catalytic residues. Interestingly, the conserved amino acid residues in the acetyltransferase catalytic triad are not required for effector-triggered immunity. In addition, we show that RipJ does not autoacetylate its lysine residues. Our study reports the identification of the first <i>R. solanacearum</i> avirulence protein that triggers bacterial wilt resistance in tomato. We expect that our discovery of RipJ as an avirulence protein will accelerate the development of bacterial wilt-resistant tomato varieties in the future.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
