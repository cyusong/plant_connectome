A versatile hub for cellular control, the eukaryotic protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme family is thought to achieve specificity through combinatorial complexity. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that expansion of PP2A gene families resulted from whole genome duplications followed by non-random gene loss, and selection analysis suggests that retention of B56/PPP2R5 gene family members after genome duplication events was driven by functional diversification. Here we identify the sites at which positive selection is detected in the plant B56 gene family, and discuss the significance of selection at these positions in the context of PP2A holoenzyme structure. The pattern of positive selection observed in the B11 subclade is distinctive, and suggests selective pressure on interactions with substrates and the enzymatic core.
