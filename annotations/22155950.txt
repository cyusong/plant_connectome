Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the main naturally occurring auxin, is essential for almost every aspect of plant growth and development. However, only recently have studies finally established the first complete auxin biosynthesis pathway that converts tryptophan (Trp) to IAA in plants. Trp is first converted to indole-3-pyruvate (IPA) by the TAA family of amino transferases and subsequently IAA is produced from IPA by the YUC family of flavin monooxygenases. The two-step conversion of Trp to IAA is the main auxin biosynthesis pathway that plays an essential role in many developmental processes.

TAA: !converts! Trp 
YUC: !converts! IPA 
Trp: !converts to! IPA 
IPA: !converts to! IAA 
IAA: !essential for! plant growth and development 
TAA/YUC: !play essential role in! many developmental processes
