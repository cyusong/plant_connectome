The wax gourd (<i>Benincasa hispida</i>) is an important vegetable crop whose fruits contain nutrients and metabolites. <i>Small auxin upregulated RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes constitute the largest early auxin-responsive gene family and regulate various biological processes in plants, although this gene family has not been studied in the wax gourd. Here, we performed genome-wide identification of the <i>SAUR</i> gene family in wax gourds and analyzed their syntenic and phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, conserved motifs, <i>cis</i>-acting elements, and expression patterns. A total of 68 <i>SAUR</i> (<i>BhSAUR</i>) genes were identified, which were distributed on nine chromosomes with 41 genes in two clusters. More than half of the <i>BhSAUR</i> genes were derived from tandem duplication events. The BhSAUR proteins were classified into seven subfamilies. <i>BhSAUR</i> gene promoters contained <i>cis</i>-acting elements involved in plant hormone and environmental signal responses. Further expression profiles showed that <i>BhSAUR</i> genes displayed different expression patterns. <i>BhSAUR60</i> was highly expressed in fruits, and overexpression led to longer fruits in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. In addition, the plants with overexpression displayed longer floral organs and wavy stems. In conclusion, our results provide a systematic analysis of the wax gourd <i>SAUR</i> gene family and facilitate the functional study of <i>BhSAUR60</i> during wax gourd fruit development.
