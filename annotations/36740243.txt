SPINDLY (SPY) is a novel nucleocytoplasmic protein O-fucosyltransferase that regulates target protein activity or stability via O-fucosylation of specific Ser/Thr residues. Previous genetic studies indicate that AtSPY regulates plant development during vegetative and reproductive growth by modulating gibberellin and cytokinin responses. AtSPY also regulates the circadian clock and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The pleiotropic phenotypes of spy mutants point to the likely role of AtSPY in regulating key proteins functioning in diverse cellular pathways. However, very few AtSPY targets are known. Here, we identified 88 SPY targets from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and Nicotiana benthamiana via the purification of O-fucosylated peptides using Aleuria aurantia lectin followed by electron transfer dissociation-MS/MS analysis. Most AtSPY targets were nuclear proteins that function in DNA repair, transcription, RNA splicing, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Cytoplasmic AtSPY targets were involved in microtubule-mediated cell division/growth and protein folding. A comparison with the published O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) proteome revealed that 30% of AtSPY targets were also O-GlcNAcylated, indicating that these distinct glycosylations could co-regulate many protein functions. This study unveiled the roles of O-fucosylation in modulating many key nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and provided a valuable resource for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms involved.
