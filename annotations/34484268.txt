Phosphorus plays an important role in plant growth and development, and is an important limiting factor for crop yield. Although previous studies have shown that 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) plays an important role in plant resistance to adversity, its response to low phosphorus (P) stress remains unknown. In this study, we reported the cloning and characterization of a cytosolic 6PGDH gene, <i>Gm6PGDH1</i>, which enhanced the tolerance to phosphate (Pi) starvation by improving root system development and modifying the antioxidant system in transgenic plants. <i>Gm6PGDH1</i> was highly expressed in the root at full bloom stage, and strongly induced by Pi starvation. The results from intact soybean composite plant and soybean plant, both containing a <i>Gm6PGDH1</i>-overexpressing construct, showed that <i>Gm6PGDH1</i> was involved in root system development, and subsequently affected P uptake under Pi-deficient conditions. Meanwhile, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the root tip of transgenic soybean was reduced, and the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes was enhanced compared with those of the wild type under Pi-deficient conditions. Interestingly, we found that the overexpression of <i>Gm6PGDH1</i> weakened the response of several other important Pi-answer genes to Pi starvation, such as some purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) and redox-related genes. In addition, the results from a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) indicated that <i>Gm6PGDH1</i> might have functional redundancy in soybean, and the results from a heterogeneous transformation system showed that overexpressing <i>Gm6PGDH1</i> also enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Together, these results suggested the great potential of <i>Gm6PGDH1</i> in crop breeding for low Pi tolerance.
