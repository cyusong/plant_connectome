['27717447', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in chloroplasts have been proposed to act  as signaling molecules for plant immunity through pathogen-associated molecular  patterns (PAMPs), such as flg22. To elucidate this process, we herein conducted  genetic screening of flg22-sensitive mutants from T-DNA insertion lines lacking  chloroplastic H(2)O(2)-responsive genes. The results obtained showed that  knockout mutants lacking a clade IV TGA transcription factor, TGA10, were more  sensitive to the flg22 treatment than wild-type plants. Furthermore, although no  flg22-sensitive phenotype was detected in the knockout mutant of another clade IV  TGA9, double knockout tga9 tga10 mutants showed more sensitivity to flg22 than  single knockout mutants. Transcripts of TGA10 and TGA9 were strongly induced by  flg22 in leaves, and this was facilitated by the double knockout of stromal and  thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidases (APX), which are major H(2)O(2) scavengers  in chloroplasts. The flg22-induced H(2)O(2) accumulation was maintained at high  level in these APXs mutants, indicating the clade IV TGAs may be induced by the  ROS. Furthermore, TGA10 was required for the complete activation of the  expression of several flg22-responsive genes in plants treated with this PAMP.  These have provided a new insight into the relationship between the TGA  transcription factors and ROS-mediated signaling in PAMPs responses.', '2016 Nov', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.06.019', 'Shigeoka']
