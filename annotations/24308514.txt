['24308514', 'BACKGROUND: Plant nuclei superficially resemble animal and fungal nuclei, but the  machinery and processes that underlie nuclear organization in these eukaryotic  lineages appear to be evolutionarily distinct. Among the candidates for nuclear  architectural elements in plants are coiled-coil proteins in the NMCP (Nuclear  Matrix Constituent Protein) family. Using genetic and cytological approaches, we  dissect the function of the four NMCP family proteins in Arabidopsis encoded by  the CRWN genes, which were originally named LINC (LITTLE NUCLEI). RESULTS: CRWN  proteins are essential for viability as evidenced by the inability to recover  mutants that have disruptions in all four CRWN genes. Mutants deficient in  different combinations of the four CRWN paralogs exhibit altered nuclear  organization, including reduced nuclear size, aberrant nuclear shape and abnormal  spatial organization of constitutive heterochromatin. Our results demonstrate  functional diversification among CRWN paralogs; CRWN1 plays the predominant role  in control of nuclear size and shape followed by CRWN4. Proper chromocenter  organization is most sensitive to the deficiency of CRWN4. The reduction in  nuclear volume in crwn mutants in the absence of a commensurate reduction in  endoreduplication levels leads to an increase in average nuclear DNA density.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that CRWN proteins are important architectural  components of plant nuclei that play diverse roles in both heterochromatin  organization and the control of nuclear morphology.', '2013 Dec 5', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-13-200', 'Richards']
