['18787168', "microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in numerous developmental and metabolic  processes in plants and animals. The steady-state levels of miRNAs need to be  properly controlled to ensure normal development. Whereas the framework of miRNA  biogenesis is established, factors involved in miRNA degradation remain unknown.  Here, we show that a family of exoribonucleases encoded by the SMALL RNA  DEGRADING NUCLEASE (SDN) genes degrades mature miRNAs in Arabidopsis. SDN1 acts  specifically on single-stranded miRNAs in vitro and is sensitive to the  2'-O-methyl modification on the 3' terminal ribose of miRNAs. Simultaneous  knockdown of three SDN genes in vivo results in elevated miRNA levels and  pleiotropic developmental defects. Therefore, we have uncovered the enzymes that  degrade miRNAs and demonstrated that miRNA turnover is crucial for plant  development.", '2008 Sep 12', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1163728', 'Chen']
