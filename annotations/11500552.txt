['11500552', 'Plants possess both anabolic and catabolic pathways for the essential amino acid  lysine (Lys). However, although the biosynthetic pathway was clearly shown to  regulate Lys accumulation in plants, the functional significance of Lys  catabolism has not been experimentally elucidated. To address this issue, we have  isolated an Arabidopsis knockout mutant with a T-DNA inserted into exon 13 of the  gene encoding Lys ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase. This  bifunctional enzyme controls the first two steps of Lys catabolism. The phenotype  of the LKR/SDH knockout was indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal  growth conditions, suggesting that Lys catabolism is not an essential pathway  under standard growth conditions. However, mature seeds of the knockout mutant  over-accumulated Lys compared with wild-type plants. This report provides the  first direct evidence for the functional significance of Lys catabolism in  regulating Lys accumulation in seeds. Such a knockout mutant may also provide new  perspectives to improve the level of the essential amino acid Lys in plant seeds.', '2001 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.126.4.1539', 'Galili']
