['34615886', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that regulate cell division and  stress response. Here we use a systems biology approach to integrate multi-omic  datasets and unravel the molecular signaling events of BR response in  Arabidopsis. We profile the levels of 26,669 transcripts, 9,533 protein groups,  and 26,617 phosphorylation sites from Arabidopsis seedlings treated with  brassinolide (BL) for six different lengths of time. We then construct a network  inference pipeline called Spatiotemporal Clustering and Inference of Omics  Networks (SC-ION) to integrate these data. We use our network predictions to  identify putative phosphorylation sites on BES1 and experimentally validate their  importance. Additionally, we identify BRONTOSAURUS (BRON) as a transcription  factor that regulates cell division, and we show that BRON expression is  modulated by BR-responsive kinases and transcription factors. This work  demonstrates the power of integrative network analysis applied to multi-omic data  and provides fundamental insights into the molecular signaling events occurring  during BR response.', '2021 Oct 6', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-021-26165-3', 'ORCID:']
