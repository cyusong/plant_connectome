Flax has a long and fascinating history. This plant was domesticated around 8,000 BCE<sup>1</sup> in the Fertile Crescent area<sup>2</sup>, first for its seeds and then for its fibres<sup>1,3</sup>. Although its uses existed long before domestication, residues of flax yarn dated 30,000 years ago have been found in the Caucasus area<sup>4</sup>. However, Ancient Egypt laid the foundations for the cultivation of flax as a textile fibre crop<sup>5</sup>. Today flax fibres are used in high-value textiles and in natural actuators<sup>6</sup> or reinforcements in composite materials<sup>7</sup>. Flax is therefore a bridge between ages and civilizations. For several decades, the development of non- or micro-destructive analysis techniques has led to numerous works on the conservation of ancient textiles. Non-destructive methods, such as optical microscopy<sup>8</sup> or vibrational techniques<sup>9,10</sup>, have been largely used to investigate archaeological textiles, principally to evaluate their degradation mechanisms and state of conservation. Vibrational spectroscopy studies can now benefit from synchrotron radiation<sup>11</sup> and X-ray diffraction measurement in the archaeometric study of historical textiles<sup>12,13</sup>. Conservation of mechanical performance and the ultrastructural differences between ancient and modern flax varieties have not been examined thus far. Here we examine the morphological, ultrastructural and mechanical characteristics of a yarn from an Egyptian mortuary linen dating from the early Middle Kingdom (Eleventh Dynasty, ca. 2033-1963 BCE) and compare them with a modern flax yarn to assess the quality and durability of ancient flax fibres and relate these to their processing methods. Advanced microscopy techniques, such as nano-tomography, multiphoton excitation microscopy and atomic force microscopy were used. Our findings reveal the cultural know-how of this ancient civilization in producing high-fineness fibres, as well as the exceptional durability of flax, which is sometimes questioned, demonstrating their potential as reinforcements in high-technology composites.
