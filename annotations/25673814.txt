Brassinosteroid activity controls plant growth and development, often in a seemingly opposing or complex manner. Differential impact of the hormone and its signalling components, acting both as promoters and inhibitors of organ growth, is exemplified by meristem differentiation and cell expansion in above- and below-ground organs. Complex brassinosteroid-based control of stomata count and lateral root development has also been demonstrated. Here, mechanisms underlying these phenotypic outputs are examined. Among these, studies uncovering core brassinosteroid signalling components, which integrate with distinct peptide, hormone, and environmental pathways, are reviewed. Finally, the differential spatiotemporal context of brassinosteroid activity within the organ, as an important determinant of controlled growth, is discussed.
