['15561708', 'The molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana specifically  regulates the activity of the molybdenum enzymes aldehyde oxidase and xanthine  dehydrogenase by converting their molybdenum cofactor from the desulfo-form into  the sulfo-form. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with an NH2-terminal domain sharing  significant similarities to NifS proteins that catalyze the decomposition of  l-cysteine to l-alanine and elemental sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster synthesis.  Although different in its physiological function, the mechanism of ABA3 for  sulfur mobilization was found to be similar to NifS proteins. The protein binds a  pyridoxal phosphate cofactor and a substrate-derived persulfide intermediate, and  site-directed mutagenesis of strictly conserved binding sites for the cofactor  and the persulfide demonstrated that they are essential for molybdenum cofactor  sulfurase activity. In vitro, the NifS-like domain of ABA3 activates aldehyde  oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase in the absence of the C-terminal domain, but  in vivo, the C-terminal domain is required for proper activation of both target  enzymes. In addition to its cysteine desulfurase activity, ABA3-NifS also  exhibits selenocysteine lyase activity. Although l-selenocysteine is unlikely to  be a natural substrate for ABA3, it is decomposed more efficiently than  l-cysteine. Besides mitochondrial AtNFS1 and plastidial AtNFS2, which are both  proposed to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation, ABA3 is proposed to be  a third and cytosolic NifS-like cysteine desulfurase in A. thaliana. However, the  sulfur transferase activity of ABA3 is used for post-translational activation of  molybdenum enzymes rather than for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.', '2005 Feb 11', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M411195200', 'Bittner']
