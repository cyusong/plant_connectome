Rice (Oryza sativa) is a typical silicon (Si) accumulator and requires a large amount of Si for high-yield production. Recently, a gene (Low silicon rice1 [Lsi1]) encoding a Si transporter was identified in rice roots. Here, we characterized Lsi1 in terms of spatial distribution and temporal variation using both physiological and molecular approaches. Results from a multicompartment transport box experiment showed that the major site for Si uptake was located at the basal zone (>10 mm from the root tip) of the roots rather than at the root tips (<10 mm from the root tip). Consistent with the Si uptake pattern, Lsi1 expression and distribution of the Lsi1 protein were found only in the basal zone of roots. In the basal zones of the seminal, crown, and lateral roots, the Lsi1 protein showed a polar localization at the distal side of both the exodermis and endodermis, where the Casparian bands are formed. This indicates that Lsi1 is required for the transport of Si through the cells of the exodermis and endodermis. Expression of Lsi1 displayed a distinct diurnal pattern. Furthermore, expression was transiently enhanced around the heading stage, which coincides with a high Si requirement during this growth stage. Expression was down-regulated by dehydration stress and abscisic acid, suggesting that expression of Lsi1 may be regulated by abscisic acid.
