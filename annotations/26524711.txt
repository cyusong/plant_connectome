Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) are the two most abundantly acquired mineral elements by plants, and their acquisition pathways interact in complex ways. Here, we review pivotal interactions with respect to root acquisition, storage, translocation and metabolism, between the K<sup>+</sup> ion and the two major N sources, ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ). The intersections between N and K physiology are explored at a number of organizational levels, from molecular-genetic processes, to compartmentation, to whole plant physiology, and discussed in the context of both N-K cooperation and antagonism. Nutritional regulation and optimization of plant growth, yield, metabolism and water-use efficiency are also discussed.
