['21550130', 'Plant natriuretic peptides (PNPs) belong to a novel class of peptidic signaling  molecules that share some structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of  expansins and affect physiological processes such as water and ion homeostasis at  nano-molar concentrations. Here we show that a recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana  PNP (AtPNP-A) rapidly increased the rate of dark respiration in treated leaves  after 5 min. In addition, we observed increases in lower leaves, and with a lag  time of 10 min, the effect spread to the upper leaves and subsequently (after 15  min) to the opposite leaves. This response signature is indicative of phloem  mobility of the signal, a hypothesis that was further strengthened by the fact  that cold girdling, which affects phloem but not xylem or apoplastic processes,  delayed the long distance AtPNP-A effect. We conclude that locally applied  AtPNP-A can induce a phloem-mobile signal that rapidly modifies plant homeostasis  in distal parts.', '2011 Sep 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2011.03.011', 'Gehring']
