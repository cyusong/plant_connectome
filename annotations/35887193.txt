'<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas) is a bacterium that causes Huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening, in citrus plants. '<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) is a close relative of CLas and in the US it infects solanaceous crops, causing zebra chip disease in potato. Previously, we have identified the Lso hypothetical protein effector 1 (Lso-HPE1). This protein uses a signal peptide for secretion; disrupts programmed cell death; and interacts with tomato RAD23c, d, and e proteins, but not with RAD23a. In this study, we evaluated whether CLIBASIA_00460, the CLas homolog of Lso-HPE1 interacted with citrus RAD23 proteins and disrupted their programmed cell death. Based on the yeast two-hybrid assay results, CLIBASIA_00460 interacted with citrus RAD23c and RAD23d, but not with citrus RAD23b. These results were confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, which showed that these interactions occurred in cell puncta, but not in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Additionally, CLIBASIA_00460 was able to disrupt the Prf<sup>D1416V</sup>-induced hypersensitive response. Therefore, based on the similar interactions between Lso-HPE1 and CLIBASIA_00460 with the host RAD23 proteins and their ability to inhibit cell death in plants, we propose that these effectors may have similar functions during plant infection.
