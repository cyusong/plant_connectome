Mesophyll conductance (gm) has been shown to impose significant limitations to net CO2 assimilation (A) in various species during water stress. Net CO2 assimilation is also limited by stomatal conductance to water (gsw), both having been shown to co-vary with leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf). Lately, several studies have suggested a close functional link between Kleaf, gsw, and gm. However, such relationships could only be circumstantial since a recent study has shown that the response of gm to drought could merely be an artefactual consequence of a reduced intercellular CO2 mole fraction (Ci). Experiments were conducted on 8-week-old hybrid poplar cuttings to determine the relationship between Kleaf, gsw, and g m in clones of contrasting drought tolerance. It was hypothesized that changes in gsw and Kleaf in response to drought would not impact on gm over most of its range. The results show that Kleaf decreased in concert with g sw as drought proceeded, whereas gm measured at a normalized Ci remained relatively constant up to a g sw threshold of ~0.15 mol m(-2) s(-1). This delayed gm response prevented a substantial decline in A at the early stage of the drought, thereby enhancing water use efficiency. Reducing the stomatal limitation of droughted plants by diminishing the ambient CO2 concentration of the air did not modify gm or Kleaf. The relationship between gas exchange and leaf hydraulics was similar in both drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive clones despite their contrasting vulnerability to stem cavitation and stomatal response to soil drying. The results support the hypothesis of a partial hydraulic isolation of the mesophyll from the main transpiration pathway.
