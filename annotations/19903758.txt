['19903758', 'RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a conserved mechanism for epigenetic  silencing of transposons and other repetitive elements. We report that the rdm4  (RNA-directed DNA Methylation4) mutation not only impairs RdDM, but also causes  pleiotropic developmental defects in Arabidopsis. Both RNA polymerase II (Pol  II)- and Pol V-dependent transcripts are affected in the rdm4 mutant. RDM4  encodes a novel protein that is conserved from yeast to humans and interacts with  Pol II and Pol V in plants. Our results suggest that RDM4 functions in epigenetic  regulation and plant development by serving as a transcriptional regulator for  RNA Pol V and Pol II, respectively.', '2009 Dec 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1851809', 'Zhu']
