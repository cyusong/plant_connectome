Actin filaments are thought to play an important role in intracellular trafficking in various eukaryotic cells. However, their involvement in intracellular trafficking in plant cells has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we investigated the roles actin filaments play in intracellular trafficking in plant cells using latrunculin B (Lat B), an inhibitor of actin filament assembly, or actin mutants that disrupt actin filaments when overexpressed. Lat B and actin2 mutant overexpression inhibited the trafficking of two vacuolar reporter proteins, sporamin:green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Arabidopsis thaliana aleurain-like protein:GFP, to the central vacuole; instead, a punctate staining pattern was observed. Colocalization experiments with various marker proteins indicated that these punctate stains corresponded to the Golgi complex. The A. thaliana vacuolar sorting receptor VSR-At, which mainly localizes to the prevacuolar compartment, also accumulated at the Golgi complex in the presence of Lat B. However, Lat B had no effect on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking of sialyltransferase or retrograde Golgi to ER trafficking. Lat B also failed to influence the Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking of H+-ATPase:GFP or the secretion of invertase:GFP. Based on these observations, we propose that actin filaments play a critical role in the trafficking of proteins from the Golgi complex to the central vacuole.
