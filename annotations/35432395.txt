In this study, the roles of glutathione (GSH), homoglutathione (hGSH), and their ratio in symbiotic nodule development and functioning, as well as in defense responses accompanying ineffective nodulation in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) were investigated. The expression of genes involved in (h)GSH biosynthesis, thiol content, and localization of the reduced form of GSH were analyzed in nodules of wild-type pea plants and mutants <i>sym33-3</i> (weak allele, "locked" infection threads, occasional bacterial release, and defense reactions) and <i>sym33-2</i> (strong allele, "locked" infection threads, defense reactions), and <i>sym40-1</i> (abnormal bacteroids, oxidative stress, early senescence, and defense reactions). The effects of (h)GSH depletion and GSH treatment on nodule number and development were also examined. The GSH:hGSH ratio was found to be higher in nodules than in uninoculated roots in all genotypes analyzed, with the highest value being detected in wild-type nodules. Moreover, it was demonstrated, that a <i>hGSHS</i>-to-<i>GSHS</i> switch in gene expression in nodule tissue occurs only after bacterial release and leads to an increase in the GSH:hGSH ratio. Ineffective nodules showed variable GSH:hGSH ratios that correlated with the stage of nodule development. Changes in the levels of both thiols led to the activation of defense responses in nodules. The application of a (h)GSH biosynthesis inhibitor disrupted the nitrogen fixation zone in wild-type nodules, affected symbiosome formation in <i>sym40-1</i> mutant nodules, and meristem functioning and infection thread growth in <i>sym33-3</i> mutant nodules. An increase in the levels of both thiols following GSH treatment promoted both infection and extension of defense responses in <i>sym33-3</i> nodules, whereas a similar increase in <i>sym40-1</i> nodules led to the formation of infected cells resembling wild-type nitrogen-fixing cells and the disappearance of an early senescence zone in the base of the nodule. Meanwhile, an increase in hGSH levels in <i>sym40-1</i> nodules resulting from GSH treatment manifested as a restriction of infection similar to that seen in untreated <i>sym33-3</i> nodules. These findings indicated that a certain level of thiols is required for proper symbiotic nitrogen fixation and that changes in thiol content or the GSH:hGSH ratio are associated with different abnormalities and defense responses.
