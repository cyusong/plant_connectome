RNA helicases (RHs) are a family of ubiquitous enzymes that alter RNA structures and remodel ribonucleoprotein complexes typically using energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. RHs are involved in various aspects of RNA processing and metabolism, exemplified by transcriptional regulation, pre-mRNA splicing, miRNA biogenesis, liquid-liquid phase separation, and rRNA biogenesis, among other molecular processes. Through these mechanisms, RHs contribute to vegetative and reproductive growth, as well as abiotic and biotic stress responses throughout the life cycle in plants. In this review, we systematically characterize RH-featured domains and signature motifs in Arabidopsis. We also summarize the functions and mechanisms of RHs in various biological processes in plants with a focus on DEAD-box and DEAH-box RNA helicases, aiming to present the latest understanding of RHs in plant biology.
