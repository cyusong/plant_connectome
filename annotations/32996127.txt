2,4-Dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA) and DIMBOA-glucoside (DIMBOA-Glc) are anti-insect benzoxazinoids in maize, yet very little information is known about how they are regulated. Reverse genetics, kinase activity analysis, phytohormone and DIMBOA/DIMBOA-Glc quantification, bioassays and transcriptome analysis were employed to study the function of ZmMPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, in maize response to herbivory. ZmMPK6 was rapidly activated by wounding and simulated herbivory. Silencing ZmMPK6 in maize A188 compromised simulated herbivory-induced ethylene levels but not those of jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, and the ZmMPK6-silenced plants exhibited elevated DIMBOA/DIMBOA-Glc and insect resistance. An ethylene complementation experiment revealed that ZmMPK6 repressed the accumulation of DIMBOA/DIMBOA-Glc in an ethylene-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ZmMPK6 might meditate the transcription of BX1 by controlling a MYB transcription factor that is likely to be located in the ethylene signalling pathway and, furthermore, ZmMPK6 and ethylene signalling also specifically and commonly regulate the transcription of other benzoxazinoid biosynthetic genes. We also show that different maize lines have very different responses to simulated herbivory in terms of ZmMPK6 activation, ethylene emission and benzoxazinoid levels. These results uncover that ZmMPK6 and ethylene pathway are novel repressors of DIMBOA/DIMBOA-Glc and provide new insight into the regulatory mechanisms underlying these two pathways.
