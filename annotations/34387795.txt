FLO6 is involved in starch synthesis by interacting with SSIVb and GBSS in rice. Starch synthesized and stored in plastids including chloroplasts and amyloplasts plays a vital role in plant growth and provides the major energy for human diet. However, the molecular mechanisms by which regulate starch synthesis remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a rice floury endosperm mutant M39, which exhibited defective starch granule formation in pericarp and endosperm, accompanied by the decreased starch content and amylose content. The abnormal starch accumulation in M39 pollen grains caused a significant decrease in plant fertility. Chloroplasts in M39 leaves contained no or only one large starch granule. Positional cloning combined with complementary experiment demonstrated that the mutant phenotypes were restored by the FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 (FLO6). FLO6 was generally expressed in various tissues, including leaf, anther and developing endosperm. FLO6 is a chloroplast and amyloplast-localized protein that is able to bind to starch by its carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48) domain. Interestingly, we found that FLO6 interacted with starch synthase IVb (SSIVb) and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI and GBSSII). Together, our results suggested that FLO6 plays a critical role in starch synthesis through cooperating with several starch synthesis enzymes throughout plant growth and development.
