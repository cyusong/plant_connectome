Plant innate immunity toward cell-wall penetrating filamentous pathogens relies on the conserved SYP12 clade of secretory syntaxins. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the two closely related SYP12 clade members, PEN1 and SYP122, play an overlapping role in this general immunity, which can be complemented by two SYP12 clade members from <i>Marchantia</i> (MpSYP12A and MpSYP12B). However, in addition to the conserved SYP12 clade function, PEN1 alone mediates pre-invasive immunity toward powdery mildew fungi, which likely reflects a specialization of its functionality. Here, we show that the PEN1-specific specialization in immunity correlates with a continuous BFA-sensitive recycling and the ability to accumulate strongly at the growing cell plate. This contrasts with the behavior of SYP122, MpSYP12A, and MpSYP12B, all being more stable at the plasma membrane. We suggest that the highly mobile SYP12 specialization observed for PEN1 is required for a fast pre-invasive immune response to resist attack from powdery mildew fungi.
