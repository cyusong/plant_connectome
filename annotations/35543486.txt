To enhance plant fitness under natural conditions, the circadian clock is synchronized and entrained by light via photoreceptors. In turn, the circadian clock exquisitely regulates the abundance and activity of photoreceptors via largely uncharacterized mechanisms. Here we show that the clock regulator TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) controls the activity of the far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) at multiple levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. Null mutants of TIC displayed dramatically increased sensitivity to light irradiation with respect to hypocotyl growth, especially to far-red light. RNA-sequencing demonstrated that TIC and phyA play largely opposing roles in controlling light-regulated gene expression at dawn. Additionally, TIC physically interacts with the transcriptional repressor TOPLESS (TPL), which was associated with the significantly increased PHYA transcript levels in the tic-2 and tpl-1 mutants. Moreover, TIC interacts with phyA in the nucleus, thereby affecting phyA protein turnover and the formation of phyA nuclear speckles following light irradiation. Genetically, phyA was found to act downstream of TIC in regulating far red light-inhibited growth. Taken together, these findings indicate that TIC acts as a major negative regulator of phyA by integrating transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms at multiple levels.
