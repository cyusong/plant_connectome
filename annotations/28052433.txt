The multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporter family comprises 70 members in the Medicago truncatula genome, and they play seemingly important, yet mostly uncharacterized, physiological functions. Here, we employed bioinformatics and molecular genetics to identify and characterize MATE transporters involved in citric acid export, Al<sup>3+</sup> tolerance and Fe translocation. MtMATE69 is a citric acid transporter induced by Fe-deficiency. Overexpression of MtMATE69 in hairy roots altered Fe homeostasis and hormone levels under Fe-deficient or Fe-oversupplied conditions. MtMATE66 is a plasma membrane citric acid transporter primarily expressed in root epidermal cells. The mtmate66 mutant had less root growth than the wild type under Al<sup>3+</sup> stress, and seedlings were chlorotic under Fe-deficient conditions. Overexpression of MtMATE66 rendered hairy roots more tolerant to Al<sup>3+</sup> toxicity. MtMATE55 is involved in seedling development and iron homeostasis, as well as hormone signaling. The mtmate55 mutant had delayed development and chlorotic leaves in mature plants. Both knock-out and overexpression mutants of MtMATE55 showed altered Fe accumulation and abnormal hormone levels compared with the wild type. We demonstrate that the zinc-finger transcription factor MtSTOP is essentially required for MtMATE66 expression and plant resistance to H<sup>+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup> toxicity. The proper expression of two previously characterized MATE flavonoid transporters MtMATE1 and MtMATE2 also depends on several transcription factors. This study reveals not only functional diversity of MATE transporters and regulatory mechanisms in legumes against H<sup>+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup> stresses, but also casts light on their role in metal nutrition and hormone signaling under various stresses.
