The angiosperm Rafflesia exhibits a unique biology, including a growth strategy that involves endophytic parasitism of a specific host, with only the gigantic flower externally visible. The Rafflesia possesses many unique evolutionary, developmental and morphological features that are rooted in yet-to-be-explained physiological processes. Although studies on the molecular biology of Rafflesia are limited by sampling difficulties due to its rarity in the wild and the short life span of its flower, current advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have allowed for the genome- and transcriptome-level dissection of the molecular mechanisms behind the unique characteristics of this parasitic plant. In this review, we summarize major findings on the cryptic biology of Rafflesia and provide insights into future research directions. The wealth of data obtained can improve our understanding of Rafflesia species and contribute toward the conservation strategy of this endangered plant.
