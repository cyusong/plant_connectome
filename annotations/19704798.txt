When plants are infested by herbivores, they emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that attract carnivorous natural enemies of herbivores. Furthermore, there are increasing evidences that defenses of intact plants against herbivores are primed when exposed to HIPVs. We previously reported that lima bean leaf volatiles induced by the herbivorous mites Tetranychus urticae primed two T. urtiae-induced indirect defenses in neighboring conspecific plants: HIPV emission and extrafloral nectar (EFN) secretion. An intriguing unanswered question is whether the durations of these two defenses are the same. Here, we show that the durations of the two defenses were the same for up to two days after the initiation of T. urticae damage. The two induced primed defense would act as a battery of defense in exposed plants.

HIPV: !attracts! carnivorous natural enemies
HIPV: !primes! HIPV emission & EFN secretion
T. urticae damage: !induces! primed defense
Primed defense: !lasts for! up to two days
