Plant papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) are a large class of proteolytic enzymes and play important roles in root nodule symbiosis (RNS), while the whole-genome studies of PLCP family genes in legume are quite limited, and the roles of Glycine max PLCPs (GmPLCPs) in nodulation, nodule development and senescence are not fully understood. In the present study, we identified 97 GmPLCPs and performed a genome-wide survey to explore the expansion of soybean PLCP family genes and their relationships to RNS. Nineteen paralogous pairs of genomic segments, consisting of 77 GmPLCPs, formed by whole-genome duplication (WGD) events were identified, showing a high degree of complexity in duplication. Phylogenetic analysis among different species showed that the lineage differentiation of GmPLCPs occurred after family expansion, and large tandem repeat segment were specifically in soybean. The expression patterns of GmPLCPs in symbiosis-related tissues and nodules identified RNS-related GmPLCPs and provided insights into their putative symbiotic functions in soybean. The symbiotic function analyses showed that a RNS-related GmPLCP gene (Glyma.04G190700) really participate in nodulation and nodule development. Our findings improved our understanding of the functional diversity of legume PLCP family genes, and provided insights into the putative roles of the legume PLCPs in nodulation, nodule development and senescence.
