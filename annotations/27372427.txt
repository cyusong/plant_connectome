['27372427', 'COP1-interacting protein 1 (CIP1, At5g41790) was the first reported interacting  protein for CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) of Arabidopsis; however its  physiological function has remained unknown for two decades. Here we show that  CIP1 is a positive regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) response. CIP1 is mainly  expressed in the photosynthetic cells and the vascular tissue, and its promoter  activity can be induced by osmotic stress and ABA. The CIP1 protein is localized  to the plasma membrane. A T-DNA insertion mutant cip1-1 was then characterized.  The mutant is sensitive to osmotic stress and has ABA insensitive phenotypes. RNA  sequencing showed that cip1-1 has lower levels of gene expression in abiotic  stress response compared with the wild-type. Meanwhile, transcript levels of ABA  biosynthesis genes are higher in cip1-1 than in the wild-type. These results  suggested that CIP1 is positively involved in ABA response.', '2016 Sep 2', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.06.147', 'Gong']
