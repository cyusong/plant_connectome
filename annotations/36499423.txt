<i>Ipomoea batatas</i> is a vital root crop and a source of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives (CQAs) with potential health-promoting benefits. As a naturally transgenic plant, <i>I. batatas</i> contains cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA) sequence homologs of the <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</i> open reading frame (ORF)14, ORF17n, rooting locus (Rol)B/RolC, ORF13, and ORF18/ORF17n of unknown function. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of abiotic stresses (temperature, ultraviolet, and light) and chemical elicitors (methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and sodium nitroprusside) on the biosynthesis of CQAs and cT-DNA gene expression in <i>I. batatas</i> cell culture as a model system. Among all the applied treatments, ultraviolet irradiation, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid caused the maximal accumulation of secondary compounds. We also discovered that <i>I. batatas</i> cT-DNA genes were not expressed in cell culture, and the studied conditions weakly affected their transcriptional levels. However, the <i>Ib-rolB/C</i> gene expressed under the strong 35S CaMV promoter increased the CQAs content by 1.5-1.9-fold. Overall, our results show that cT-DNA-encoded transgenes are not involved in stress- and chemical elicitor-induced CQAs accumulation in cell cultures of <i>I. batatas</i>. Nevertheless, overaccumulation of RolB/RolC transcripts potentiates the secondary metabolism of sweet potatoes through a currently unknown mechanism. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms linked with CQAs biosynthesis in cell culture of naturally transgenic food crops, i.e., sweet potato.
