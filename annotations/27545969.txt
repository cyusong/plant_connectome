['27545969', 'Incidence of natural light stress renders it important to enhance our  understanding of the mechanisms by which plants protect themselves from harmful  effects of UV-B irradiation, as this is critical for fitness of land plant  species. Here we describe natural variation of a class of  phenylacylated-flavonols (saiginols), which accumulate to high levels in floral  tissues of Arabidopsis. They were identified in a subset of accessions,  especially those deriving from latitudes between 16 degrees  and 43 degrees  North. Investigation  of introgression line populations using metabolic and transcript profiling,  combined with genomic sequence analysis, allowed the identification of  flavonol-phenylacyltransferase 2 (FPT2) that is responsible for the production of  saiginols and conferring greater UV light tolerance in planta. Furthermore,  analysis of polymorphism within the FPT duplicated region provides an  evolutionary framework of the natural history of this locus in the Brassicaceae.', '2016 Aug 22', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms12399', 'Fernie']
