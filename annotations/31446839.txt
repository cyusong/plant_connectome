Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) are ubiquitously present in various types of cells of living organisms. They are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and cell differentiation, and are required for abiotic stress tolerances in plants. However, it is still not understood whether polyamines are involved in the plant growth inhibition caused by DNA-damaging agents. In this study, we examined the effects of polyamines on the inhibition of plant root growth and gene expression in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> treated with mitomycin C (MMC), a genotoxic agent that induces DNA interstrand crosslinks. We found that polyamines alleviated the inhibitory effect caused by MMC on root growth. In addition, we also found that polyamines alleviated the increased expression of <i>AtBRCA1</i> and <i>AtRAD51</i> genes induced by MMC treatment. Our study provides the first evidence that polyamines contribute to tolerance against plant-growth inhibition caused by a DNA-damaging chemical.

Polyamines: !alleviate! MMC-induced plant root growth inhibition
Polyamines: !alleviate! increased expression of AtBRCA1 and AtRAD51 genes
MMC: !induces! DNA interstrand crosslinks
MMC: !inhibits! plant root growth
AtBRCA1 and AtRAD51 genes: !increase expression! in response to MMC
