Expression patterns of hundreds of transcripts in apical buds were monitored during bud flushing in sessile oak (Quercus petraea), in order to identify genes differentially expressed between the quiescent and active stage of bud development. Different transcriptomic techniques combining the construction of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries and the monitoring of gene expression using macroarray and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to dissect bud burst, with a special emphasis on the onset of the process. We generated 801 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from six developmental stages of bud burst. Macroarray experiment revealed a total of 233 unique transcripts exhibiting differential expression during the process, and a putative function was assigned to 65% of them. Cell rescue/defense-, metabolism-, protein synthesis-, cell cycle- and transcription-related transcripts were among the most regulated genes. Macroarray and real-time RT-PCR showed that several genes exhibited contrasted expressions between quiescent and swelling buds, such as a putative homologue of the transcription factor DAG2 (Dof Affecting Germination 2), previously reported to be involved in the control of seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana. These differentially expressed genes constitute relevant candidates for signaling pathway of bud burst in trees.
