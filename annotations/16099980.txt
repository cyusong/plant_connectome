['16099980', 'Flowering of Arabidopsis is regulated by several environmental and endogenous  signals. An important integrator of these inputs is the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)  gene, which encodes a small, possibly mobile protein. A primary response to  floral induction is the activation of FT RNA expression in leaves. Because  flowers form at a distant site, the shoot apex, these data suggest that FT  primarily controls the timing of flowering. Integration of temporal and spatial  information is mediated in part by the bZIP transcription factor FD, which is  already expressed at the shoot apex before floral induction. A complex of FT and  FD proteins in turn can activate floral identity genes such as APETALA1 (AP1).', '2005 Aug 12', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1114358', 'Weigel']
