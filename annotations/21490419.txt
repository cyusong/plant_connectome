The presence of externally supplied DNA in the growth medium enhances growth of lateral roots and root hairs in Arabidopsis. This phenomenon cannot be attributed to phosphorus (P) limitation because it is independent of the plants' P status. Rather, we hypothesized that DNA triggers a currently unknown signaling pathway. Analyzing the transcriptional changes of genes induced by externally supplied DNA, we show that 7 of the 17 studied CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLEs) genes were differentially regulated. CLEs are known peptide hormones that affect plant development including root morphology. While previous research had shown that over-expression of these CLE genes alters root morphology, changes in gene expression had not been linked to environmental triggers. The differential expression of these CLEs genes and accompanied changes of the root phenotype are indicative of a DNA-elicited signal pathway which affects root development. We conclude that DNA acts as a signaling compound which induces root proliferation in a way that would enhance the plant's ability to acquire nutrients from soil organic matter. Our study further confirms the importance of CLEs for controlling root morphology in response to specific environmental conditions, and draws attention to a novel role of DNA as a signaling compound.
