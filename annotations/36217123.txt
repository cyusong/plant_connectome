Leaf size affects crop canopy morphology and photosynthetic efficiency, which can influence forage yield and quality. It is of great significance to mine the key genes controlling leaf development for breeding new alfalfa varieties. In this study, we mapped leaf length (LL), leaf width (LW), and leaf area (LA) in an F1 mapping population derived from a cultivar named ZhongmuNo.1 with larger leaf area and a landrace named Cangzhou with smaller leaf area. This study showed that the larger LW was more conducive to increasing LA. A total of 24 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with leaf size were identified on both the paternal and maternal linkage maps. Among them, nine QTL explained about 11.50-22.45% phenotypic variation. RNA-seq analysis identified 2,443 leaf-specific genes and 3,770 differentially expressed genes. Combining QTL mapping, RNA-seq alalysis, and qRT-PCR, we identified seven candidate genes associated with leaf development in five major QTL regions. Our study will provide a theoretical basis for marker-assisted breeding and lay a foundation for further revealing molecular mechanism of leaf development in alfalfa.
