['11891265', 'gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes  the first step of glutathione (GSH) degradation in the gamma-glutamyl cycle in  mammals. A cDNA encoding an Arabidopsis homolog for gamma-GT was overexpressed in  tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. A high level of the membrane-bound gamma-GT  activity was localized outside the cell in transgenic plants. The overproduced  enzyme was characterized by a high affinity to GSH and was cleaved  post-translationally in two unequal subunits. Thus, Arabidopsis gamma-GT is  similar to the mammalian enzymes in enzymatic properties, post-translational  processing, and cellular localization, suggesting analogous biological functions  as a key enzyme in the catabolism of GSH.', '2002 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.010887', 'Kushnir']
