The type III secretion system (T3SS) of plant-pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> is essential for virulence. Genes encoding the T3SS are not constitutively expressed and must be induced upon infection. Plant-derived metabolites, including sugars such as fructose and sucrose, are inducers of T3SS-encoding genes, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying perception of these host signals by <i>P. syringae</i> are unknown. Here, we report that <i>sugar-induced expression of type III secretion A</i> (<i>setA</i>), predicted to encode a DeoR-type transcription factor, is required for maximal sugar-induced expression of T3SS-associated genes in <i>P. syringae</i> DC3000. From a Tn<i>5</i> transposon mutagenesis screen, we identified two independent mutants with insertions in <i>setA</i>. When both <i>setA</i>::Tn<i>5</i> mutants were cultured in minimal medium containing fructose, genes encoding the T3SS master regulator HrpL and effector AvrRpm1 were expressed at lower levels relative to that of a wild-type strain. Decreased <i>hrpL</i> and <i>avrRpm1</i> expression also occurred in a <i>setA</i>::Tn<i>5</i> mutant in response to glucose, sucrose, galactose, and mannitol, demonstrating that <i>setA</i> is genetically required for T3SS induction by many different sugars. Expression of upstream regulators <i>hrpR</i>/<i>S</i> and <i>rpoN</i> was not altered in <i>setA</i>::Tn<i>5</i>, indicating that SetA positively regulates <i>hrpL</i> expression independently of increased transcription of these genes. In addition to decreased response to defined sugar signals, a <i>setA</i>::Tn<i>5</i> mutant had decreased T3SS deployment during infection and was compromised in its ability to grow in planta and cause disease. These data suggest that SetA is necessary for <i>P. syringae</i> to effectively respond to T3SS-inducing sugar signals encountered during infection.
