Rice productivity has considerably improved due to the effective employment of heterosis, but the genetic basis of heterosis for grain shape and weight remains uncertain. For studying the genetic dissection of heterosis for grain shape/weight and their relationship with grain yield in rice, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed on 1,061 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which was developed by crossing <i>xian</i>/<i>indica</i> rice Quan9311B (Q9311B) and Wu-shan-si-miao (WSSM). Whereas, BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> (a backcross F<sub>1</sub>) was developed by crossing RILs with Quan9311A (Q9311A) combined with phenotyping in Hefei (HF) and Nanning (NN) environments. Overall, 114 (main-effect, mQTL) and 359 (epistatic QTL, eQTL) were identified in all populations (RIL, BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub>, and mid-parent heterosis, H<sub>MP</sub>s) for 1000-grain weight (TGW), grain yield per plant (GYP) and grain shape traits including grain length (GL), grain width (GW), and grain length to width ratio (GLWR). Differential QTL detection revealed that all additive loci in RILs population do not show heterotic effects, and few of them affect the performance of BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub>. However, 25 mQTL not only contributed to BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub>'s performance but also contributed to heterosis. A total of seven QTL regions was identified, which simultaneously affected multiple grain traits (grain yield, weight, shape) in the same environment, including five regions with opposite directions and two regions with same directions of favorable allele effects, indicating that partial genetic overlaps are existed between different grain traits. This study suggested different approaches for obtaining good grain quality with high yield by pyramiding or introgressing favorable alleles (FA) with the same direction of gene effect at the QTL regions affecting grain shape/weight and grain yield distributing on different chromosomes, or introgressing or pyramiding FA in the parents instead of fixing additive effects in hybrid as well as pyramiding the polymorphic overdominant/dominant loci between the parents and eliminating underdominant loci from the parents. These outcomes offer valuable information and strategy to develop hybrid rice with suitable grain type and weight.
