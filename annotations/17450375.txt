Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cells have been habituated to grow in lethal concentrations of dichlobenil (DCB), a specific inhibitor of cellulose biosynthesis. Bean callus cells were successively cultured in increasing DCB concentrations up to 2 microM. The 2-microM DCB habituated cells were impoverished in cellulose and xyloglucan, had an increased xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET; EC 2.4.1.207) activity, together with an increased growth rate and a decreased molecular size of xyloglucan. However, the application of lethal concentrations of two different cellulose-biosynthesis inhibitors (DCB and isoxaben) for a short period of time produced little effect on XET activity and xyloglucan molecular size. We propose that the weakening of plant cell wall provoked by decrease in cellulose content might promote the xyloglucan tethers and increase the ability of xyloglucan to bind to cellulose in order to give rigidity to the wall.
