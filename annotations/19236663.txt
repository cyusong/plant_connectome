Plant survival under heat stress requires the activation of proper defence mechanisms to avoid the impairment of metabolic functions. Heat stress leads to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. In plants, the ascorbate (ASC)-GSH cycle plays a pivotal role in controlling ROS levels and cellular redox homeostasis. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) is the enzyme of this cycle mainly involved in ROS detoxification. In this study, the ASC-GSH cycle enzymes were analysed in the cytosol, mitochondria and plastids of tobacco Bright Yellow-2 cultured cells. The cells were also subjected to two different heat shocks (HSs; 35 or 55 degrees C for 10 min) and the cell compartments were isolated in both conditions. The results reported here indicate that moderate HS (35 degrees C) does not affect cell viability, whereas cell exposure to 55 degrees C HS induces programmed cell death (PCD). In relation to ASC-GSH cycle, the three analysed compartments have specific enzymatic profiles that are diversely altered by the HS treatments. The cytosol contains the highest activity of all ASC-GSH cycle enzymes and the data reported here suggest that it acts as a redox buffer for the whole cells. In particular, the cytosolic APX seems to be the most versatile enzyme, being its activity enhanced after moderate HS and reduced during PCD induction, whereas the other APX isoenzymes are only affected in the cells undergoing PCD. The relevance of the changes in the different ASC-GSH cycle isoenzymes in allowing cell survival or promoting PCD is discussed.
