['13677469', 'We have identified and characterized novel types of ferredoxin and ferredoxin  reductase from Arabidopsis. Among a number of potential ferredoxin reductase  genes in the Arabidopsis genome, AtMFDR was identified to encode a homologue of  mitochondrial ferredoxin reductase, and AtMFDX1 and AtMFDX2 were predicted to  code for proteins similar to mitochondrial ferredoxin. First, we isolated cDNAs  for these proteins and expressed them in heterologous systems of insect cells and  Escherichia coli, respectively. The recombinant AtMFDX1 and AtMFDR proteins  exhibited spectral properties characteristic of ferredoxin and ferredoxin  reductase, respectively, and a pair of recombinant AtMFDX1 and AtMFDR proteins  was sufficient to transfer electrons from NAD(P)H to cytochrome c in vitro.  Subcellular fractionation analyses suggested membrane association of AtMFDR  protein, and protein-gel blot analyses and transient expression studies of green  fluorescence protein fusions indicated mitochondrial localization of AtMFDX1 and  AtMFDR. RNA-gel blot analyses revealed that the accumulation levels of AtMFDXs  and AtMFDR gene transcripts were specifically high in flowers, while protein-gel  blot analysis demonstrated substantial accumulation of AtMFDR protein in leaf,  stem, and flower. Possible physiological roles of these mitochondrial electron  transfer components are discussed in relation to redox dependent metabolic  pathways in plants.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1025015811141', 'Ohta']
