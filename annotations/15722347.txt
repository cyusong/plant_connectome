['15722347', 'The translocase of the inner membrane 17 (AtTIM17-2) protein from Arabidopsis has  been shown to link the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. This was  demonstrated by several approaches: (i) In vitro organelle import assays  indicated the imported AtTIM17-2 protein remained protease accessible in the  outer membrane when inserted into the inner membrane. (ii) N-terminal and  C-terminal tagging indicated that it was the C-terminal region that was located  in the outer membrane. (iii) Antibodies raised to the C-terminal 100 amino acids  recognize a 31-kDa protein from purified mitochondria, but cross-reactivity was  abolished when mitochondria were protease-treated to remove outer  membrane-exposed proteins. Antibodies to AtTIM17-2 inhibited import of proteins  via the general import pathway into outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria, but did  not inhibit protein import via the carrier import pathway. Together these results  indicate that the C-terminal region of AtTIM17-2 is exposed on the outer surface  of the outer membrane, and the C-terminal region is essential for protein import  into mitochondria.', '2005 Apr 22', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M413299200', 'Whelan']
