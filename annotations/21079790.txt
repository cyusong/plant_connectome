['21079790', 'The SUPPRESSOR OF rps4-RLD1 (SRFR1) gene was identified based on enhanced  AvrRps4-triggered resistance in the naturally susceptible Arabidopsis accession  RLD. No other phenotypic effects were recorded, and the extent of SRFR1  involvement in regulating effector-triggered immunity was unknown. Here we show  that mutations in SRFR1 in the accession Columbia-0 (Col-0) lead to severe  stunting and constitutive expression of the defense gene PR1. These phenotypes  were temperature-dependent. A cross between srfr1-1 (RLD background) and srfr1-4  (Col-0) showed that stunting was caused by a recessive locus in Col-0. Mapping  and targeted crosses identified the Col-0-specific resistance gene SNC1 as the  locus that causes stunting. SRFR1 was proposed to function as a transcriptional  repressor, and SNC1 is indeed overexpressed in srfr1-4. Interestingly,  co-regulated genes in the SNC1 cluster are also upregulated in the srfr1-4  snc1-11 double mutant, indicating that the overexpression of SNC1 is not a  secondary effect of constitutive defense activation. In addition, a Col-0 RPS4  mutant showed full susceptibility to bacteria expressing avrRps4 at 24 degrees C but not  at 22 degrees C, while RLD susceptibility was not temperature-dependent. The rps4-2  snc1-11 double mutant showed increased, but not full, susceptibility at 22 degrees C,  indicating that additional cross-talk between resistance pathways may exist.  Intriguingly, when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana, SRFR1, RPS4  and SNC1 are in a common protein complex in a cytoplasmic microsomal compartment.  Our results highlight SRFR1 as a convergence point in at least a subset of  TIR-NBS-LRR protein-mediated immunity in Arabidopsis. Based on the cross-talk  evident from our results, they also suggest that reports of constitutive  resistance phenotypes in Col-0 need to consider the possible involvement of SNC1.', '2010 Nov 4', 'PLoS Pathog', '10.1371/journal.ppat.1001172', 'Gassmann']
