Among various abiotic stresses, heat stress is one of the most damaging, threatening plant productivity and survival all over the world. Warmer temperatures due to climatic anomalies above optimum growing temperatures have detrimental impacts on crop yield potential as well as plant distribution patterns. Heat stress affects overall plant metabolism in terms of physiology, biochemistry, and gene expression. Membrane damage, protein degradation, enzyme inactivation, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species are some of the harmful effects of heat stress that cause injury to various cellular compartments. Although plants are equipped with various defense strategies to counteract these adversities, their defensive means are not sufficient to defend against the ever-rising temperatures. Hence, substantial yield losses have been observed in all crop species under heat stress. Here, we describe the involvement of various plant growth-regulators (PGRs) (hormones, polyamines, osmoprotectants, antioxidants, and other signaling molecules) in thermotolerance, through diverse cellular mechanisms that protect cells under heat stress. Several studies involving the exogenous application of PGRs to heat-stressed plants have demonstrated their role in imparting tolerance, suggesting the strong potential of these molecules in improving the performance of food crops grown under high temperature.
