The mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUc) was recently characterized in details in metazoans and consists of pore-forming units (MCUs) and regulatory factors that channel calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ) ion into the mitochondria. MCUs participate in many stress and developmentally related processes involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> . Although multiple homologues of MCUs and one regulatory subunit are usually present in plants, the first functional characterization and contribution to Ca<sup>2+</sup> related processes of these proteins have been reported recently. Here, we focused on two predicted Arabidopsis MCUs and studied their role in the germination and the growth of pollen tube, a tip-growing cell type highly dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Heterologous expression of MCU1 or MCU2 in yeast is sufficient to generate a mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. MCU1 and MCU2 fluorescent reporters are co-expressed in the vegetative cell mitochondria of the pollen grain but are undetectable in the embryo sac. We demonstrate that MCU1 and MCU2 can form a heterotypic complex. Phenotypic analyses revealed an impaired pollen tube germination and growth in vitro only for the mcu2 mutants suggesting a predominant role of MCU2. Our results show that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> controlled by MCUs is an additional player in Arabidopsis pollen tube germination and growth.
