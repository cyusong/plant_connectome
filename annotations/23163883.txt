['23163883', 'In land plants polar auxin transport is one of the substantial processes guiding  whole plant polarity and morphogenesis. Directional auxin fluxes are mediated by  PIN auxin efflux carriers, polarly localized at the plasma membrane. The  polarization of exocytosis in yeast and animals is assisted by the exocyst: an  octameric vesicle-tethering complex and an effector of Rab and Rho GTPases. Here  we show that rootward polar auxin transport is compromised in roots of  Arabidopsis thaliana loss-of-function mutants in the EXO70A1 exocyst subunit. The  recycling of PIN1 and PIN2 proteins from brefeldin-A compartments is delayed  after the brefeldin-A washout in exo70A1 and sec8 exocyst mutants. Relocalization  of PIN1 and PIN2 proteins after prolonged brefeldin-A treatment is largely  impaired in these mutants. At the same time, however, plasma membrane  localization of GFP:EXO70A1, and the other exocyst subunits studied (GFP:SEC8 and  YFP:SEC10), is resistant to brefeldin-A treatment. In root cells of the exo70A1  mutant, a portion of PIN2 is internalized and retained in specific, abnormally  enlarged, endomembrane compartments that are distinct from VHA-a1-labelled early  endosomes or the trans-Golgi network, but are RAB-A5d positive. We conclude that  the exocyst is involved in PIN1 and PIN2 recycling, and thus in polar auxin  transport regulation.', '2013 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12074', 'Zarsky']
