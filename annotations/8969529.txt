['8969529', 'Two Arabidopsis ecotypes are resistant to systemic infection by cauliflower  mosaic virus (CaMV), a plant para-retrovirus. Arabidopsis ecotype Enkheim-2  (En-2) is highly resistant to CaMV infection while Bla-14 is more weakly  resistant. CaMV resistance in En-2 can be largely attributed to the action of a  single semidominant gene called cauliflower mosaic virus resistance1 (CAR1),  located at a locus on chromosome 1. Resistance in Bla-14 is tightly linked to  CAR1 and may be due to a weak allele at the same locus or another gene in a gene  cluster. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay in conjunction with  replication- and movement-incompetent viral mutants was used to determine whether  virus replication or movement is affected in the resistant ecotypes. The pattern  of accumulation of the wild-type virus in the resistant ecotype, En-2, was  similar to that of a movement-incompetent CaMV mutant, suggesting that CAR1  interferes with or fails to support CaMV movement. CaMV-inoculated En-2 plants do  not show visible signs of a hypersensitive response. However, indicators of an  induced defense response do appear in CaMV-infected En-2 plants, such as the  activation of pathogenesis-related protein gene expression and the production of  camalexin, an Arabidopsis phytoalexin. Defense responses induced chemically or by  mutation in the susceptible ecotypes delayed and reduced the severity of a CaMV  infection. These findings suggest that CAR1 acts either in the susceptible  ecotype to support virus movement or in the resistant ecotype to signal a defense  response.', '1996 Dec', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/mpmi-9-0810', 'Howell']
