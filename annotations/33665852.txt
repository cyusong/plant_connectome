Light regulates anthocyanins synthesis in plants. Upon exposure to visible light, the inhibition of photosynthetic electron transfer significantly lowered the contents of anthocyanins and the expression levels of key genes involved in anthocyanins synthesis in plum fruit peel. Meanwhile, the expression levels of PsmMDH2 (encoding the malate dehydrogenase in mitochondria) and PschMDH (encoding the malate dehydrogenase in chloroplasts) decreased significantly. The contents of anthocyanins and the levels of the key genes involved in anthocyanin synthesis decreased significantly with the treatment of 1-MCP (an inhibitor of ethylene perception) but were enhanced by the exogenous application of ethylene. The ethylene treatment could also recover the anthocyanin synthesis capacity lowered by the photosynthetic electron transfer inhibition. Silencing PsmMDH2 and PschMDH significantly lowered the contents of anthocyanins in plum fruit. At low temperature, visible light irradiation induced anthocyanin accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves. However, the mmdh, chmdh, and etr1-1 mutants had significantly lower anthocyanins content and expressions of the key genes involved in anthocyanins synthesis compared to wild type. Overall, the present study demonstrates that both photosynthesis and respiration were involved in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis in visible light. The visible light regulates anthocyanin synthesis by controlling the malate metabolism via MDHs and the ethylene signaling pathway.
