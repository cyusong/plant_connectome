Sunlight enhanced peel color and significantly up-regulated the expression of PyMYB10 and PybHLH genes. MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcriptional complex forms in the light and is involved in regulating anthocyanin accumulation in the peel. Anthocyanin is the major pigment in the peel of Yunnan red pear (Pyrus pyrifolia (Burm.) Nak.). A transcriptional activation protein complex, involving members of the transcription factor classes of MYB, bHLH and WD40, regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis. This complex was examined in the peel of red pear. In order to clarify the interaction of PyMYB10, PybHLH and PyWD40, fruit were bagged then peel samples collected 0, 3, 5, and 7 days after bag removal. Samples were used for Western blotting and protein interaction analysis. The results showed that sunlight enhanced peel color and significantly up-regulated the expression of both PyMYB10 and PybHLH genes. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis showed that PybHLH interacted with PyMYB10 or PyWD40, and PyMYB10 interacted with PyWD40. Using onion cells as a model system, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) confirmed these interactions and showed that the interaction localized to the nuclei. GST Pull down and Far-Western blotting assays demonstrated that PybHLH interacted with PyMYB10 or PyWD40, respectively, and PyMYB10 interacted with PyWD40 in vitro. In addition, EMSA assay showed that PyMYB10 can directly bind to the promoter of the gene encoding the anthocyanin biosynthesis enzyme anthocyanidin synthase (PyANS). Taken together, these results showed that the ternary complex of PyMYB10, PybHLH and PyWD40 transcription factors forms to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in Yunnan red pear.
