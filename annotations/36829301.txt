Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in the modulation of defence and growth activities in plants. The best-characterized growth-defence trade-offs stem from antagonistic crosstalk among hormones. In this study, we first confirmed that JA negatively regulates root-knot nematode (RKN) susceptibility via the root exudates (REs) of tomato plants. Omics and toxicological analyses implied that kaempferol, a type of flavonol, from REs has a negative effect on RKN infection. We demonstrated that SlMYB57 negatively regulated kaempferol contents in tomato roots, whereas SlMYB108/112 had the opposite effect. We revealed that JA fine-tuned the homeostasis of kaempferol via SlMYB-mediated transcriptional regulation and the interaction between SlJAZs and SlMYBs, thus ensuring a balance between lateral root (LR) development and RKN susceptibility. Overall, this work provides novel insights into JA-modulated LR development and RKN susceptibility mechanisms and elucidates a trade-off model mediated by JA in plants encountering stress.
