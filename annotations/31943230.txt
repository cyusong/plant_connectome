Heat stress during flowering has differential impact on male and female reproductive organ viability leading to yield losses in field crops. Unlike flooded rice, dryland cereals such as sorghum, pearl millet and wheat have optimised their flower opening during cooler early morning or late evening hours to lower heat stress damage during flowering. Although previous studies have concluded that pollen viability determines seed set under heat stress, recent findings have revealed pearl millet and sorghum pistils to be equally sensitive to heat stress. Integrating flower opening time during cooler hours with increased pollen and pistil viability will overcome heat stress-induced damage during flowering under current and future hotter climatic conditions.
