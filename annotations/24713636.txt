['24713636', 'Proteins harboring the kin17 domain (KIN17) constitute a family of well-conserved  eukaryotic nuclear proteins involved in nucleic acid metabolism. In mammals,  KIN17 orthologs contribute to DNA replication, RNA splicing, and DNA integrity  maintenance. Recently, we reported a functional characterization of an  Arabidopsis thaliana KIN17 homolog (AtKIN17) that uncovered a role for this  protein in tuning physiological responses during copper (Cu) deficiency and  oxidative stress. However, functions similar to those described in mammals may  also be expected in plants given the conservation of functional domains in KIN17  orthologs. Here, we provide additional data consistent with the participation of  AtKIN17 in controlling general plant growth and development, as well as in  response to UV radiation. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis genome codes for a second  homolog to KIN17, we referred to as KIN17-like-protein (KLP). KLP  loss-of-function lines exhibited a reduced inhibition of root growth in response  to copper excess and relatively elongated hypocotyls in etiolated seedlings.  Altogether, our experimental data point to a general function of the kin17 domain  proteins in plant growth and development.', '2014', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.28634', 'Huijser']
