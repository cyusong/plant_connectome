Carotenoids play vital roles in the coloration of plant tissues and organs, particularly fruits; however, the regulation of carotenoid metabolism in fruits during ripening is largely unknown. Here, we show that red light promotes fruit coloration by inducing accelerated degreening and carotenoid accumulation in kumquat fruits. Transcriptome profiling revealed that a NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC2) family transcription factor, FcrNAC22, is specifically induced in red light-irradiated fruits. FcrNAC22 localizes to the nucleus, and its gene expression is up-regulated as fruits change color. Results from dual luciferase, yeast one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that FcrNAC22 directly binds to, and activates the promoters of three genes encoding key enzymes in the carotenoid metabolic pathway. Moreover, FcrNAC22 overexpression in citrus and tomato fruits as well as in citrus callus enhances expression of most carotenoid biosynthetic genes, accelerates plastid conversion into chromoplasts, and promotes color change. Knock down of FcrNAC22 expression in transiently transformed citrus fruits attenuates fruit coloration induced by red light. Taken together, our results demonstrate that FcrNAC22 is an important transcription factor that mediates red light-induced fruit coloration via up-regulation of carotenoid metabolism.
