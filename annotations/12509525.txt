['12509525', 'The movement of guard cells in stomatal complexes controls water loss and CO(2)  uptake in plants. Examination of the dual-affinity nitrate transporter gene  AtNRT1.1 (CHL1) revealed that it is expressed and functions in Arabidopsis guard  cells. CHL1 promoter-beta-glucuronidase and CHL1 promoter-green fluorescent  protein constructs showed strong expression in guard cells, and  immunolocalization experiments with anti-CHL1 antibody confirmed these results.  To assess CHL1 function, chl1 mutant plants grown in the presence of nitrate were  examined. Compared with wild-type plants, chl1 mutants had reduced stomatal  opening and reduced transpiration rates in the light or when deprived of CO(2) in  the dark. These effects result in enhanced drought tolerance in chl1 mutants. At  the cellular level, chl1 mutants showed reduced nitrate accumulation in guard  cells during stomatal opening and failed to show nitrate-induced depolarization  of guard cells. In wild-type guard cells, nitrate induced depolarization, and  nitrate concentrations increased threefold during stomatal opening. These results  identify an anion transporter that functions in stomatal opening and demonstrate  that CHL1 supports stomatal function in the presence of nitrate.', '2003 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.006312', 'Crawford']
