This experiment aimed to test whether recovery of shoot hydraulic conductivity after drought depends on cellular metabolism in addition to xylem hydraulics. We rehydrated droughted grapevines (Vitis vinifera) after treating intact plants through the root with 0.5 mm mercuric chloride (a metabolic inhibitor) at the end of the stress period, before rehydration. The contribution of mercury-inhibited water transport in both shoot and root, and the extent of shoot vessel embolization, were assessed. Drought stress decreased plant water potential and induced embolization of the shoot vessels. The rehydration in Hg-untreated plants re-established both shoot water potential and specific shoot hydraulic conductivity (Kss) at levels comparable with watered controls, and induced recovery of most of the embolisms formed in the shoot during the drought. In contrast, in plants treated with HgCl2, recovery of Kss and root hydraulic conductance were impaired. In rehydrated, Hg-treated plants, the effects of Hg on Kss were reversed when either the shoot or the root was treated with 60 mM beta-mercaptoethanol as a mercuric scavenger. This work suggests that plant cellular metabolism, sensitive to mercuric chloride, affects the recovery of shoot hydraulic conductivity during grapevine rehydration by interfering with embolism removal, and that it involves either the root or the shoot level.
