Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are produced by all living organisms and play an important role in innate immunity because they are readily available and non-specific against invading pathogenic microorganisms. Snakin-2 (SN2) from tomato is a short, cationic peptide that forms lethal pores in biomembranes of microbes. In plant cells, SN2 is produced as a prepeptide with a signal sequence for ER targeting and an acidic region to decrease toxicity in the producing organism. Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR in tomato plants demonstrated that SN2 is constitutively expressed, mostly in leaves and flowers. After fungal infection, wounding, or external application of phytohormones (such as methyl jasmonate, MeJa) operating in the JA-dependent defense response, a systemic reaction with an elevated expression of the SN2 gene is triggered in all parts of tomato plants. Abiotic stress factors like extreme temperatures or dehydration do not affect SN2 expression. Upon wounding, the expression of SN2 and LoxD are strongly enhanced in tomato fruits. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the protein level of bioactive SN2 is also increased upon application of methyl jasmonate in tomato seedlings.
