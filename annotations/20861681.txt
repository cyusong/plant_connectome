To study the importance of intercellular transport for MADS domain transcription factor functioning during floral development, we analyzed the dynamic behavior of fluorescently-tagged MADS domain proteins in transgenic plants by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. These analyses, described in a recent paper in The Plant Journal, provided proof for previous suggestions that the Arabidopsis thaliana C-type protein AGAMOUS has a non-cell-autonomous role in floral meristem integrity. Furthermore, it indicated a possible non-cell-autonomous role for the B-type proteins APETALA3 and PISTILLATA, and the E-type protein SEPALLATA3, through lateral intercellular movement in the floral meristem. In this addendum we compare some of the available fluorescent protein-based technologies for the investigation of transcription factor movements and dynamics.
