The cytokinin (CK) phytohormones have long been known to activate cell proliferation in plants. However, how CKs regulate cell division and cell expansion remains unclear. Here, we reveal that a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GROWTH REGULATOR (CKG), mediates CK-dependent regulation of cell expansion and cell cycle progression in Arabidopsis thaliana. The overexpression of CKG increased cell size in a ploidy-independent manner and promoted entry into the S phase of the cell cycle, especially at the seedling stage. Furthermore, CKG enhanced organ growth in a pleiotropic fashion, from embryogenesis to reproductive stages, particularly of cotyledons. In contrast, ckg loss-of-function mutants exhibited smaller cotyledons. CKG mainly regulates the expression of genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle including WEE1. We propose that CKG provides a regulatory module that connects cell cycle progression and organ growth to CK responses.
