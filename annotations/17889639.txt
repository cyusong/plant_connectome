Polar transport of the signaling molecule auxin is critical for plant development and depends on both the polar distribution of auxin efflux carriers, which pump auxin out of the cell and the alignment of these polarized cells. Two papers in this issue of Cell (Michniewicz et al., 2007; Jaillais et al., 2007) address how polar transport of these carriers occurs and describe the endosomal pathways involved.
