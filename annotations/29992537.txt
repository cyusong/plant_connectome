Root hairs (RH) are tip growing polarized cells aiding the uptake of nutrients and water into plants. RH differentiation involves the interplay of various hormones and second messengers. Tightly regulated production of reactive oxygen species by the NADPH oxidase RBOHC crucially functions in RH differentiation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent phosphorylation has been implemented in these processes. However, the kinases regulating RBOHC remained enigmatic. Here we identify CBL1-CIPK26 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor-kinase complexes as modulators of RBOHC activity. Combined genetic, cell biological and biochemical analyses reveal synergistic function of CIPK26-mediated phosphorylation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding for RBOHC activation. Complementation of rbohC mutant RH phenotypes by a S318/322 phosphorylation deficient RBOHC version suggests flexible and alternating phosphorylation patterns as mechanism fine-tuning ROS production in RH development.
