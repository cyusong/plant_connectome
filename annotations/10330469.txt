['10330469', 'The COP9 complex is a regulator essential for repression of light-mediated  development in Arabidopsis. Using partial amino acid sequence data generated from  purified COP9 complexes, we cloned the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding the 27-kD  subunit of the COP9 complex and showed that it is encoded by the previously  identified FUSCA5 (FUS5) locus. fus5 mutants exhibit constitutive  photomorphogenic phenotypes similar to those of cop9 and fus6. Point mutations in  FUS5 that led to a loss of FUS5 protein were detected in four fus5 allelic  strains. FUS5 contains the PCI/PINT and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  activation loop motifs and is highly conserved with the mammalian COP9 complex  subunit 7 and the Aspergillus nidulans AcoB proteins. FUS5 is present in both  complex and monomeric forms. In the COP9 complex, FUS5 may interact directly with  FUS6 and COP9. Mutations in FUS6 and COP9 result in a shift in the  electrophoretic mobility of FUS5. This shift can be mimicked by in vitro  phosphorylation of FUS5 by plant extracts. These findings further support the  hypothesis that the COP9 complex is a central and common regulator that may  interact with multiple signaling pathways.', '1999 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.5.839', 'Chamovitz']
