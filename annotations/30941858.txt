Brassica napus L. (canola) is one of the world's most economically important oilseeds. Despite our growing knowledge of Brassica genetics, we still know little about the genes and gene regulatory networks underlying early seed development. In this work, we use laser microdissection coupled with RNA sequencing to profile gene activity of both the maternal and filial subregions of the globular seed. We find subregions of the chalazal end including the chalazal endosperm, chalazal proliferating tissue, and chalazal seed coat, have unique transcriptome profiles associated with hormone biosynthesis and polysaccharide metabolism. We confirm that the chalazal seed coat is uniquely enriched for sucrose biosynthesis and transport, and that the chalazal endosperm may function as an important regulator of the maternal region through brassinosteroid synthesis. The chalazal proliferating tissue, a poorly understood subregion, was specifically enriched in transcripts associated with megasporogenesis and trehalose biosynthesis, suggesting this ephemeral structure plays an important role in both sporophytic development and carbon nutrient balance, respectively. Finally, compartmentalization of transcription factors and their regulatory circuits has uncovered previously unknown roles for the chalazal pole in early seed development.
