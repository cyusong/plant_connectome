Sugarcane is capable to store large amounts of sucrose in the culm at maturity hence it became a major source of sucrose for the food and the renewable energy industries. Sucrose, the main disaccharide produced by photosynthesis, is mainly stored in the vacuole of the cells of non-photosynthetic tissues. Two pathways are known to release free sucrose in plant cells, one is de novo synthesis dependent on sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose phosphate phosphatase (S6PP) while the other is regulatory and dependent on sucrose synthase (SuSy) activity. The molecular understanding of genes that give rise to the expression of the enzyme sucrose phosphate phosphatase, responsible for the release of sucrose in the last synthetic step lag behind the regulatory SuSy gene. Sugarcane genome sequencing effort disclosed the existence of a tandem duplication and the present work further support that both S6PP.1 and S6PP_2D isoforms are actively transcribed in young sugarcane plants but significantly less at maturity. Two commercial hybrids (SP80-3280 and R570) and both Saccharum spontaneum (IN84-58) and S.officinarum (BADILLA) exhibit transcriptional activity at three-month-old plants of the tandem S6PP_2D in leaves, culm, meristem and root system with a cultivar-specific distribution. Moreover, this tandem duplication is shared with other grasses and is ancestral in the group. Detection of a new isoform of S6PP resulting from the translation of 14 exon-containing transcript (S6PP_2D) will contribute to the knowledge of sucrose metabolism in plants. In addition, expression varies along plant development and between sugarcane cultivars and parental species.
