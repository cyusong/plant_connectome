['23148892', 'Environmental constraints challenge cell homeostasis and thus require a tight  regulation of metabolic activity. We have previously reported that the  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism is crucial for Arabidopsis salt tolerance  as revealed by the NaCl hypersensitivity of the GABA transaminase (GABA-T,  At3g22200) gaba-t/pop2-1 mutant. In this study, we demonstrate that GABA-T  deficiency during salt stress causes root and hypocotyl developmental defects and  alterations of cell wall composition. A comparative genome-wide transcriptional  analysis revealed that expression levels of genes involved in carbon metabolism,  particularly sucrose and starch catabolism, were found to increase upon the loss  of GABA-T function under salt stress conditions. Consistent with the altered  mutant cell wall composition, a number of cell wall-related genes were also found  differentially expressed. A targeted quantitative analysis of primary metabolites  revealed that glutamate (GABA precursor) accumulated while succinate (the final  product of GABA metabolism) significantly decreased in mutant roots after 1 d of  NaCl treatment. Furthermore, sugar concentration was twofold reduced in  gaba-t/pop2-1 mutant roots compared with wild type. Together, our results provide  strong evidence that GABA metabolism is a major route for succinate production in  roots and identify GABA as a major player of central carbon adjustment during  salt stress.', '2013 May', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12033', 'Deleu']
