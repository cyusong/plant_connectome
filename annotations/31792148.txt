['31792148', 'Chloroplast biogenesis depends on an extensive interplay between the nucleus,  cytosol, and chloroplasts, involving regulatory nucleus-encoded chloroplast  proteins, as well as nucleocytosolic photoreceptors such as phytochromes (phys)  and other extrachloroplastic factors. However, this whole process is only  partially understood. Here, we describe the role of VENOSA4 (VEN4) in chloroplast  development and acclimation to adverse growth conditions. A 35S:VEN4-eGFP fusion  protein localizes to the nucleus in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  protoplasts, and VEN4 homologs are present in a wide range of eukaryotes  including humans, where the corresponding homolog (SAMHD1) cleaves dNTPs.  Defective photosynthesis in ven4 seedlings results from reduced accumulation of  photosynthetic proteins and appears to be caused by a reduction in the  translational capacity of chloroplasts. The negative effect of the ven4 mutation  on photosynthesis can be phenotypically suppressed by germinating seeds in the  presence of excess dCTP or a pool of dNTPs, implying that VEN4, like human  SAMHD1, is involved in dNTP catabolism. Moreover, VEN4 activity is also required  for optimal responses to cold and salt stresses. In conclusion, our work  emphasizes the importance of the nucleocytosolic compartment and the fine-tuning  of dNTP levels for chloroplast translation and development.', '2020 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.01108', 'ORCID:']
