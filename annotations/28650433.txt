Plants maximize their fitness by adjusting their growth and development in response to signals such as light and temperature. The circadian clock provides a mechanism for plants to anticipate events such as sunrise and adjust their transcriptional programmes. However, the underlying mechanisms by which plants coordinate environmental signals with endogenous pathways are not fully understood. Using RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments, we show that the evening complex (EC) of the circadian clock plays a major role in directly coordinating the expression of hundreds of key regulators of photosynthesis, the circadian clock, phytohormone signalling, growth and response to the environment. We find that the ability of the EC to bind targets genome-wide depends on temperature. In addition, co-occurrence of phytochrome B (phyB) at multiple sites where the EC is bound provides a mechanism for integrating environmental information. Hence, our results show that the EC plays a central role in coordinating endogenous and environmental signals in Arabidopsis.
