The perennial woody plants of citrus are one of the most important fruit crops in the world and largely depends on arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) to obtain essential nutrients from soil. However, the molecular aspects of AMS in citrus and perennial woody plants in general have largely been understudied. We used RNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes in roots of Poncirus trifoliata upon mycorrhization by the AM fungus Glomus versiforme and evaluated their conservation by comparative transcriptome analyses with four herbaceous model plants. We identified 282 differentially expressed genes in P. trifoliata, including orthologs of 21 genes with characterized roles in AMS and 83 genes that are considered to be conserved in AM-host plants. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed a 'core set' of 156 genes from P. trifoliata whose orthologous genes from at least three of the five species also exhibited similar transcriptional changes during AMS. Functional analysis of one of these conserved AM-induced genes, a 3-keto-acyl-ACP reductase (FatG) involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, confirmed its involvement in AMS in Medicago truncatula. Our results identify a core transcriptional program for AMS that is largely conserved between P. trifoliata and other plants. The comparative transcriptomics approach adds to previous phylogenomics studies to identify conserved genes required for AMS.
