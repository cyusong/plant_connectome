Plant root systems are critical for survival, acting as the primary interface for nutrient and water acquisition, as well as anchoring the plant to the ground. As plants grow, their root systems become more elaborate, which is largely mediated by the formation of root branches, or lateral roots. Lateral roots initiate deep within the root in the pericycle cell layer, and their development is controlled by a wide range of internal signaling factors and environmental cues, as well as mechanical feedback from the surrounding cells. The endodermal cell layer, which overlies the pericycle, has emerged as an important tissue regulating LR initiation and formation. We recently identified the AtMYB93 transcription factor as a negative regulator of lateral root development in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, AtMYB93 expression is highly restricted to the few endodermal cells overlying developing lateral root primordia, suggesting that this transcriptional regulator might play a key role in mediating the effect of the endodermis on lateral root development. Here we discuss our recent findings in the wider context of root system development - with a particular focus on the role of the endodermis - and propose several potential models to explain AtMYB93 function during lateral root organogenesis.

AtMYB93: !localizes to! endodermal cells 
endodermis: !affects! lateral root initiation and formation
