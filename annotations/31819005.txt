['31819005', 'Cellular membranes contain many lipids, some of which, such as sphingolipids,  have important structural and signaling functions. The common sphingolipid  glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is present in plants, fungi, and animals. As a major  plant sphingolipid, GlcCer is involved in the formation of lipid microdomains,  and the regulation of GlcCer is key for acclimation to stress. Although the  GlcCer biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated, little is known about GlcCer  catabolism, and a plant GlcCer-degrading enzyme (glucosylceramidase (GCD)) has  yet to be identified. Here, we identified AtGCD3, one of four Arabidopsis  thaliana homologs of human nonlysosomal glucosylceramidase, as a plant GCD. We  found that recombinant AtGCD3 has a low K(m) for the fluorescent lipid C(6)-NBD  GlcCer and preferentially hydrolyzes long acyl-chain GlcCer purified from  Arabidopsis leaves. Testing of inhibitors of mammalian glucosylceramidases  revealed that a specific inhibitor of human beta-glucosidase 2,  N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, inhibits AtGCD3 more effectively than does a specific  inhibitor of human beta-glucosidase 1, conduritol beta-epoxide. We also found that  Glu-499 and Asp-647 in AtGCD3 are vital for GCD activity. GFP-AtGCD3 fusion  proteins mainly localized to the plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum  membrane. No obvious growth defects or changes in sphingolipid contents were  observed in gcd3 mutants. Our results indicate that AtGCD3 is a plant  glucosylceramidase that participates in GlcCer catabolism by preferentially  hydrolyzing long-acyl-chain GlcCers.', '2020 Jan 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.011274', 'ORCID:']
