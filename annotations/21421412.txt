['21421412', 'Freezing temperatures control where and when plants can grow, and negatively  influence crop quality and productivity. To identify key regulatory genes  involved in cold adaptation, we screened activation-tagged Arabidopsis lines for  mutants with greater freezing tolerance. One mutant, freezing tolerant line1  (ftl1-1D), manifested enhanced tolerance along with dwarfism and delayed  flowering. This was caused by activation of DWARF AND DELAYED FLOWERING 1 (DDF1),  a gene previously described as a regulatory component in salinity signaling. The  induced gene encoded an AP2 transcription factor of the CBF/DREB1 subfamily. In  addition to conferring tolerance to low temperatures and salt stress,  ftl1-1D/ddf1 improved tolerance to drought and heat. Real-time PCR indicated that  FTL1/DDF1 was up-regulated by those four types of stresses in wild-type  Arabidopsis. Its increased expression in the mutant induced various  stress-responsive genes under normal growing conditions, resulting in improved  tolerances. However, phenotypes shown in the ftl1-1D/ddf1 were restored by  treatment with exogenous gibberellin (GA(3)), indicating the involvement of a GA  pathway in FTL1/DDF1-mediated tolerance. Therefore, we conclude that FTL1/DDF1  plays a role in regulating responses to several abiotic stresses, perhaps via  cross-talk in the pathways.', '2011 Apr', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.01.002', 'Lim']
