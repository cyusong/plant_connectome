['18547395', "Coumarins are derived via the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants. The  2H-1-benzopyran-2-one core structure of coumarins is formed via the  ortho-hydroxylation of cinnamates, trans/cis isomerization of the side chain, and  lactonization. Ortho-hydroxylation is a key step in coumarin biosynthesis as a  branch point from lignin biosynthesis; however, ortho-hydroxylation of cinnamates  is not yet fully understood. In this study, scopoletin biosynthesis was explored  using Arabidopsis thaliana, which accumulates scopoletin and its  beta-glucopyranoside scopolin in its roots. T-DNA insertion mutants of caffeoyl  CoA O-methyltransferase 1 (CCoAOMT1) showed significant reduction in scopoletin  and scopolin levels in the roots, and recombinant CCoAOMT1 exhibited  3'-O-methyltransferase activity on caffeoyl CoA to feruloyl CoA. These results  suggest that feruloyl CoA is a key precursor in scopoletin biosynthesis.  Ortho-hydroxylases of cinnamates were explored in the oxygenase families in A.  thaliana, and one of the candidate genes in the Fe(II)- and  2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2OGD) family was designated as F6'H1. T-DNA  insertion mutants of F6'H1 showed severe reductions in scopoletin and scopolin  levels in the roots. The pattern of F6'H1 expression is consistent with the  patterns of scopoletin and scopolin accumulation. The recombinant F6'H1 protein  exhibited ortho-hydroxylase activity for feruloyl CoA (K(m) = 36.0 +/- 4.27  microM; k(cat) = 11.0 +/- 0.45 sec(-1)) to form 6'-hydroxyferuloyl CoA, but did  not hydroxylate ferulic acid. These results indicate that Fe(II)- and  2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase is the pivotal enzyme in the  ortho-hydroxylation of feruloyl CoA in scopoletin biosynthesis.", '2008 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03568.x', 'Shimizu']
