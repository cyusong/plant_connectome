Seagrass meadows are critical ecosystems, and they are among the most threatened habitats on the planet. As an anthropogenic biotic invader, <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> Loisel. competes with native plants, threatens native ecosystems and coastal aquaculture, and may cause local biodiversity to decline. The distribution area of the exotic species <i>S. alterniflora</i> in the Yellow River Delta had been expanding to ca.4,000 ha from 1990 to 2018. In this study, we reported, for the first time, the competitive effects of the exotic plant (<i>S. alterniflora</i>) on seagrass (<i>Zostera japonica</i> Asch. & Graebn.) by field investigation and a transplant experiment in the Yellow River Delta. Within the first 3 months of the field experiment, <i>S. alterniflora</i> had pushed forward 14 m into the <i>Z. japonica</i> distribution region. In the study region, the area of <i>S. alterniflora</i> in 2019 increased by 516 times compared with its initial area in 2015. Inhibition of <i>Z. japonica</i> growth increased with the invasion of <i>S. alterniflora</i>. <i>Z. japonica</i> had been degrading significantly under the pressure of <i>S. alterniflora</i> invasion. <i>S. alterniflora</i> propagates sexually via seeds for long distance invasion and asexually by tillers and rhizomes for short distance invasion. Our results describe the invasion pattern of <i>S. alterniflora</i> and can be used to develop strategies for prevention and control of <i>S. alterniflora</i> invasion.
