Leaf shape traits have long been a focus of many disciplines, but the complex genetic and environmental interactive mechanisms regulating leaf shape variation have not yet been investigated in detail. The question of the respective roles of genes and environment and how they interact to modulate leaf shape is a thorny evolutionary problem, and sophisticated methodology is needed to address it. In this study, we investigated a framework-level approach that inputs shape image photographs and genetic and environmental data, and then outputs the relative importance ranks of all variables after integrating shape feature extraction, dimension reduction, and tree-based statistical models. The power of the proposed framework was confirmed by simulation and a Populus szechuanica var. tibetica data set. This new methodology resulted in the detection of novel shape characteristics, and also confirmed some previous findings. The quantitative modeling of a combination of polygenetic, plastic, epistatic, and gene-environment interactive effects, as investigated in this study, will improve the discernment of quantitative leaf shape characteristics, and the methods are ready to be applied to other leaf morphology data sets. Unlike the majority of approaches in the quantitative leaf shape literature, this framework-level approach is data-driven, without assuming any pre-known shape attributes, landmarks, or model structures.
