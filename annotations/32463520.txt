Transfer cells (TCs) support high nutrient rates into, or at symplasmic discontinuities within, the plant body. Their transport capacity is conferred by an amplified plasma membrane surface area, enriched in nutrient transporters, supported on an intricately invaginated wall labyrinth (WL). Thus, development of the WL is at the heart of TC function. Enquiry has shifted from describing WL architecture and formation to discovering mechanisms regulating WL assembly. Experimental systems used to examine these phenomena are critiqued. Considerable progress has been made in identifying master regulators that commit stem cells to a TC fate (e.g. the maize Myeloblastosis (MYB)-related R1-type transcription factor) and signals that induce differentiated cells to undergo trans-differentiation to a TC phenotype (e.g. sugar, auxin and ethylene). In addition, signals that provide positional information for assembly of the WL include apoplasmic hydrogen peroxide and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> plumes. The former switches on, and specifies the intracellular site for WL construction, while the latter creates subdomains to direct assembly of WL invaginations. Less is known about macromolecule species and their spatial organization essential for WL assembly. Emerging evidence points to a dependency on methyl-esterified homogalacturonan accumulation, unique patterns of cellulose and callose deposition and spatial positioning of arabinogalactan proteins.
