Inducible defenses that provide enhanced resistance to insect attack are nearly universal in plants. The defense-signaling cascade is mediated by the synthesis, movement, and perception of jasmonate (JA) and the interaction of this signaling molecule with other plant hormones and messengers. To explore how the interaction of JA and ethylene influences induced defenses, we employed the never-ripe (Nr) tomato mutant, which exhibits a partial block in ethylene perception, and the defenseless (def1) mutant, which is deficient in JA biosynthesis. The defense gene proteinase inhibitor (PIN2) was used as marker to compare plant responses. The Nr mutant showed a normal wounding response with PIN2 induction, but the def1 mutant did not. As expected, methyl JA (MeJA) treatment restored the normal wound response in the def1 mutant. Exogenous application of MeJA increased resistance to Helicoverpa zea, induced defense gene expression, and increased glandular trichome density on systemic leaves. Exogenous application of ethephon, which penetrates tissues and decomposes to ethylene, resulted in increased H. zea growth and interfered with the wounding response. Ethephon treatment also increased salicylic acid in systemic leaves. These results indicate that while JA plays the main role in systemic induced defense, ethylene acts antagonistically in this system to regulate systemic defense.
