LIM domain proteins are cysteine-rich proteins, and are often considered as actin bundlers and transcription factors in plants. However, the roles of XLIM proteins in plants (especially in cotton) remain unexplored in detail so far. In this study, we identified a cotton XLIM protein (GhXLIM6) that is preferentially expressed in cotton fiber during whole elongation stage and early secondary cell wall (SCW) synthesis stage. The GhXLIM6-silenced transgenic cotton produces shorter fibers with thinner cell walls, compared with wild-type (WT). GhXLIM6 protein could directly bind F-actin and promote actin polymerization both in vitro and in vivo. It also acts as a transcription factor to suppress GhKNL1 expression through binding the PAL-box element of GhKNL1 promoter, and subsequently regulate the expression of CesA genes related to cellulose biosynthesis and deposition in SCWs of cotton fibers. The cellulose content in fibers of GhXLIM6RNAi cotton is lower than that in WT. Taken together, these data reveal the dual roles of GhXLIM6 in fiber development. On one hand, GhXLIM6 functions in fiber elongation through binding to F-actin to maintain the dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, GhXLIM6 fine-tunes fiber SCW formation, probably through directly suppressing transcription of GhKNL1 to promote cellulose biosynthesis.
