['30664249', 'Stress granules (SGs) are evolutionary conserved aggregates of proteins and  untranslated mRNAs formed in response to stress. Despite their importance for  stress adaptation, no complete proteome composition has been reported for plant  SGs. In this study, we addressed the existing gap. Importantly, we also provide  evidence for metabolite sequestration within the SGs. To isolate SGs we used  Arabidopsis seedlings expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of the  SGs marker protein, Rbp47b, and an experimental protocol combining differential  centrifugation with affinity purification (AP). SGs isolates were analysed using  mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics. A quarter of the identified  proteins constituted known or predicted SG components. Intriguingly, the  remaining proteins were enriched in key enzymes and regulators, such as  cyclin-dependent kinase A (CDKA), that mediate plant responses to stress. In  addition to proteins, nucleotides, amino acids and phospholipids also accumulated  in SGs. Taken together, our results indicated the presence of a preexisting SG  protein interaction network; an evolutionary conservation of the proteins  involved in SG assembly and dynamics; an important role for SGs in moderation of  stress responses by selective storage of proteins and metabolites.', '2019 May', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.15690', 'ORCID:']
