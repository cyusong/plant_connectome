In plants, proper seed development and the continuing post-embryonic organogenesis both require that different cell types are correctly differentiated in response to internal and external stimuli. Among internal stimuli, plant hormones and particularly auxin and its polar transport (PAT) have been shown to regulate a multitude of plant physiological processes during vegetative and reproductive development. Although our current auxin knowledge is almost based on the results from researches on the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana, during the last few years, many studies tried to transfer this knowledge from model to crop species, maize in particular. Applications of auxin transport inhibitors, mutant characterization, and molecular and cell biology approaches, facilitated by the sequencing of the maize genome, allowed the identification of genes involved in auxin metabolism, signaling, and particularly in polar auxin transport. PIN auxin efflux carriers have been shown to play an essential role in regulating PAT during both seed and post-embryonic development in maize. In this review, we provide a summary of the recent findings on PIN-mediated polar auxin transport during maize development. Similarities and differences between maize and Arabidopsis are analyzed and discussed, also considering that their different plant architecture depends on the differentiation of structures whose development is controlled by auxins.
