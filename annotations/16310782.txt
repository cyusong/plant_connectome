Beta amyloid (Abeta) is believed one of the major pathogens of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the reduction of Abeta is considered a primary therapeutic target. Immunization with Abeta can reduce Abeta burden and pathological features in transgenic AD model mice. Transgenic potato plants were made using genes encoding 5 tandem repeats of Abeta1-42 peptides with an ER retention signal. Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (Tg2576) fed with transgenic potato tubers with adjuvant showed a primary immune response and a partial reduction of Abeta burden in the brain. Thus, Abeta tandem repeats can be expressed in transgenic potato plants to form immunologically functional Abeta, and these potatoes has a potential to be used for the prevention and treatment of AD.
