SNAREs (soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) mediate membrane fusion of vesicle transport in eukaryotic cells. LjSYP132s are the members of Qa-SNAREs in Lotus japonicus. Two isoforms, LjSYP132a and LjSYP132b, are generated by alternative splicing. Immunoblot analysis detected strong expression of LjSYP132s in infected root nodules and seeds by posttranscriptional modification. In either LjSYP132a or LjSYP132b silenced roots (RNAi-LjSYP132a, RNAi-LjSYP132b), the infection thread (IT) was not elongated, suggesting that both LjSYP132a and LjSYP132b have a role in IT progression. The results were consistent with the data of qRT-PCR showing that both genes were expressed at the early stage of infection. However, during the nodulation, only LjSYP132a was induced. LjSYP132s protein was observed in the Mesorhizobium loti-inoculated roots of mutants, nfr1, castor and pollux, suggesting that LjSYP132s can be induced without Nod factor signaling. Accumulation of LjSYP132s in the peribacteroid membrane suggests the function of not only IT formation but also nutrient transport. In contrast, qRT-PCR showed that LjSYP132b was expressed in the seeds. A stable transgenic plant of LjSYP132b, R132b, was produced by RNAi silencing. In the R132b plants, small pods with a few seeds and abnormal tip growth of the pollen tubes were observed, suggesting that LjSYP132b has a role in pollen tube growth and nutrient transport in the plasma membrane of seeds.
