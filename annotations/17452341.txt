['17452341', 'In higher plants, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGlc-PPase) is a  heterotetrameric enzyme comprised of two small and two large subunits.  Potato-Arabidopsis hybrid ADPGlc-PPases were generated and their regulatory  properties analyzed. We show that ADPGlc-PPase subunits from two different  species can interact, producing active enzymes with new regulatory properties.  Depending on the subunit combinations, hybrid heterotetramers showed responses to  allosteric effectors [3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) and Pi] in the micromolar or  millimolar range. While hybrid potato small subunit (PSS) and the Arabidopsis  large subunit APL1 showed an extremely sensitive response to 3-PGA and Pi, hybrid  PSS/Arabidopsis APL2 was very insensitive to them. Intermediate responses were  determined for other subunit combinations.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcm047', 'Romero']
