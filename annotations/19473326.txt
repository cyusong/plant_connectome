Molecular genetic analyses in Arabidopsis disclosed a genetic pathway whereby flowering is induced by the photoperiod. This cascade is examined here within the time course of floral transition in the long-day (LD) plant Sinapis alba induced by a single photoperiodic cycle. In addition to previously available sequences, the cloning of CONSTANS (SaCO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (SaFT) homologues allowed expression analyses to be performed to follow the flowering process step by step. A diurnal rhythm in SaCO expression in the leaves was observed and transcripts of SaFT were detected when light was given in phase with SaCO kinetics only. This occurred when day length was extended or when a short day was shifted towards a 'photophile phase'. The steady-state level of SaFT transcripts in the various physiological situations examined was found to correlate like a rheostat with floral induction strength. Kinetics of SaFT activation were also consistent with previous estimations of translocation of florigen out of leaves, which could actually occur after the inductive cycle. In response to one 22-h LD, initiation of floral meristems by the shoot apical meristem (SAM) started about 2 days after activation of SaFT and was marked by expression of APETALA1 (SaAP1). Meanwhile, LEAFY (SaLFY) was first up-regulated in leaf primordia and in the SAM. FRUITFULL (SaFUL) was later activated in the whole SAM but excluded from floral meristems. These patterns are integrated with previous observations concerning upregulation of SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1 (SaSOC1) to provide a temporal and spatial map of floral transition in Sinapis.
