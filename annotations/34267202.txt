Trivalent rare earth elements (REEs) are widely used in agriculture. Aerially applied REEs enter leaf epidermal cells by endocytosis and act systemically to improve the growth of the whole plant. The mechanistic basis of their systemic activity is unclear. Here, we show that treatment of Arabidopsis leaves with trivalent lanthanum [La(III)], a representative of REEs, triggers systemic endocytosis from leaves to roots. La(III)-induced systemic endocytosis requires AtrbohD-mediated reactive oxygen species production and jasmonic acid. Systemic endocytosis impacts the accumulation of mineral elements and the development of roots consistent with the growth promoting effects induced by aerially applied REEs. These findings provide insights into the mechanistic basis of REE activity in plants.
