The "Mendelian Rules" of inheritance are cornerstones of genetics, described in Mendel's seminal publication from 1866. The experimental results and their interpretation have been discussed in numerous ways. This perspective emphasizes the contribution of Mendel's preparations prior to his crossing experiments to the discovery of Mendelian genetics. This thoughtful experimental design, and some fortune, avoided pitfalls that could have resulted in non-Mendelian inheritance.
