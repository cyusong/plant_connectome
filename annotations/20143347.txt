['20143347', 'Formation of polyploid organisms by fertilization of unreduced gametes in meiotic  mutants is believed to be a common phenomenon in species evolution. However, not  well understood is how species in nature generally exist as haploid and diploid  organisms in a long evolutionary time while polyploidization must have repeatedly  occurred via meiotic mutations. Here, we show that the ploidy increased for two  consecutive generations due to unreduced but viable gametes in the Arabidopsis  cyclin a1;2-2 (also named tardy asynchronous meiosis-2) mutant, but the resultant  octaploid plants produced progeny of either the same or reduced ploidy via  genomic reductions during meiosis and pollen mitosis. Ploidy reductions through  sexual reproduction were also observed in independently generated artificial  octaploid and hexaploid Arabidopsis plants. These results demonstrate that  octaploid is likely the maximal ploidy produced through sexual reproduction in  Arabidopsis. The polyploidy-associated genomic instability may be a general  phenomenon that constrains ploidy levels in species evolution.', '2010 Apr', 'Genesis', '10.1002/dvg.20610', 'Yang']
