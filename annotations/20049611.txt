Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), coupled with mass spectroscopy, was used to study seed abortion in Dimocarpus longan Lour. (cv. Minjiao 64-1) by comparing normal and aborted seeds at three developmental stages. More than 1,000 protein spots were reproducibly detected in 2-DE gels, with 43 protein spots being significantly altered in their intensity between normal and aborted seeds at least at one stage. Thirty-five proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) analysis and protein database searching. Most of the identified proteins were associated with a variety of functions, including energy and metabolism (30%), programed cell death (9%), antioxidative processes (14%), chaperonin (23%), cell division, amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolism, and other functional classes. Furthermore, the expression patterns of HSP70 and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (cAPX) were validated by immunoblotting analysis. This study provides a novel, global insight into proteomic differences between normal and aborted seeds in longan. We anticipate that identification of the differentially expressed proteins may lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis for seed abortion in longan.
