['20228247', 'Maintenance of stem cells in the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot meristem is regulated  by signals from the underlying cells of the organizing center, provided through  the transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS). Here, we report the isolation of several  independent mutants of MGOUN1 (MGO1) as genetic suppressors of ectopic WUS  activity and enhancers of stem cell defects in hypomorphic wus alleles. mgo1  mutants have previously been reported to result in a delayed progression of  meristem cells into differentiating organ primordia (Laufs et al., 1998). Genetic  analyses indicate that MGO1 functions together with WUS in stem cell maintenance  at all stages of shoot and floral meristems. Synergistic interactions of mgo1  with several chromatin mutants suggest that MGO1 affects gene expression together  with chromatin remodeling pathways. In addition, the expression states of  developmentally regulated genes are randomly switched in mgo1 in a mitotically  inheritable way, indicating that MGO1 stabilizes epigenetic states against  stochastically occurring changes. Positional cloning revealed that MGO1 encodes a  putative type IB topoisomerase, which in animals and yeast has been shown to be  required for regulation of DNA coiling during transcription and replication. The  specific developmental defects in mgo1 mutants link topoisomerase IB function in  Arabidopsis to stable propagation of developmentally regulated gene expression.', '2010 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.068296', 'Laux']
