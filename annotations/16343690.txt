Ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) is a plant blue-copper protein catalyzing dioxygen reduction to water using ascorbic acid as the electron donor. In spite of extensive molecular characterization the physiological role of AAO is still uncertain. Abundant mRNA, protein and activity of AAO were observed in illuminated leaves of Cucurbita pepo. AAO activity was found to be proportional to light intensity. The light effect was rapidly reversed in dark and activity remained low throughout the dark period. Activity was elicited in dark by increased oxygen concentration. AAO activity increased in the facultative CAM Kalanchoë blossfeldiana upon induction of the CAM cycle and decreased during germination of C. pepo and Zea mays under hypoxic conditions. These results strongly suggest that AAO activity could be part of a dynamic system for oxygen management in plants.
