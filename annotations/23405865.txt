Pseudomonas cichorii is the causal agent of lettuce midrib rot, characterized by a dark-brown to green-black discoloration of the midrib. Formation of necrotic lesions by several plant-pathogenic pseudomonads is associated with production of phytotoxic lipopeptides, which contribute to virulence. Therefore, the ability of P. cichorii SF1-54 to produce lipopeptides was investigated. A cell-free culture filtrate of SF1-54 showed surfactant, antimicrobial, and phytotoxic activities which are typical for lipopeptides. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of P. cichorii SF1-54 culture filtrate revealed the presence of seven compounds with lipopeptide characteristics. Two related lipopeptides, named cichofactin A and B, were studied in more detail: they are linear lipopeptides with a decanoic and dodecanoic lipid chain, respectively, connected to the N-terminus of an eight-amino-acid peptide moiety. Both cichofactins are new members of the syringafactin lipopeptide family. Furthermore, two nonribosomal peptide synthethase-encoding genes, cifA and cifB, were identified as responsible for cichofactin biosynthesis. A cifAB deletion mutant no longer produced cichofactins and was impaired in swarming motility but showed enhanced biofilm formation. Upon spray inoculation on lettuce, the cichofactin-deficient mutant caused significantly less rotten midribs than the wild type, indicating that cichofactins are involved in pathogenicity of P. cichorii SF1-54. Further analysis revealed that P. cichorii isolates vary greatly in swarming motility and cichofactin production.
