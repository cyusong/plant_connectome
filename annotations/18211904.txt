['18211904', 'Three methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins in Arabidopsis, AtMBD5, AtMBD6,  and AtMBD7, are functional in binding methylated CpG dinucleotides in vitro and  localize to the highly CpG-methylated chromocenters in vivo. These proteins  differ, however, in their subnuclear localization pattern; AtMBD5 and AtMBD6,  each containing a single MBD motif, show preference for two perinucleolar  chromocenters, whereas AtMBD7, a naturally occurring poly-MBD protein containing  three MBD motifs, localizes to all chromocenters. Here we studied the  significance of multiple MBD motifs for subnuclear localization and mobility in  living cells. We found that the number of MBD motifs determines the subnuclear  localization of the MBD protein. Furthermore, live kinetic experiments showed  that AtMBD7-green fluorescent protein (GFP) has lower mobility than AtMBD5-GFP  and AtMBD6-GFP, which is conferred by cooperative activity of its three MBD  motifs. Thus, the number of MBD motifs appears to affect not only binding  affinity and mobility within the nucleus, but also the subnuclear localization of  the protein. Our results suggest that poly-MBD proteins can directly affect  chromatin structure by inducing intra- and inter-chromatin compaction via  bridging over multiple methylated CpG sites.', '2008 Mar 28', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M706221200', 'Grafi']
