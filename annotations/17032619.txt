Vitamin C (l-ascorbate) is important for antioxidative and metabolic functions in both plants and humans. Ascorbate itself is oxidized to dehydroascorbate during the process of antioxidation, and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) re-reduces the oxidized ascorbate. Therefore, this enzyme is assumed to be critical for ascorbate recycling. Here we show that the expression of rice DHAR in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced resistance to salt stress. Salt tolerance was remarkably improved despite slight increases in DHAR activity and total ascorbate. This study provides direct evidence for the importance of DHAR in salt tolerance.
