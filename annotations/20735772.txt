['20735772', 'Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNAs is a widespread phenomenon in  plants; however, many questions, especially regarding its regulation and  functional implications, remain to be elucidated. In vertebrates, polypyrimidine  tract-binding proteins (PTBs) have been identified as key splicing factors  influencing splice site selection and orchestrating coordinated splicing  programmes during developmental processes. Here, we analysed three PTB homologues  from Arabidopsis thaliana and provide evidence for their gene regulatory  potential based on AS and a splicing-independent mechanism. Our data reveal that  Arabidopsis PTB homologues are subject to extensive auto- and cross-regulation  via AS-coupled nonsense-mediated decay, thereby establishing a basis for  interlinking their expression. Furthermore, the multiple modes of action of  Arabidopsis PTB homologues are reflected in their subcellular localization in the  nucleus, cytosol and processing bodies. This work provides insight into the  regulation of AS in plants and highlights the regulatory potential of the  multifunctional plant PTB homologues, which might have important implications in  diverse biological processes.', '2010 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04321.x', 'Wachter']
