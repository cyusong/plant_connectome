['26406904', 'Biogenesis of chloroplasts involves a series of protein trafficking events.  Nuclear-encoded proteins are imported into the organelle, and then trafficked to  various chloroplast locations by systems that are directly homologous to  bacterial systems. Although the thylakoid-based systems have been studied  extensively, much less is known about the systems that reside and function in the  inner envelope membrane. One such system, the Sec2 system, is homologous to both  the thylakoid-based Sec1 system and bacterial Sec systems, and may mediate both  integration and translocation across the inner envelope. At a minimum, this  system is expected to include three components, but only two, SCY2 and SECA2,  have been identified in Arabidopsis. Bioinformatics and protein modeling were  used to identify the protein encoded by At4g38490 as a candidate for the missing  component (SECE2). Cellular localization, biochemistry, protein interaction  assays in yeast, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were used to establish  that this protein is an integral membrane protein of the inner envelope, and  specifically interacts with the SCY2 component in vivo. Sequence analyses  indicated that SECE2 proteins are found in a variety of plants, and differ from  the thylakoid SECE1 proteins in a stroma-exposed helical domain, which may  contribute to their specificity. Finally, a genetic analysis indicated that SECE2  plays an essential role in plant growth and development.', '2015 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13028', 'Fernandez']
