The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a prominent role in various abiotic stress responses of plants. In the ABA-dependent osmotic stress response, SnRK2.6, one of the subclass III SnRK2 kinases, has been identified as playing a key role by phosphorylating and activating downstream genes. Although several modulatory proteins have been reported to be phosphorylated by SnRK2.6, the identities of the full spectrum of downstream targets have yet to be sufficiently established. In this study, we identified CaSAP14, a stress-associated protein in pepper (Capsicum annuum), as a downstream target of CaSnRK2.6. We elucidated the physical interaction between SnRK2.6 and CaSAP14, both in vitro and in vivo, and accordingly identified a C-terminal C2H2-type zinc finger domain of CaSAP14 as being important for their interaction. CaSAP14-silenced pepper plants showed dehydration- and high salt-sensitive phenotypes, whereas overexpression of CaSAP14 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to dehydration, high salinity, and mannitol treatment, with plants showing ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes. Furthermore, an in-gel kinase assay revealed that CaSnRK2.6 phosphorylates CaSAP14 in response to exogenous ABA, dehydration, and high-salinity stress. Collectively, these findings suggest that CaSAP14 is a direct substrate of CaSnRK2.6 and positively modulates dehydration- and high salinity-induced osmotic stress responses.
