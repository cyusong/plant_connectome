As sessile and autotrophic organisms, plants have evolved sophisticated pathways to produce a rich array of specialized metabolites, many of which are biologically active and function as defense substances in protecting plants from herbivores and pathogens. Upon stimuli, these structurally diverse small molecules may be synthesized or constitutively accumulated. Jasmonate acids (JAs) are the major defense phytohormone involved in transducing external signals (such as wounding) to activate defense reactions, including, in particular, the reprogramming of metabolic pathways that initiate and enhance the production of defense compounds against insect herbivores and pathogens. In this review, we summarize the progress of recent research on the control of specialized metabolic pathways in plants by JA signaling, with an emphasis on the molecular regulation of terpene and alkaloid biosynthesis. We also discuss the interplay between JA signaling and various signaling pathways during plant defense responses. These studies provide valuable data for breeding insect-proof crops and pave the way to engineering the production of valuable metabolites in future.
