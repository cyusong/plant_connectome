['17605754', 'One of the earliest responses of plants to environmental stress is establishing a  temporary growth arrest that allows adaptation to adverse conditions. The  response to abiotic stress requires the modulation of gene expression, which may  be mediated by the alteration of chromatin structures. This alteration can be  accomplished with the help of chromatin-remodeling enzymes, such as the various  SWI/SNF classes of ATPases. Here, we investigate the role of the Arabidopsis  SNF2/Brahma-type AtCHR12 chromatin-remodeling gene in plant growth and  development in reaction to adverse environmental conditions. We show that the  AtCHR12 chromatin-remodeling gene plays a vital role in mediating the temporary  growth arrest of Arabidopsis that is induced upon perception of stress. Exposing  an AtCHR12 overexpressing mutant to stress conditions leads to growth arrest of  normally active primary buds, as well as to reduced growth of the primary stem.  In contrast, the AtCHR12 knockout mutant shows less growth arrest than the  wild-type when exposed to moderate stress. Without stress, mutant plants are  indistinguishable from the wild-type, and the growth arrest response seems to  depend on the severity of the stress applied. Modulation of AtCHR12 expression  correlates with changes in expression of dormancy-associated genes. This is in  agreement with the concept of AtCHR12 participation in priming the plants for the  growth arrest response. Our data indicate that AtCHR12-associated growth arrest  differs from DELLA-mediated growth restraint. This establishes AtCHR12 as a novel  gene involved in the response repertoire of plants that permits flexible  modulation of growth in adverse and/or otherwise limiting environments.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03185.x', 'Bisseling']
