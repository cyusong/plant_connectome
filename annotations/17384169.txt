['17384169', 'We explore the roles of gibberellin (GA) signaling genes SLEEPY1 (SLY1) and  RGA-LIKE2 (RGL2) in regulation of seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana, a  plant in which the hormone GA is required for seed germination. Seed germination  failure in the GA biosynthesis mutant ga1-3 is rescued by GA and by mutations in  the DELLA gene RGL2, suggesting that RGL2 represses seed germination. RGL2  protein disappears before wild-type seed germination, consistent with the model  that GA stimulates germination by causing the SCF(SLY1) E3 ubiquitin ligase  complex to trigger ubiquitination and destruction of RGL2. Unlike ga1-3, the  GA-insensitive sly1 mutants show variable seed dormancy. Seed lots with high seed  dormancy after-ripened slowly, with stronger alleles requiring more time. We  expected that if RGL2 negatively controls seed germination, sly1 mutant seeds  that germinate well should accumulate lower RGL2 levels than those failing to  germinate. Surprisingly, RGL2 accumulated at high levels even in after-ripened  sly1 mutant seeds with 100% germination, suggesting that RGL2 disappearance is  not a prerequisite for seed germination in the sly1 background. Without GA,  several GA-induced genes show increased accumulation in sly1 seeds compared with  ga1-3. It is possible that the RGL2 repressor of seed germination is inactivated  by after-ripening of sly1 mutant seeds.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048009', 'Steber']
