['29031033', 'Pumilio RNA-binding proteins are largely involved in mRNA degradation and  translation repression. However, a few evolutionarily divergent Pumilios are also  responsible for proper pre-rRNA processing in human and yeast. Here, we describe  an essential Arabidopsis nucleolar Pumilio, APUM24, that is expressed in tissues  undergoing rapid proliferation and cell division. A T-DNA insertion for APUM24  did not affect the male and female gametogenesis, but instead resulted in a  negative female gametophytic effect on zygotic cell division immediately after  fertilization. Additionally, the mutant embryos displayed defects in cell  patterning from pro-embryo through globular stages. The mutant embryos were  marked by altered auxin maxima, which were substantiated by the mislocalization  of PIN1 and PIN7 transporters in the defective embryos. Homozygous apum24 callus  accumulates rRNA processing intermediates, including uridylated and adenylated  5.8S and 25S rRNA precursors. An RNA-protein interaction assay showed that the  histidine-tagged recombinant APUM24 binds RNAin vitro with no apparent  specificity. Overall, our results demonstrated that APUM24 is required for rRNA  processing and early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.', '2017 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13745', 'Choi']
