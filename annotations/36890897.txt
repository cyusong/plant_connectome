<i>Heptacodium miconioides</i> Rehd., commonly known as "seven-son flower," is an ornamental species with a beautiful flower pattern and persistent sepals. Its sepals are of horticultural value, turning bright red and elongating in the autumn; however, the molecular mechanisms that cause sepal color change remain unclear. We analyzed the dynamic changes in anthocyanin composition in the sepal of <i>H. miconioides</i> at four developmental stages (S1-S4). A total of 41 anthocyanins were detected and classified into 7 major anthocyanin aglycones. High levels of the pigments cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, cyanidin-3-O-galactoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside were responsible for sepal reddening. Transcriptome analysis revealed 15 differentially expressed genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis that were detected between 2 developmental stages. Of these, the high expression of <i>HmANS</i> was considered critical structural gene related to anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in the sepal through co-expression analysis with anthocyanin content. In addition, a transcription factor (TF)-metabolite correlation analysis revealed that three HmMYB, two HmbHLH, two HmWRKY, and two HmNAC TFs exhibited a strong positive role in the regulation of the anthocyanin structural genes (Pearson's correlation coefficient > 0.90). Luciferase activity assay showed that HmMYB114, HmbHLH130, HmWRKY6, and HmNAC1 could activate the promoters of <i>HmCHS4</i> and <i>HmDFR1</i> genes <i>in vitro</i>. These findings increase our understanding of anthocyanin metabolism in the sepal of <i>H. miconioides</i> and provide a guide for studies involving sepal color conversion and regulation.
