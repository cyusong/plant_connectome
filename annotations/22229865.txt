The study of native plants growing in hostile environments is useful to understand how these species respond to stress conditions. Parietaria diffusa (M.&K.) is able to survive in highly calcareous soils and extreme environments, such as house walls, without displaying any chlorotic symptoms. Here, we have investigated the existence of Strategy I complementary/alternative mechanism(s) involved in Fe solubilization and uptake and responsible for Parietaria's extraordinary efficiency. After assessing the specific traits involved in a calcicole-behaviour in the field, we have grown plants in conditions of Fe deficiency, either direct (-Fe) or induced by the presence of bicarbonate (+FeBic). Then, the growth performance, physiological and biochemical responses of the plants were investigated. The study shows that in Parietaria+FeBic, the classical responses of Strategy I plants are activated to a lower extent than in -Fe. In addition, there is a greater production of phenolics and organic acids that are both exuded and accumulated in the roots, which in turn show structures similar to 'proteoid-like roots'. We suggest that in the presence of this constraint, Parietaria undergoes some metabolic rearrangements that involve PEP-consuming reactions and an enhancement of the shikimate pathway.
