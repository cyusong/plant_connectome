RAD51 (DNA repair gene) family genes play ubiquitous roles in immune response among species from plants to mammals. In this study, we cloned the <i>ZmRAD51A</i> gene (a member of <i>RAD51</i>) in maize and generated <i>ZmRAD51A</i> overexpression (<i>ZmRAD51A</i>-OE) in rice, tobacco, and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The expression level of <i>ZmRAD51A</i> was remarkably induced by salicylic acid (SA) application in maize, and the transient overexpression of <i>ZmRAD51A</i> in tobacco induced a hypersensitive response. The disease resistance was significantly enhanced in <i>ZmRAD51A</i>- OE (overexpressing) plants, triggering an increased expression of defense-related genes. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that, compared to control lines, <i>ZmRAD51A</i>-OE in rice plants resulted in higher SA levels, and conferred rice plants resistance to <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. Moreover, the <i>ZmRAD51A</i>-OE <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants displayed increased resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 when compared to wild types. Together, our results provide the evidence that, for the first time, the maize DNA repair gene <i>ZmRAD51A</i> plays an important role in in disease resistance.
