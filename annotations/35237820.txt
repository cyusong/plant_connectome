Microbial rhodopsins have advanced optogenetics since the discovery of channelrhodopsins almost two decades ago. During this time an abundance of microbial rhodopsins has been discovered, engineered, and improved for studies in neuroscience and other animal research fields. Optogenetic applications in plant research, however, lagged largely behind. Starting with light-regulated gene expression, optogenetics has slowly expanded into plant research. The recently established all-trans retinal production in plants now enables the use of many microbial opsins, bringing extra opportunities to plant research. In this review, we summarize the recent advances of rhodopsin-based plant optogenetics and provide a perspective for future use, combined with fluorescent sensors to monitor physiological parameters.
