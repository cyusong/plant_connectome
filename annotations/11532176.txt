['11532176', 'GSK3/shaggy-like protein kinases have been shown to play diverse roles in  development and signal transduction pathways in various organisms. An Arabidopsis  homologue of GSK3/shaggy-like kinase, AtGSK1, has been shown to be involved in  NaCl stress responses. In order to further clarify the role of AtGSK1 in NaCl  stress responses in plants, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that  over-expressed AtGSK1 mRNA. These plants showed enhanced resistance to NaCl  stress when assayed either as whole plants or by measurement of root growth on  NaCl plates. In addition, AtGSK1 transgenic plants in the absence of NaCl stress  showed phenotypic changes, such as accumulation of anthocyanin, that were similar  to those observed in wild-type plants under NaCl stress. Transgenic plants  accumulated 30-50% more Na+ than did wild-type plants when subjected to NaCl  stress, and Ca2+ content was increased by 15-30% in the transgenic plants  regardless of the NaCl stress level. Northern blotting revealed that AtGSK1  over-expression induced expression of the NaCl stress-responsive genes AtCP1,  RD29A and CHS1 in the absence of NaCl stress. In addition, AtCBL1 and AtCP1 were  super-induced in the NaCl-stressed transgenic plants. Taken together, these  results suggest that AtGSK1 is involved in the signal transduction pathway(s) of  NaCl stress responses in Arabidopsis.', '2001 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01099.x', 'Hwang']
