The gaseous phytohormone ethylene influences many aspects of plant life, including germination, fruit ripening, senescence, and stress responses. These diverse roles of ethylene occur in part through crosstalk with other phytohormones, which affects ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways. We have recently shown that the phytohormones, including gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, auxin, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid, regulate the stability of ACC synthases (ACSs), the rate-limiting enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis. Here, we report that treatment of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings with strigolactone (SL) increases ethylene biosynthesis. SL does not influence ACS stability or <i>ACS</i> gene expression, but it increases the transcript levels of a subset of ACC oxidase (<i>ACO</i>) genes, thereby enhancing ethylene biosynthesis. Taken together with the results of our previous study, these findings demonstrate that most phytohormones differentially regulate ethylene biosynthesis in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings by affecting ACS stability and/or the transcript levels of ethylene biosynthesis genes.
