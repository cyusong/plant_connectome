['26625868', 'Plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role in modulating plant  responses to environmental stresses. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription  factors are one of the largest transcription factor families that regulate  multiple aspects of plant growth and development, as well as of plant metabolism  in Arabidopsis. Several bHLH transcription factors have been shown to be involved  in the regulation of ABA signaling. We report here the characterization of  bHLH129, a bHLH transcription factor in Arabidopsis. We found that the expression  level of bHLH129 was reduced in response to exogenously applied ABA, and elevated  in the ABA biosynthesis mutant aba1-5. Florescence observation of transgenic  plants expressing bHLH129-GFP showed that bHLH129 was localized in the nucleus,  and transient expression of bHLH129 in protoplasts inhibited reporter gene  expression. When expressed in Arabidopsis under the control of the 35S promoter,  bHLH129 promoted root elongation, and the transgenic plants were less sensitivity  to ABA in root elongation assays. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that ABA  response of several genes involved in ABA signaling, including ABI1, SnRK2.2,  SnRK2.3 and SnRK2.6 were altered in the transgenic plants overexpressing bHLH129.  Taken together, our study suggests that bHLH129 is a transcription repressor that  negatively regulates ABA response in Arabidopsis.', '2015 Dec 2', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep17587', 'Wang']
