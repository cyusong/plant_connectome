['11553739', 'The first committed step in the biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates is the  conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime into an indole-3-S-alkyl-thiohydroximate. The  initial step in this conversion is catalyzed by CYP83B1 in Arabidopsis (S. Bak,  F.E. Tax, K.A. Feldmann, D.A. Galbraith, R. Feyereisen [2001] Plant Cell 13:  101-111). The knockout mutant of the CYP83B1 gene (rnt1-1) shows a strong auxin  excess phenotype and are allelic to sur-2. CYP83A1 is the closest relative to  CYP83B1 and shares 63% amino acid sequence identity. Although expression of  CYP83A1 under control of its endogenous promoter in the rnt1-1 background does  not prevent the auxin excess and indole glucosinolate deficit phenotype caused by  the lack of the CYP83B1 gene, ectopic overexpression of CYP83A1 using a 35S  promoter rescues the rnt1-1 phenotype. CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 heterologously  expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells show marked differences in  their substrate specificity. Both enzymes convert indole-3-acetaldoxime to a  thiohydroximate adduct in the presence of NADPH and a nucleophilic thiol donor.  However, indole-3-acetaldoxime has a 50-fold higher affinity toward CYP83B1 than  toward CYP83A1. Both enzymes also metabolize the phenylalanine- and  tyrosine-derived aldoximes. Enzyme kinetic comparisons of CYP83A1 and CYP83B1  show that indole-3-acetaldoxime is the physiological substrate for CYP83B1 but  not for CYP83A1. Instead, CYP83A1 catalyzes the initial conversion of aldoximes  to thiohydroximates in the synthesis of glucosinolates not derived from  tryptophan. The two closely related CYP83 subfamily members therefore are not  redundant. The presence of putative auxin responsive cis-acting elements in the  CYP83B1 promoter but not in the CYP83A1 promoter supports the suggestion that  CYP83B1 has evolved to selectively metabolize a tryptophan-derived aldoxime  intermediate shared with the pathway of auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.', '2001 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.127.1.108', 'Feyereisen']
