Cadmium-sensitive yeast screening resulted in the isolation of protein translation factor SaeIF1 from the hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii which has both general and special regulatory roles in controlling cadmium accumulation. The hyperaccumulator of Sedum alfredii has the extraordinary ability to hyperaccumulate cadmium (Cd) in shoots. To investigate its underlying molecular mechanisms of Cd hyperaccumulation, a cDNA library was generated from leaf tissues of S. alfredii. SaeIF1, belonging to the eukaryotic protein translation factor SUI1 family, was identified by screening Cd-sensitive yeast transformants with this library. The full-length cDNA of SaeIF1 has 582 bp and encodes a predicted protein with 120 amino acids. Transient expression assays showed subcellular localization of SaeIF1 in the cytoplasm. SaeIF1 was constitutively and highly expressed in roots and shoots of the hyperaccumulator of S. alfredii, while its transcript levels showed over 100-fold higher expression in the hyperaccumulator of S. alfredii relative to the tissues of a nonhyperaccumulating ecotype of S. alfredii. However, the overexpression of SaeIF1 in yeast cells increased Cd accumulation, but conferred more Cd sensitivity. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing SaeIF1 accumulated more Cd in roots and shoots without changes in the ratio of Cd content in shoots and roots, but were more sensitive to Cd stress than wild type. Both special and general roles of SaeIF1 in Cd uptake, transportation, and detoxification are discussed, and might be responsible for the hyperaccumulation characteristics of S. alfredii.
