Efficient root-to-shoot delivery of water and nutrients in plants relies on the correct differentiation of xylem cells into hollow elements. While auxin is integral to the formation of xylem cells, it remains poorly characterized how each subcellular pool of this hormone regulates this process. Combining genetic and cell biological approaches, we investigated the bipartite activity of nucleoplasmic vs plasma membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinases PIP5K1 and its homolog PIP5K2 in Arabidopsis thaliana roots and uncovered a novel mechanism by which phosphoinositides integrate distinct aspects of the auxin signaling cascade and, in turn, regulate the onset of xylem differentiation. The appearance of undifferentiated cells in protoxylem strands of pip5k1 pip5k2 is phenomimicked in auxin transport and perception mutants and can be partially restored by the nuclear residence of PIP5K1. By contrast, exclusion of PIP5K1 from the nucleus hinders the auxin-mediated induction of the xylem master regulator VASCULAR RELATED NAC DOMAIN (VND) 7. A xylem-specific increase of auxin levels abolishes pip5k1 pip5k2 vascular defects, indicating that the establishment of auxin maxima is required to activate VND7-mediated xylem differentiation. Our results describe a new mechanism by which distinct subcellular pools of phosphoinositides integrate auxin transport and perception to initiate xylem differentiation in a spatiotemporal manner.
