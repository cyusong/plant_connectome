['36597715', 'Guard cells control the opening of stomatal pores in the leaf surface, with the  use of a network of protein kinases and phosphatases. Loss of function of the  CBL-interacting protein kinase 23 (CIPK23) was previously shown to decrease the  stomatal conductance, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this response still  need to be clarified. CIPK23 was specifically expressed in Arabidopsis guard  cells, using an estrogen-inducible system. Stomatal movements were linked to  changes in ion channel activity, determined with double-barreled intracellular  electrodes in guard cells and with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique in  Xenopus oocytes. Expression of the phosphomimetic variant CIPK23(T190D) enhanced  stomatal opening, while the natural CIPK23 and a kinase-inactive CIPK23(K60N)  variant did not affect stomatal movements. Overexpression of CIPK23(T190D)  repressed the activity of S-type anion channels, while their steady-state  activity was unchanged by CIPK23 and CIPK23(K60N) . We suggest that CIPK23  enhances the stomatal conductance at favorable growth conditions, via the  regulation of several ion transport proteins in guard cells. The inhibition of  SLAC1-type anion channels is an important facet of this response.', '2023 Apr', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.18708', 'ORCID:']
