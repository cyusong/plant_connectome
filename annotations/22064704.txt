['22064704', 'RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is an important de novo DNA methylation  pathway in plants. RdDM mediates the transcriptional silencing of many endogenous  genomic loci, most of which are transposon related. A forward genetics screen  identified DTF1 (DNA-binding transcription factor 1) as a new component for RdDM  in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutations in DTF1 release the transcriptional  silencing of RdDM target loci and reduce the accumulation of 24-nt small  interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from some of the targets. Interestingly, in the dtf1  mutant plants, the release of transcriptional gene silencing at solo-LTR is  accompanied by decreased siRNA accumulation but not by reduced DNA methylation.  These results suggest that DTF1 is an atypical component of RdDM and has both DNA  methylation-dependent and -independent roles in transcriptional gene silencing.  We suggest that besides DNA methylation, siRNAs may cause some other  uncharacterized epigenetic modifications that lead to transcriptional gene  silencing.', '2011 Dec', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2011.173', 'Zhu']
