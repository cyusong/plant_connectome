<i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> is a devastating potyvirus infecting many economically important brassica crops. In response to this, the plant host engages its RNA silencing machinery, involving AGO proteins, as a prominent strategy to restrain turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection. It has also been shown that the mRNA decay components DCP2 and VCS partake in viral infection suppression. Here, we report that the mRNA decapping components LSM1, PAT1, PATH1, and PATH2 are essential for TuMV infection. More specifically, <i>lsm1a/lsm1b</i> double mutants and <i>pat1/path1/path2</i> triple mutants in <i>summ2</i> background exhibit resistance to TuMV. Concurrently, we observed that TuMV interferes with the decapping function of LSM1 and PAT proteins as the mRNA-decay target genes <i>UGT87A2</i> and <i>ASL9</i> accumulate during TuMV infection. Moreover, as TuMV coat protein can be specifically found in complexes with PAT proteins but not LSM1, this suggests that TuMV "hijacks" decapping components via PAT proteins to support viral infection.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
