['28572457', 'Neutral lipid metabolism is a key aspect of intracellular homeostasis and energy  balance and plays a vital role in cell survival under adverse conditions,  including nutrient deprivation in yeast and mammals, but the role of  triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in plant stress response remains largely  unknown. By thoroughly characterizing mutants defective in SUGAR-DEPENDENT1  (SDP1) triacylglycerol lipase or PEROXISOMAL ABC TRANSPORTER 1 (PXA1), here we  show that TAG is a key intermediate in the mobilization of fatty acids from  membrane lipids for peroxisomal beta-oxidation under prolonged dark treatment.  Disruption of SDP1 increased TAG accumulation in cytosolic lipid droplets and  markedly enhanced plant tolerance to extended darkness. We demonstrate that  blocking TAG hydrolysis enhances plant tolerance to dark treatment via two  distinct mechanisms. In pxa1 mutants, in which free fatty acids accumulated  rapidly under extended darkness, SDP1 disruption resulted in a marked decrease in  levels of cytotoxic lipid intermediates such as free fatty acids and phosphatidic  acid, suggesting a buffer function of TAG accumulation against lipotoxicity under  fatty acid overload. In the wild type, in which free fatty acids remained low and  unchanged under dark treatment, disruption of SDP1 caused a decrease in reactive  oxygen species production and hence the level of lipid peroxidation, indicating a  role of TAG in protection against oxidative damage. Overall, our findings reveal  a crucial role for TAG metabolism in membrane lipid breakdown, fatty acid  turnover, and plant survival under extended darkness.', '2017 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00653', 'ORCID:']
