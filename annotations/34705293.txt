Reproductive success largely defines the fitness of plant species. Understanding how heat and drought affect plant reproduction is thus key to predicting future plant fitness under rising global temperatures. Recent work suggests reproductive tissues are highly vulnerable to water stress in perennial plants where reproductive sacrifice could preserve plant survival. However, most crop species are annuals where such a strategy would theoretically reduce fitness. We examined the reproductive strategy of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum var. Rheinlands Ruhm) to determine whether water supply to fruits is prioritized above vegetative tissues during drought. Using optical methods, we mapped xylem cavitation and tissue shrinkage in vegetative and reproductive organs during dehydration to determine the priority of water flow under acute water stress. Stems and peduncles of tomato showed significantly greater xylem cavitation resistance than leaves. This maintenance of intact water supply enabled tomato fruit to continue to expand during acute water stress, utilizing xylem water made available by tissue collapse and early cavitation of leaves. Here, tomato plants prioritize water supply to reproductive tissues, maintaining fruit development under drought conditions. These results emphasize the critical role of water transport in shaping life history and suggest a broad relevance of hydraulic prioritization in plant ecology.
