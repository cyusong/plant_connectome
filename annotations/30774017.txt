Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen which provokes galls on roots and stems (crown-gall disease) and colonizes them. Two approaches combining omics were used to decipher the lifestyle of A. tumefaciens in plant tumors: an integrative approach when omics were used on A. tumefaciens cells collected from plant tumors, a deconvolution approach when omics were used on A. tumefaciens cells exploiting a single tumor metabolite in pure culture assay. This addendum highlights some recent results on the biotroph lifestyle of A. tumefaciens in plant tumors.
