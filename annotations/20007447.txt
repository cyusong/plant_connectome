['20007447', 'Casein kinase II (CK2) is a protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved  function as a circadian clock component in several organisms, including the  long-day plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The circadian clock component  CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it  influences photoperiodic flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant,  Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under  long-day conditions. Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice  by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis  CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism. Our  findings from overexpressing the dominant-negative CK2 allele in rice support the  independence of CK2 function from the circadian clock. This lack of control of  the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in  OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2  target site in CCA1. However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the  OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for  regulation of the circadian clock. We also demonstrated that the other conserved  CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under  diurnal conditions. These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time  regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution.', '2010 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.148908', 'Izawa']
