['26086094', 'Phosphate (Pi) remobilization in plants is critical to continuous growth and  development. AtATL80 is a plasma membrane (PM)-localized RING E3 ubiquitin (Ub)  ligase that belongs to the Arabidopsis Toxicos en Levadura (ATL) family. AtATL80  was upregulated by long-term low Pi (0-0.02 mM KH2PO4) conditions in Arabidopsis  seedlings. AtATL80-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants  (35S:AtATL80-sGFP) displayed increased phosphorus (P) accumulation in the shoots  and lower biomass, as well as reduced P-utilization efficiency (PUE) under high  Pi (1 mM KH2PO4) conditions compared to wild-type plants. The loss-of-function  atatl80 mutant line exhibited opposite phenotypic traits. The atatl80 mutant line  bolted earlier than wild-type plants, whereas AtATL80-overexpressors bloomed  significantly later and produced lower seed yields than wild-type plants under  high Pi conditions. Thus, AtATL80 is negatively correlated not only with P  content and PUE, but also with biomass and seed yield in Arabidopsis. In  addition, AtATL80-overexpressors were significantly more sensitive to cold stress  than wild-type plants, while the atatl80 mutant line exhibited an increased  tolerance to cold stress. Taken together, our results suggest that AtATL80, a  PM-localized ATL-type RING E3 Ub ligase, participates in the Pi mobilization and  cold stress response as a negative factor in Arabidopsis.', '2015 Aug 7', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.015', 'Kim']
