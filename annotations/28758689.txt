['28758689', 'Circadian rhythms of gene expression are generated by the combinatorial action of  transcriptional and translational feedback loops as well as chromatin remodelling  events. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are natural antisense  transcripts (NATs) to transcripts encoding central oscillator components were  proposed as modulators of core clock function in mammals (Per) and fungi  (frq/qrf). Although oscillating lncRNAs exist in plants, their functional  characterization is at an initial stage. By screening an Arabidopsis thaliana  lncRNA custom-made array we identified CDF5 LONG NONCODING RNA (FLORE), a  circadian-regulated lncRNA that is a NAT of CDF5. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR  confirmed the circadian regulation of FLORE, whereas GUS-staining and flowering  time evaluation were used to determine its biological function. FLORE and CDF5  antiphasic expression reflects mutual inhibition in a similar way to frq/qrf.  Moreover, whereas the CDF5 protein delays flowering by directly repressing FT  transcription, FLORE promotes it by repressing several CDFs (CDF1, CDF3, CDF5)  and increasing FT transcript levels, indicating both cis and trans function. We  propose that the CDF5/FLORE NAT pair constitutes an additional circadian  regulatory module with conserved (mutual inhibition) and unique (function in  trans) features, able to fine-tune its own circadian oscillation, and  consequently, adjust the onset of flowering to favourable environmental  conditions.', '2017 Nov', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.14703', 'Chua']
