Autophagy, an intracellular degradation system conserved in eukaryotes, has been increasingly recognized as a key battlefield in plant-pathogen interactions. However, the role of plant autophagy in nematode parasitism is mostly unknown. We report here the identification of a novel and conserved effector, Nematode Manipulator of Autophagy System 1 (NMAS1), from plant-parasitic cyst nematodes (Heterodera and Globodera spp.). We used molecular and genetic analyses to demonstrate that NMAS1 is required for nematode parasitism. The NMAS1 effectors are potent suppressors of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by flg22 and cell death mediated by immune receptors in Nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting a key role of NMAS1 effectors in nematode virulence. Arabidopsis atg mutants defective in autophagy showed reduced susceptibility to nematode infection. The NMAS1 effectors contain predicted AuTophaGy-related protein 8 (ATG8)-interacting motif (AIM) sequences. In planta protein-protein interaction assays further demonstrated that NMAS1 effectors specifically interact with host plant ATG8 proteins. Interestingly, mutation in AIM2 of GrNMAS1 from the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis abolishes its interaction with potato StATG8 proteins and its activity in ROS suppression. Collectively, our results reveal for the first time that cyst nematodes employ a conserved AIM-containing virulence effector capable of targeting a key component of host autophagy to promote disease.
