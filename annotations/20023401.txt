Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a class of molecular chaperones that play an essential role in preserving cellular functions under stressful conditions. The over production of recombinant proteins often causes cellular stress that results in aggregation/misfolding of proteins, which sometimes leads to the formation of inclusion bodies. Here we report the cloning and characterization of heat-inducible PgHsp70 from Pennisetum glaucum, a heat and drought tolerant plant that showed stability and chaperone activity at elevated temperatures. The predicted amino acid sequence of PgHsp70 revealed a high homology with Hsp70 from other plants, and the overall 3D structure homology modeling is similar to that of the constitutively expressed bovine cytosolic Heat Shock Cognate (HSC)-70. The purified recombinant protein had an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa and displayed optimal chaperone activity at 50 degrees C, and pH 8.0. Under these conditions, the T(1/2) of PgHsp70 increased from 10 to 15 h in the presence of glycerol. The PgHsp70 exhibited a higher chaperone activity towards glutamate dehydrogenase than alcohol dehydrogenase. The expression of recombinant carbonic anhydrase (CA) in E. coli in a catalytically active soluble form rather than in inclusion bodies was made feasible by co-expression of PgHsp70. Circular dichroism (CD) studies of the recombinant PgHsp70 did not reveal any discernible changes in the alpha-helix content, with increase in temperature from 35 to 85 degrees C, thus suggesting a critical role of alpha-helix content in maintaining the chaperone activity.
