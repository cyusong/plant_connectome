['8159788', 'A clone designated A.t.RAB6 encoding a small GTP-binding protein was isolated  from a cDNA library of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissue. The predicted amino acid  sequence was highly homologous to the mammalian and yeast counterparts, H.Rab6  and Ryh1/Ypt6, respectively. Lesser homology was found between the predicted  Arabidopsis protein sequence and two small GTP-binding proteins isolated from  plant species (44% homology to Zea mays Ypt1 and 43% homology to Nicotiana  tabacum Rab5). Conserved stretches in the deduced amino acid sequence of A.t.Rab6  include four regions involved in GTP-binding, an effector region, and C-terminal  cysteine residues required for prenylation and subsequent membrane attachment.  Northern blot analysis demonstrated that A.t.Rab6 mRNA was expressed in root,  leaf, stem, and flower tissues from A. thaliana with the highest levels present  in roots. Escherichia coli produced histidine-tagged A.t.Rab6 protein-bound GTP,  whereas a mutation in one of the guanine nucleotide-binding sites (asparagine122  to isoleucine) rendered it incapable of binding GTP. Functionally, the A.t.RAB6  gene was able to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the YPT6 null  mutant in yeast. The isolation of this gene will aid in the dissection of the  machinery involved in soluble protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network of  plants.', '1994 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.2.591', 'Raikhel']
