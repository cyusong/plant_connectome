Gamma-glutamyl transferase/transpeptidase (GGT, (5-l-glutamyl)-peptide:amino-acid 5-glutamyltransferase; EC 2.3.2.2.) is an ectoenzyme promoting the cleavage of the gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione (GSH) and gamma-glutamyl related compounds. In this work, we describe the localization of GGT by enzymehistochemical and immunohistochemical analysis in maize plants. Our results show that the tissue spatial distribution of GGT activity closely correlates with the localization of the GGT protein. We also demonstrate that GGT activity and protein are unevenly distributed in tissues, being higher in the epidermis and stomata, parenchyma of conductive elements and root meristem. These results can contribute to our understanding of GGT function and regulation as well as its role in glutathione metabolism. To date, these are largely unknown in plants.
