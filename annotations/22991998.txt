Recognition of pathogen effectors by plant immune receptors often leads to the activation of a hypersensitive response (HR), which is a rapid and localized cell death of plant tissue surrounding the site at which recognition occurs. Due to its particular amenability to transient assays for functional genetics, tobacco is a model for immune signaling in the Solanaceae plant family. Here, we show that coexpression of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) immune receptor Ve1 and the corresponding Verticillium effector protein Ave1 leads to HR only in particular tobacco species. Whereas HR is obtained in Nicotiana tabacum, no such response is obtained in N. benthamiana. Furthermore, our analysis revealed an endogenous Ve1 ortholog in Nicotiana glutinosa, as expression of Ave1 in absence of Ve1 induced a HR, and N. glutinosa was found to be resistant against race 1 Verticillium dahliae. We furthermore report the establishment of virus-induced gene silencing in N. tabacum for functional analysis of Ve1 signaling. Collectively, our data show that N. tabacum can be used as a model plant to study Ve1-mediated immune signaling.
