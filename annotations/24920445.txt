['24920445', 'CASPARIAN STRIP MEMBRANE DOMAIN PROTEINS (CASPs) are four-membrane-span proteins  that mediate the deposition of Casparian strips in the endodermis by recruiting  the lignin polymerization machinery. CASPs show high stability in their membrane  domain, which presents all the hallmarks of a membrane scaffold. Here, we  characterized the large family of CASP-like (CASPL) proteins. CASPLs were found  in all major divisions of land plants as well as in green algae; homologs outside  of the plant kingdom were identified as members of the MARVEL protein family.  When ectopically expressed in the endodermis, most CASPLs were able to integrate  the CASP membrane domain, which suggests that CASPLs share with CASPs the  propensity to form transmembrane scaffolds. Extracellular loops are not necessary  for generating the scaffold, since CASP1 was still able to localize correctly  when either one of the extracellular loops was deleted. The CASP first  extracellular loop was found conserved in euphyllophytes but absent in plants  lacking Casparian strips, an observation that may contribute to the study of  Casparian strip and root evolution. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), CASPL  showed specific expression in a variety of cell types, such as trichomes,  abscission zone cells, peripheral root cap cells, and xylem pole pericycle cells.', '2014 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.239137', 'Geldner']
