Here, nodulated lupins (Lupinus angustifolius (cv Wonga)) were hydroponically grown at low phosphate (LP) or adequate phosphate (HP). Routes of pyruvate synthesis were assessed in phosphorus (P)-starved roots and nodules, because P-starvation can enhance metabolism of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) via the nonadenylate-requiring PEP carboxylase (PEPc) route. Since nodules and roots may not experience the same degree of P stress, it was postulated that decreases in metabolic inorganic phosphorus (Pi) of either organ, should favour more pyruvate being synthesized from PEPc-derived malate. Compared with HP roots, the LP roots had a 50% decline in Pi concentrations and 55% higher ADP : ATP ratios. However, LP nodules maintained constant Pi levels and unchanged ADP : ATP ratios, relative to HP nodules. The LP roots had greater PEP metabolism via PEPc and synthesized more pyruvate from PEPc-derived malate. In nodules, P supply did not influence PEPc activities or levels of malate-derived pyruvate. These results indicate that nodules were more efficient than roots in maintaining optimal metabolic Pi and adenylate levels during LP supply. This caused an increase in PEPc-derived pyruvate synthesis in LP roots, but not in LP nodules.

P-starvation: !enhances! PEP metabolism via PEPc 
LP roots: !have greater! PEP metabolism via PEPc 
LP roots: !synthesize more! pyruvate from PEPc-derived malate 
LP nodules: !maintain constant! Pi levels 
LP nodules: !unchanged! ADP : ATP ratios
