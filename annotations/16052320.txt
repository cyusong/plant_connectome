Two hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide systemin (TobHS) precursor proteins known as preproTobHypSys-A and B were recently discovered in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) [Pearce et al. in Nature 411:817-820, 2001]. In this work, the effect of elicitors, insect damage, and abiotic stress on the expression of preproTobHypSys-A ppTobHS-A) in tobacco plants was evaluated. Foliar application of methyl jasmonate preferentially induced the systemic expression of ppTobHS-A in leaves phyllotactically one position above-treated leaves. Abscisic acid strongly induced ppTobHS-A, but water-stress did not. Mechanical wound-induction of ppTobHS-A in young plantlets was rapidly (1 h) and simultaneously detected in wounded and upper unwounded leaves, whereas in older plants induction was slow (12 h) and localized. ppTobHS-A was induced in plants infested with Bemisia tabaci or damaged by herbivory with Manduca sexta larvae. Compared to mechanical wounding, larval herbivory induced a stronger and more stable expression of ppTobHS-A. Moreover, exposure to Manduca-damaged plants induced its expression in neighboring intact plants. In most treatments, the expression patterns of ppTobHS-A coincided with those of selected wound-responsive (WR) genes (e.g., PIOX, NtPI-I, TPI). This correlation was tighter in the wounded and MeJA-treated leaves, whereas in distal, undamaged leaves, it appeared to depend on the type of WR gene examined and on the type of damage sustained by the plant. These results are consistent with the perceived role of the TobHS in defense signaling.
