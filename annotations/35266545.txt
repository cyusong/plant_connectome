During and after the domestication of crops from ancestral wild plants, humans selected cultivars that could change their flowering time in response to seasonal daylength. Continuous selection of this trait eventually allowed the introduction of crops into higher or lower latitudes and different climates from the original regions where domestication initiated. In the past two decades, numerous studies have found the causal genes or alleles that change flowering time and have assisted in adapting crop species such as barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), maize (Zea mays spp. mays), and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) to new environments. This updated review summarizes the genes or alleles that contributed to crop adaptation in different climatic areas. Many of these genes are putative orthologs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) core clock genes. We also discuss how knowledge of the clock's molecular functioning can facilitate molecular breeding in the future.
