In eukaryotes, three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture maintains genome stability and is important in regulating gene transcription. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which diverse ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes regulate the 3D chromatin structure in plants. We examined the 3D chromatin structure within the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF, ISWI, INO80, and CHD remodeling complexes in wild-type (WT) and mutant Arabidopsis thaliana plants by combining high-throughput sequencing with in situ Hi-C, the enrichment of histone marks, nucleosome density, and gene expression. We found that compartment regions switched and compartmental strength was significantly weakened in all four enzyme mutants. Chromatin remodeling complexes differentially regulated the nucleosome distribution pattern and density within the switching compartments. Alterations of nucleosome distribution pattern and density were associated with a reduction in H3K27me3 levels in the chromatin remodeling enzyme mutants and led to compartment switching. Our data show that chromatin remodeling complexes regulate the linear nucleosome distribution pattern and density to promote H3K27me3 deposition, which in turn regulates 3D chromatin structure.

ATPase subunit: !regulates! 3D chromatin structure
SWI/SNF: !regulates! nucleosome distribution pattern
INO80: !regulates! nucleosome density
CHD: !regulates! H3K27me3 levels
H3K27me3: !promotes! compartment switching
