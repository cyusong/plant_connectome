Silene latifolia is a dioecious plant in which sex is determined by X and Y chromosomes. Expression of the B-function gene SLM2, an ortholog of PISTILLATA (PI) in Arabidopsis, was examined by in situ hybridization. SLM2 was not expressed in suppressed stamens of female flowers, but was expressed in developing stamens of smut-infected female flowers. These results indicate that the control of SLM2 is independent of the presence of the Y chromosome. Smut-infected females provide a useful system for clarifying the relationship between the B-function gene and the sex determination factor.

SLM2: !expressed in! developing stamens of smut-infected female flowers
X chromosome: !determines! sex
Y chromosome: !determines! sex
SLM2: !control independent of! Y chromosome
