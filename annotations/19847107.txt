Plants have the ability to adjust its physiology and metabolism to the changes of nutrient availability in the environment. Since a number of common responses are regulated by sugar and auxin, the obvious question arises is whether sugar and auxin act interdependently to bring about changes in plant morphology. In the February issue of the PLoS ONE, we presented detailed investigation of glucose and auxin signaling interaction in controlling root growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Further analysis of tissue specific regulation of glucose auxin signaling interaction may provide some insight as to how these two signaling molecules interact to control the morphogenic changes during seedling development.
