Teosinte branched1/Cincinnata/proliferating cell factor (TCP) transcription factors play important roles in plant growth and defense. However, the molecular mechanisms of TCPs participating in plant defense remain unclear. Here, we characterized a cotton TCP4-like fine-tuned by miR319b, which could interact with NON-EXPRESSER OF PATHOGEN-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) to directly activate <i>isochorismate synthase 1</i> (<i>ICS1</i>) expression, facilitating plant resistance against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. mRNA degradome data and GUS-fused assay showed that <i>GhTCP4-like</i> mRNA was directedly cleaved by ghr-miR319b. Knockdown of ghr-miR319b increased plant resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i>, whereas silencing <i>GhTCP4-like</i> increased plant susceptibility by the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) method, suggesting that <i>GhTCP4-like</i> is a positive regulator of plant defense. According to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and GUS reporter analysis, GhTCP4-like could transcriptionally activate <i>GhICS1</i> expression, resulting in increased salicylic acid (SA) accumulation. Yeast two-hybrid and luciferase complementation image analyses demonstrated that <i>GhTCP4-like</i> interacts with <i>GhNPR1</i>, which can promote <i>GhTCP4-like</i> transcriptional activation in <i>GhICS1</i> expression according to the GUS reporter assay. Together, these results revealed that GhTCP4-like interacts with GhNPR1 to promote <i>GhICS1</i> expression through fine-tuning of ghr-miR319b, leading to SA accumulation, which is percepted by NPR1 to increase plant defense against <i>V. dahliae</i>. Therefore, GhTCP4-like participates in a positive feedback regulation loop of SA biosynthesis via NPR1, increasing plant defenses against fungal infection.
