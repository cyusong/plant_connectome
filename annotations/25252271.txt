During community assembly, early arriving exotic species might suppress other species to a greater extent than do native species. Because most exotics were intentionally introduced, we hypothesize there was human selection on regeneration traits during introduction. This could have occurred at the across- or within-species level (e.g. during cultivar development). We tested these predictions by seeding a single species that was either native, exotic 'wild-type' (from their native range), or exotic 'cultivated' using 28 grassland species in a glasshouse experiment. Priority effects were assessed by measuring species' effect on establishment of species from a seed mix added 21 d later. Exotic species had higher germination and earlier emergence dates than native species, and differences were found in both 'wild' and 'cultivated' exotics. Exotic species reduced biomass and species diversity of later arriving species much more than native species, regardless of seed source. Results indicate that in situations in which priority effects are likely to be strong, effects will be greater when an exotic species arrives first than when a native species arrives first; and this difference is not merely a result of exotic species cultivation, but might be a general native-exotic difference that deserves further study.

exotic species: !suppresses! native species
exotic species: !germinates earlier! native species
exotic species: !reduces biomass! later arriving species
exotic species: !reduces diversity! later arriving species
