['25775508', 'The chloroplast ATP synthase, a multisubunit complex in the thylakoid membrane,  catalyzes the light-driven synthesis of ATP, thereby supplying the energy for  carbon fixation during photosynthesis. The chloroplast ATP synthase is composed  of both nucleus- and chloroplast-encoded proteins that have required the  evolution of novel mechanisms to coordinate the biosynthesis and assembly of  chloroplast ATP synthase subunits temporally and spatially. Here we have  elucidated the assembly mechanism of the alpha3beta3gamma core complex of the chloroplast  ATP synthase by identification and functional characterization of a key assembly  factor, PAB (protein in chloroplast atpase biogenesis). PAB directly interacts  with the nucleus-encoded gamma subunit and functions downstream of chaperonin 60  (Cpn60)-mediated CF1gamma subunit folding to promote its assembly into the catalytic  core. PAB does not have any recognizable motifs or domains but is conserved in  photosynthetic eukaryotes. It is likely that PAB evolved together with the  transfer of chloroplast genes into the nucleus to assist nucleus-encoded CF1gamma  assembly into the CF1 core. Such coordination might represent an evolutionarily  conserved mechanism for folding and assembly of nucleus-encoded proteins to  ensure proper assembly of multiprotein photosynthetic complexes.', '2015 Mar 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1413392111', 'Zhang']
