['24415770', 'The Mediator16 (MED16; formerly termed SENSITIVE TO FREEZING6 [SFR6]) subunit of  the plant Mediator transcriptional coactivator complex regulates cold-responsive  gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, acting downstream of the C-repeat  binding factor (CBF) transcription factors to recruit the core Mediator complex  to cold-regulated genes. Here, we use loss-of-function mutants to show that RNA  polymerase II recruitment to CBF-responsive cold-regulated genes requires MED16,  MED2, and MED14 subunits. Transcription of genes known to be regulated via CBFs  binding to the C-repeat motif/drought-responsive element promoter motif requires  all three Mediator subunits, as does cold acclimation-induced freezing tolerance.  In addition, these three subunits are required for low temperature-induced  expression of some other, but not all, cold-responsive genes, including genes  that are not known targets of CBFs. Genes inducible by darkness also required  MED16 but required a different combination of Mediator subunits for their  expression than the genes induced by cold. Together, our data illustrate that  plants control transcription of specific genes through the action of subsets of  Mediator subunits; the specific combination defined by the nature of the stimulus  but also by the identity of the gene induced.', '2014 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.117796', 'Knight']
