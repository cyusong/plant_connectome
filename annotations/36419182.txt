Positive selection is the driving force underpinning local adaptation and leaves footprints of selective sweeps on the underlying major genes. Quantifying the timing of selection and revealing the genetic bases of adaptation in plant species occurring in steep and varying environmental gradients are crucial to predict a species' ability to colonize new niches. We use whole-genome sequence data from six populations across three different habitats of the wild tomato species Solanum chilense to infer the past demographic history and search for genes under strong positive selection. We then correlate current and past climatic projections with the demographic history, allele frequencies, the age of selection events and distribution shifts. Several selective sweeps occur at regulatory networks involved in root-hair development in low altitude and response to photoperiod and vernalization in high-altitude populations. These sweeps appear to occur in a concerted fashion in a given regulatory gene network at particular periods of substantial climatic change. Using a unique combination of genome scans and modelling of past climatic data, we quantify the timing of selection at genes likely underpinning local adaptation to semiarid habitats.
