Biologists have long debated the drivers of the genome size evolution and variation ever since Darwin. Assumptions for the adaptive or maladaptive consequences of the associations between genome sizes and environmental factors have been proposed, but the significance of these hypotheses remains controversial. <i>Eragrostis</i> is a large genus in the grass family and is often used as crop or forage during the dry seasons. The wide range and complex ploidy levels make <i>Eragrostis</i> an excellent model for investigating how the genome size variation and evolution is associated with environmental factors and how these changes can ben interpreted. We reconstructed the <i>Eragrostis</i> phylogeny and estimated genome sizes through flow cytometric analyses. Phylogenetic comparative analyses were performed to explore how genome size variation and evolution is related to their climatic niches and geographical ranges. The genome size evolution and environmental factors were examined using different models to study the phylogenetic signal, mode and tempo throughout evolutionary history. Our results support the monophyly of <i>Eragrostis</i>. The genome sizes in <i>Eragrostis</i> ranged from ~0.66 pg to ~3.80 pg. We found that a moderate phylogenetic conservatism existed in terms of the genome sizes but was absent from environmental factors. In addition, phylogeny-based associations revealed close correlations between genome sizes and precipitation-related variables, indicating that the genome size variation mainly caused by polyploidization may have evolved as an adaptation to various environments in the genus <i>Eragrostis</i>. This is the first study to take a global perspective on the genome size variation and evolution in the genus <i>Eragrostis</i>. Our results suggest that the adaptation and conservatism are manifested in the genome size variation, allowing the arid species of <i>Eragrostis</i> to spread the xeric area throughout the world.
