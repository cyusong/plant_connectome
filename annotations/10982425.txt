['10982425', 'The discovery of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway for the  biosynthesis of isoprenoids raises the important question of the nature and  regulation of the enzymes involved in this pathway. CLA1, a gene previously  isolated from Arabidopsis, encodes the first enzyme of the  2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate  synthase. We demonstrate this enzyme activity by complementation of the cla1-1  mutant phenotype and by direct enzymatic assays. Based on mRNA and protein  expression patterns this enzyme is expressed mainly in developing photosynthetic  and non-photosynthetic tissues. The beta-glucuronidase expression pattern driven  from the CLA1 gene regulatory region supports the northern and protein data while  also showing that this gene has some level of expression in most tissues of the  plant. A mutation in the CLA1 gene interferes with the normal development of  chloroplasts and etioplasts, but does not seem to affect amyloplast structure.  Microscopic analysis also shows a pleiotropic effect of the CLA1 gene mutation in  mesophyll tissue formation.', '2000 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.124.1.95', 'Leon']
