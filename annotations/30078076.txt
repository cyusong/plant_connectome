Photosynthetic production of isoprenoids in cyanobacteria is considered in terms of metabolic engineering and biological importance. Metabolic engineering of photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria) has been performed to construct bio-solar cell factories that convert carbon dioxide to various value-added chemicals. Isoprenoids, which are found in nature and range from essential cell components to defensive molecules, have great value in cosmetics, pharmaceutics, and biofuels. In this review, we summarize the recent engineering of cyanobacteria for photosynthetic isoprenoids production as well as carbon molar basis comparisons with heterotrophic isoprenoids production in engineered Escherichia coli.
