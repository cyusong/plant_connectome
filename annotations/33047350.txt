Plants growing at high densities interact via a multitude of pathways. Here, we provide an overview of mechanisms and functional consequences of plant architectural responses initiated by light cues that occur in dense vegetation. We will review the current state of knowledge about shade avoidance, as well as its possible applications. On an individual level, plants perceive neighbour-associated changes in light quality and quantity mainly with phytochromes for red and far-red light and cryptochromes and phototropins for blue light. Downstream of these photoreceptors, elaborate signalling and integration takes place with the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS, several hormones and other regulators. This signalling leads to the shade avoidance responses, consisting of hyponasty, stem and petiole elongation, apical dominance and life cycle adjustments. Architectural changes of the individual plant have consequences for the plant community, affecting canopy structure, species composition and population fitness. In this context, we highlight the ecological, evolutionary and agricultural importance of shade avoidance.
