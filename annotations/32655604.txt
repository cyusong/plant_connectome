BTB-TAZ (BT)-domain proteins regulate plant development and pathogen defense. However, their roles in resistance to abiotic stresses remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that the sweetpotato BT protein-encoding gene <i>IbBT4</i> significantly enhanced the drought tolerance of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. <i>IbBT4</i> expression was induced by PEG6000, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and brassinosteroids (BRs). The <i>IbBT4</i>-overexpressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seeds presented higher germination rates and longer roots in comparison with those of WT under 200 mM mannitol stress. Under drought stress the transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants exhibited significantly increased survival rates and BR and proline contents and decreased water loss rates, MDA content and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. <i>IbBT4</i> overexpression upregulated the BR signaling pathway and proline biosynthesis genes and activated the ROS-scavenging system under drought stress. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed that the IbBT4 protein interacts with BR-ENHANCED EXPRESSION 2 (BEE2). Taken together, these results indicate that the <i>IbBT4</i> gene provides drought tolerance by enhancing both the BR signaling pathway and proline biosynthesis and further activating the ROS-scavenging system in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
