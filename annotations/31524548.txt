Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are highly hydrophilic and thermostable proteins that could be induced by abiotic stresses in plants. Previously, we have isolated a group 3 LEA gene <i>WZY3-1</i> (GenBank: KX090360.1) in wheat. In this study, the recombinant plasmid with <i>WZY3-1</i> was transformed into <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21 for protein expression. Furthermore, we transformed WZY3-1 into <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Overexpression of WZY3-1 in <i>E.coli</i> enhanced their tolerance to mannitol and NaCl. WZY3-1 protein could protect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) under freeze and heat stress. Overexpression of WZY3-1 showed that WZY3-1 could help to improve the drought tolerance of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. In summary, our works show that WZY3-1 plays an important role in abiotic stress resistance in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.
