Cotton is a key global fiber crop. However, yield potential is limited by the presence of endemic and introduced pests and diseases. The introduction of host plant resistance (HPR), defined as the purposeful use of resistant crop cultivars to reduce the impact of pests and diseases, has been a key breeding target for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) cotton breeding program. The program has seen success in releasing cultivars resistant to Bacterial blight, Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, and Cotton bunchy top. However, emerging biotic threats such as Black root rot and secondary pests, are becoming more frequent in Australian cotton production systems. The uptake of tools and breeding methods, such as genomic selection, high throughput phenomics, gene editing, and landscape genomics, paired with the continued utilization of sources of resistance from <i>Gossypium</i> germplasm, will be critical for the future of cotton breeding. This review celebrates the success of HPR breeding activities in the CSIRO cotton breeding program and maps a pathway for the future in developing resistant cultivars.
