The scope of RNA-aptamers application is becoming wider and has expanded beyond solely medical use. We propose the use of RNA-aptamers in plants to suppress the functions of individual proteins, thereby achieving resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. In current work we experimentally demonstrate the possibility of inhibiting protein activity in N. bentamiana plants by quenching the fluorescence level of GFP (green fluorescent protein) as a result of specifically selected RNA-aptamer binding action.
