Anthocyanin is one of the flavonoids, which has strong antioxidant properties. Functional rice rich in anthocyanins can not only improve immunity, but also anti-radiation, beauty, anti-aging effect, very popular in the market. In this study, we used Zibaoxiangnuo 1 (ZBXN 1), a functional rice variety which is rich in total flavonoids and anthocyanins, as the experimental material to construct Recombination Inbred Lines (RILs) with Minghui63 (MH63), a variety without anthocyanins. The contents of anthocyanins and total flavonoids of RILs and two parents were determined for three consecutive generations. The average anthocyanin content of parent ZBXN 1 was 319.31 mg/kg, and the anthocyanin inheritance of RIL population was relatively stable, with 10 samples higher than ZBXN 1. In addition, there was no significant difference in the total flavonoids content between the two parents, the total flavonoids content of Z25 in RIL population was 0.33%. Based on these studies, we believe that ZBXN 1 has abundant and stable anthocyanins, which can be used as an intermediate breeding material for breeding high-quality varieties with high anthocyanins, and lay a foundation for breeding more anthocyanin-rich rice varieties.
