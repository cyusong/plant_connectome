<i>RB</i> is a potato gene that provides resistance to a broad spectrum of genotypes of the late blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. <i>RB</i> belongs to the CC-NB-LRR (coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) class of resistance (<i>R</i>) genes, a major component of the plant immune system. The RB protein detects the presence of class I and II IPI-O effectors from <i>P. infestans</i> to initiate a hypersensitive resistance response, but this activity is suppressed in the presence of the Class III effector IPI-O4. Using natural genetic variation of RB within potato wild relatives, we identified two amino acids in the CC domain that alter interactions needed for suppression of resistance by IPI-O4. We have found that separate modification of these amino acids in RB can diminish or expand the resistance capability of this protein against <i>P. infestans</i> in both <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and potato. Our results demonstrate that increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that determine resistance activation and R protein suppression by effectors can be utilized to tailor-engineer genes with the potential to provide increased durability.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
