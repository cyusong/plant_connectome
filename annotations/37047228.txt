Heat stress caused by rapidly changing climate warming has become a serious threat to crop growth worldwide. Exogenous cytokinin (CK) kinetin (KT) has been shown to have positive effects in improving salt and drought tolerance in plants. However, the mechanism of KT in heat tolerance in rice is poorly understood. Here, we found that exogenously adequate application of KT improved the heat stress tolerance of rice seedlings, with the best effect observed when the application concentration was 10<sup>-9</sup> M. In addition, exogenous application of 10<sup>-9</sup> M KT promoted the expression of CK-responsive <i>OsRR</i> genes, reduced membrane damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in rice, and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Meanwhile, exogenous 10<sup>-9</sup> M KT treatment significantly enhanced the expression of antioxidant enzymes, heat activation, and defense-related genes. In conclusion, exogenous KT treatment regulates heat tolerance in rice seedlings by modulating the dynamic balance of ROS in plants under heat stress.
