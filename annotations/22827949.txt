['22827949', 'The ubiquitination pathway is involved in a variety of cellular processes in  plant growth, development, and immune responses. However, the function of this  pathway in connecting plant development and innate immunity is still largely  unknown. Recently, we characterized the U-box/ARM E3 ubiquitin ligase PUB13,  which regulates both immune responses and flowering time in Arabidopsis. Here, we  show that the rice Spl11 gene can complement the cell death and flowering  functions of PUB13 in the pub13 mutant. In addition, HFR1, which functions mainly  in photomorphogenesis, was identified as one of the PUB13-interacting proteins  through yeast two-hybrid screening and pull-down assays. Because the flowering  phenotype of pub13 depends on photoperiod, we propose that PUB13 may regulate  HFR1 to fine-tune photomorphogenesis and flowering time in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Aug', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.20703', 'Wang']
