['29505832', 'Unveiling the signal transduction of phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) and its  regulatory mechanisms is critical for developing the strategies toward improving  plant responses to stressful environments. ABA signaling is perceived and  mediated by multiple PYR/PYL receptors, whose post-translational modifications,  especially phosphorylation, remain largely unknown. In this study, we  demonstrate that Arabidopsis EL1-like (AEL) protein, a casein kinase that  regulates various physiological processes, phosphorylate PYR/PYLs to promote  their ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in suppressed ABA responses.  Arabidopsis ael triple mutants display hypersensitive responses to ABA treatment,  which is consistent with the suppressed degradation of PYR/PYL proteins. PYR/PYLs  are phosphorylated in vivo and mutation of the conserved AEL phosphorylation  sites results in reduced phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of  PYR/PYLs, and hence enhanced ABA responses. Taken together, these results  demonstrate that AEL-mediated phosphorylation plays crucial roles in regulating  the stability and function of PYR/PYLs, providing significant insights into the  post-translational regulation of PYR/PYL receptors and ABA signaling.', '2018 May 7', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2018.02.012', 'Xue']
