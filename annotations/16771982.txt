Here, a conceptual model is presented for the development of Phytophthora disease in pedunculate oak. The model is presented using the causal loop diagram tool and gives an overview of how various abiotic and biotic factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability and mycorrhizal colonization, may affect the reproduction and the infective capacity of soil-borne Phytophthora species, the susceptibility of the host and subsequent disease development. It is suggested that the link between the root damage caused by Phytophthora species and overall tree vitality is in the assimilation and allocation of carbon within the plants. The potential impact of environmental factors on these processes is discussed. The model is presented with reference to scenarios related to variation in soil moisture and nutrient availability. The need for species-specific validation of the model and the implications of the model are discussed.

Soil moisture: !affects! Phytophthora reproduction
Nutrient availability: !affects! Phytophthora infective capacity
Mycorrhizal colonization: !affects! Phytophthora reproduction
Root damage: !affects! Tree vitality
Environmental factors: !affects! Carbon assimilation/allocation
Variation in soil moisture: !affects! Model scenarios
