Long-term goals to impact or modify fruit quality and yield have been the target of researchers for many years. Different approaches such as traditional breeding,mutation breeding, and transgenic approaches have revealed a regulatory network where several hormones concur in a complex way to regulate fruit set and development,and these networks are shared in some way among species with different kinds of fruits. Understanding the molecular and biochemical networks of fruit set and development could be very useful for breeders to meet the current and future challenges of agricultural problems.

Hormones: !regulate! Fruit set and development
Traditional breeding: !reveals! Regulatory network
Mutation breeding: !reveals! Regulatory network
Transgenic approaches: !reveals! Regulatory network
Fruit set and development: !shared among! Species
Molecular and biochemical networks: !understand! Fruit set and development
