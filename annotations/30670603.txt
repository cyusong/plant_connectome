Diel starch turnover responds rapidly to changes in the light regime. We investigated if these responses require changes in the temporal dynamics of the circadian clock. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was grown in a 12-h photoperiod for 19 d, shifted to three different reduced light levels or to low CO<sub>2</sub> for one light period, and returned to growth conditions. The treatments produced widespread changes in clock transcript abundance. However, almost all of the changes were restricted to extreme treatments that led to carbon starvation and were small compared to the magnitude of the circadian oscillation. Changes included repression of <i>EARLY FLOWERNG 4</i>, slower decay of dusk components, and a slight phase delay at the next dawn, possibly due to abrogated Evening Complex function and sustained expression of <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs</i> and <i>REVEILLEs</i> during the night. Mobilization of starch in the night occurred in a linear manner and was paced to dawn, both in moderate treatments that did not alter clock transcripts and in extreme treatments that led to severe carbon starvation. We conclude that pacing of starch mobilization to dawn does not require retrograde carbon signaling to the transcriptional clock. On the following day, growth decreased, sugars rose, and starch accumulation was stimulated in low-light-treated plants compared to controls. This adaptive response was marked after moderate treatments and occurred independently of changes in the transcriptional clock. It is probably a time-delayed response to low-C signaling in the preceding 24-h cycle, possibly including changes in <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR</i> and <i>REVEILLE</i> expression.
