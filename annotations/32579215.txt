Many polypetalous plants have a constriction at the base of the petal that leaves a small gap that can provide entry into the young flower bud before the reproductive organs are fully developed. In cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), this gap is occluded by tufts of short unicellular trichomes superficially resembling the fibers found on cotton seeds. We are just beginning to understand the developmental regulation of the seed fibers and have previously characterized several MIXTA-like MYB transcription factors (TFs) that are critical for correct seed fiber development but know little about the molecular regulation of other types of cotton trichomes. Here, using RNAi or dominant suppression transgenic cotton lines and natural fiber mutants, we investigated the development and regulation of the petal base trichomes. Petal base trichomes and seed trichomes were also examined across several different species within and outside of the Malvoideae. We found that the petal base trichomes are regulated by the same MYB TFs as cotton seed fibers and, since they are more widely distributed across different taxa than the seed fibers, could have preceded them in the evolution of these important textile fibers produced by some cotton species.
