Nitrate transporter 2 (NRT2) and NRT3 or nitrate-assimilation-related 2 (NAR2) proteins families form a two-component, high-affinity nitrate transport system, which is essential for the acquisition of nitrate from soils with low N availability. An extensive phylogenomic analysis across land plants for these families has not been performed. In this study, we performed a microsynteny and orthology analysis on the NRT2 and NRT3 genes families across 132 plants (<i>Sensu lato</i>) to decipher their evolutionary history. We identified significant differences in the number of sequences per taxonomic group and different genomic contexts within the NRT2 family that might have contributed to N acquisition by the plants. We hypothesized that the greater losses of NRT2 sequences correlate with specialized ecological adaptations, such as aquatic, epiphytic, and carnivory lifestyles. We also detected expansion on the NRT2 family in specific lineages that could be a source of key innovations for colonizing contrasting niches in N availability. Microsyntenic analysis on NRT3 family showed a deep conservation on land plants, suggesting a high evolutionary constraint to preserve their function. Our study provides novel information that could be used as guide for functional characterization of these gene families across plant lineages.
