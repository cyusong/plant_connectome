['12445118', 'Jasmonates (JAs) regulate Arabidopsis thaliana wound and defence responses,  pollen development, and stress-related growth inhibition. Significantly, each of  these responses requires COI1, an F-box protein. Other F-box proteins interact  with SKP1 and cullin proteins to form SCF complexes that selectively recruit  regulatory proteins targeted for ubiquitination. To determine whether COI1 also  functions in an SCF complex, we have characterized Arabidopsis proteins that bind  to COI1. An Arabidopsis cDNA expression library was screened in yeast for clones  that produce proteins which can bind to COI1. We recovered two SKP1 homologues  and a histone deacetylase. The Arabidopsis F-box protein TIR1 interacted with  SKP1 proteins, but not with the histone deacetylase. Mutant COI1 proteins  revealed that the F-box is required for interaction with SKP1s, but that  sequences in leucine-rich repeat domains are required for interaction with the  histone deacetylase. Epitope-tagged COI1 was introduced into Arabidopsis plants  and cell cultures. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction  in planta of COI1 with SKP1-like proteins and histone deacetylase, and also  indicated that COI1 interacted with cullin. These results suggest that COI1 forms  an SCFCOI1 complex in vivo. COI1 is therefore expected to form a functional  E3-type ubiquitin ligase in plants and to regulate expression of jasmonate  responsive genes, possibly by targeted ubiquitination of a histone deacetylase.', '2002 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01432.x', 'Turner']
