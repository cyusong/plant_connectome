Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule in plant physiology. However, its production in photosynthetic organisms remains partially unresolved. The best characterized NO production route involves the reduction of nitrite to NO via different non-enzymatic or enzymatic mechanisms. Nitrate reductases (NRs), the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and the new complex between NR and NOFNiR (nitric oxide-forming nitrite reductase) described in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are the main enzymatic systems that perform this reductive NO production in plants. Apart from this reductive route, several reports acknowledge the possible existence of an oxidative NO production in an arginine-dependent pathway, similar to the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity present in animals. However, no NOS homologs have been found in the genome of embryophytes and, despite an increasing amount of evidence attesting to the existence of NOS-like activity in plants, the involved proteins remain to be identified. Here we review NO production in plants with emphasis on the presentation and discussion of recent data obtained in this field.
