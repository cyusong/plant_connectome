['28062751', 'Posttranscriptional methylation of RNA cytosine residues to 5-methylcytosine  (m(5)C) is an important modification with diverse roles, such as regulating  stress responses, stem cell proliferation, and RNA metabolism. Here, we used RNA  bisulfite sequencing for transcriptome-wide quantitative mapping of m(5)C in the  model plant Arabidopsis thaliana We discovered more than a thousand m(5)C sites  in Arabidopsis mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and other noncoding RNAs across three  tissue types (siliques, seedling shoots, and roots) and validated a number of  these sites. Quantitative differences in methylated sites between these three  tissues suggest tissue-specific regulation of m(5)C. Perturbing the RNA m(5)C  methyltransferase TRM4B resulted in the loss of m(5)C sites on mRNAs and  noncoding RNAs and reduced the stability of tRNA(Asp(GTC)) We also demonstrate  the importance of m(5)C in plant development, as trm4b mutants have shorter  primary roots than the wild type due to reduced cell division in the root apical  meristem. In addition, trm4b mutants show increased sensitivity to oxidative  stress. Finally, we provide insights into the targeting mechanism of TRM4B by  demonstrating that a 50-nucleotide sequence flanking m(5)C C3349 in MAIGO5 mRNA  is sufficient to confer methylation of a transgene reporter in Nicotiana  benthamiana.', '2017 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00751', 'ORCID:']
