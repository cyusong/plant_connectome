A wilty mutant (scabrous diminutive, sd) of Capsicum annuum L. hyperaccumulates Na+ in all tissues and has a lower K+ content in the roots. This has been shown to be due to a greater efflux of (86)Rb+ (K+) and influx of (22)Na+ in the mutant. In this study, the transporters responsible for these fluxes were investigated by applying patch clamp techniques to protoplasts derived from root cortical cells. Inwardly rectifying K+ currents were comparable in the two genotypes, but a characteristically bigger outward K+ current was observed in protoplasts from mutant roots, correlating with a bigger efflux of (86)Rb+ from mutant plants. Whole-cell currents due to the movement of Na+ have also been studied in both genotypes. The magnitude of the time-independent inward currents that conduct Na+ at hyperpolarizing voltages were comparable in both genotypes. However, microelectrode measurements of membrane potentials in cortical cells of roots in high Na+ conditions revealed that the membrane potentials of the root cells in the mutants were approximately 60 mV more negative than in wild-type root cells. Quantitatively, this hyperpolarization is calculated to be sufficient to account for the increased Na+ influx in the mutants.
