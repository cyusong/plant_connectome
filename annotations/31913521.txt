The wheat group offers an outstanding system to address the interplay between hybridization, chromosomal evolution and biological diversification. Most diploid wild wheats originated following hybridization between the A-genome lineage and the B-genome lineage some 4 Myr ago, resulting in an admixed D-genome lineage that presented dramatic radiation accompanied by considerable changes in genome size and chromosomal rearrangements. Comparative profiling of low-copy genes, repeated sequences and transposable elements among those divergent species characterized by different karyotypes highlights high genome dynamics and sheds new light on the processes underlying chromosomal evolution in wild wheats. One of the hybrid clades presents upsizing of metacentric chromosomes going along with the proliferation of specific repeats (i.e. 'genomic obesity'), whereas other species show stable genome size associated with increasing chromosomal asymmetry. Genetic and ecological variation in those specialized species suggest that genome restructuring was coupled with adaptive processes to support the evolution of a majority of acrocentric chromosomes. This synthesis of current knowledge on genome restructuring across the diversity of wild wheats paves the way towards surveys based on latest sequencing technologies to characterize valuable resources and address the significance of chromosomal evolution in species with complex genomes.
