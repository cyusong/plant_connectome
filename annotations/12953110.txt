['12953110', 'To investigate UV light response mechanisms in higher plants, we isolated a UV  light-sensitive mutant, rev3-1, in Arabidopsis. The root growth of rev3-1 was  inhibited after UV-B irradiation under both light and dark conditions. We found  that chromosome 1 of rev3-1 was broken at a minimum of three points, causing  chromosome inversion and translocation. A gene disrupted by this rearrangement  encoded the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta (AtREV3), which is thought  to be involved in translesion synthesis. The rev3-1 seedlings also were sensitive  to gamma-rays and mitomycin C, which are known to inhibit DNA replication.  Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine after UV-B irradiation was less in rev3-1 than  in the wild type. These results indicate that UV light-damaged DNA interrupted  DNA replication in the rev3-1 mutant, leading to the inhibition of cell division  and root elongation.', '2003 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.012369', 'Tanaka']
