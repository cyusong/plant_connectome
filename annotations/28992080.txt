Our current understanding of how plants move auxin through their tissues is largely built on the use of polar auxin transporter inhibitors. Although the most important proteins that mediate auxin transport and its regulation have probably all been identified and the mapping of their interactions is well underway, mechanistically we are still surprisingly far away from understanding how auxin is transported. Such an understanding will only emerge after new data are placed in the context of the wealth of physiological data on which they are founded. This review will look back over the use of a key inhibitor called naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and outline its contribution to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of polar auxin transport, before proceeding to speculate on how its use is likely still to be informative.
