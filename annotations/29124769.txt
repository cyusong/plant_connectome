Introgression can be an important source of adaptive phenotypes, although conversely it can have deleterious effects. Evidence for adaptive introgression is accumulating but information on the genetic architecture of introgressed traits lags behind. Here we determine trait architecture in Populus trichocarpa under introgression from P.막alsamifera using admixture mapping and phenotypic analyses. Our results reveal that admixture is a key driver of clinal adaptation and suggest that the northern range extension of P.맚richocarpa depends, at least in part, on introgression from P.막alsamifera. However, admixture with P.막alsamifera can lead to potentially maladaptive early phenology, and a reduction in growth and disease resistance in P.맚richocarpa. Strikingly, an introgressed chromosome 9 haplotype block from P.막alsamifera restores the late phenology and high growth parental phenotype in admixed P.맚richocarpa. This epistatic restorer block may be strongly advantageous in maximizing carbon assimilation and disease resistance in the southernmost populations where admixture has been detected. We also confirm a previously demonstrated case of adaptive introgression in chromosome 15 and show that introgression generates a transgressive chlorophyll-content phenotype. We provide strong support that introgression provides a reservoir of genetic variation associated with adaptive characters that allows improved survival in new environments.
