Removal of pyrophosphate from dihydroneopterin triphosphate (DHNTP) is the second step in the pterin branch of the folate synthesis pathway. There has been controversy over whether this reaction requires a specific pyrophosphohydrolase or is a metal ion-dependent chemical process. The genome of Lactococcus lactis has a multicistronic folate synthesis operon that includes an open reading frame (ylgG) specifying a putative Nudix hydrolase. Because many Nudix enzymes are pyrophosphohydrolases, YlgG was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. The recombinant protein showed high DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity with a K(m) value of 2 microM, had no detectable activity against deoxynucleoside triphosphates or other typical Nudix hydrolase substrates, required a physiological level (approximately 1 mM) of Mg(2+), and was active as a monomer. Essentially no reaction occurred without enzyme at 1 mM Mg(2+). Inactivation of ylgG in L. lactis resulted in DHNTP accumulation and folate depletion, confirming that YlgG functions in folate biosynthesis. We therefore propose that ylgG be redesignated as folQ. The closest Arabidopsis homolog of YlgG (encoded by Nudix gene At1g68760) was expressed in E. coli and shown to have Mg(2+)-dependent DHNTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity. This protein (AtNUDT1) was reported previously to have NADH pyrophosphatase activity in the presence of 5 mM Mn(2+) (Dobrzanska, M., Szurmak, B., Wyslouch-Cieszynska, A., and Kraszewska, E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 50482-50486). However, we found that this activity is negligible at physiological levels of Mn(2+) and that, with 1 mM Mg(2+), AtNUDT1 prefers DHNTP and (deoxy) nucleoside triphosphates.
