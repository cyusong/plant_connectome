Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in plants are multipurpose enzymes that are involved in growth and development and anthocyanins transportation. However, members of the GST gene family were not identified in sweet cherry (<i>Prunus avium</i>). To identify the GST genes in sweet cherry, a genome-wide analysis was conducted. In this study, we identified 67 GST genes in <i>P. avium</i> genome and nomenclature according to chromosomal distribution. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that <i>PavGST</i> genes were classified into seven chief subfamily: TCHQD, Theta, Phi, Zeta, Lambda, DHAR, and Tau. The majority of the <i>PavGST</i> genes had a relatively well-maintained exon-intron and motif arrangement within the same group, according to gene structure and motif analyses. Gene structure (introns-exons) and conserved motif analysis revealed that the majority of the <i>PavGST</i> genes showed a relatively well-maintained motif and exons-introns configuration within the same group. The chromosomal localization, GO enrichment annotation, subcellular localization, syntenic relationship, Ka/Ks analysis, and molecular characteristics were accomplished using various bioinformatics tools. Mode of gene duplication showed that dispersed duplication might play a key role in the expansion of <i>PavGST</i> gene family. Promoter regions of <i>PavGST</i> genes contain numerous <i>cis</i>-regulatory components, which are involved in multiple stress responses, such as abiotic stress and phytohormones responsive factors. Furthermore, the expression profile of sweet cherry <i>PavGSTs</i> showed significant results under LED treatment. Our findings provide the groundwork for future research into induced LED anthocyanin and antioxidants deposition in sweet cherries.
