In Arabidopsis thaliana, ozone-induced signaling has been shown to involve the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) MPK3 and MPK6. To identify a possible ozone-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) involved in the activation of these specific MAPKs, we employed RNA interference-(RNAi)-based suppression of MKK5, a known cognate MAPKK to both MPK3 and MPK6. When exposed to ozone, activation of both MPK3 and MPK6 was markedly reduced in the MKK5-suppressed plants compared to WT. Additionally, the MKK5-suppressed plants were found to be highly sensitive to ozone as determined by visible leaf damage concomitant with elevated levels of leaf-localised H(2)O(2). Taken together, our data suggest MKK5 functions both in ozone-induced activation of MPK3 and MPK6 and in integrating ROS homeostasis during ozone stress.
