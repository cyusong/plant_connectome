['22960908', 'Remodeling of actin filament arrays in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli is  thought to require precise control over the generation and availability of  filament ends. Heterodimeric capping protein (CP) is an abundant filament capper,  and its activity is inhibited by membrane signaling phospholipids in vitro. How  exactly CP modulates the properties of filament ends in cells and whether its  activity is coordinated by phospholipids in vivo is not well understood. By  observing directly the dynamic behavior of individual filament ends in the  cortical array of living Arabidopsis thaliana epidermal cells, we dissected the  contribution of CP to actin organization and dynamics in response to the  signaling phospholipid, phosphatidic acid (PA). Here, we examined three cp  knockdown mutants and found that reduced CP levels resulted in more dynamic  activity at filament ends, and this significantly enhanced filament-filament  annealing and filament elongation from free ends. The cp mutants also exhibited  more dense actin filament arrays. Treatment of wild-type cells with exogenous PA  phenocopied the actin-based defects in cp mutants, with an increase in the  density of filament arrays and enhanced annealing frequency. These cytoskeletal  responses to exogenous PA were completely abrogated in cp mutants. Our data  provide compelling genetic evidence that the end-capping activity of CP is  inhibited by membrane signaling lipids in eukaryotic cells. Specifically, CP acts  as a PA biosensor and key transducer of fluxes in membrane signaling  phospholipids into changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.103945', 'Staiger']
