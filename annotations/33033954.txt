Cadmium stress induces WDR5a expression to promote NO accumulation to repress root meristem growth via suppressing auxin transport and synthesis in Arabidopsis. Nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS)-like activity plays a vital role in toxic cadmium (Cd)-induced NO production and inhibition of root meristem growth, while factor(s) regulating NOS-like activity and root meristem growth in plant response to Cd has not been identified yet. Here, we report that WD40 repeat 5a (WDR5a) functions in Cd-induced NOS-like activity, NO accumulation and root meristem growth suppression. We found that wdr5a-1 mutant root has increased root meristem growth with lower NOS-like activity and NO accumulation than wild type upon Cd exposure, and exogenous NO donors sodium nitroprusside or nitrosoglutathione can restore its reduced Cd sensitivity. In addition, Cd activates WDR5a expression in roots, and overexpressing WDR5a results in increased NO accumulation and suppressed root meristem growth similar to Cd-stressed wild-type roots, while scavenging NO or inhibiting NOS-like activity significantly reverts these effects of Cd. Furthermore, WDR5a acts in Cd-repressed auxin accumulation through reducing the levels of auxin efflux carriers PIN1/3/7 and biosynthetic enzyme TAA1, and reduced sensitivity of wdr5a-1 root meristem to Cd can be partially reverted by inhibiting TAA1 activity pharmaceutically or mutating TAA1 genetically. This study identified WDR5a as a key factor modulating NO accumulation and root meristem growth in plant response to Cd.
