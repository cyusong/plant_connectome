Rapidly determining root growth patterns is biologically important and technically challenging. Current methods focus on direct observation of roots and require destructive excavations or time-consuming root tracing. We developed a novel methodology based on analyzing soil particle displacement, rather than direct observation of roots. This inferred root growth method uses digital image correlation (DIC) analysis, an established and high-throughput method used in many engineering and science disciplines. By applying DIC analyses to repeated images of plants grown in clear window boxes, we produced visually intuitive and quantifiable strain maps, indicating the magnitude and direction of soil movement. From this, we could infer root growth and rapidly quantify root system metrics. Strain measures were closely associated with the spatial distribution of roots and correlated with root length measured using conventional approaches. The method also allowed for the detection of root proliferation in nutrient-enriched soil patches, indicating its suitability for quantifying biological patterns. This novel application of DIC in root biology is effective, scalable, low cost, flexible and complementary to existing technologies. This method offers a new tool for answering questions in plant biology and will be particularly useful in studies involving temporal dynamics of root processes.
