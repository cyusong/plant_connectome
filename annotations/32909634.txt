Environmental changes cause abiotic stress in plants, primarily through alterations in the uptake of the nutrients and water they require for their metabolism and growth and to maintain their cellular homeostasis. The plasma membranes of cells contain transporter proteins, encoded by their specific genes, responsible for the uptake of nutrients and water (aquaporins). However, their interregulation has rarely been taken into account. Therefore, in this review we identify how the plant genome responds to abiotic stresses such as nutrient deficiency, drought, salinity and low temperature, in relation to both nutrient transporters and aquaporins. Some general responses or regulation mechanisms can be observed under each abiotic stress such as the induction of plasma membrane transporter expression during macronutrient deficiency, the induction of tonoplast transporters and reduction of aquaporins during micronutrients deficiency. However, drought, salinity and low temperatures generally cause an increase in expression of nutrient transporters and aquaporins in tolerant plants. We propose that both types of transporters (nutrients and water) should be considered jointly in order to better understand plant tolerance of stresses.
