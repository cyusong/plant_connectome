Jasmonates have crucial roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Given the importance of transcriptional regulation in jasmonate-mediated stress responses, transcription factors are key regulators of jasmonate signaling. The transcription factors JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED MYC2-LIKE 1 (JAM1), JAM2, and JAM3 are negative regulators of jasmonate signaling, although the mechanisms that control the activities of these transcription factors remain unclear. To understand the regulatory mechanisms of JAM proteins, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen for protein interaction partners of JAM1 and found that JAM1 interacted with JAZ proteins.
