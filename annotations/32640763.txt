Advances in molecular biology including genomics, high-throughput sequencing, and genome editing enable increasingly faster and more precise cultivar development. Identifying genes and functional markers (FMs) that are highly associated with plant phenotypic variation is a grand challenge. Functional genomics approaches such as transcriptomics, targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING), homologous recombinant (HR), association mapping, and allele mining are all strategies to identify FMs for breeding goals, such as agronomic traits and biotic and abiotic stress resistance. The advantage of FMs over other markers used in plant breeding is the close genomic association of an FM with a phenotype. Thereby, FMs may facilitate the direct selection of genes associated with phenotypic traits, which serves to increase selection efficiencies to develop varieties. Herein, we review the latest methods in FM development and how FMs are being used in precision breeding for agronomic and quality traits as well as in breeding for biotic and abiotic stress resistance using marker assisted selection (MAS) methods. In summary, this article describes the use of FMs in breeding for development of elite crop cultivars to enhance global food security goals.
