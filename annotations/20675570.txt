['20675570', 'Stomata, which are epidermal pores surrounded by two guard cells, develop from a  specialized stem cell lineage and function in shoot gas exchange. The Arabidopsis  thaliana FOUR LIPS (FLP) and MYB88 genes encode closely related and atypical  two-MYB-repeat proteins, which when mutated result in excess divisions and  abnormal groups of stomata in contact. Consistent with a role in transcription,  we show here that FLP and MYB88 are nuclear proteins with DNA binding preferences  distinct from other known MYBs. To identify possible FLP/MYB88 transcriptional  targets, we used chromatin immunoprecitation (ChIP) followed by hybridization to  Arabidopsis whole genome tiling arrays. These ChIP-chip data indicate that  FLP/MYB88 target the upstream regions especially of cell cycle genes, including  cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and components of the prereplication  complex. In particular, we show that FLP represses the expression of the  mitosis-inducing factor CDKB1;1, which, along with CDKB1;2, is specifically  required both for the last division in the stomatal pathway and for cell  overproliferation in flp mutants. We propose that FLP and MYB88 together  integrate patterning with the control of cell cycle progression and terminal  differentiation through multiple and direct cell cycle targets. FLP recognizes a  distinct cis-regulatory element that overlaps with that of the cell cycle  activator E2F-DP in the CDKB1;1 promoter, suggesting that these MYBs may also  modulate E2F-DP pathways.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074609', 'Grotewold']
