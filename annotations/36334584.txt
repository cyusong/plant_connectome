Organic fertilizer is commonly used to increase crop yields and improve soil quality. However, it is unclear whether crops adapt to organic fertilizer by regulating metabolic pathways that are involved in nutrient utilization. In this study, we focused on the organic phosphorus (P<sub>o</sub>) in organic fertilizer and, using watermelon, investigated changes in gene expression and metabolic pathways in response to organic fertilizer and the combination of chemical fertilizer and organic fertilizer (chemical fertilizer 70% and organic fertilizer 30%, based on phosphorus supply). Purple acid phosphatase (PAP) gene expression was upregulated in leaves and roots of watermelon grown in organic fertilizer alone and in the combination of chemical/organic fertilizer, resulting in enhanced phosphatase activity in roots. When the ratio of chemical to organic fertilizer was 85/15, root-associated acid phosphatase (APase) activity increased over chemical fertilizer alone. This formulation also resulted in increased inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) concentration in roots and leaves, and the upregulation of the secretory APase genes ClaPAP10/12/15/26, and ClaPAP18 in roots. In conclusion, watermelon responds to organic fertilizer by upregulating expression of secretory ClaPAP genes, subsequently enhancing root-associated APase activity further improving the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters, and ultimately facilitating P<sub>o</sub> utilization by roots. The mechanisms of P utilization by roots comprise the enhancement of APase and phytase activity, absorption of small P<sub>o</sub> molecules, uptake of P<sub>i</sub>, and the increase of lateral root number when organic fertilizer is applied to the plants. These findings help to establish the mechanisms by which plants respond to organic fertilizer by regulating metabolic pathways at the transcriptional level.
