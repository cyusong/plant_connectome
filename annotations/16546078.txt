['16546078', 'BACKGROUND: Plants achieve remarkable plasticity in shoot system architecture by  regulating the activity of secondary shoot meristems, laid down in the axil of  each leaf. Axillary meristem activity, and hence shoot branching, is regulated by  a network of interacting hormonal signals that move through the plant. Among  these, auxin, moving down the plant in the main stem, indirectly inhibits  axillary bud outgrowth, and an as yet undefined hormone, the synthesis of which  in Arabidopsis requires MAX1, MAX3, and MAX4, moves up the plant and also  inhibits shoot branching. Since the axillary buds of max4 mutants are resistant  to the inhibitory effects of apically supplied auxin, auxin and the MAX-dependent  hormone must interact to inhibit branching. RESULTS: Here we show that the  resistance of max mutant buds to apically supplied auxin is largely independent  of the known, AXR1-mediated, auxin signal transduction pathway. Instead, it is  caused by increased capacity for auxin transport in max primary stems, which show  increased expression of PIN auxin efflux facilitators. The max phenotype is  dependent on PIN1 activity, but it is independent of flavonoids, which are known  regulators of PIN-dependent auxin transport. CONCLUSIONS: The MAX-dependent  hormone is a novel regulator of auxin transport. Modulation of auxin transport in  the stem is sufficient to regulate bud outgrowth, independent of AXR1-mediated  auxin signaling. We therefore propose an additional mechanism for long-range  signaling by auxin in which bud growth is regulated by competition between auxin  sources for auxin transport capacity in the primary stem.', '2006 Mar 21', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.058', 'Leyser']
