['33492497', 'TCX8 localizes to nucleus and has transcriptional repression activity. TCX8 binds  to the promoter region of LOX2 encoding lipoxygenase, causing JA biosynthesis  suppression, and thereby delays plant senescence. Conserved CXC domain-containing  proteins are found in most eukaryotes. Eight TCX proteins, which are homologs of  animal CXC-Hinge-CXC (CHC) proteins, were identified in Arabidopsis, and three of  them, TSO1, TCX2/SOL2 and TCX3/SOL1, have been reported to affect cell-cycle  control. TCX8, one of the TCX family proteins, was believed to be a TF but its  precise function has not been reported. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed  TCP20, a TF that binds to the promoter of LOX2 encoding lipoxygenase, as a strong  candidate for interaction with TCX8. We confirmed that TCX8 directly interacts  with TCP20 using in vitro pull-down assay and in vivo BiFC and observed that  TCX8, as a TF, localizes to nucleus. Using EMSA and by analyzing phenotypes of  TCX8-overexpression lines, we demonstrated that TCX8 regulates the expression of  LOX2 by binding to either cis-element of LOX2 promoter to which TCP20 or TCP4  binds, affecting JA biosynthesis, and thereby delaying plant senescence. Our  study provides new information about the role of TCX8 in modulating plant  senescence through regulating LOX2 expression.', '2021 Apr', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-021-02663-y', 'ORCID:']
