Male gametogenesis in angiosperms involves two rounds of mitosis that are essential for the generation of two sperm cells to achieve double fertilization, a distinct event in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants. Precise regulation of mitosis during male gametogenesis is critically important for the establishment of the male germline. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying mitotic division during male gametophyte development have not been characterized fully. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis transcription initiation factor TFIIB-related protein BRP4 is involved in the regulation of mitotic cell-cycle progression during male gametogenesis. BRP4 was expressed predominately in developing male gametophytes. Knockdown expression of BRP4 by a native promoter-driven RNA interference construct in Arabidopsis resulted in arrest of the mitotic progression of male gametophytes, leading to a defect in pollen development. Moreover, we showed that the level of expression of a gene encoding a subunit of the origin recognition complex, ORC6, was decreased in BRP4 knockdown plants, and that the ORC6 knockdown transgenic plants phenocopied the male gametophyte defect observed in BRP4 knockdown plants, suggesting that ORC6 acts downstream of BRP4 to mediate male mitotic progression. Taken together, our results reveal that BRP4 plays an important role in the regulation of mitotic cell-cycle progression during male gametogenesis.
