The information on core components in maize polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are updated at a genome-wide scale, and the protein-protein interaction networks of PRC2 components are further provided in maize. The evolutionarily conserved polycomb group (PcG) proteins form multi-subunits polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) that repress gene expression via chromatin condensation. In Arabidopsis, three distinct PRC2s have been identified, each determining a specific developmental program with partly functional redundancy. However, the core components and biological functions of PRC2 in cereals remain obscure. Here, we updated the information on maize PRC2 components at a genome-wide scale. Maize PRC2 subunits are highly duplicated, with five MSI1, three E(z), two ESC and two Su(z)12 homologs. ZmFIE1 is preferentially expressed in the endosperm, whereas the remaining are broadly expressed in many tissues. ZmCLF/MEZ1 and ZmFIE1 are maternally expressed imprinted genes, in contrast to the paternal-dominantly expression of ZmFIE2 in the endosperm. In maize, E(z) members likely provide a scaffold for assembling PRC2 complexes, whereas Su(z)12 and p55/MSI1-like proteins together reinforce the complex; ESC members probably determine its specificity: FIE1-PRC2 regulates endosperm cell development, whereas FIE2-PRC2 controls other cell types. The duplicated Brassicaceae-specific MEA and FIS2 also directly interact with maize PRC2 members. Together, this study establishes a roadmap for protein-protein interactions of maize PRC2 components, providing new insights into their functions in the growth and development of cereals.
