['18375596', 'Light is an important factor for plant growth and development. We have identified  and functionally characterized a regulatory gene SHORT HYPOCOTYL IN WHITE LIGHT1  (SHW1) involved in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedling development. SHW1  encodes a unique serine-arginine-aspartate-rich protein, which is constitutively  localized in the nucleus of hypocotyl cells. Transgenic analyses have revealed  that the expression of SHW1 is developmentally regulated and is closely  associated with the photosynthetically active tissues. Genetic and molecular  analyses suggest that SHW1 acts as a negative regulator of light-mediated  inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, however, plays a positive regulatory role in  light-regulated gene expression. The shw1 mutants also display shorter hypocotyl  in dark, and analyses of shw1 cop1 double mutants reveal that SHW1 acts  nonredundantly with COP1 to control hypocotyl elongation in the darkness. Taken  together, this study provides evidences that SHW1 is a regulatory protein that is  functionally interrelated to COP1 and plays dual but opposite regulatory roles in  photomorphogenesis.', '2008 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.118174', 'Chattopadhyay']
