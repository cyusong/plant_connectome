Non-specific phospholipase C (NPC) is involved in plant growth, development and stress responses. To elucidate the mechanism by which NPCs mediate cellular functions, here we show that NPC4 is S-acylated at the C terminus and that acylation determines its plasma membrane (PM) association and function. The acylation of NPC4 was detected using NPC4 isolated from Arabidopsis and reconstituted in vitro. The C-terminal Cys-533 was identified as the S-acylation residue, and the mutation of Cys-533 to Ala-533 in NPC4 (NPC4<sup>C533A</sup> ) led to the loss of S-acylation and membrane association of NPC4. The knockout of NPC4 impeded the phosphate deficiency-induced decrease of the phosphosphingolipid glycosyl inositol phosphoryl ceramide (GIPC), but introducing NPC4<sup>C533A</sup> to npc4-1 failed to complement this defect, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the non-acylated NPC4<sup>C533A</sup> fails to hydrolyze GIPC during phosphate deprivation. Moreover, NPC4<sup>C533A</sup> failed to complement the primary root growth in npc4-1 under stress. In addition, NPC4 in Brassica napus was S-acylated and mutation of the S-acylating cysteine residue of BnaC01.NPC4 led to the loss of S-acylation and its membrane association. Together, our results reveal that S-acylation of NPC4 in the C terminus is conserved and required for its membrane association, phosphosphingolipid hydrolysis and function in plant stress responses.
