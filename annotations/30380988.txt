Plants are exposed to various stress factors including biotic and abiotic stresses. Drought is a limiting factor that minimizes the development and growth of several plants in arid and semi-arid regions. Stress response is usually occur at different levels, Morphological, physiological and biochemical while at the molecular level a large number of genes are involved. This study aims at developing a new SSR primer for aquaporin related to drought stress in plants. A total of 177 complete coding sequences (CDS) available in the NCBI database are downloaded. After analyzing with BLAST, 163 sequences are selected. 1294 SSR derived from these sequences are characterized with MISA and indicating that all sequences contained SSRs. The most abundant SSR has been tetra-nucleotide repeat motif (36%) and among all the tetra-nucleotide repeats, the motif AAAG/CTTT was the most common type, whereas in tri-nucleotide, the motif CCG/CGG has been the predominate type. By using Primer3, 1120 primer pairs are generated and after analyzing, only 735 non redundant primer pairs that present the good characteristics are selected. Among them, some of the pairs of primers are randomly selected and validated on DNA of various species using PCR and agarose gel.
