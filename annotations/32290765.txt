Plants evolve diverse strategies to cope with herbivorous insects, in which the lipid-derived phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role. This study was conducted to investigate the differential responses of tomato and maize plants to <i>Spodoptera exigua</i>herbivory and to clarify the role played by JA, methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) and jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-L-Ile) in their defense responses. JA, MeJA and JA-L-Ile were quantified using HPLC-MS/MS. The results showed that maize plant was more tolerant to<i>S. exigua</i>herbivory than tomato. <i>Spodopteraexigua</i> attack induced JA, MeJA, and JA-L-Ile to high levels after 2 h of infestation in both test plants. Then, all studied JAsconcentration decreased gradually by increasing infestation time up to 1 week. JA concentration in infested maize was much higher than that in infested tomato leaves. However, MeJA concentration in infested tomato leaves was higher than that in maize. In control plants, JA was not recorded, while MeJA was recorded in comparable values both in tomato and maize. Our results showed that JA plays the main role in increasing defense responses to <i>S. exigua</i> infestation in the studied plants as a direct signaling molecule; however, MeJA could play an indirect role by inducing JA accumulation. JA-L-Ile indicated a less efficient role in defense responses to <i>S. exigua</i> attack in both test plants where its level is much lower than JA and MeJA.

JA: !increases! defense responses 
MeJA: !induces! JA accumulation 
JA-L-Ile: !less efficient role in! defense responses
