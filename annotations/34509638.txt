Paraquat is one of the most widely used nonselective herbicides and has elicited the emergence of paraquat-resistant weeds. However, the molecular mechanisms of paraquat resistance are not completely understood. Here we report the Arabidopsis gain-of-function mutant pqt15-D with significantly enhanced resistance to paraquat and the corresponding gene PQT15, which encodes the Multidrug and Toxic Extrusion (MATE) transporter DTX6. A point mutation at +932 bp in DTX6 causes a G311E amino acid substitution, enhancing the paraquat resistance of pqt15-D, and overexpression of DTX6/PQT15 in the wild-type plants also results in strong paraquat resistance. Moreover, heterologous expression of DTX6 and DTX6-D in Escherichia coli significantly enhances bacterial resistance to paraquat. Importantly, overexpression of DTX6-D enables Arabidopsis plants to tolerate 4 mM paraquat, a near-commercial application level. DTX6/PQT15 is localized in the plasma membrane and endomembrane, and functions as a paraquat efflux transporter as demonstrated by paraquat efflux assays with isolated protoplasts and bacterial cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DTX6/PQT15 is an efflux transporter that confers paraquat resistance by exporting paraquat out of the cytosol. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism of paraquat resistance in higher plants and provide a promising candidate gene for engineering paraquat-resistant crops.
