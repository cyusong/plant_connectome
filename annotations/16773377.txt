cDNA clones encoding cytochrome b(5) fusion desaturases were isolated from Primula cortusoides L. and Primula luteola Ruprecht, species previously shown to preferentially accumulate either n-6 or n-3 Delta6-desaturated fatty acids, respectively. Functional characterisation of these desaturases in yeast revealed that the recombinant Primula enzymes displayed substrate preferences, resulting in the predominant synthesis of either gamma-linolenic acid (n-6) or stearidonic acid (n-3). Independent expression of the two Primula desaturases in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana confirmed these results, with gamma-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid accumulating in both leaf and seed tissues to different levels, depending on the substrate specificity of the desaturase. Targeted lipid analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis lines revealed the presence of Delta6-desaturated fatty acids in the acyl-CoA pools of leaf but not seed tissue. The implications for the transgenic synthesis of C(20) polyunsaturated fatty acids via the elongation of Delta6-desaturated fatty acids are discussed, as is the potential of using Primula desaturases in the synthesis of C(18) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as stearidonic acid.
