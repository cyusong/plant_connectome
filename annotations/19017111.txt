Nitric oxide (NO) plays important roles in diverse physiological processes in plants. NO can provoke both beneficial and harmful effects, which depend on the concentration and location of NO in plant cells. This review is focused on NO synthesis and the functions of NO in plant responses to abiotic environmental stresses. Abiotic stresses mostly induce NO production in plants. NO alleviates the harmfulness of reactive oxygen species, and reacts with other target molecules, and regulates the expression of stress responsive genes under various stress conditions.

NO: !provokes! beneficial/harmful effects
NO: !synthesizes! in plants
NO: !alleviates! harmfulness of ROS
NO: !reacts with! other target molecules
NO: !regulates! expression of stress responsive genes
