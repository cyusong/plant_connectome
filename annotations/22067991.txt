The trans-Golgi network (TGN) in plant cells is an independent organelle, displaying rapid association and dissociation with Golgi bodies. In plant cells, the TGN is the site where secretory and endocytic membrane trafficking meet. Cell wall components, signaling molecules and auxin transporters have been found to undergo intracellular trafficking around the TGN. However, how different trafficking pathways are regulated and how different cargoes are sorted in the TGN is poorly defined in plant cells. Using a combined approach of genetic and in vivo imaging, we recently demonstrated that Arabidopsis TRAPPII acts in the TGN and is required for polar targeting of PIN2, but not PIN1, auxin efflux carrier in root tip cells. Here, we report that, TRAPPII in Arabidopsis is required for polar distribution of AUX1, an auxin influx carrier in protophloem cells and epidermal cells of Arabidopsis root tips. In yeast cells, TRAPPII serves as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ypt1 and Ypt31/32 in late Golgi trafficking, while in mammalian cells, TRAPPII acts as a GEF for Rab1 (homolog of yeast Ypt1) in early Golgi trafficking. We show here that TRAPPII in Arabidopsis is functionally linked to Rab-A proteins, homologs of yeast Ypt31/32, but not Rab-D proteins, homologs of yeast Ypt1 and animal Rab1 proteins.
