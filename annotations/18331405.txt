Polyphenol oxidase (PPO; EC 1.10.3.2 or EC 1.14.18.1), a thylakoid-lumen protein encoded by a nuclear gene, plays a role in the defense of plants against both herbivores and pathogens. Although previously reported to be a Tat (twin-arginine-dependent translocation) protein, the import of PPO by isolated chloroplasts was inhibited by azide, a diagnostic inhibitor of the Sec-dependent pathway. Import of PPO inhibited thylakoid translocation of a Tat protein and did not affect translocation of Sec-dependent proteins. In contrast, a pre-accumulated iPPO competed with Sec-dependent but not with Tat proteins. A previously reported second processing step in the stroma removes a twin-Arg that is part of a 'Sec-avoidance' motif in the thylakoid targeting domain of PPO. When the second processing site was mutated, the import of the resulting precursor showed Sec-dependent characteristics. The PPO transit peptide could drive thylakoid translocation of a Tat protein in the dark. Azide inhibited the secretion of a PPO intermediate that lacks a twin-Arg to the periplasm of Escherichia coli, but had no effect on the export of the intermediate containing the twin-Arg. PPO is synthesized in plants in response to wound and pathogen-related signals and it is possible that when the Tat pathway is unable to translocate adequate amounts of newly synthesized PPO, translocation is diverted to the Sec-dependent pathway by processing the intermediate at the second site and removing the twin-Arg.
