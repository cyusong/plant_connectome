Nucleosome-free open chromatin often harbors transcription factor (TF)-binding sites that are associated with active <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements. However, analysis of open chromatin regions has rarely been applied to oomycete or fungal plant pathogens. In this study, we performed the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to identify open chromatin and <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> at the mycelial stage. We identified 10,389 peaks representing nucleosome-free regions (NFRs). The peaks were enriched in gene-promoter regions and associated with 40% of <i>P. sojae</i> genes; transcription levels were higher for genes with multiple peaks than genes with a single peak and were higher for genes with a single peak than genes without peak. Chromatin accessibility was positively correlated with gene transcription level. Through motif discovery based on NFR peaks in core promoter regions, 25 candidate <i>cis</i>-regulatory motifs with evidence of TF-binding footprints were identified. These motifs exhibited various preferences for location in the promoter region and associations with the transcription level of their target genes, which included some putative pathogenicity-related genes. As the first study revealing the landscape of open chromatin and the correlation between chromatin accessibility and gene transcription level in oomycetes, the results provide a technical reference and data resources for future studies on the regulatory mechanisms of gene transcription.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
