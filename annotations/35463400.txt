Identifying genes/loci for resistance to pine wilt disease (PWD) caused by the pine wood nematode (PWN) is beneficial for improving resistance breeding in <i>Pinus thunbergii</i>, but to date, genetic information using molecular markers has been limited. Here, we constructed a high-density linkage map using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for PWD resistance for the self-pollinated progeny of "Namikata 73," which is the most resistant variety among resistant varieties of <i>P. thunbergii</i>, following inoculation tests with PWN. An S<sub>1</sub> mapping population consisting of the 116 progenies derived from self-pollination of the resistant variety, "Namikata 73" (resistance rank 5 to PWN), was inoculated with PWN isolate Ka-4 and evaluated for disease symptoms. To construct a high-density linkage map, we used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by GBS based on next-generation sequencing technology and some anchor DNA markers, expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived SNP markers and EST-derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and genomic SSR markers. The linkage map had 13 linkage groups (LGs) consisting of 2,365 markers including 2,243 GBS-SNP markers over a total map distance of 1968.4 centimorgans (cM). Results from QTL analysis using phenotype data and the linkage map indicated that PWD resistance is controlled by a single locus located on LG-3, as identified in a previous study. This locus showed overdominant genetic action in the present study. With the confirmation of <i>PWD1</i> in two different mapping populations (present study and a previous study), the locus associated with this region is thought to be a good target for marker-assisted selection in <i>P. thunbergii</i> breeding programs in order to obtain high levels of resistance to PWD caused by PWN.
