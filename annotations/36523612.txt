The loss of tomatoes caused by <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (<i>B. cinerea</i>) is one of the crucial issues restricting the tomato yield. This study screened the elicitor protein phosphopentomutase from <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> LJ02 (BvEP) which improves the tomato resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i>. Phosphatemutase was reported to play a crucial role in the nucleoside synthesis of various microorganisms. However, there is no report on improving plant resistance by phosphopentomutase, and the related signaling pathway in the immune response has not been elucidated. High purity recombinant BvEP protein have no direct inhibitory effect on <i>B. cinerea in vitro</i>,and but induce the hypersensitivity response (HR) in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>. Tomato leaves overexpressing BvEP were found to be significantly more resistant to <i>B. cinerea</i> by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated genetic transformation. Several defense genes, including <i>WRKY28</i> and <i>PTI5</i> of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), <i>UDP</i> and <i>UDP1</i> of effector-triggered immunity (ETI), <i>Hin1</i> and <i>HSR203J</i> of HR, <i>PR1a</i> of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and the SAR related gene <i>NPR1</i> were all up-regulated in transgenic tomato leaves overexpressing BvEP. In addition, it was found that transient overexpression of BvEP reduced the rotting rate and lesion diameter of tomato fruits caused by <i>B. cinerea</i>, and increased the expression of PTI, ETI, SAR-related genes, ROS content, SOD and POD activities in tomato fruits, while there was no significant effect on the weight loss and TSS, TA and Vc contents of tomato fruits. This study provides new insights into innovative breeding of tomato disease resistance and has great significance for loss reduction and income enhancement in the tomato industry.
