['23843604', 'Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the best-characterized type of endocytosis  in eukaryotic cells. Plants appear to possess all of the molecular components  necessary to carry out CME; however, functional characterization of the  components is still in its infancy. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified mu2 as a  putative interaction partner of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE6 (CESA6). Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) mu2 is homologous to the medium subunit 2 of the mammalian  ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX2 (AP2). In mammals, the AP2 complex acts as the central  hub of CME by docking to the plasma membrane while concomitantly recruiting cargo  proteins, clathrin triskelia, and accessory proteins to the sites of endocytosis.  We confirmed that mu2 interacts with multiple CESA proteins through the mu-homology  domain of mu2, which is involved in specific interactions with endocytic cargo  proteins in mammals. Consistent with its role in mediating the endocytosis of  cargos at the plasma membrane, mu2-YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN localized to  transient foci at the plasma membrane, and loss of mu2 resulted in defects in bulk  endocytosis. Furthermore, loss of mu2 led to increased accumulation of YELLOW  FLUORESCENT PROTEIN-CESA6 particles at the plasma membrane. Our results suggest  that CESA represents a new class of CME cargo proteins and that plant cells might  regulate cellulose synthesis by controlling the abundance of active CESA  complexes at the plasma membrane through CME.', '2013 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.221234', 'Gu']
