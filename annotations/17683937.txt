['17683937', 'BACKGROUND: At the core of the eukaryotic circadian network, clock genes/proteins  form multiple transcriptional/translational negative-feedback loops and generate  a basic approximately 24 hr oscillation, which provides daily regulation for a  wide range of processes. This temporal organization enhances the fitness of the  organism only if it corresponds to the natural day/night cycles. Light is the  most effective signal in synchronizing the oscillator to environmental cycles.  RESULTS: The lip1-1 (light insensitive period 1) mutant isolated from the model  plant Arabidopsis thaliana displays novel circadian phenotypes arising from  specific defects in the light input pathway to the oscillator. In wild-type  plants, period length shortens with increasing light fluence rates and the phase  of rhythms can be shifted by light pulses administered to dark-adapted plants. In  contrast, in lip1-1, period length is nearly insensitive to light intensity and  significantly larger phase shifts (delays) can be induced during the subjective  night. The mutant also displays elevated photomorphogenic responses to red and  blue light, which cannot be explained by the circadian defect, suggesting  distinct functions for LIP1 in the circadian light input and photomorphogenesis.  The LIP1 gene encodes a functional, plant-specific atypical small GTPase, and  therefore we postulate that it acts similarly to ZEITLUPE at postranscriptional  level. CONCLUSIONS: LIP1 represents the first small GTPase implicated in the  circadian system of plants. LIP1 plays a unique negative role in controlling  circadian light input and is required for precise entrainment of the plant clock.', '2007 Sep 4', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.018', 'Nagy']
