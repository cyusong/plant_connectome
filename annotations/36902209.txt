An increasing number of scientists working to raise agricultural productivity see the potential in the roots and the soil adjacent to them, together with a wealth of micro-organisms. The first mechanisms activated in the plant during any abiotic or biotic stress concern changes in the oxidative status of the plant. With this in mind, for the first time, an attempt was made to check whether the inoculation of seedlings of the model plant <i>Medicago truncatula</i> with rhizobacteria belonging to the genus <i>Pseudomonas</i> (<i>P. brassicacearum</i> KK5, <i>P. corrugata</i> KK7), <i>Paenibacillus borealis</i> KK4 and a symbiotic strain <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> KK13 would change the oxidative status in the days following inoculation. Initially, an increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis was observed, which led to an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes responsible for regulating hydrogen peroxide levels. The main enzyme involved in the reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in the roots was catalase. The observed changes indicate the possibility of using the applied rhizobacteria to induce processes related to plant resistance and thus to ensure protection against environmental stress factors. In the next stages, it seems reasonable to check whether the initial changes in the oxidative state affect the activation of other pathways related to plant immunity.
