['26195288', 'Mediator is a conserved multi-protein complex that acts as a bridge between  promoter-bound transcriptional regulators and RNA polymerase II. While redox  signaling is important in adjusting plant metabolism and development, the  involvement of Mediator in redox homeostasis and regulation only recently started  to emerge. Our previous results show that the MED10a, MED28, and MED32 Mediator  subunits form various types of covalent oligomers linked by intermolecular  disulfide bonds in vitro. To link that with biological significance we have  characterized Arabidopsis med32 and med28 mutants and found that they are  affected in root development and senescence, phenotypes possibly associated to  redox changes.', '2016 May', 'Protoplasma', '10.1007/s00709-015-0853-y', 'Wingsle']
