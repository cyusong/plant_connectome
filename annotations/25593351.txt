['25593351', 'Plants have developed a variety of mechanisms to cope with abiotic and biotic  stresses. In a previous subcellular localization study of hydrogen  peroxide-responsive proteins, two peptides with an unknown function (designated  ARACIN1 and ARACIN2) have been identified. These peptides are structurally very  similar but are transcriptionally differentially regulated during abiotic  stresses during Botrytis cinerea infection or after benzothiadiazole and methyl  jasmonate treatments. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), these paralogous  genes are positioned in tandem within a cluster of pathogen defense-related  genes. Both ARACINs are small, cationic, and hydrophobic peptides, known  characteristics for antimicrobial peptides. Their genes are expressed in  peripheral cell layers prone to pathogen entry and are lineage specific to the  Brassicaceae family. In vitro bioassays demonstrated that both ARACIN peptides  have a direct antifungal effect against the agronomically and economically  important necrotrophic fungi B. cinerea, Alternaria brassicicola, Fusarium  graminearum, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).  In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that ectopically express ARACIN1 are  protected better against infections with both B. cinerea and A. brassicicola.  Therefore, we can conclude that both ARACINs act as antimicrobial peptides.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.255505', 'Van']
