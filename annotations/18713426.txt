Petal coloration and pigment components in 12 American crape myrtle cultivars (Lagerstroemia indicaxLagerstroemia fauriei) and five Chinese crape myrtle cultivars (L. indica hybrids) were studied. Color was measured by CIEL*a*b* scale and anthocyanin composition of crape myrtle was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The presence of the previously reported delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, petunidin 3-O-glucoside and malvidin 3-O-glucoside were confirmed. Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside was identified in crape myrtle for the first time. We explored the relationship between petal color and anthocyanin contents by multiple linear regression analyses. The results indicated that total flavones and flavonols were important variables and contributed to blue-enhancing in crape myrtle. Based on anthocyanins and co-pigments analysis, flower color breeding in crape myrtle towards true-red and blue were discussed.
