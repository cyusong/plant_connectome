Shade avoidance response (S.A.R) is regulated by light and circadian clock. Circadian clock controls S.A.R by the transcriptional regulation of positive regulators of S.A.R, PIF4 and PIF5, to prevent plants from responding to 'light' of dark period. Thus, in many cases, deficits in circadian clock appear in abnormalities of hypocotyl and/or petiole elongation. Previously, interesting phenomena were reported that the triple mutants of PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATORS9, 7 and 5, which are clock components, show longer petioles and smaller leaves under light/dark cycle than those under continuous lighting. These S.A.R-like phenotypes cannot be explained by their hyposensitivity to red light. We demonstrated detailed analyses of this mutant to reveal the leaf-specific S.A.R regulated by circadian clock. Expression analyses of S.A.R-related genes suggested that PRR5 functions as a repressor of S.A.R. Morphological analyses of leaves under different light condition revealed that PRR5 is involved in the inhibition of leaf expansion in S.A.R.
