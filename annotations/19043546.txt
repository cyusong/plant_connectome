['19043546', "Polyploidy has had a considerable impact on the evolution of many eukaryotes,  especially angiosperms. Indeed, most--if not all-angiosperms have experienced at  least one round of polyploidy during the course of their evolution, and many  important crop plants are current polyploids. The occurrence of 2n gametes  (diplogametes) in diploid populations is widely recognised as the major source of  polyploid formation. However, limited information is available on the genetic  control of diplogamete production. Here, we describe the isolation and  characterisation of the first gene, AtPS1 (Arabidopsis thaliana Parallel Spindle  1), implicated in the formation of a high frequency of diplogametes in plants.  Atps1 mutants produce diploid male spores, diploid pollen grains, and spontaneous  triploid plants in the next generation. Female meiosis is not affected in the  mutant. We demonstrated that abnormal spindle orientation at male meiosis II  leads to diplogamete formation. Most of the parent's heterozygosity is therefore  conserved in the Atps1 diploid gametes, which is a key issue for plant breeding.  The AtPS1 protein is conserved throughout the plant kingdom and carries domains  suggestive of a regulatory function. The isolation of a gene involved in  diplogamete production opens the way for new strategies in plant breeding  programmes and progress in evolutionary studies.", '2008 Nov', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1000274', 'Mercier']
