The cytochrome b6f (cyt b6f) acts as a common linker of electron transport between photosystems I and II in oxygenic photosynthesis. PetM, one of eight subunits of the cyt b6f complex, is a small hydrophobic subunit at the outside periphery, the functional mechanism of which remains to be elucidated in higher plants. In this work, we found that unlike the PetM mutant in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the Arabidopsis thaliana PetM mutant showed a bleached phenotype with yellowish leaves, block of photosynthetic electron transport and loss of photo-autotrophy, similar to the Arabidopsis PetC mutant. Although PetM is relatively conserved between higher plants and cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PetM could not rescue the PetM-knockout phenotype in Arabidopsis. We provide evidence that the Synechocystis PetM did not stably bind to the Arabidopsis cyt b6f complex. Based on these results, we suggest that PetM is required by Arabidopsis to maintain the function of the cyt b6f complex, likely through its close link with core subunits to form a tight 'fence' that stabilizes the core of the complex.
