Chloroplast repair and reorganization are crucial for the rehydration of resurrected plants. As one of the most important organelles in plant, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. Meanwhile, light is important to the biosynthesis and activity regulation of chloroplasts. Here, we investigate the recovery of the chloroplasts and photosynthetic system in plant: <i>Selaginella tamariscina</i> under dark condition and environmental light (dark-light transition) condition. This study used the <i>S. tamariscina</i> grown in a culturing room, dehydrated <i>S. tamariscina</i> and <i>S. tamariscina</i> rehydrated in environmental light and dark conditions for 72 h as experimental material to measure and observed the chlorophyll content, chloroplast ultrastructure, photosynthesis, chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. Specific leaf area and relative water content recovered in dark-rehydration conditions and were higher than those of light-rehydration, while dark-rehydration did not fully recover the chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, water-use efficiency, nor the Fv/Fm. Dehydration did not destroy the chloroplast envelop, but increased the number of plastoglobules and disturbed the granum structure. As a homeochlorophyllous resurrection plant, reorganization, not the rebuilding of chloroplasts, occurs during the dehydration and rehydration processes in <i>S. tamariscina</i>. Environmental light signals play an important role in the recovery of photosynthetic systems.
