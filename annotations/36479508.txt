<i>Piriformospora indica</i>, the mutualistic biotrophic root colonizing endosymbiotic fungus belonging to the order Sebacinales, offers host plants various benefits and enhances its growth and performance. The effect of colonization of <i>P. indica</i> in <i>Piper nigrum</i> L. cv. Panniyur1 on growth advantages, floral induction and evocation was investigated. Growth and yield benefits are credited to the alteration in the phytohormone levels fine-tuned by plants in response to the fungal colonization and perpetuation. The remarkable upregulation in the phytohormone levels, as estimated by LC- MS/MS and quantified by qRT-PCR, revealed the effectual contribution by the endophyte. qRT-PCR results revealed a significant shift in the expression of putative flowering regulatory genes in the photoperiod induction pathway (<i>FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY, APETALA1, AGAMOUS, SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS 1, GIGANTEA, PHYTOCHROMEA</i>, and <i>CRYPTOCHROME1</i>) gibberellin biosynthetic pathway genes (<i>GIBBERELLIN 20-OXIDASE2, GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE, DELLA</i> PROTEIN <i>REPRESSOR OF GA1-3 1</i>) autonomous (<i>FLOWERING LOCUS C, FLOWERING LOCUS VE, FLOWERING LOCUS CA</i>), and age pathway (<i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER LIKE9, APETALA2</i>). The endophytic colonization had no effect on vernalization (<i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i>) or biotic stress pathways (<i>SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2, WRKY family transcription factor 22</i>). The data suggest that <i>P. nigrum</i> responds positively to <i>P. indica</i> colonization, affecting preponement in floral induction as well as evocation, and thereby shortening the juvenile phase of the crop.
