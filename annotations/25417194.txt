Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization in one side of split-root sorghum plants systemically reduced root contents of strigolactones in both sides of the split roots. Shoot-derived signals other than auxin appeared to be involved in this process. Strigolactones (SLs) are a novel class of plant hormones regulating both shoot and root architectures and suggested to be functioning downstream of auxin. The levels of SLs in plant tissues and root exudates are regulated by nutrients, especially phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N); however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We examined the effects of N and P fertilization on root contents of two SLs, sorgomol and 5-deoxystrigol, in sorghum plants pre-incubated under N and P free conditions using a split-root system. N and P fertilization to one side of the split-root plants systemically reduced root contents of SLs in both sides of the split roots. The shoot N and P levels increased when one side of the split-root plants was fertilized, while N and P levels in the non-fertilized split roots were unaffected. N fertilization decreased shoot and root IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) levels, while P fertilization did not affect them. IAA applied to the shoot apices increased root contents of 5-deoxystrigol but not that of sorgomol only when the plants were grown under P free conditions. Shoot (leaf) removal dramatically decreased the root contents of SLs but did not affect root IAA levels, and IAA applied to the stumps of leaves could not restore root contents of SLs. Consequently, shoot-derived signals other than auxin are suggested to be involved in the regulation of SL production in roots.
