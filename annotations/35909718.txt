Salt stress is one of the factors that limits rice production, and an important task for researchers is to cultivate rice with strong salt tolerance. In this study, 211 rice accessions were used to determine salt tolerance germinability (STG) indices and conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 36,727 SNPs. The relative germination energy (RGE), relative germination index (RGI), relative vigor index (RVI), relative mean germination time (RMGT), relative shoot length (RSL), and relative root length (RRL) were used to determine the STG indices in rice. A total of 43 QTLs, including 15 for the RGE, 6 for the RGI, 7 for the RVI, 3 for the RMGT, 1 for the RSL, and 11 for the RRL, were identified on nine chromosome regions under 60 and 100 mM NaCl conditions. For these STG-related QTLs, 18 QTLs were co-localized with previous studies, and some characterized salt-tolerance genes, such as <i>OsCOIN, OsHsp17.0</i>, and <i>OsDREB2A</i>, are located in these QTL candidates. Among the 25 novel QTLs, <i>qRGE60-1-2</i> co-localized with <i>qRGI60-1-1</i> on chromosome 1, and <i>qRGE60-3-1</i> and <i>qRVI60-3-1</i> co-localized on chromosome 3. According to the RNA-seq database, 16 genes, including nine for <i>qRGE60-1-2</i> (<i>qRGI60-1-1</i>) and seven for <i>qRGE60-3-1</i> (<i>qRVI60-3-1</i>), were found to show significant differences in their expression levels between the control and salt treatments. Furthermore, the expression patterns of these differentially expressed genes were analyzed, and nine genes (five for <i>qRGE60-1-2</i> and four for <i>qRGE60-3-1</i>) were highly expressed in embryos at the germination stage. Haplotype analysis of these nine genes showed that the rice varieties with elite haplotypes in the <i>LOC_Os03g13560, LOC_Os03g13840</i>, and <i>LOC_Os03g14180</i> genes had high STG. GWAS validated the known genes underlying salt tolerance and identified novel loci that could enrich the current gene pool related to salt tolerance. The resources with high STG and significant loci identified in this study are potentially useful in breeding for salt tolerance.
