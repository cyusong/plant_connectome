An orchid flower exhibits a zygomorphic corolla with a well-differentiated labellum. In Cymbidium sinense, many varieties with peloric or pseudopeloric flowers have been bred during centuries of domestication. However, little is known about the molecular basis controlling orchid floral zygomorphy and the origin of these varieties. Here, we studied the floral morphogenesis of C. sinense and transcriptome-wide enriched differentially expressed genes among different varieties. The floral zygomorphy of C. sinense is established in the early developmental process. Out of 27 MIKCC-MADS factors, we found two homeotic MADS genes whose expression was down-regulated in peloric varieties but up-regulated in pseudopeloric varieties. CsAP3-2 expressed in the inner floral organs co-operates with a labellum-specific factor CsAGL6-2, asymmetrically promoting the differentiation of inner tepals. Interestingly, we detected exon deletions on CsAP3-2 in peloric varieties, indicating that loss of B-function results in the origin of peloria. Additional petaloid structures developed when we ectopically expressed these genes in Arabidopsis, suggesting their roles in floral morphogenesis. These findings indicate that the interplay among MADS factors would be crucial for orchid floral zygomorphy, and mutations in these factors may have maintained during artificial selection.
