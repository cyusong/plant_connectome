Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are important prosthetic groups in all organisms. The biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters has been studied extensively in bacteria and yeast. By contrast, much remains to be discovered about Fe-S cluster biogenesis in higher plants. Plant plastids are known to make their own Fe-S clusters. Plastid Fe-S proteins are involved in essential metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis, nitrogen and sulfur assimilation, protein import, and chlorophyll transformation. This review aims to summarize the roles of Fe-S proteins in essential metabolic pathways and to give an overview of the latest findings on plastidic Fe-S assembly. The plastidic Fe-S biosynthetic machinery contains many homologues of bacterial mobilization of sulfur (SUF) proteins, but there are additional components and properties that may be plant-specific. These additional features could make the plastidic machinery more suitable for assembling Fe-S clusters in the presence of oxygen, and may enable it to be regulated in response to oxidative stress, iron status and light.
