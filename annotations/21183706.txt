['21183706', 'Diurnal regulation of transcripts encoding proteins located in mitochondria,  plastids, and peroxisomes is important for adaptation of organelle biogenesis and  metabolism to meet cellular requirements. We show this regulation is related to  diurnal changes in promoter activities and the presence of specific cis-acting  regulatory elements in the proximal promoter region [TGGGC(C/T)], previously  defined as site II elements, and leads to diurnal changes in organelle protein  abundances. These site II elements can act both as activators or repressors of  transcription, depending on the night/day period and on the number and  arrangement of site II elements in the promoter tested. These elements bind to  the TCP family of transcriptions factors in Arabidopsis thaliana, which nearly  all display distinct diurnal patterns of cycling transcript abundance. TCP2,  TCP3, TCP11, and TCP15 were found to interact with different components of the  core circadian clock in both yeast two-hybrid and direct protein-protein  interaction assays, and tcp11 and tcp15 mutant plants showed altered transcript  profiles for a number of core clock components, including LATE ELONGATED  HYPOCOTYL1 and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR5. Thus, site II elements in the promoter  regions of genes encoding mitochondrial, plastid, and peroxisomal proteins  provide a direct mechanism for the coordination of expression for genes involved  in a variety of organellar functions, including energy metabolism, with the  time-of-day specific needs of the organism.', '2010 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074518', 'Whelan']
