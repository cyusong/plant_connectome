Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) has emerged as a vector for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in cereals, having been used to study a number of genes involved in resistance in both wheat and barley. However, the effects of the BSMV vector on plant physiology and disease resistance in plants remains unexplored. The BSMV inoculation control vector, BSMV:GFP was shown to cause severe viral symptoms in wheat, displaying chlorosis, leaf curling and growth inhibition typical of the symptoms seen in BSMV-infected barley. These viral symptoms were accompanied by induction of genes implicated in defense against pathogens, namely PR1, PR4, PR5, PR10 and PAL. Subsequent inoculation of BSMV:GFP-infected wheat with a wheat pathotype of Magnaporthe oryzae, the blast pathogen, resulted in decreased susceptibility. Penetration of epidermal cells and subsequent multiple cell colonization by M. oryzae was significantly reduced. This increased restriction of pathogen growth observed for BSMV:GFP infections with and without the viral coat protein gene. However, prior infection with BSMV:GFP had no effect on the development of a compatible isolate of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of powdery mildew.
