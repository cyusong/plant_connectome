The gaseous hormone ethylene has multiple roles in plant development and responses to external cues. Among these is the regulation of "Rhizobium"-induced nodulation in legumes. Extensive descriptive literature exists, but has been expanded to allow more mechanistic analysis through the application of genetics. Both mutants and transgenics displaying ethylene insensitivity have now been described, suggesting an intimate interplay of ethylene response, plant development and nodulation.
