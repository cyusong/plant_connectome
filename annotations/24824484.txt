['24824484', 'In animals, the nuclear lamina is a fibrillar meshwork on the inner surface of  the nuclear envelope, composed of coiled-coil lamin proteins and lamin binding  membrane proteins. Plants also have a meshwork on the inner surface of the  nuclear envelope, but little is known about its composition other than the  presence of members of the CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN) protein family, possible plant  lamin analogs. Here, we describe a candidate lamina component, based on two  Arabidopsis thaliana mutants (kaku2 and kaku4) with aberrant nuclear morphology.  The responsible gene in kaku2 encodes CRWN1, and the responsible gene in kaku4  encodes a plant-specific protein of unknown function (KAKU4) that physically  interacts with CRWN1 and its homolog CRWN4. Immunogold labeling revealed that  KAKU4 localizes at the inner nuclear membrane. KAKU4 deforms the nuclear envelope  in a dose-dependent manner, in association with nuclear membrane invagination and  stack formation. The KAKU4-dependent nuclear envelope deformation was enhanced by  overaccumulation of CRWN1, although KAKU4 can deform the nuclear envelope even in  the absence of CRWN1 and/or CRWN4. Together, these results suggest that plants  have evolved a unique lamina-like structure to modulate nuclear shape and size.', '2014 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.122168', 'Hara-Nishimura']
