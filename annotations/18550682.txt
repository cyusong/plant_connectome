Here, we analyzed the effects of light regulation on four selected histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me2, and H3K27me3) and the relationship of these histone modifications with the expression of representative light-regulated genes. We observed that the histone modifications examined and gene transcription were cooperatively regulated in response to changing light environments. Using H3K9ac as an example, our analysis indicated that histone modification patterns are set up very early and are relatively stable during Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedling development. Distinct photoreceptor systems are responsible for mediating the effects of different light qualities on histone modifications. Moreover, we found that light regulation of gene-specific histone modifications involved the known photomorphogenesis-related proteolytic system defined by the pleiotropic CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC/DE-ETOLIATED proteins and histone modification enzymes (such as HD1). Furthermore, our data suggest that light-regulated changes in histone modifications might be an intricate part of light-controlled gene transcription. Thus, it is possible that variations in histone modifications are an important physiological component of plant responses to changing light environments.
