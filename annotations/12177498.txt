['12177498', 'We have identified a new plant gene, AtCOX17, encoding a protein that shares  sequence similarity to COX17, a Cu-binding protein from yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) and vertebrates that mediates the delivery of Cu to the mitochondria  for the assembly of a functional cytochrome oxidase complex. The newly  characterized Arabidopsis protein has six Cys residues at positions corresponding  to those known to coordinate Cu binding in the yeast homolog. Moreover, we show  that the Arabidopsis COX17 cDNA complements a COX17 mutant of yeast restoring the  respiratory deficiency associated with that mutation. These two lines of evidence  indicate that the plant protein identified here is a functional equivalent of  yeast COX17 and might serve as a Cu delivery protein for the plant mitochondria.  COX17 was identified by investigating the hypersensitive response-like necrotic  response provoked in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves after harpin inoculation.  AtCOX17 expression was activated by high concentrations of Cu, bacterial  inoculation, salicylic acid treatment, and treatments that generated NO and  hydrogen peroxide. All of the conditions inducing COX17 are known to inhibit  mitochondrial respiration and to produce an increase of reactive oxygen species,  suggesting that gene induction occurs in response to stress situations that  interfere with mitochondrial function.', '2002 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.010963', 'Castresana']
