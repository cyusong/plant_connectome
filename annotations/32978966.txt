In filamentous fungi, hyphal growth depends on the continuous delivery of vesicles to the growing tips. It is unclear how fast-growing hyphae coordinate simultaneous cell extension and expansion in the tip cells. We have functionally characterized 12 TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain-containing proteins in Fusarium graminearum. Among them, FgMsb3 is found to regulate hyphal tip expansion and to be required for pathogenicity. The regulatory mechanism of FgMsb3 has been further investigated by genetic, high-resolution microscopy and high-throughput co-immunoprecipitation strategies. The FgMsb3 protein localizes at the polarisome and the hyphal apical dome (HAD) where it acts as a GTPase-activating protein for FgRab8 which is required for apical secretion-mediated growth and pathogenicity. Deletion of FgMSB3 causes excessive polarized trafficking but blocks the fusion of FgSnc1-associated vesicles to the plasma membrane. Moreover, we establish that FgSpa2 interacts with FgMsb3, enabling FgMsb3 tethering to the polarisome. Loss of FgSpa2 or other polarisome components (FgBud6 and FgPea2) causes complete shifting of FgMsb3 to the HAD and this affects the polarized growth and pathogenicity of the fungus. In summary, we conclude that FgSpa2 regulates FgMsb3-FgRab8 cascade and this is crucial for creating a steady-state equilibrium that maintains continuous polarized growth and contributes to the pathogenicity of F. graminearum.
