['16109415', 'We show that the thylakoid membrane phosphoprotein TMP14 is a novel subunit of  plant photosystem I (PSI). Blue native/SDS-PAGE and sucrose gradient  fractionation demonstrated the association of the protein exclusively with PSI.  We designate the protein PSI-P. The presence of PSI-P subunit in Arabidopsis  mutants lacking other PSI subunits was analyzed and suggested a location in the  proximity of PSI-L, -H and -O subunits. The PSI-P protein was not differentially  phosphorylated in state 1 and state 2.', '2005 Aug 29', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.07.061', 'Haldrup']
