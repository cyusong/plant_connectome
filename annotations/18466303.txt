['18466303', 'Suppressor of overexpression of constans1 (SOC1) is one of the flowering pathway  integrators and regulates the expression of LEAFY (LFY), which links floral  induction and floral development. However, the mechanism by which SOC1, a MADS  box protein, regulates LFY has proved elusive. Here, we show that SOC1 directly  binds to the distal and proximal region of the LFY promoter where critical  cis-elements are located. Intragenic suppressor mutant analysis shows that a  missense mutation in the MADS box of SOC1 causes loss of binding to the LFY  promoter as well as suppression of the flowering promotion function. The  full-length SOC1 protein locates in the cytoplasm if expressed alone in  protoplast transient expression assay, but relocates to the nucleus if expressed  with AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24), another flowering pathway integrator and a MADS box  protein. The domain analysis shows that co-localization of SOC1 and AGL24 is  mediated by the MADS box and the intervening region of SOC1. Finally, we show  that LFY is expressed only in those tissues where SOC1 and AGL24 expressions  overlap. Thus, we propose that heterodimerization of SOC1 and AGL24 is a key  mechanism in activating LFY expression.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03552.x', 'Lee']
