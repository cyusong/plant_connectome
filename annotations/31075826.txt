The <i>INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD)</i> genes comprise a conserved transcription factor family that regulates a variety of developmental and physiological processes in plants. Many recent studies have focused on the genetic characterization of IDD family members and revealed various biological functions, including modulation of sugar metabolism and floral transition, cold stress response, seed development, plant architecture, regulation of hormone signaling, and ammonium metabolism. In this review, we summarize the functions and working mechanisms of the <i>IDD</i> gene family in the regulatory network of metabolism and developmental processes.
