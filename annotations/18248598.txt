Piriformospora indica, an endophyte of the Sebacinaceae family, promotes growth and seed production of many plant species, including Arabidopsis. Growth of a T-DNA insertion line in PYK10 is not promoted and the plants do not produce more seeds in the presence of P. indica, although their roots are more colonized by the fungus than wild-type roots. Overexpression of PYK10 mRNA did not affect root colonization and the response to the fungus. PYK10 codes for a root- and hypocotyl-specific beta-glucosidase/myrosinase, which is implicated to be involved in plant defences against herbivores and pathogens. Expression of PYK10 is activated by the basic helix-loop-helix domain containing transcription factor NAI1, and two Arabidopsis lines with mutations in the NAI1 gene show the same response to P. indica as the PYK10 insertion line. PYK10 transcript and PYK10 protein levels are severely reduced in a NAI1 mutant, indicating that PYK10 and not the transcription factor NAI1 is responsible for the response to the fungus. In wild-type roots, the message level for a leucine-rich repeat protein LRR1, but not for plant defensin 1.2 (PDF1.2), is upregulated in the presence of P. indica. In contrast, in lines with reduced PYK10 levels the PDF1.2, but not LRR1, message level is upregulated in the presence of the fungus. We propose that PYK10 restricts root colonization by P. indica, which results in the repression of defence responses and the upregulation of responses leading to a mutualistic interaction between the two symbiotic partners.
