FUSCA3 (FUS3) is a master regulator of seed development important in establishing and maintaining embryonic identity whose expression is tightly regulated at genetic and epigenetic levels. Despite this prominent role, the control of FUS3 expression remains poorly understood. Promoter and functional complementation analyses provided insight into the regulation of FUS3. W-boxes present in the promoter proximal to the start of transcription are recognized by WRKY type-1 factors which are necessary for the activation of FUS3 expression. The RY motif, the binding site of B3 factors, is important for the activation of FUS3 in the embryo proper but not in the suspensor. The loss of a negative regulatory sequence (NRS) leads to preferential expression of FUS3 in the vasculature of vegetative tissues. Since the NRS includes the RY motif, mechanisms of activation and repression target adjacent or overlapping regions. These findings discriminate the regulation of FUS3 from that of LEAFY COTYLEDON2 by the control exerted by WRKY factors and by the presence of the RY motif, yet also confirm conservation of certain regulatory elements, thereby implicating potential regulation by BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BPC) factors and POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2).
