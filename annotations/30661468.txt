Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) belonging to Begomovirus family of Geminivirus is known to cause one of the most destructive diseases in tomato. Amongst various ToLCVs, a monopartite Tomato leaf curl Joydebpur virus (ToLCJoV) is most prevalent in eastern part of India. In the present study, we observed induced expression of one of the negative regulators of ethylene signaling pathway gene (LeCTR1) in ToLCJoV infected plants. The Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) induced silencing of the LeCTR1 gene provided enhanced tolerance to ToLCJoV infections. The leaf curling as well as ROS accumulation was significantly reduced in the viral infected LeCTR1 silenced plants. Induction of several defense marker genes (NPR1, PR1, PR5, AOS2, EIN2, EIN3 and ERF5) reinforced enhanced tolerance against ToLCJoV infection in the LeCTR1 silenced tomato. Overall, the present study provides evidence that silencing of LeCTR1 can be deployed to protect tomato from ToLCJoV infections.
