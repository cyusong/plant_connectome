It is known that when plant leaves are exposed to exogenously applied nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen derived from NO<sub>2</sub> is reduced to amino acid nitrogen. However, whether this is the sole metabolic fate of exogenously applied NO<sub>2</sub> is unclear. In this study, Arabidopsis leaves were exposed to 4 ppm <sup>15</sup>N-labeled NO<sub>2</sub> for 4 h in light, followed by capillary ion analysis and elemental analysis-mass spectrometry with an elemental analyzer connected directly to a mass spectrometer. We found that leaf cells exposed to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled NO<sub>2</sub> accumulated a large amount of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled nitrate. Neither <sup>15</sup>N-labeled nitrite nor endogenous nitrite was present in exposed leaves. It is likely that exogenously applied NO<sub>2</sub> is first converted to nitrite, and that nitrite is oxidized to nitrate in Arabidopsis leaf cells. The complete disappearance of nitrite derived from exogenously applied NO<sub>2</sub> and endogenous nitrite supports this mechanism.
