In this present study, we introduce a fundamental framework and provide information regarding the possible roles of GDSL-type esterase/lipase gene family in Arabidopsis. GDSL-type esterases/lipases are hydrolytic enzymes with multifunctional properties such as broad substrate specificity, regiospecificity, and stereoselectivity. In this study, we identified 105 GDSL-type esterase/lipase genes in Arabidopsis thaliana by conducting a comprehensive computational analysis. Expression studies indicated that GDSL-type lipase proteins showed varied expression patterns. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that AtGELP (Arabidopsis thaliana GDSL-type esterase/lipase protein) gene family was divided into four clades. The phylogenetic analysis, combined with protein motif architectures, and expression profiling were used to predict the roles AtGELP genes. To investigate the physical roles of the AtGELP gene family, we successfully screened 88 AtGELP T-DNA knockout lines for 54 AtGELP genes from 199 putative SALK T-DNA mutants. Transgenic plants of AtGELP genes were used to elucidate the phenotypic characteristics in various developmental stages or stress conditions. Our results suggest that the AtGELP genes have diverse physical functions such as affecting the germination rate and early growth of seedlings subjected to high concentrations of glucose, or being involved in biotic stress responses.
