UV-B constitutes a critical part of the sunlight reaching the earth surface. The homodimeric plant UV-B photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) monomerizes in response to UV-B and induces photomorphogenic responses, including UV-B acclimation and tolerance. REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (RUP1) and RUP2 are negative feedback regulators that operate by facilitating UVR8 ground state reversion through re-dimerization. Here we show that RUP1 and RUP2 are transcriptionally induced by cryptochrome photoreceptors in response to blue light, which is dependent on the bZIP transcriptional regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5). Elevated RUP1 and RUP2 levels under blue light enhance UVR8 re-dimerization, thereby negatively regulating UVR8 signalling and providing photoreceptor pathway cross-regulation in a polychromatic light environment, as is the case in nature. We further show that cryptochrome 1, as well as the red-light photoreceptor phytochrome B, contribute to UV-B tolerance redundantly with UVR8. Thus, photoreceptors for both visible light and UV-B regulate UV-B tolerance through an intricate interplay allowing the integration of diverse sunlight signals.
