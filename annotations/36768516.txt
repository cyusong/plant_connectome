The relationship between the variants of bitter taste receptor gene <i>TAS2R4</i>, dietary intake, and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. Hence, we aimed to examine the association of <i>TAS2R4</i> rs2233998 variants with T2DM incidence in middle-aged and older Korean adults to understand if their association was modulated by dietary intake. Data of the Ansan-Ansung cohort from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were used in this study. A total of 4552 Korean adults aged 40-69 years with no history of T2DM or cancer at baseline were followed-up for 16 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a 103-item food frequency questionnaire, and new T2DM cases were defined based on the World Health Organization and International Diabetes Federation criteria. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for T2DM incidence. During the mean follow-up period of 11.97 years, 1082 (23.77%) new T2DM cases were identified. Women carrying the TT genotype of <i>TAS2R4</i> rs2233998 exhibited 1.48 times higher incidence of T2DM (HR: 1.48; 95 CI: 1.13-1.93) than those carrying the CC genotype. <i>TAS2R4</i> rs2233998 variants were positively associated with the incidence of T2DM among Korean women with high intakes of carbohydrates or sugars and low intakes of fruits or vegetables. TT carrier women in the highest tertile of carbohydrate or sugar intake exhibited an increased incidence of T2DM (HR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.33-3.27 for carbohydrates; HR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.53-3.51 for sugars) than CC carrier women. Women carrying the TT genotype in the lowest tertile exhibited an increased incidence of T2DM (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.02-2.37 for vegetables; HR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.06-2.48 for fruits) than women carrying the CC genotype in the highest tertile of vegetable or fruit consumption. However, no association was observed between <i>TAS2R4</i> rs2233998 variants and dietary intake with T2DM incidence in Korean men. Our findings suggest that variants of <i>TAS2R4</i> rs2233998 are associated with T2DM incidence, and their associations are strengthened by excessive intake of carbohydrates or sugars and inadequate intake of fruits or vegetables. Diet encompassing optimal intake of carbohydrates or sugars and high intake of fruits or vegetables may minimize the risk of developing T2DM.
