['19806166', "Metabolism of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a major biologically active nitric  oxide (NO) species, is catalyzed by the evolutionally conserved GSNO reductase  (GSNOR). Previous studies showed that the Arabidopsis GSNOR1/HOT5 gene regulates  salicylic acid signaling and thermotolerance by modulating the intracellular  S-nitrosothiol level. Here, we report the characterization of the Arabidopsis  paraquat resistant2-1 (par2-1) mutant that shows an anti-cell death phenotype.  The production of superoxide in par2-1 is comparable to that of wild-type plants  when treated by paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride), suggesting  that PAR2 acts downstream of superoxide to regulate cell death. PAR2, identified  by positional cloning, is shown to be identical to GSNOR1/HOT5. The par2-1 mutant  carries a missense mutation in a highly conserved glycine, which renders the  mutant protein unstable. Compared to wild type, par2-1 mutant has a higher NO  level, as revealed by staining with 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate. Consistent  with this result, wild-type plants treated with an NO donor display resistance to  paraquat. Interestingly, the GSNOR1/HOT5/PAR2 protein level, other than its  steady-state mRNA level, is induced by paraquat, but is reduced by NO donors.  Taken together, these results suggest that GSNOR1/HOT5/PAR2 plays an important  role in regulating cell death in plant cells through modulating intracellular NO  level.", '2009 Dec', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2009.117', 'Zuo']
