High-temperature stress severely affects rice grain quality. While extensive research has been conducted at the physiological, transcriptional, and protein levels, it is still unknown how protein phosphorylation regulates seed development in high-temperature environments. Here, we explore the impact of high-temperature stress on the phosphoproteome of developing grains from two indica rice varieties, 9311 and Guangluai4 (GLA4), with different starch qualities. A total of 9994 phosphosites from 3216 phosphoproteins were identified in all endosperm samples. We identified several consensus phosphorylation motifs ([sP], [LxRxxs], [Rxxs], [tP]) induced by high-temperature treatment and revealed a core set of protein kinases, splicing factors, and regulatory factors in response to high-temperature stress, especially those involved in starch metabolism. A detailed phosphorylation scenario in the regulation of starch biosynthesis (AGPase, GBSSI, SSIIa, SSIIIa, BEI, BEIIb, ISA1, PUL, PHO1, PTST) in rice endosperm was proposed. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in phosphorylated enzymes related to starch synthesis (SSIIIa-Ser94, BEI-Ser562, BEI-Ser620, BEI-Ser821, BEIIb-Ser685, BEIIb-Ser715) were confirmed by Western blot analysis, which revealed that phosphorylation might play specific roles in amylopectin biosynthesis in response to high-temperature stress. The link between phosphorylation-mediated regulation and starch metabolism will provide new insights into the mechanism underlying grain quality development in response to high-temperature stress.
