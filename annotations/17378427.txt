An analysis, using microarrays, of gene expression in rice plants infected with Rice dwarf virus revealed significant decreases in levels of expression of genes that are involved in the formation of cell walls, reflecting the stunted growth of diseased plants. The expression of plastid-related genes also was suppressed, as anticipated from the white chlorotic appearance of infected leaves. By contrast, the expression of defense- and stress-related genes was enhanced after viral infection. These results suggest that virus-infected rice plants attempt to survive viral infection and replication by raising the levels of expression of defense- and stress-related genes while suppressing the expression of genes required for the elongation of cells and photosynthesis.
