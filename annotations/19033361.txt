['19033361', "The organs of a eudicot flower are specified by four functional classes, termed  class A, B, C and E, of MADS domain transcription factors. The combinatorial  formation of tetrameric complexes, so called 'floral quartets', between these  classes is widely believed to represent the molecular basis of floral organ  identity specification. As constituents of all complexes, the class E floral  homeotic proteins are thought to be of critical relevance for the formation of  floral quartets. However, experimental support for tetrameric complex formation  remains scarce. Here we provide physico-chemical evidence that in vitro  homotetramers of the class E floral homeotic protein SEPALLATA3 from Arabidopsis  thaliana bind cooperatively to two sequence elements termed 'CArG boxes' in a  phase-dependent manner involving DNA looping. We further show that the N-terminal  part of SEPALLATA3 lacking K3, a subdomain of the protein-protein interactions  mediating K domain, and the C-terminal domain, is sufficient for protein  dimerization, but not for tetramer formation and cooperative DNA binding. We  hypothesize that the capacity of class E MADS domain proteins to form tetrameric  complexes contributes significantly to the formation of floral quartets. Our  findings further suggest that the spacing and phasing of CArG boxes are important  parameters in the molecular mechanism by which floral homeotic proteins achieve  target gene specificity.", '2009 Jan', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkn900', 'Theissen']
