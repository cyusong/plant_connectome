In Medicago sativa nodulated roots, NR-dependent NO production is involved in maintaining energy state, presumably through phytoglobin NO respiration, under both salinity and hypoxia stress. The response to low and average salinity stress and to a 5 day-long flooding period was analyzed in M. sativa nodulated roots. The two treatments result in a decrease in the biological nitrogen fixation capacity and the energy state (evaluated by the ATP/ADP ratio), and conversely in an increase nitric oxide (NO) production. Under salinity and hypoxia treatments, the use of either sodium tungstate, an inhibitor of nitrate reductase (NR), or carboxy-PTIO, a NO scavenger, results in a decrease in NO production and ATP/ADP ratio, meaning that NR-dependent NO production participates to the maintenance of the nodulated roots energy state.

NR: !produces! NO
NO: !maintains! energy state
salinity/hypoxia: !decreases! biological nitrogen fixation capacity
salinity/hypoxia: !increases! NO production
sodium tungstate: !inhibits! NR
carboxy-PTIO: !scavenges! NO
NR: !participates in! maintenance of nodulated roots energy state
