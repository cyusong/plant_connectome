The cell wall is the primary interface between plant cells and their immediate environment and must balance multiple functionalities, including the regulation of growth, the entry of beneficial microbes, and protection against pathogens. Here, we demonstrate how API, a SCAR2 protein component of the SCAR/WAVE complex, controls the root cell wall architecture important for pathogenic oomycete and symbiotic bacterial interactions in legumes. A mutation in API results in root resistance to the pathogen Phytophthora palmivora and colonization defects by symbiotic rhizobia. Although api mutant plants do not exhibit significant overall growth and development defects, their root cells display delayed actin and endomembrane trafficking dynamics and selectively secrete less of the cell wall polysaccharide xyloglucan. Changes associated with a loss of API establish a cell wall architecture with altered biochemical properties that hinder P. palmivora infection progress. Thus, developmental stage-dependent modifications of the cell wall, driven by SCAR/WAVE, are important in balancing cell wall developmental functions and microbial invasion.
