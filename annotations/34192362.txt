In Arabidopsis, the high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter HAK5 is the major pathway for root K<sup>+</sup> uptake when below 100 µM; HAK5 responds to Low-K<sup>+</sup> (LK) stress by strongly and rapidly increasing its expression during K<sup>+</sup> -deficiency. Therefore, positive regulators of HAK5 expression have the potential to improve K<sup>+</sup> uptake under LK. Here, we show that mutants of the transcription factor MYB77 share a LK-induced leaf chlorosis phenotype, lower K<sup>+</sup> content, and lower Rb<sup>+</sup> uptake of the hak5 mutant, but not the shorter root growth, and that overexpression of MYB77 enhanced K<sup>+</sup> uptake and improved tolerance to LK stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MYB77 positively regulates the expression of HAK5, by binding to the HAK5 promoter and enhances high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake of roots. As such, our results reveal a novel pathway for enhancing HAK5 expression under LK stress, and provides a candidate for increasing the tolerance of plants to LK.
