['25846245', 'JAsmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins repress the activity of transcription factors  that execute responses to the plant hormone jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile). The  ZIM protein domain recruits the co-repressors NINJA and TOPLESS to JAZ-bound  transcription factors, and contains a highly conserved TIF[F/Y]XG motif that  defines the larger family of TIFY proteins to which JAZs belong. Here, we report  that diverse plant species contain genes encoding putative non-TIFY JAZ proteins,  including a previously unrecognized JAZ repressor in Arabidopsis (JAZ13, encoded  by At3g22275). JAZ13 is most closely related to JAZ8 and includes divergent EAR,  TIFY/ZIM, and Jas motifs. Unlike JAZ8, however, JAZ13 contains a Ser-rich  C-terminal tail that is a site for phosphorylation. Overexpression of JAZ13  resulted in reduced sensitivity to JA, attenuation of wound-induced expression of  JA-response genes, and decreased resistance to insect herbivory. JAZ13 interacts  with the bHLH transcription factor MYC2 and the co-repressor TOPLESS but,  consistent with the absence of a TIFY motif, neither NINJA nor other JAZs.  Analysis of single and higher-order T-DNA insertion jaz null mutants provided  further evidence that JAZ13 is a repressor JA signaling. Our results demonstrate  that proteins outside the TIFY family are functional JAZ repressors and further  suggest that this expansion of the JAZ family allows fine-tuning of JA-mediated  transcriptional responses.', '2015 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12841', 'Howe']
