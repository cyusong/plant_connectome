['18567791', 'Flavonoids are secondary metabolites known to modulate plant growth and  development. A primary function of flavonols, a subgroup of flavonoids, is  thought to be the modification of auxin fluxes in the plant. Flavonols in the  cell are glycosylated, and the repressor of lrx1 (rol1) mutants of Arabidopsis  thaliana, affected in rhamnose biosynthesis, have a modified flavonol  glycosylation profile. A detailed analysis of the rol1-2 allele revealed  hyponastic growth, aberrant pavement cell and stomatal morphology in cotyledons,  and defective trichome formation. Blocking flavonoid biosynthesis suppresses the  rol1-2 shoot phenotype, suggesting that it is induced by the modified flavonol  profile. The hyponastic cotyledons of rol1-2 are likely to be the result of a  flavonol-induced increase in auxin concentration. By contrast, the pavement cell,  stomata, and trichome formation phenotypes appear not to be induced by the  modified auxin distribution. Together, these results suggest that changes in the  composition of flavonols can have a tremendous impact on plant development  through both auxin-induced and auxin-independent processes.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.053249', 'Klein']
