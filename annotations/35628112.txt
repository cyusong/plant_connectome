Photomorphogenic responses of etiolated seedlings include the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and opening of the apical hook. In addition, dark-grown seedlings respond to light by the formation of adventitious roots (AR) on the hypocotyl. How light signaling controls adventitious rooting is less well understood. Hereto, we analyzed adventitious rooting under different light conditions in wild type and photomorphogenesis mutants in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Etiolation was not essential for AR formation but raised the competence to form AR under white and blue light. The blue light receptors CRY1 and PHOT1/PHOT2 are key elements contributing to the induction of AR formation in response to light. Furthermore, etiolation-controlled competence for AR formation depended on the COP9 signalosome, E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC (COP1), the COP1 interacting SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) kinase family members (SPA1,2 and 3) and Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIF). In contrast, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), suppressed AR formation. These findings provide a genetic framework that explains the high and low AR competence of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> hypocotyls that were treated with dark, and light, respectively. We propose that light-induced auxin signal dissipation generates a transient auxin maximum that explains AR induction by a dark to light switch.
