The impact of mineral N supply, N-free or NO3(-) with or without NH4+, on the subsequent uptake of NO3(-) by maritime pine seedlings associated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Rhizopogon roseolus was studied using ion-selective microelectrodes. NO3(-) net fluxes into N-starved non-mycorrhizal short roots (NMSRs) were low and measurable only over the NO3(-) concentration range of 0-70 microM. The simple kinetics observed in those roots may reflect the dominant operation of a high-affinity NO3(-) transport system (HATS) which is constitutive. NO3(-) pretreatment increased the NO3(-) net fluxes and led to a complex kinetics that may reflect the operation of other HATS. A simple kinetics was observed in plants pre-incubated at high NH4+ concentration. In contrast, NO3(-) uptake kinetics presented only one saturation phase in the fungus, whether associated with the plant or not. NO3(-) uptake was greater after a pretreatment in N-free or NO3 (-) solution, but NH4+ pretreatment led to a threefold reduction in NO3 (-) uptake. These results suggest that the regulation of NO3(-) transport systems varies between the host and the fungal partner. This variation is likely to contribute to the positive effect of mycorrhizal association on N uptake in plants when the N supply is low and fluctuating.
