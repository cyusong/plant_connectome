The cultivated Camellia sasanqua forms a divergent double flower pattern, and the stamen petaloid is a vital factor in the phenomenon. However, the regulation mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, a comprehensive comparative transcriptome analysis of the wild-type, "semi-double", "peony double", and "rose double" was performed. The cluster analysis of global gene expression level showed petal and stamen difficulty separable in double flower. The crucial pathway and genes related to double flower patterns regulation were identified by pairwise comparisons and weighted gene coexpression network (WGCNA). Divergent genes expression, such as AUX1 and AHP, are involved in plant hormone signaling and photosynthesis, and secondary metabolites play an important role. Notably, the diversity of a petal-specific model exhibits a similar molecular signature to the stamen, containing extensin protein and PSBO1, supporting the stamen petaloid point. Moreover, the expansion of class A gene activity influenced the double flower formation, showing that the key function of gene expression was probably demolished. Overall, this work confirmed the ABCE model and provided new insights for elucidating the molecular signature of double formation.
