['11108847', 'E2F/DP complexes play a pivotal role in the regulation of the G1/S transition in  animals. Recently, plant E2F homologs have been cloned, but DP-related sequences  have not been identified so far. Here we report that Arabidopsis thaliana  contains at least two different DP-related genes, AtDPa and AtDPb. They exhibit  an overall domain organization similar to that of their animal counterparts,  although phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that they form a separate subgroup.  AtDPs efficiently heterodimerize in vitro with the Arabidopsis E2F-related  proteins, AtE2Fa and AtE2Fb through their dimerization domains. AtDPa and AtE2Fa  are predominantly produced in actively dividing cells with highest transcript  levels in early S phase cells.', '2000 Dec 1', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(00)02238-9', 'Inze']
