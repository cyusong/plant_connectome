Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) can participate in multiple signalling pathways and are considered one of the most critical components of the early events of intercellular signalling. As an RLK, the ERECTA family (ERf), which comprises ERECTA (ER), ERECTA-Like1 (ERL1), and ERECTA-Like2 (ERL2) in Arabidopsis, regulates multiple signalling pathways in plant growth and development. Despite its indispensability, detailed information on ERf-manipulated signalling pathways remains elusive. In this review, we attempt to summarize the essential roles of the ERf in plant organ morphogenesis, including shoot apical meristem, stem, and reproductive organ development.
