Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have attracted considerable interest from plant pathologists since they regulate plant defenses via the hypersensitive response (HR) and stomatal closure. Here, we introduce the regulatory mechanisms of NO and ROS bursts and discuss the role of such bursts in HR and stomatal closure. It showed that epidermal sections of leaves respond to pathogens by the rapid and intense production of intracellular ROS and NO. Oxidative stress and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induce stomatal closure. Catalase and peroxidase-deficient plants are also hyperresponsive to pathogen invasion, suggesting a role for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in HR-mediated cell death. The analysis reveals that ROS and NO play important roles in stomatal closure and HR that involves multiple pathways. Therefore, multi-disciplinary and multi-omics combined analysis is crucial to the advancement of ROS and NO research and their role in plant defense mechanism.
