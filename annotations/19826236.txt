Increasing instances prove that nitric oxide (NO) plays a significant role in mediating root growth and development, and it is reported that NO acts as a messenger and mediates the auxin-induced adventitious roots (AR) developing process in cucumber explants. Compared with the current understanding of AR development in dicots, knowledge of the molecular and physiological mechanisms of crown root (CR) development in monocots is limited, and the roles of NO in CR initiation and development are still far from clear. Our recent studies demonstrate that a critical concentration of endogenous NO is indispensable for CR primordia initiation, the reduction of endogenous NO content blocks CR primordia initiation and decreases CR number in rice seedlings. In this addendum, Base on the results of our studies and previous reports, we supposed that CR formtion in monocots and AR formtion in dicots possible take part in the same NO signaling pathway, althoug in dicots, AR are formed under unusual circumstances and belong to the abnormal developmental program, and in monocot cereals, CR are genetically determined roots and belong to the normal developmental program of cereals. At last, we advanced a proposed schematic model showing the NO signaling pathway of CR emergence in monocots.

NO: !mediates! root growth and development 
NO: !induces! adventitious roots 
NO: !initiates! crown root primordia 
NO: !blocks! crown root primordia initiation 
NO: !signals! crown root emergence 
CR: !belongs to! normal developmental program 
AR: !belongs to! abnormal developmental program
