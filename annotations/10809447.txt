['10809447', 'It is believed that phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism plays a central role in  signalling pathways in both animals and higher plants. PI is synthesized from  CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DG) and myo-inositol by phosphatidylinositol synthase (PI  synthase, EC 2.7.8.11). Here we report the identification of a plant cDNA  (AtPIS1) encoding a 26 kDa PI synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana. The plant  enzyme as deduced from its cDNA sequence shares 35-41% identical amino acids with  PI synthases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammals. AtPIS1 functionally  complements a mutant of S. cerevisiae with a lesion in PI synthase, and  recombinant AtPIS1 protein present in yeast membranes strongly depends on the two  principal substrates, myo-inositol and CDP-DG, and requires Mg2+ ions for full  activity.', '2000 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006308909105', 'Mueller-Roeber']
