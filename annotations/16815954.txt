['16815954', 'The shoot apical meristem contains cells that undergo continual growth and  division to generate the building blocks for the aerial portion of the plant. As  cells leave the meristem, they undergo differentiation to form specific cell  types. Most notably, heterotrophic cells of the meristem rapidly gain autotrophic  capability by synthesis and assembly of components of the chloroplast. At the  same time, cells undergo enlargement via vacuolation. Despite significant  advances in the characterization of transcriptional networks involved in meristem  maintenance and leaf determination, our understanding of the actual mechanism of  meristem cell differentiation remains very limited. Using a microinduction  technique, we show that local, transient overexpression of a  retinoblastoma-related (RBR) protein in the shoot apical meristem is sufficient  to trigger cells in the meristem to undergo the initial stages of  differentiation. Taken together with recent data showing that RBR protein plays a  key role in restricting stem cell differentiation in the root apical meristem,  our data contribute to an emerging picture of RBR proteins as a central part of  the mechanism controlling meristem cell differentiation.', '2006 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.083022', 'Fleming']
