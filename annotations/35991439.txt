Lentil is one of the essential legume crops, which provides protein for humans and animals. This legume can improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, which is imperative in low-fertility soils. The growth and productivity of lentil could be enhanced through improving nutrition and root revitalization. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of root activator (RA) and phosphorus (P) application on morphological, physiological, agronomic, and quality traits of lentil under newly reclaimed low-fertility sandy soil in an arid environment. The RA was applied at four levels of 0 (RA0-untreated control), 1.25 (RA1), 2.5 (RA2), and 3.75 (RA3) l ha<sup>-1</sup>. RA contained 9% potassium humate, 1,600 ppm indole butyric acid, 200 ppm gibberellic acid, and 200 ppm naphthalene acetic acid. The recommended rate of phosphorus (P) fertilization in the newly reclaimed low-fertility sandy soil (75 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>) was applied, and its amount was increased and decreased by 25 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> vs. non-added control. Thus, P rates were applied at four rates 0 (P0; control), 50 (P1), 75 (P2), and 100 (P3) kg phosphorus pentoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) ha<sup>-1</sup>. Our results revealed that treated lentil plants with the high levels of both treatments (RA3 and P3) exhibited superiority in root measurements (root length, total number of nodules plant<sup>-1</sup>, number of active nodules plant<sup>-1</sup>, dry weights of active nodules, and total root), nitrogenase activity, chlorophyll <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, carotenoids, yield traits, and seed proteins and carbohydrates. However, the recommended P level (75 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>, P2) under the high level of RA (3.75 l ha<sup>-1</sup>, RA3) displayed non-significant differences in yield traits (plant height, 1,000-seed weight, seed yield ha<sup>-1</sup>) and quality traits (protein and carbohydrate) with the high P level (100 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>, P3). Accordingly, its recommended economically and environmentally to use this coapplication of RA3 and P3 in low-fertility soil for better lentil growth, and seed yield and quality.
