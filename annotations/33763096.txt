Micronutrient malnutrition is one of the main public health problems in many parts of the world. This problem raises the attention of all valuable sources of micronutrients for the human diet, such as common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.). In this research, a panel of 174 accessions representing Croatian common bean landraces was phenotyped for seed content of eight nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Mn), and genotyped using 6,311 high-quality DArTseq-derived SNP markers. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was then performed to identify new genetic sources for improving seed mineral content. Twenty-two quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) associated with seed nitrogen content were discovered on chromosomes Pv01, Pv02, Pv03, Pv05, Pv07, Pv08, and Pv10. Five QTNs were associated with seed phosphorus content, four on chromosome Pv07, and one on Pv08. A single significant QTN was found for seed calcium content on chromosome Pv09 and for seed magnesium content on Pv08. Finally, two QTNs associated with seed zinc content were identified on Pv06 while no QTNs were found to be associated with seed potassium, iron, or manganese content. Our results demonstrate the utility of GWAS for understanding the genetic architecture of seed nutritional traits in common bean and have utility for future enrichment of seed with macro- and micronutrients through genomics-assisted breeding.
