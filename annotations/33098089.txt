['33098089', 'Vegetable oil is a major edible oil and an important industrial raw material.  However, breeders have found it challenging to improve the oil content of crop  seeds, and little is known about regulators with the potential to increase oil  content via molecular engineering in modern oil crop breeding. We reported an  F-box protein, Arabidopsis thaliana MYB Interaction Factor 1 (AtMIF1), which is a  member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 complex involved in the 26S proteasome  protein degradation pathway. AtMIF1 physically interacts with MYB domain protein  5 (MYB5), which results in MYB5 degradation, so that transcriptional activation  of the MYB/bHLH/WD-repeat (MBW) complex does not occur normally and GLABRA2  (GL2), encoding an inhibitor of oil content and functioning as a direct  downstream gene of MBW, is not properly transcribed. AtMIF1 functioned as a  positive regulator that increases oil content by attenuating GL2 inhibition. We  overexpressed AtMIF1 and obtained transgenic plants with significantly higher  seed oil contents. Importantly, both vegetative and reproductive growth of the  transgenic plants appeared normal. In summary, this work reveals a novel  regulator, AtMIF1, and a new regulatory pathway, 26S proteasome-AtMIF1-MYB5, for  increasing the oil content of seeds without affecting plant growth, thus  facilitating oil crop breeding.', '2021 Feb', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.17016', 'ORCID:']
