Seeds are dormant and desiccated structures, filled with storage products to be used after germination. These properties are determined by the maturation program, which starts, in Arabidopsis thaliana, mid-embryogenesis, at about the same time and developmental stage in all the seeds in a fruit. The two factors, chronological and developmental time, are closely entangled during seed development, so their relative contribution to the transition to maturation is not well understood. It is also unclear whether that transition is determined autonomously by each seed or whether it depends on signals from the fruit. The onset of maturation follows the cellularization of the endosperm, and it has been proposed that there exists a causal relationship between both processes. We explored all these issues by analyzing markers for maturation in Arabidopsis mutant seeds that develop at a slower pace, or where endosperm cellularization happens too early, too late, or not at all. Our data show that the developmental stage of the embryo is the key determinant of the initiation of maturation, and that each seed makes that transition autonomously. We also found that, in contrast with previous models, endosperm cellularization is not required for the onset of maturation, suggesting that this transition is independent of the hexose/sucrose ratio in the seed. Our observations indicate that the mechanisms that control endosperm cellularization, embryo growth, and embryo maturation act independently of each other.
