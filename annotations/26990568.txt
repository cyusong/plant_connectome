The evolution of predominant self-fertilization from cross-fertilization in plants is accompanied by diverse changes to morphology, ecology and genetics, some of which likely result from regulatory changes in gene expression. We examined changes in gene expression during early stages in the transition to selfing in populations of animal-pollinated Eichhornia paniculata with contrasting mating patterns. We crossed plants from outcrossing and selfing populations and tested for the presence of allele-specific expression (ASE) in floral buds and leaf tissue of F1 offspring, indicative of cis-regulatory changes. We identified 1365 genes exhibiting ASE in floral buds and leaf tissue. These genes preferentially expressed alleles from outcrossing parents. Moreover, we found evidence that genes exhibiting ASE had a greater nonsynonymous diversity compared to synonymous diversity in the selfing parents. Our results suggest that the transition from outcrossing to high rates of self-fertilization may have the potential to shape the cis-regulatory genomic landscape of angiosperm species, but that the changes in ASE may be moderate, particularly during the early stages of this transition.
