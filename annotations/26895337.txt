Strigolactones control various aspects of plant development, including root architecture. Here, we review how strigolactones act in the root and survey the strigolactone specificity of signaling components that affect root development. Strigolactones are a group of secondary metabolites produced in plants that have been assigned multiple roles, of which the most recent is hormonal activity. Over the last decade, these compounds have been shown to regulate various aspects of plant development, such as shoot branching and leaf senescence, but a growing body of literature suggests that these hormones play an equally important role in the root. In this review, we present all known root phenotypes linked to strigolactones. We examine the expression and presence of the main players in biosynthesis and signaling of these hormones and bring together the available information that allows us to explain how strigolactones act to modulate the root system architecture.
