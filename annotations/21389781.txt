Microbial pathogens inflict large losses to agriculture annually and thus mechanisms of plant resistance and how to deploy them to enhance disease resistance in crops are foci of much research interest. We recently described the important role of ethylene and Ethylene Response transcription Factors (ERFs), particularly MtERF1-1, in mediating resistance to the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani in the model legume, Medicago truncatula. Previous studies on the closely related AtERF14, a master regulator of ethylene dependent defenses including other ERFs, suggested that in Arabidopsis these defenses were not essential for resistance to the same R. solani isolate but were required for resistance to another fungal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum. Medicago plants with roots over-expressing MtERF1-1 were challenged with F. oxysporum but showed no altered resistance. These results further support a potential for divergent roles of ethylene associated defenses in different plant hosts responding to the same pathogen.

MtERF1-1: !mediates! resistance to Rhizoctonia solani 
AtERF14: !regulates! ethylene dependent defenses 
MtERF1-1: !over-expresses in! Medicago plants 
F. oxysporum: !resistance not altered by! MtERF1-1 over-expression
