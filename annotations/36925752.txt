Multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a new chemical application tool for tall stalk tropical crop <i>Areca catechu</i>, which could improve deposit performance, reduce operator healthy risk, and increase spraying efficiency. In this work, a spraying experiment was carried out in two <i>A. catechu</i> fields with two leaf area index (LAI) values, and different operational parameters were set. Spray deposit quality, spray drift, and ground loss were studied and evaluated. The results showed that the larger the LAI of <i>A. catechu</i>, the lesser the coverage of the chemical deposition. The maximum coverage could reach 4.28% and the minimum 0.33%. At a flight speed of 1.5 m/s, sprayed droplets had the best penetration and worst ground loss. The overall deposition effect was poor when the flight altitudes were greater than 11.09 m and the flight speed was over 2.5 m/s. Comparing flight speed of 2.5 to 1.5 m/s, the overall distance of 90% of the total drift increased to double under the same operating parameters. This study presents reference data for UAV chemical application in <i>A. catechu</i> protection.
