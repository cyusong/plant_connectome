Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is an effective plant immunity elicitor; however, its induction mechanism in plants is complex and needs further investigation. In this study, the Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (hereafter called DC3000) interaction was used to investigate the induction effect and the underlying mechanisms of COS. COS is effective in inducing resistance to DC3000 in Arabidopsis, and our results demonstrate that treatment with COS 3 days before DC3000 inoculation provided the most effective resistance. Disease severity in jar1 (jasmonic acid [JA]-deficient mutant), NahG, and sid2 (salicylic acid [SA]-deficient mutants) suggest both the SA and JA pathways are required for the Arabidopsis response to DC3000. COS pretreatment induced resistance in wild type (WT), jar1, and also, although to a lesser degree, in NahG and sid2 plants, implying that the SA and JA pathways play redundant roles in COS-induced resistance to DC3000. In COS-pretreated plants, expression of genes related to the SA pathway (PR1, PR2, and PR5) and SA content increased in both WT and jar1. Moreover, expression of genes related to the JA pathway (PDF1.2 and VSP2) and JA content both increased in WT and NahG. In conclusion, COS induces resistance to DC3000 in Arabidopsis by activating both SA- and JA-mediated pathways, although SA and JA pathways play redundant roles in this COS-induced resistance.
