The responses of juvenile plants of forest crops to drought stress are a key stage in the survival of forest populations. In this work, a suitable experimental system to study the early drought resistance mechanisms and signaling in a drought-tolerant clone (C14) of Eucalyptus globulus Labill is proposed. This system, using hydroponic culture and an osmotic agent, polyethylene glycol 8000, was demonstrated to induce severe stress in the root area, affecting the responses of the plantlets at the aerial level. These responses were very fast, beginning only 3h after the induction of stress, and the results highlight the roles of xylematic abscisic acid (ABA) and pH changes over other signals, such as cytokinins, as early chemical signals in rapid water stress. The relationship between these chemical factors, ABA and pH, and the physiological and water parameters observed were significant, supporting their proposed principal role. This work aids our understanding of underlying responses to hydrological limitations of forest crops, and provides valuable information for further physiological and molecular studies of water stress in this and other tree species.
