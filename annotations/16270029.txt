['16270029', 'Iron (Fe) is necessary for all living cells, but its bioavailability is often  limited. Fe deficiency limits agriculture in many areas and affects over a  billion human beings worldwide. In mammals, NRAMP2/DMT1/DCT1 was identified as a  major pathway for Fe acquisition and recycling. In plants, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4  are induced under Fe deficiency. The similitude of AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4  expression patterns and their common targeting to the vacuole, together with the  lack of obvious phenotype in nramp3-1 and nramp4-1 single knockout mutants,  suggested a functional redundancy. Indeed, the germination of nramp3 nramp4  double mutants is arrested under low Fe nutrition and fully rescued by high Fe  supply. Mutant seeds have wild type Fe content, but fail to retrieve Fe from the  vacuolar globoids. Our work thus identifies for the first time the vacuole as an  essential compartment for Fe storage in seeds. Our data indicate that  mobilization of vacuolar Fe stores by AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 is crucial to support  Arabidopsis early development until efficient systems for Fe acquisition from the  soil take over.', '2005 Dec 7', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600864', 'Thomine']
