In plants, jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins (JAZs) act as critical regulators, interacting physically with transcription factors (TFs) and other transcriptional regulators to modulate jasmonate (JA)-responsive gene expression and participate in crosstalk with other hormone signalling pathways. Identifying novel JAZ-interacting proteins will provide new insights into JA signalling cascades in plants. Here, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify 70 NtJAZ1-interacting proteins, including an A/T-rich interaction domain containing protein 1 (NtAIDP1) from JA-treated tobacco Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells. NtAIDP1 is localised in the nucleus and interacts with NtJAZ1 via its C-terminal heat shock protein 20 (HSP) domain. Aside from NtJAZ1, NtAIDP1 also interacts with other JA-inducible NtJAZs, including NtJAZ2b, NtJAZ2b.2, NtJAZ5, NtJAZ7, NtJAZ11 and NtJAZ12, but not with NtJAZ3, NtJAZ3b or NtJAZ10, and interacts with NtNINJA, NtDELLA1 and NtDELLA2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, NtAIDP1 binds to the AT-rich region of the GAG fragment of the putrescine N-methyltransferase 1a (NtPMT1a) promoter and activates the transcriptional activity of the GAG fragment, whereas NtMYC2a interacts with and competitively inhibits the transactivational activity of NtAIDP1 in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Overexpression of NtAIDP1 promotes the transcription of NtPDF1.2 and NtJAZ1, but has little effect on the expression of NtPMT1a, quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase 2 (NtQPT2), and NtMYC2a in tobacco. These results indicate that NtAIDP1 is a new component of the JA signalling pathway and is involved in JA-regulated gene expression.
