During embryo development, the vascular precursors and ground tissue stem cells divide to renew themselves and produce the vascular tissue, endodermal cells, and cortical cells. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating division of these stem cells have remained largely elusive. In this study, we show that loss of function of SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) genes results in aberrant embryo development. Fewer cortical, endodermal, and vascular cells are generated in the embryos of serk1 serk2 bak1 triple mutants. WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) is ectopically expressed in vascular cells of serk1 serk2 bak1 embryos. The first transverse division of vascular precursors in mid-globular embryos and second asymmetric division of ground tissue stem cells in early-heart embryos are abnormally altered to a longitudinal division. The embryo defects can be partially rescued by constitutively activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase YODA (YDA) and MAPK kinase MKK5. Taken together, our results reveal that SERK-mediated signals regulate division patterns of vascular precursors and ground tissue stem cells, likely via the YDA-MKK4/5 cascade, during embryo development.
