Cymbidium ensifolium L. is known for its ornamental value and is frequently used in cosmetics. Information about the salt stress response of C. ensifolium is scarce. In this study, we reported the physiological and transcriptomic responses of C. ensifolium leaves under the influence of 100 mM NaCl stress for 48 (T48) and 96 (T96) hours. Leaf Na<sup>+</sup> content, activities of the antioxidant enzymes i.e., superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and ascorbate peroxidase, and malondialdehyde content were increased in salt-stressed leaves of C. ensifolium. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a relatively high number of genes were differentially expressed in CKvsT48 (17,249) compared to CKvsT96 (5,376). Several genes related to salt stress sensing (calcium signaling, stomata closure, cell-wall remodeling, and ROS scavenging), ion balance (Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>), ion homeostasis (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios), and phytohormone signaling (abscisic acid and brassinosteroid) were differentially expressed in CKvsT48, CKvsT96, and T48vsT96. In general, the expression of genes enriched in these pathways was increased in T48 compared to CK while reduced in T96 compared to T48. Transcription factors (TFs) belonging to more than 70 families were differentially expressed; the major families of differentially expressed TFs included bHLH, NAC, MYB, WRKY, MYB-related, and C3H. A Myb-like gene (CenREV3) was further characterized by overexpressing it in Arabidopsis thaliana. CenREV3's expression was decreased with the prolongation of salt stress. As a result, the CenREV3-overexpression lines showed reduced root length, germination %, and survival % suggesting that this TF is a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance. These results provide the basis for future studies to explore the salt stress response-related pathways in C. ensifolium.
