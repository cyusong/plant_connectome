Starch is a major component of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) endosperm and is an important part of the human diet. The functions of many starch synthesis genes have been elucidated. However, little is known about their regulatory mechanisms in wheat. Here, we identified a novel NAC transcription factor, TaNAC019-A1 (TraesCS3A02G077900), that negatively regulates starch synthesis in wheat and rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperms. TaNAC019-A1 was highly expressed in the endosperm of developing grains and encoded a nucleus-localized transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of TaNAC019-A1 in rice and wheat led to significantly reduced starch content, kernel weight, and kernel width. The TaNAC019-A1-overexpression wheat lines had smaller A-type starch granules and fewer B-type starch granules than wild-type. Moreover, TaNAC019-A1 could directly bind to the 'ACGCAG' motif in the promoter regions of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit 1 (TaAGPS1-A1, TraesCS7A02G287400) and TaAGPS1-B1 (TraesCS7B02G183300) and repress their expression, thereby inhibiting starch synthesis in wheat endosperm. One haplotype of TaNAC019-B1 (TaNAC019-B1-Hap2, TraesCS3B02G092800) was positively associated with thousand-kernel weight and underwent positive selection during the Chinese wheat breeding process. Our data demonstrate that TaNAC019-A1 is a negative regulator of starch synthesis in wheat endosperm and provide novel insight into wheat yield improvement.
