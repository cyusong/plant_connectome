A role of the plant hormone cytokinin in regulating the development and activity of chloroplasts was described soon after its discovery as a plant growth regulator more than 50 years ago. Its promoting action on chloroplast ultrastructure and chlorophyll synthesis has been reported repeatedly, especially during etioplast-to-chloroplast transition. Recently, a protective role of the hormone for the photosynthetic apparatus during high light stress was shown. Details about the molecular mechanisms of cytokinin action on plastids are accumulating from genetic and transcriptomic studies. The cytokinin receptors AHK2 and AHK3 are mainly responsible for the transduction of the cytokinin signal to B-type response regulators, in particular ARR1, ARR10, and ARR12, which are transcription factors of the two-component system mediating cytokinin functions. Additional transcription factors linking cytokinin and chloroplast development include CGA1, GNC, HY5, GLK2, and CRF2. In this review, we summarize early and more recent findings of the long-known relationship between the hormone and the organelle and describe crosstalk between cytokinin, light, and other hormones during chloroplast development.
