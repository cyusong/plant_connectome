['19755540', 'Major storage reserves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds are  triacylglycerols (seed oils) and proteins. Seed oil content is severely reduced  for the regulatory mutant wrinkled1 (wri1-1; At3g54320) and for a double mutant  in two isoforms of plastidic pyruvate kinase (pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha; At5g52920 and  At3g22960). Both already biochemically well-characterized mutants were now  studied by (13)C metabolic flux analysis of cultured developing embryos based on  comparison with their respective genetic wild-type backgrounds. For both  mutations, in seeds as well as in cultured embryos, the oil fraction was strongly  reduced while the fractions of proteins and free metabolites increased. Flux  analysis in cultured embryos revealed changes in nutrient uptakes and fluxes into  biomass as well as an increase in tricarboxylic acid cycle activity for both  mutations. While in both wild types plastidic pyruvate kinase (PK(p)) provides  most of the pyruvate for plastidic fatty acid synthesis, the flux through PK(p)  is reduced in pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha by 43% of the wild-type value. In wri1-1, PK(p)  flux is even more reduced (by 82%), although the genes PKpbeta(1) and PKpalpha  are still expressed. Along a common paradigm of metabolic control theory, it is  hypothesized that a large reduction in PK(p) enzyme activity in  pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha has less effect on PK(p) flux than multiple smaller reductions  in glycolytic enzymes in wri1-1. In addition, only in the wri1-1 mutant is the  large reduction in PK(p) flux compensated in part by an increased import of  cytosolic pyruvate and by plastidic malic enzyme. No such limited compensatory  bypass could be observed in pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.144121', 'Schwender']
