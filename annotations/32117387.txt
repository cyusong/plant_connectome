The rice XA21 and XA3 pattern receptor kinases, derived from <i>Oryza longistaminata</i> and an <i>Oryza. sativa japonica</i> cultivar Wase Aikoku 3, respectively, confer resistance to strains of the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), the causal agent of rice bacterial blight disease. Previously, we showed that transfer of <i>Xa21</i> to the model rice cultivar Kitaake enhances resistance to <i>Xoo</i>. In this manuscript we demonstrate that Kitaake expressing <i>Xa3</i> confers resistance to <i>Xoo</i> strain PXO79 and that the stress-related marker genes <i>PR10b</i> and <i>KO5</i> are upregulated in <i>Xoo</i>-infected <i>Xa3</i> rice leaves. We also show that rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2 (OsSERK2) positively regulates XA3-mediated immunity in Kitaake. We found that overexpression of XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15) and XB24, two negative regulators of XA21-mediated immunity, do not affect XA3-mediated immunity in the Kitaake genetic background. Our results indicate that the rice immune receptors XA21 and XA3 employ both shared and distinct signaling components in their response to <i>Xoo</i>. The results are important to further understand pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice. Furthermore, the presence of Kitaake rice carrying <i>Xa3</i> will facilitate genetic research to study the XA3-mediated immunity.
