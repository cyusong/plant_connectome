Haustoria of parasitic plants have evolved sophisticated traits to successfully infect host plants. The degradation and modification of host cell walls enable the haustorium to effectively invade host tissues. This study focused on two <i>APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR</i> (<i>ERF</i>) genes and a set of the cell wall enzyme genes principally expressed during the haustorial invasion of <i>Cuscuta campestris</i> Yuncker. The orthogroups of the TF and cell wall enzyme genes have been implicated in the cell wall degradation and modification activities in the abscission of tomatoes, which are currently the phylogenetically closest non-parasitic model species of <i>Cuscuta</i> species. Although haustoria are generally thought to originate from root tissues, our results suggest that haustoria have further optimized invasion potential by recruiting regulatory modules from other biological processes.

ERF: !affects! Cell wall enzyme genes
TF: !regulates! Cell wall enzyme genes
Haustoria: !recruits! Regulatory modules
Tomatoes: !phylogenetically closest to! Cuscuta species
