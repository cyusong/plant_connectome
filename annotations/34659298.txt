Gene pairs resulting from whole genome duplication (WGD), so-called ohnologous genes, are retained if at least one member of the pair undergoes neo- or sub-functionalization. Phylogenetic analyses of the ohnologous genes <i>ALBOSTRIANS</i> (<i>HvAST/HvCMF7</i>) and <i>ALBOSTRIANS-LIKE</i> (<i>HvASL</i>/<i>HvCMF3</i>) of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) revealed them as members of a subfamily of genes coding for CCT motif (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE and TIMING OF CAB1) proteins characterized by a single CCT domain and a putative N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide. Recently, we showed that <i>HvCMF7</i> is needed for chloroplast ribosome biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that mutations in <i>HvCMF3</i> lead to seedlings delayed in development. They exhibit a yellowish/light green - <i>xantha -</i> phenotype and successively develop pale green leaves. Compared to wild type, plastids of mutant seedlings show a decreased PSII efficiency, impaired processing and reduced amounts of ribosomal RNAs; they contain less thylakoids and grana with a higher number of more loosely stacked thylakoid membranes. Site-directed mutagenesis of <i>HvCMF3</i> identified a previously unknown functional domain, which is highly conserved within this subfamily of CCT domain containing proteins. HvCMF3:GFP fusion constructs were localized to plastids and nucleus. <i>Hvcmf3Hvcmf7</i> double mutants exhibited a <i>xantha</i>-albino or albino phenotype depending on the strength of molecular lesion of the <i>HvCMF7</i> allele. The chloroplast ribosome deficiency is discussed as the primary observed defect of the <i>Hvcmf3</i> mutants. Based on our observations, the genes <i>HvCMF3</i> and <i>HvCMF7</i> have similar but not identical functions in chloroplast development of barley supporting our hypothesis of neo-/sub-functionalization between both ohnologous genes.
