The type III secretion system (T3SS) is considered one of the major virulence factors in many bacterial pathogens. This report demonstrates that RssB, ClpXP, and RpoS play a role in T3SS regulation of Dickeya dadantii 3937. ClpP is a serine-type protease which associates with the ClpX chaperone to form a functional Clp proteolytic complex for degradation of proteins. With the assistance of recognition factor RssB, ClpXP degrades the RpoS sigma factor. RpoS positively regulates the expression of the rsmA gene encoding an RNA-binding regulatory protein. By interacting with the hrpL mRNA, RsmA reduces HrpL production and downregulates the T3SS genes in the HrpL regulon. In addition, ClpXP, RssB, and RpoS affect pectinolytic enzyme production in D. dadantii 3937, probably through RsmA. The ClpXP and RssB proteins are essential for bacterial virulence.
