Although peroxisomes play a key role in plant metabolism under both normal and stressful growth conditions, the impact of drought and heat stress on the peroxisomes remains unknown. Quinoa represents an informative system for dissecting the impact of abiotic stress on peroxisome proliferation because it is adapted to marginal environments. Here we determined the correlation of peroxisome abundance with physiological responses and yield under heat, drought and heat plus drought stresses in eight genotypes of quinoa. We found that all stresses caused a reduction in stomatal conductance and yield. Furthermore, H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> content increased under drought and heat plus drought. Principal component analysis demonstrated that peroxisome abundance correlated positively with H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> content in leaves and correlated negatively with yield. Pearson correlation coefficient for yield and peroxisome abundance (r = -0.59) was higher than for commonly used photosynthetic efficiency (r = 0.23), but comparable to those for classical stress indicators such as soil moisture content (r = 0.51) or stomatal conductance (r = 0.62). Our work established peroxisome abundance as a cellular sensor for measuring responses to heat and drought stress in the genetically diverse populations. As heat waves threaten agricultural productivity in arid climates, our findings will facilitate identification of genetic markers for improving yield of crops under extreme weather patterns.
