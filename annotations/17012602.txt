['17012602', 'We have investigated the transport of storage proteins, their processing  proteases, and the Vacuolar Sorting Receptor-1/Epidermal Growth Factor  Receptor-Like Protein1 (VSR-1/ATELP1) receptor during the formation of protein  storage vacuoles in Arabidopsis thaliana embryos by means of high-pressure  freezing/freeze substitution, electron tomography, immunolabeling techniques, and  subcellular fractionation. The storage proteins and their processing proteases  are segregated from each other within the Golgi cisternae and packaged into  separate vesicles. The storage protein-containing vesicles but not the processing  enzyme-containing vesicles carry the VSR-1/ATELP1 receptor. Both types of  secretory vesicles appear to fuse into a type of prevacuolar multivesicular body  (MVB). We have also determined that the proteolytic processing of the 2S albumins  starts in the MVBs. We hypothesize that the compartmentalized processing of  storage proteins in the MVBs may allow for the sequential activation of  processing proteases as the MVB lumen gradually acidifies.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.040931', 'Staehelin']
