Using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), we analyzed the proteome of <i>Sinorhizobium medicae</i> WSM419 growing as free-living cells and in symbiosis with <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. In all, 3,215 proteins were identified, over half of the open reading frames predicted from the genomic sequence. The abundance of 1,361 proteins displayed strong lifestyle bias. In total, 1,131 proteins had similar levels in bacteroids and free-living cells, and the low levels of 723 proteins prevented statistically significant assignments. Nitrogenase subunits comprised approximately 12% of quantified bacteroid proteins. Other major bacteroid proteins included symbiosis-specific cytochromes and FixABCX, which transfer electrons to nitrogenase. Bacteroids had normal levels of proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis, glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway; however, several amino acid degradation pathways were repressed. This suggests that bacteroids maintain a relatively independent anabolic metabolism. Tricarboxylic acid cycle proteins were highly expressed in bacteroids and no other catabolic pathway emerged as an obvious candidate to supply energy and reductant to nitrogen fixation. Bacterial stress response proteins were induced in bacteroids. Many WSM419 proteins that are not encoded in <i>S. meliloti</i> Rm1021 were detected, and understanding the functions of these proteins might clarify why <i>S. medicae</i> WSM419 forms a more effective symbiosis with <i>M. truncatula</i> than <i>S. meliloti</i> Rm1021.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
