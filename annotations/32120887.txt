It has been reported that overproduction of Rubisco activase (RCA) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) decreased Rubisco content, resulting in declining photosynthesis. We examined the effects of RCA levels on Rubisco content using transgenic rice with overexpressed or suppressed <i>RCA</i> under the control of different promoters of the <i>RCA</i> and Rubisco small subunit (<i>RBCS</i>) genes. All plants were grown hydroponically with different N concentrations (0.5, 2.0 and 8.0 mM-N). In RCA overproduced plants with > 2-fold RCA content (RCA-HI lines), a 10%-20% decrease in Rubisco content was observed at 0.5 and 2.0 mM-N. In contrast, at 8.0 mM-N, Rubisco content did not change in RCA-HI lines. Conversely, in plants with 50%-60% increased RCA content (RCA-MI lines), Rubisco levels remained unchanged, regardless of N concentration. Such effects on Rubisco content were independent of the promoter that was used. In plants with <i>RCA</i> suppression to < 10% of the wild-type RCA content, Rubisco levels were increased at 0.5 mM-N, but were unchanged at 2.0 and 8.0 mM-N. Thus, the effects of the changes in RCA levels on Rubisco content depended on N supply. Moreover, RCA overproduction was feasible without a decrease in Rubisco content, depending on the degree of RCA production.

RCA: !overproduction! decreases Rubisco content
RCA: !suppression! increases Rubisco content
N supply: !affects! effects of RCA levels on Rubisco content
