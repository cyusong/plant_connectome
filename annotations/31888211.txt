Balanced photosynthesis under drought is essential for better survival and for agricultural benefits in terms of biomass and yield. Given the current attempts to improve the photosynthetic efficiency for greater crop yield, the explanation of the genetic basis of that process, together with the phenotypic analysis, is significant in terms of both basic studies and potential agricultural application. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to uncover the molecular basis of the photosynthesis process under drought stress in barley. To address that goal, we conducted transcriptomic examination together with detailed photosynthesis analysis using the JIP-test. Using this approach, we indicated that photosynthesis is a process that is very early affected in barley seedlings treated with severe drought stress. Rather than focusing on individual genes, our strategy was pointed to the identification of groups of genes with similar expression patterns. As such, we identified and annotated almost 150 barley genes as crucial core-components of photosystems, electron transport components, and Calvin cycle enzymes. Moreover, we designated 17 possible regulatory interactions between photosynthesis-related genes and transcription factors in barley. Summarizing, our results provide a list of candidate genes for future genetic research and improvement of barley drought tolerance by targeting photosynthesis.
