Cuticular waxes play a crucial role not only in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses, but also in the quality and storability of fruits, such as the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Although the biosynthetic pathways of waxes have been extensively characterized, the regulatory mechanisms underlying wax biosynthesis in tomato remain largely unclear. Here, we show that Woolly (Wo), a multicellular trichome regulator, is involved in modulating wax biosynthesis in tomato. Wo enhances the expression of the wax biosynthetic genes SlCER6, SlKCR1, and SlPAS2, and the wax transporter gene SlLTP, and thereby promotes wax accumulation. Furthermore, Wo directly binds to the L1-box in the promoter of SlCER6, an essential element of the very-long-chain fatty acid elongase complex. Intriguingly, overexpression (OE) or knock-down of SlMYB31, an MYB transcription factor that physically interacts with Wo in vivo and in vitro, produces marked changes in wax composition, and whereas Wo knock-down inhibits wax accumulation in SlMYB31-OE lines, SlMYB31 knock-down inhibits wax accumulation in Wo-OE lines, implying that these two genes function in the same pathway. Lastly, SlCER6 expression is induced by abscisic acid in a manner that is partially dependent on Wo. These results demonstrate that Wo and SlMYB31 cooperatively control tomato cuticular wax biosynthesis by regulating the expression of SlCER6.
