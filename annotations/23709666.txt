['23709666', 'The first structure that differentiates during plant embryogenesis is the  extra-embryonic suspensor that positions the embryo in the lumen of the seed. A  central role in nutrient transport has been ascribed to the suspensor in species  with prominent suspensor structures. Little is known, however, about what impact  the size of the rather simple Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suspensor has on  embryogenesis. Here, we describe mutations in the predicted exo-polygalacturonase  gene NIMNA (NMA) that lead to cell elongation defects in the early embryo and  markedly reduced suspensor length. Mutant nma embryos develop slower than  wild-type embryos, and we could observe a similar developmental delay in another  mutant with shorter suspensors. Interestingly, for both genes, the paternal  allele has a stronger influence on the embryonic phenotype. We conclude that the  length of the suspensor is crucial for fast developmental progression of the  embryo in Arabidopsis.', '2013 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.217166', 'Bayer']
