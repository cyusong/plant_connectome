['9856939', 'Polar auxin transport controls multiple developmental processes in plants,  including the formation of vascular tissue. Mutations affecting the PIN-FORMED  (PIN1) gene diminish polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence  axes. The AtPIN1gene was found to encode a 67-kilodalton protein with similarity  to bacterial and eukaryotic carrier proteins, and the AtPIN1 protein was detected  at the basal end of auxin transport-competent cells in vascular tissue. AtPIN1  may act as a transmembrane component of the auxin efflux carrier.', '1998 Dec 18', 'Science', '10.1126/science.282.5397.2226', 'Palme']
