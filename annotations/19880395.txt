A highly sensitive quantitative method for assaying nicotianamine (NA) and 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-TOF-MS) was developed. The amino and hydroxyl groups of NA and DMA were derivatized using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride. The amounts of NA and DMA in 10 mul of xylem sap from rice cultivated under iron (Fe)-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions were quantified without concentration. In Fe-sufficient plants, the concentrations of NA and DMA were almost equal to that of Fe. In Fe-deficient plants, the concentration of NA did not change significantly, whereas that of DMA increased markedly.

NA: !concentration unchanged! Fe-sufficient plants
DMA: !concentration increased! Fe-deficient plants
NA: !equal to! Fe concentration
Fe: !affects! DMA concentration
