Plants produce an array of proteins as a part of a global response to protect the cell metabolism when they grow under environmental conditions such as drought and salinity that generate reduced water potential. The synthesis of hydrophilic proteins is a major part of the response to water deficit conditions. An increased expression of LEA proteins is thought to be one of the primary lines of defense to prevent the loss of intercellular water during adverse conditions. These LEA proteins are known to prevent aggregation of a wide range of other proteins. In this study we report the water stress induced protein aggregation and its abrogation followed by expression of group 1 and group 2 LEA proteins of water soluble proteomes in horsegram. Water stress caused an increased protein aggregation with magnitude and duration of stress in horsegram seedlings. Tissue-specific expression of LEA 1 protein decreased in the embryonic axis when compared to cotyledons in 24h stressed seedlings. We found no cross reaction of LEA 1 with proteome of 48h stressed embryonic axis and 72h stressed root and shoot samples. However, LEA 2 antibodies were cross reacted with four polypeptides with different molecular mass in shoot tissue samples and found no reaction with root proteome as evidenced from immuno-blot analysis. The role of LEA proteins in relation to protein aggregation during water stressed conditions was discussed.
