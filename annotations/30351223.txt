The pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus has caused serious damage to pine forests in China. Effectors secreted by phytonematodes play a role in host infection. We identified and characterized an effector, BxSapB1, based on the B. xylophilus transcriptome at the early stages of infection and the transient expression of proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana. BxSapB1 triggered cell death in N. benthamiana when secreted into the apoplast, and this effect was independent of N. benthamiana brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (NbBAK1) and suppressor of BIR1-1 (NbSOBIR1). The signal peptide of BxSapB1 was proven to be functional in yeast using the yeast signal sequence trap system and BxSapB1 was strongly expressed in the subventral gland cells of B. xylophilus, as revealed by in-situ hybridization. In addition, based on local BLAST analysis, the BxSapB1 showed 100% identity to BUX.s00139.62, which was identified from the B. xylophilus secretome during Pinus thunbergii infection. BxSapB1 was upregulated in a highly virulent strain and downregulated in a weakly virulent strain of PWN at the early stages of infection. RNA interference assays showed that silencing BxSapB1 resulted in decreased expression of pathogenesis-related genes (PtPR-1b, PtPR-3, and PtPR-5) as well as delayed onset of symptoms in P. thunbergii infected by B. xylophilus. The combined data suggest that BxSapB1 can trigger cell death in N. benthamiana and that it contributes to the virulence in B. xylophilus during parasitic interaction.
