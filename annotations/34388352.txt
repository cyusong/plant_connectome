<i>Fusarium musae</i> causes crown rot of banana and it is also associated to clinical fusariosis. A chromosome-level genome assembly of <i>F. musae</i> F31 obtained combining Nanopore long reads and Illumina paired-end reads resulted in 12 chromosomes plus one contig with overall N<sub>50</sub> of 4.36 Mb, and is presented together with its mitochondrial genome (58,072 bp). The F31 genome includes telomeric regions for 11 of the 12 chromosomes representing one of the most complete genomes available in the <i>Fusarium fujikuroi</i> species complex. The high-quality assembly of the F31 genome will be a valuable resource for studying the pathogenic interactions occurring between <i>F. musae</i> and banana. Moreover, it represents an important resource for understanding the genome evolution in the <i>F. fujikuroi</i> species complex.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
