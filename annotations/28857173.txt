The Kok effect - an abrupt decline in quantum yield (QY) of net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation at low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) - is widely used to estimate respiration in the light (R), which assumes the effect is caused by light suppression of R. A recent report suggested much of the Kok effect can be explained by declining chloroplastic CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (c<sub>c</sub> ) at low PPFD. Several predictions arise from the hypothesis that the Kok effect is caused by declining c<sub>c</sub> , and we tested these predictions in Vicia faba. We measured CO<sub>2</sub> exchange at low PPFD, in 2% and 21% oxygen, in developing and mature leaves, which differed greatly in R in darkness. Our results contradicted each of the predictions based on the c<sub>c</sub> effect: QY exceeded the theoretical maximum value for photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake; QY was larger in 21% than 2% oxygen; and the change in QY at the Kok effect breakpoint was unaffected by oxygen. Our results strongly suggest the Kok effect arises largely from a progressive decline in R with PPFD that includes both oxygen-sensitive and -insensitive components. We suggest an improved Kok method that accounts for high c<sub>c</sub> at low PPFD.
