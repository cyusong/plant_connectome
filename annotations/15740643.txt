['15740643', 'A developmentally retarded mutant (drm1) was identified from ethyl  methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized M2 seeds in Columbia (Col-0) genetic  background. The drm1 flowers 109 d after sowing, with a whole life cycle of about  160 d. It also shows a pleiotropic phenotype, e.g., slow germination and lower  germination rate, lower growth rate, curling leaves and abnormal floral organs.  The drm1 mutation was a single recessive nuclear mutation, which was mapped to  the bottom of chromosome 5 and located within a region of 20-30 kb around MXK3.1.  There have been no mutants with similar phenotypes reported in the literature,  suggesting that DRM1 is a novel flowering promoting locus. The findings that the  drm1 flowered lately under all photoperiod conditions and its late flowering  phenotype was significantly restored by vernalization treatment suggest that the  drm1 is a typical late flowering mutant and most likely associated with the  autonomous flowering pathway. The conclusion was further confirmed by the  revelation that the transcript level of FLC was constantly upregulated in the  drm1 at all the developmental phases examined, except for a very early stage.  Moreover, the transcript levels of two other important repressors, EMF and TFL1,  were also upregulated in the drm1, implying that the two repressors, along with  FLC, seems to act in parallel pathways in the drm1 to regulate flowering as well  as other aspects of floral development in a negatively additive way. This helps  to explain why the drm1 exhibits a much more severe late-flowering phenotype than  most late-flowering mutants reported. It also implies that the DRM1 might act  upstream of these repressors.', '2005 Feb', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/sj.cr.7290278', 'Kuai']
