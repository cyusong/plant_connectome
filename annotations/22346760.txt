['22346760', 'Shifts between epigenetic states of transcriptional activity are typically  correlated with changes in epigenetic marks. However, exceptions to this rule  suggest the existence of additional, as yet uncharacterized, layers of epigenetic  regulation. MOM1, a protein of 2,001 amino acids that acts as a transcriptional  silencer, represents such an exception. Here we define the 82 amino acid domain  called CMM2 (Conserved MOM1 Motif 2) as a minimal MOM1 fragment capable of  transcriptional regulation. As determined by X-ray crystallography, this motif  folds into an unusual hendecad-based coiled-coil. Structure-based mutagenesis  followed by transgenic complementation tests in plants demonstrate that CMM2 and  its dimerization are effective for transcriptional suppression at chromosomal  loci co-regulated by MOM1 and the siRNA pathway but not at loci controlled by  MOM1 in an siRNA-independent fashion. These results reveal a surprising  separation of epigenetic activities that enable the single, large MOM1 protein to  coordinate cooperating mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.', '2012 Feb', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1002484', 'Paszkowski']
