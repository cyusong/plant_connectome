Ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) shrubs commonly occur in forest understories and could therefore alter arbuscular (AM) and/or ectomycorrhizal (EcM) tree effects on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Specifically, ErM fungi have extensive organic matter decay capabilities, and ErM plant and fungal tissues have high concentrations of secondary compounds that can form persistent complexes in the soil. Together, these traits could contribute to organic matter accumulation and inorganic nutrient limitation. These effects could also differ in AM- vs EcM-dominated stands at multiple scales within and among forest biomes by, for instance, altering fungal guild interactions. Most work on ErM effects in forests has been conducted in boreal forests dominated by EcM trees. However, ErM plants occur in c. 96, 69 and 29% of boreal, temperate and tropical forests, respectively. Within tropical montane forests, the effects of ErM plants could be particularly pronounced because their traits are more distinct from AM than EcM trees. Because ErM fungi can function as free-living saprotrophs, they could also be more resilient to forest disturbances than obligate symbionts. Further consideration of ErM effects within and among forest biomes could improve our understanding of how cooccurring mycorrhizal types interact to collectively affect soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics under changing conditions.
