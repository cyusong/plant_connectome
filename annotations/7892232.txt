['7892232', 'Male fertility in flowering plants is dependent on production of viable pollen  grains within the anther. Genes expressed exclusively in the anther are likely to  include those that control male fertility. On the basis of their tissue  specificity, such genes have been isolated, yet in none of them has this function  been demonstrated. Here we report that one such gene, Bcp1, is active in both  diploid tapetum and haploid microspores and is required for pollen fertility.  Perturbation of this gene in either tapetum or microspores prevents production of  fertile pollen in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. When tapetum expression of this  gene is perturbed, mature anthers contain dead shriveled pollen. On the other  hand, when microspore expression is perturbed, anthers show 1:1 segregation of  viable/aborted pollen. These findings identify a class of  sporophytic/gametophytic genes controlling male fertility and, hence,  reproduction in flowering plants.', '1995 Mar 14', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.92.6.2106', 'Singh']
