['23206231', 'Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ligase, plays a  critical role in cell cycle control, but the functional characterization of each  subunit has not yet been completed. To investigate the function of APC1 in  Arabidopsis, we analyzed four mutant alleles of APC1, and found that mutation in  APC1 resulted in significantly reduced plant fertility, accumulation of cyclin B,  and disrupted auxin distribution in embryos. The three mutant alleles apc1-1,  apc1-2 and apc1-3 shared variable defects in female gametogenesis including  degradation, abnormal nuclear number, and disrupted polarity of nuclei in the  embryo sac as well as in embryogenesis, in which embryos were arrested at  multiple stages. All of these defects are similar to those previously identified  in apc4. The mutant apc1-4, in which the T-DNA was inserted after the  transmembrane domain at the C-terminus, showed much more severe phenotypes; that  is, most of the ovules were arrested at the one-nucleate female gametophyte stage  (stage FG1). In the apc1 apc4 double mutants, the fertility was further reduced  by one-third in apc1-1/+ apc4-1/+, and in some cases no ovules even survived in  siliques of apc1-4/+ apc4-1/+. Our data thus suggest that APC1, an essential  component of APC/C, plays a synergistic role with APC4 both in female  gametogenesis and in embryogenesis.', '2013 Jan', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12018', 'Qu']
