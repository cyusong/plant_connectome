['21946064', 'Various transcription factors are involved in the response to environmental  stresses in plants. In this study, we characterized AtERF71/HRE2, a member of the  Arabidopsis AP2/ERF family, as an important regulator of the osmotic and hypoxic  stress responses in plants. Transcript level of AtERF71/HRE2 was highly increased  by anoxia, NaCl, mannitol, ABA, and MV treatments. aterf71/hre2 loss-of-function  mutants displayed higher sensitivity to osmotic stress such as high salt and  mannitol, accumulating higher levels of ROS under high salt treatment. In  contrast, AtERF71/HRE2-overexpressing transgenic plants showed tolerance to salt  and mannitol as well as flooding and MV stresses, exhibiting lower levels of ROS  under high salt treatment. AtERF71/HRE2 protein was localized in the nucleus, and  the C-terminal region of AtERF71/HRE2 was required for transcription activation  activity. Taken together, our results suggest that AtERF71/HRE2 might function as  a transcription factor involved in the response to osmotic stress as well as  hypoxia.', '2011 Oct 14', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.039', 'Moon']
