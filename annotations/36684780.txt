Horizontal gene transfer is a rare and useful genetic mechanism in higher plants. <i>Gastrodia elata</i> Blume (<i>GE</i>) (Orchidaceae), well known as traditional medicinal material in East Asia, adopts a heterotrophic lifestyle, thus being considered to be more prone to horizontal gene transfer (HGT). <i>GE</i> is a "polytypic species" that currently comprised of five recognized forms according to the plant morphology. <i>G. elata Blume forma elata</i> (<i>GEE</i>) and <i>G. elata Bl.f.glauca</i> (<i>GEG</i>) are two common forms that naturally grow in different habitats with difference in altitude and latitude. <i>G. elata Bl.f.viridis</i> (<i>GEV</i>) often occurs sporadically in cultivated populations of <i>GEE</i> and <i>GEG</i>. However, the genetic relationships and genetic mechanism underpinned the divergent ecological adaptations of <i>GEE</i> and <i>GEG</i> have not been revealed. Here, we assembled a chromosome-level draft genome of <i>GEE</i> with 1.04 Gb. Among predicted 17,895 protein coding genes, we identified three HGTs. Meanwhile, we resequenced 10 <i>GEE</i> accessions, nine <i>GEG</i> accessions, and 10 <i>GEV</i> accessions, and identified two independent genetic lineages: <i>GEG</i>_pedigree (<i>GEG</i> individuals and <i>GEV</i> individuals collected from <i>GEG</i> populations) and <i>GEE</i>_pedigree (<i>GEE</i> individuals and <i>GEV</i> individuals collected from <i>GEE</i> populations), which strongly support the taxonomic status of <i>GEE</i> and <i>GEG</i> as subspecies, not as different forms. In highly differentiated genomic regions of <i>GEE</i>_pedigree and <i>GEG</i>_pedigree, three chalcone synthase-encoding genes and one Phox/Bem1p (PB1) domain of encoding Auxin (AUX)/Indoleacetic acid (IAA) were identified in selection sweeping genome regions, which suggested that differentiation between <i>GEE</i>_pedigree and <i>GEG</i>_pedigree was promoted by the selection of genes related to photoresponse and growth and development. Overall, this new genome would be helpful for breeding and utilization of <i>GE</i> and the new findings would deepen the understanding about ecological adaptation and evolution of <i>GE</i>.
