Higher plants possess the ability to trigger a long-term acclimatory response to different environmental light conditions through the regulation of the light-harvesting antenna size of photosystem II. The present study provides an insight into the molecular nature of the signal which initiates the high light-mediated response of a reduction in antenna size. Using barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants, it is shown (i) that the light-harvesting antenna size is not reduced in high light with a low hydrogen peroxide content in the leaves; and (ii) that a decrease in the antenna size is observed in low light in the presence of an elevated concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the leaves. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the ability to reduce the antenna size of photosystem II in high light is restricted to photosynthetic apparatus with a reduced level of the plastoquinone pool and with a low hydrogen peroxide content. Conversely, the reduction of antenna size in low light is induced in photosynthetic apparatus possessing elevated hydrogen peroxide even when the reduction level of the plastoquinone pool is low. Hydrogen peroxide affects the relative abundance of the antenna proteins that modulate the antenna size of photosystem II through a down-regulation of the corresponding lhcb mRNA levels. This work shows that hydrogen peroxide contributes to triggering the photosynthetic apparatus response for the reduction of the antenna size of photosystem II by being the molecular signal for the long-term acclimation of plants to high light.
