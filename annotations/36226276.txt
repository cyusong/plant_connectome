Post-translational histone modifications play important roles in regulating chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. Histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is a prominent histone modification mainly associated with gene activation. Here we showed that a histone demethylase, JMJ15, belonging to KDM5/JARID group, is involved in salt stress response in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. <i>Jmj15</i> loss-of-function mutants displayed increased sensitivity to salt stress. Moreover, knockout of <i>JMJ15</i> impaired the salt responsive gene expression program and affected H3K4me3 levels of many stress-related genes under salt-stressed condition. Importantly, we demonstrated that <i>JMJ15</i> regulated the expression level of two WRKY transcription factors, <i>WRKY46</i> and <i>WRKY70</i>, which were negatively involved in abiotic stress tolerance. Furthermore, JMJ15 directly bound to and demethylated H3K4me3 mark in the promoter and coding regions of <i>WRKY46</i> and <i>WRKY70</i>, thereby repressing these two <i>WRKY</i> gene expression under salt stress. Overall, our study revealed a novel molecular function of the histone demethylase JMJ15 under salt stress in plants.
