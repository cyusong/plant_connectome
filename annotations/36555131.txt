Nitrogen accelerates salt accumulation in the root zone of an euhalophyte, which might be beneficial for inhibiting the salt damage and interspecific competition for nutrients of non-halophytes in intercropping. However, the variations in the effect of euhalophyte/non-halophyte intercropping with nitrogen supply are poorly understood. Here, we selected the euhalophyte <i>Suaeda salsa</i> (suaeda) and non-halophyte <i>Zea mays</i> L. (maize) as the research objects, setting up three cropping patterns in order to explore the influence of nitrogen application on the intercropping effect in the suaeda/maize intercropping. The results showed that the biomass of maize in the intercropping was significantly lower than that in the monoculture, while for suaeda, it was higher in the intercropping than that in the monoculture. The biomass of maize under NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N treatment performed significantly higher than that under no nitrogen treatment. Moreover, under suitable NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N treatment, more salt ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>) gathered around the roots of suaeda, which weakened the salt damage on maize growth. In the intercropping, the effect of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N on the maize growth was enhanced when compared with the non-significant effect of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, but a positive effect of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N on suaeda growth was found. Therefore, the disadvantage of maize growth in the intercropping suaeda/maize might be caused by interspecific competition to a certain extent, providing an effective means for the improvement of saline-alkali land by phytoremediation.
