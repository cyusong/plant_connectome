['33290549', 'RNA modifications can regulate the stability of RNAs, mRNA-protein interactions,  and translation efficiency. Pseudouridine is a prevalent RNA modification, and  its metabolic fate after RNA turnover was recently characterized in eukaryotes,  in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we present structural and biochemical  analyses of PSEUDOURIDINE KINASE from Arabidopsis (AtPUKI), the enzyme catalyzing  the first step in pseudouridine degradation. AtPUKI, a member of the PfkB family  of carbohydrate kinases, is a homodimeric alpha/beta protein with a protruding small  beta-strand domain, which serves simultaneously as dimerization interface and  dynamic substrate specificity determinant. AtPUKI has a unique nucleoside binding  site specifying the binding of pseudourine, in particular at the nucleobase, by  multiple hydrophilic interactions, of which one is mediated by a loop from the  small beta-strand domain of the adjacent monomer. Conformational transition of the  dimerized small beta-strand domains containing active site residues is required for  substrate specificity. These dynamic features explain the higher catalytic  efficiency for pseudouridine over uridine. Both substrates bind well (similar  Km), but only pseudouridine is turned over efficiently. Our studies provide an  example for structural and functional divergence in the PfkB family and highlight  how AtPUKI avoids futile uridine phosphorylation which in vivo would disturb  pyrimidine homeostasis.', '2021 Jan 11', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkaa1144', 'Rhee']
