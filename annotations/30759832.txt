To reveal the mechanism of salinity stress alleviation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), we investigated the growth parameter, soluble sugar, soluble protein, and protein abundance pattern of <i>E. angustifolia</i> seedlings that were cultured under salinity stress (300 mmol/L NaCl) and inoculated by <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> (RI). Furthermore, a label-free quantitative proteomics approach was used to reveal the stress-responsive proteins in the leaves of <i>E. angustifolia</i>. The result indicates that the abundance of 75 proteins in the leaves was significantly influenced when <i>E. angustifolia</i> was inoculated with AMF, which were mainly involved in the metabolism, signal transduction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. Furthermore, we identified chorismate mutase, elongation factor mitochondrial, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, calcium-dependent kinase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, NADH dehydrogenase, alkaline neutral invertase, peroxidase, and other proteins closely related to the salt tolerance process. The proteomic results indicated that <i>E. angustifolia</i> seedlings inoculated with AMF increased the secondary metabolism level of phenylpropane metabolism, enhanced the signal transduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS scavenging ability, promoted the biosynthesis of protein, accelerated the protein folding, and inhibited the degradation of protein under salt stress. Moreover, AMF enhanced the synthesis of ATP and provided sufficient energy for plant cell activity. This study implied that symbiosis of halophytes and AMF has potential as an application for the improvement of saline-alkali soils.
