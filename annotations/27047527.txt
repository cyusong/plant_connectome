['27047527', 'The biosynthesis of chlorophylls and carotenoids and the assembly of thylakoid  membranes are critical for the photoautotrophic growth of plants. Different  factors are involved in these two processes. In recent years, members of the  DnaJ-like zinc finger domain proteins have been found to take part in the  biogenesis and/or the maintenance of plastids. One member of this family of  proteins, PSA2, was recently found to localize to the thylakoid lumen and  regulate the accumulation of photosystem I. In this study, we report that the  silencing of PSA2 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in variegated leaves and  retarded growth. Although both chlorophylls and total carotenoids decreased in  the psa2 mutant, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin accumulated in the mutant seedlings  grown under growth condition. Lower levels of non-photochemical quenching and  electron transport rate were also found in the psa2 mutant seedlings under growth  condition compared with those of the wild-type plants, indicating an impaired  capability to acclimate to normal light irradiance when PSA2 was silenced.  Moreover, we also observed an abnormal assembly of grana thylakoids and poorly  developed stroma thylakoids in psa2 chloroplasts. Taken together, our results  demonstrate that PSA2 is a member of the DnaJ-like zinc finger domain protein  family that affects light acclimation and chloroplast development.', '2016', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2016.00360', 'Lu']
