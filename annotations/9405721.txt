['9405721', 'Potassium (K+) nutrition and salt tolerance are key factors controlling plant  productivity. However, the mechanisms by which plants regulate K+ nutrition and  salt tolerance are poorly understood. We report here the identification of an  Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, sos3 (salt-overly-sensitive 3), which is  hypersensitive to Na+ and Li+ stresses. The mutation is recessive and is in a  nuclear gene that maps to chromosome V. The sos3 mutation also renders the plant  unable to grow on low K+. Surprisingly, increased extracellular Ca2+ suppresses  the growth defect of sos3 plants on low K+ or 50 mM NaCl. In contrast, high  concentrations of external Ca2+ do not rescue the growth of the  salt-hypersensitive sos1 mutant on low K+ or 50 mM NaCl. Under NaCl stress, sos3  seedlings accumulated more Na+ and less K+ than the wild type. Increased external  Ca2+ improved K+/Na+ selectivity of both sos3 and wild-type plants. However, this  Ca2+ effect in sos3 is more than twice as much as that in the wild type. In  addition to defining the first plant mutant with an altered calcium response,  these results demonstrate that the SOS3 locus is essential for K+ nutrition,  K+/Na+ selectivity, and salt tolerance in higher plants.', '1997 Dec 23', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.94.26.14960', 'Zhu']
