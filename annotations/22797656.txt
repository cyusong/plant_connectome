['22797656', 'While suberin is an insoluble heteropolymer, a number of soluble lipids can be  extracted by rapid chloroform dipping of roots. These extracts include esters of  saturated long-chain primary alcohols and hydroxycinnamic acids. Such fatty  alcohols and hydroxycinnamic acids are also present in suberin. We demonstrate  that alkyl coumarates and caffeates, which are the major components of  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root waxes, are present primarily in taproots.  Previously we identified ALIPHATIC SUBERIN FERULOYL TRANSFERASE (At5g41040), a  HXXXD-type acyltransferase (BAHD family), responsible for incorporation of  ferulate into aliphatic suberin of Arabidopsis. However, aliphatic suberin  feruloyl transferase mutants were unaffected in alkyl hydroxycinnamate ester root  wax composition. Here we identify a closely related gene, At5g63560, responsible  for the synthesis of a subset of alkyl hydroxycinnamate esters, the alkyl  caffeates. Transgenic plants harboring P(At5g63560)::YFP fusions showed  transcriptional activity in suberized tissues. Knockout mutants of At5g63560 were  severely reduced in their alkyl caffeate but not alkyl coumarate content.  Recombinant At5g63560p had greater acyltransferase activity when presented with  caffeoyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) substrate, thus we have named this acyltransferase  FATTY ALCOHOL:CAFFEOYL-CoA CAFFEOYL TRANSFERASE. Stress experiments revealed  elevated alkyl coumarate content in root waxes of NaCl-treated wild-type and  fatty alcohol:caffeoyl-CoA caffeoyl transferase plants. We further demonstrate  that FATTY ACYL-CoA REDUCTASEs (FARs) FAR5 (At3g44550), FAR4 (At3g44540), and  FAR1 (At5g22500) are required for the synthesis of C18, C20, and C22 alkyl  hydroxycinnamates, respectively. Collectively, these results suggest that  multiple acyltransferases are utilized for the synthesis of alkyl  hydroxycinnamate esters of Arabidopsis root waxes and that FAR1/4/5 provide the  fatty alcohols required for alkyl hydroxycinnamate synthesis.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.201822', 'Pollard']
