['12782725', 'The SCF(TIR1) complex is a central regulator of the auxin response pathway in  Arabidopsis. This complex functions as a ubiquitin protein ligase that targets  members of the auxin/indoleacetic acid (Aux/IAA) family of transcriptional  regulators for ubiquitin-mediated degradation in response to auxin. In an attempt  to identify additional factors required for SCF(TIR1) activity, we conducted a  genetic screen to isolate enhancers of the auxin response defect conferred by the  tir1-1 mutation. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the  eta3 mutant. The eta3 mutation interacts synergistically with tir1-1 to strongly  enhance all aspects of the tir1 mutant phenotype, including auxin inhibition of  root growth, lateral root development, hypocotyl elongation at high temperature,  and apical dominance. We isolated the ETA3 gene using a map-based cloning  strategy and determined that ETA3 encodes SGT1b. SGT1b was identified recently as  a factor involved in plant disease resistance signaling, and SGT1 from barley and  tobacco extracts was shown to interact with SCF ubiquitin ligases. We conclude  that ETA3/SGT1b is required for the SCF(TIR1)-mediated degradation of Aux/IAA  proteins.', '2003 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010884', 'Parker']
