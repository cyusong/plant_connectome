['15773851', 'Active brassinosteroids (BRs), such as brassinolide (BL) and castasterone (CS),  are growth-promoting plant hormones. An Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 monooxygenase  (CYP734A1, formerly CYP72B1), encoded by the BAS1 gene, inactivates BRs and  modulates photomorphogenesis. BAS1 was identified as the overexpressed gene  responsible for a dominant, BR-deficient mutant, bas1-D. This mutant was isolated  in an activation-tagged screen designed to identify redundant genes that might  not be identified in classic loss-of-function screens. Here we report the  isolation of a second activation-tagged mutant with a BR-deficient phenotype. The  mutant phenotype is caused by the overexpression of SOB7 (CYP72C1), a homolog of  BAS1. We generated single and double null-mutants of BAS1 and SOB7 to test the  hypothesis that these two genes act redundantly to modulate photomorphogenesis.  BAS1 and SOB7 act redundantly with respect to light promotion of cotyledon  expansion, repression of hypocotyl elongation and flowering time in addition to  other phenotypes not regulated by light. We also provide biochemical evidence to  suggest that BAS1 and SOB7 act redundantly to reduce the level of active BRs, but  have unique mechanisms. Overexpression of SOB7 results in a dramatic reduction in  endogenous CS levels, and although single null-mutants of BAS1 and SOB7 have the  same level of CS as the wild type, the double null-mutant has twice the amount.  Application of BL to overexpression lines of BAS1 or SOB7 results in enhanced  metabolism of BL, though only BAS1 overexpression lines confer enhanced  conversion to 26-OHBL, suggesting that SOB7 and BAS1 convert BL and CS into  unique products.', '2005 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02358.x', 'Neff']
