Expression of blueberry cold-regulated genes (VcCORs) could play a role in the variable cold hardiness of blueberry tissues. In this study, transcriptome comparisons were conducted to reveal expression of VcCORs in non-acclimated leaves, flower buds, and flowers of both non-transgenic and transgenic blueberries containing an overexpressed blueberry <i>DWARF AND DELAYED FLOWERING</i> gene (<i>VcDDF1</i>) as well as in fully chilled flower buds of non-transgenic blueberry. In non-transgenic blueberries, 57.5% of VcCOR genes showed differential expression in at least one of the three pairwise comparisons between non-acclimated leaves, flower buds, and flowers, and six out of nine dehydration-responsive element-binding factors showed differential expression. In addition, expression of <i>VcDDF1</i> was not cold-inducible in non-transgenic blueberries and had higher expression in flowers than in leaves or non-acclimated flower buds. In transgenic blueberries, overexpression of <i>VcDDF1</i> resulted in higher <i>VcDDF1</i> expression in leaves than in flower buds and flowers. <i>VcDDF1</i> overexpression enhanced expression of blueberry <i>CBF1</i> and <i>CBF3</i> in leaves and repressed expression of <i>CBF3</i> in both flower buds and flowers. Overall, the results revealed tissue-specific expression patterns of VcCORs. The responses of VcCORs to overexpression of <i>VcDDF1</i> suggest that it is possible to increase plant cold hardiness through overexpression of a non-cold-inducible gene.
