Phytochrome A (phyA) is the only plant photoreceptor that perceives far-red light and then mediates various responses to this signal. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of oat phyA have been extensively studied, and it was shown that phosphorylation of a serine residue in the hinge region of oat phyA could regulate the interaction of phyA with its signal transducers. However, little is known about the role of the hinge region of <i>Arabidopsis</i> phyA. Here, we report that three sites in the hinge region of <i>Arabidopsis</i> phyA (i.e., S590, T593, and S602) are essential in regulating phyA function. Mutating all three of these sites to either alanines or aspartic acids impaired phyA function, changed the interactions of mutant phyA with FHY1 and FHL, and delayed the degradation of mutant phyA upon light exposure. Moreover, the in vivo formation of a phosphorylated phyA form was greatly affected by these mutations, while our data indicated that the abundance of this phosphorylated phyA form correlated well with the extent of phyA function, thus suggesting a pivotal role of the phosphorylated phyA in inducing the far-red light response. Taking these data together, our study reveals the important role of the hinge region of <i>Arabidopsis</i> phyA in regulating phyA phosphorylation and function, thus linking specific residues in the hinge region to the regulatory mechanisms of phyA phosphorylation.
