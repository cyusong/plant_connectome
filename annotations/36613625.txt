Chromium is used in many settings, and hence, it can easily enter the natural environment. It exists in several oxidation states. In soil, depending on its oxidation-reduction potential, it can occur in bivalent, trivalent or hexavalent forms. Hexavalent chromium compounds are cancerogenic to humans. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Cr(VI) on the structure of bacteria and fungi in soil, to find out how this effect is modified by humic acids and to determine the response of <i>Zea mays</i> to this form of chromium. A pot experiment was conducted to answer the above questions. <i>Zea mays</i> was sown in natural soil and soil polluted with Cr(VI) in an amount of 60 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d.m. Both soils were treated with humic acids in the form of HumiAgra preparation. The ecophysiological and genetic diversity of bacteria and fungi was assayed in soil under maize (not sown with <i>Zea mays</i>). In addition, the following were determined: yield of maize, greenness index, index of tolerance to chromium, translocation index and accumulation of chromium in the plant. It has been determined that Cr(VI) significantly distorts the growth and development of <i>Zea mays</i>, while humic acids completely neutralize its toxic effect on the plant. This element had an adverse effect on the development of bacteria of the genera <i>Cellulosimicrobium</i>, <i>Kaistobacter</i>, <i>Rhodanobacter</i>, <i>Rhodoplanes</i> and <i>Nocardioides</i> and fungi of the genera <i>Chaetomium and Humicola</i>. Soil contamination with Cr(VI) significantly diminished the genetic diversity and richness of bacteria and the ecophysiological diversity of fungi. The negative impact of Cr(VI) on the diversity of bacteria and fungi was mollified by <i>Zea mays</i> and the application of humic acids.

Cr(VI): !adversely affects! <i>Zea mays</i> 
Cr(VI): !diminishes! genetic diversity of bacteria and ecophysiological diversity of fungi 
Humic acids: !neutralizes! toxic effect of Cr(VI) 
<i>Zea mays</i>: !mollifies! negative impact of Cr(VI)
