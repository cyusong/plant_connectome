C-to-U RNA editing in plant mitochondria requires the participation of many nucleus-encoded factors, most of which are pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. There is a large number of PPR proteins and the functions many of them are unknown. Here, we report a mitochondrion-localized DYW-subgroup PPR protein, PPR27, which functions in the editing of multiple mitochondrial transcripts in maize. The ppr27 mutant is completely deficient in C-to-U editing at the ccmFN-1357 and rps3-707 sites, and editing at six other sites is substantially reduced. The lack of editing at ccmFN-1357 causes a deficiency of CcmFN protein. As CcmFN functions in the maturation pathway of cytochrome proteins that are subunits of mitochondrial complex III, its deficiency results in an absence of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c proteins. Consequently, the assembly of mitochondrial complex III and super-complex I+III2 is decreased, which impairs the electron transport chain and respiration, leading to arrests in embryogenesis and endosperm development in ppr27. In addition, PPR27 was found to physically interact with ZmMORF1, which interacts with ZmMORF8, suggesting that these three proteins may facilitate C-to-U RNA editing via the formation of a complex in maize mitochondria. This RNA editing is essential for complex III assembly and seed development in maize.
