Tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i> L.), as an evergreen plant, needs a humid environment. Water deficit would diminish tea yield and quality. We analyzed the dynamic changes in the metabolite and lipid profiling of tea leaves under various drought conditions and re-watering to determine the metabolic changes in tea leaves responding to drought challenges. In all, 119 metabolites showed substantial alterations in drought-stressed tea plants, including sugars and sugar alcohols, amino acids, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and lipids. We detected 29 lipids and they were classified into phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidic acid (PA), sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerol (SQDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), and phosphatidylinositol (PI). The levels of sugar, sugar alcohol, and sugar precursors may change as a response to drought stress. Compared with these metabolites, the membrane lipids showed more dynamic changes in tea under drought stresses. Furthermore, metabolic recovery was only partial, with the majority of the examined metabolites exhibiting significantly different levels between samples from re-watered and well-watered tea plants. The findings also showed that comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were efficient in elucidating the impacts of drought stress on tea plant metabolism. Our findings are valuable for understanding the mechanisms behind drought tolerance in tea plants from the metabolism perspective and utilizing the compounds to improve the drought tolerance of tea plants.
