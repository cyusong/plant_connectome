['17446396', 'Intercellular protein movement plays a critical role in animal and plant  development. SHORTROOT (SHR) is a moving transcription factor essential for  endodermis specification in the Arabidopsis root. Unlike diffusible animal  morphogens, which form a gradient across multiple cell layers, SHR movement is  limited to essentially one cell layer. However, the molecular mechanism is  unknown. We show that SCARECROW (SCR) blocks SHR movement by sequestering it into  the nucleus through protein-protein interaction and a safeguard mechanism that  relies on a SHR/SCR-dependent positive feedback loop for SCR transcription. Our  studies with SHR and SCR homologs from rice suggest that this mechanism is  evolutionarily conserved, providing a plausible explanation why nearly all plants  have a single layer of endodermis.', '2007 Apr 20', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1139531', 'Benfey']
