Chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) limits the regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) in the Calvin-Benson cycle. However, it does not always limit the rate of CO2 assimilation. In the present study, the effects of overproduction of GAPDH on the rate of CO2 assimilation under elevated [CO2] conditions, where the capacity for RuBP regeneration limits photosynthesis, were examined in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa). GAPDH activity was increased to 3.2- and 4.5-fold of the wild-type levels by co-overexpression of the GAPDH genes, GAPA and GAPB, respectively. In the transgenic rice plants, the rate of CO2 assimilation under elevated [CO2] conditions increased by approximately 10%, whereas that under normal and low [CO2] conditions was not affected. These results indicate that overproduction of GAPDH is effective in improving photosynthesis under elevated [CO2] conditions, although its magnitude is relatively small. By contrast, biomass production of the transgenic rice plants was not greater than that of wild-type plants under elevated [CO2] conditions, although starch content tended to increase marginally.

GAPDH: !limits! RuBP regeneration 
GAPDH: !increases! CO2 assimilation 
GAPA/GAPB: !overexpress! GAPDH 
Transgenic rice: !improves! photosynthesis 
Transgenic rice: !not greater than! wild-type biomass production
