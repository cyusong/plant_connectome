Plant bacterial and fungal diseases cause significant agricultural losses and need to be controlled. Beneficial bacteria are promising candidates for controlling these diseases. In this study, <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. JCK-6131 exhibited broad-spectrum antagonistic activity against various phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi. <i>In vitro</i> assays showed that the fermentation filtrate of JCK-6131 inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungi with minimum concentration inhibitory (MIC) values of 0.31-10% and 0.31-1.25%, respectively. In the <i>in vivo</i> experiments, treatment with JCK-6131 effectively suppressed the development of apple fire blight, tomato bacterial wilt, and cucumber <i>Fusarium</i> wilt in a dose-dependent manner. RP-HPLC and ESI-MS/MS analyses indicated that JCK-6131 can produce several antimicrobial compounds, three of which were identified as streptothricin E acid, streptothricin D, and 12-carbamoyl streptothricin D. In addition, the disease control efficacy of the foliar application of JCK-6131 against tomato bacterial wilt was similar to that of the soil drench application, indicating that JCK-6131 could enhance defense resistance in plants. Molecular studies on tomato plants showed that JCK-6131 treatment induced the expression of the <i>pathogenesis-related</i> (<i>PR</i>) genes <i>PR1</i>, <i>PR3</i>, <i>PR5</i>, and <i>PR1</i>2, suggesting the simultaneous activation of the salicylate (SA) and jasmonate (JA) signaling pathways. The transcription levels of <i>PR</i> genes increased earlier and were higher in treated plants than in untreated plants following <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> infection. These results indicate that <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. JCK-6131 can effectively control various plant bacterial and fungal diseases via two distinct mechanisms of antibiosis and induced resistance.
