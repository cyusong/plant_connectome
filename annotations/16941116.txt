We examined the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from plastids obtained from wild type maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings grown under different light conditions and from photosynthetic mutants grown under white light. The cpDNA was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR, quantitative DNA fluorescence, and blot-hybridization following pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The amount of DNA per plastid in light-grown seedlings declines greatly from stalk to leaf blade during proplastid-to-chloroplast development, and this decline is due to cpDNA degradation. In contrast, during proplastid-to-etioplast development in the dark, the cpDNA levels increase from the stalk to the blade. Our results suggest that DNA replication continues in the etioplasts of the upper regions of the stalk and in the leaves. The cpDNA level decreases rapidly, however, after dark-grown seedlings are transferred to light and the etioplasts develop into photosynthetically active chloroplasts. Light, therefore, triggers the degradation of DNA in maize chloroplasts. The cpDNA is retained in the leaf blade of seedlings grown under red, but not blue light. We suggest that light signaling pathways are involved in mediating cpDNA levels, and that red light promotes replication and inhibits degradation and blue light promotes degradation. For five of nine photosynthetic mutants, cpDNA levels in expanded leaves are higher than in wild type, indicating that nuclear genotype can affect the loss or retention of cpDNA.
