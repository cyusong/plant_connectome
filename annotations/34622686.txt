Duckweeds (Lemnaceae) are representative producers in fresh aquatic ecosystems and also yield sustainable biomass for animal feeds, human foods, and biofuels, and contribute toward effective wastewater treatment; thus, enhancing duckweed productivity is a critical challenge. Plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can improve the productivity of terrestrial plants; however, duckweed-PGPB interactions remain unclear and no previous study has investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying duckweed-PGPB interaction. Herein, a PGPB, <i>Ensifer</i> sp. strain SP4, was newly isolated from giant duckweed (<i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i>), and the interactions between <i>S. polyrhiza</i> and SP4 were investigated through physiological, biochemical, and metabolomic analyses. In <i>S. polyrhiza</i> and SP4 coculture, SP4 increased the nitrogen (N), chlorophyll, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) contents and the photosynthesis rate of <i>S. polyrhiza</i> by 2.5-, 2.5-, 2.7-, and 2.4-fold, respectively. Elevated photosynthesis increased the relative growth rate and biomass productivity of <i>S. polyrhiza</i> by 1.5- and 2.7-fold, respectively. Strain SP4 significantly altered the metabolomic profile of <i>S. polyrhiza</i>, especially its amino acid profile. N stable isotope analysis revealed that organic N compounds were transferred from SP4 to <i>S. polyrhiza</i>. These N compounds, particularly glutamic acid, possibly triggered the increase in photosynthetic and growth activities. Accordingly, we propose a new model for the molecular mechanism underlying <i>S. polyrhiza</i> growth promotion by its associated bacteria <i>Ensifer</i> sp. SP4, which occurs through enhanced N compound metabolism and photosynthesis. Our findings show that <i>Ensifer</i> sp. SP4 is a promising PGPB for increasing biomass yield, wastewater purification activity, and CO<sub>2</sub> capture of <i>S. polyrhiza</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
