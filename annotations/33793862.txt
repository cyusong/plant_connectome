Plant growth and development rely on sugar transport between source and sink cells and between different organelles. The plastid-localized sugar transporter GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE TRANSLOCATER1 (GPT1) is an essential gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Using a partially rescued gpt1 mutant and cell-specific RNAi suppression of GPT1, we demonstrated that GPT1 is essential to the function of the embryo suspensor and the development of the embryo. GPT1 showed a dynamic expression/accumulation pattern during embryogenesis. Inhibition of GPT1 accumulation via RNAi using a suspensor-specific promoter resulted in embryos and seedlings with defects similar to auxin mutants. Loss of function of GPT1 in the suspensor also led to abnormal/ectopic cell division in the lower part of the suspensor, which gave rise to an ectopic embryo, resulting in twin embryos in some seeds. Furthermore, loss of function of GPT1 resulted in vacuolar localization of PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) and altered DR5 auxin activity. Proper localization of PIN1 on the plasma membrane is essential to polar auxin transport and distribution, a key determinant of pattern formation during embryogenesis. Our findings suggest that the function of GPT1 in the embryo suspensor is linked to sugar and/or hormone distribution between the embryo proper and the maternal tissues, and is important for maintenance of suspensor identity and function during embryogenesis.
