The SHAQKYF R1MYB transcription factor (TF) HvMYBS3 from barley is an activator of gene expression both during endosperm development and in aleurone cells upon seed germination. Its mRNA was detected as early as 10 days after flowering in developing barley endosperm, with a peak at 18 days, and in aleurone cells at 8 h after water imbibition, as shown by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. The HvMYBS3 protein expressed in bacteria binds to oligonucleotides containing a GATA core derived from the promoters of: (i) the developing endosperm gene Itr1 (5'-GATAAGATA-3') encoding trypsin inhibitor BTI-CMe, and (ii) the post-germinating aleurone gene Amy6.4 (5'-TATCCAC-3'/5'-GTGGATA-3') encoding a high-pI alpha-amylase. Transient expression experiments in co-bombarded developing endosperms and in barley aleurone layers demonstrated that HvMYBS3 trans-activated transcription both from Itr1 and Amy6.4 promoters, in contrast with a previously reported seed-expressed R1MYB, HvMCB1, which was an activator of Itr1 and a transcriptional repressor of the Amy6.4 gene. In the yeast three-hybrid system, the HvMYBS3 protein formed a ternary complex with BPBF and BLZ2, two important seed TFs. However, no binary interactions could be detected between HvMYBS3 and BLZ2 or between HvMYBS3 and BPBF.
