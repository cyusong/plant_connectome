qRT-PCR is a common and key technical means to study gene expression in biological research. However, reliability and accuracy of quantification by qRT-PCR is entirely dependent on the identification of appropriate reference genes. Cucumber as an economical vegetable is widely cultivated worldwide and is subject to serious nematode infection, especially from <i>M. incognita</i>. Plant could employ beneficial soil bacteria in the rhizosphere to enhance plant adaptability to various stresses. In this study, the optimal reference genes in cucumber under <i>M. incognita</i> stress and <i>Pseudomonas</i> treatment were calculated and confirmed. A total of thirteen candidate reference genes were identified across three different treatments. Of these, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper programs combined RefFinder software identified <i>EF1</i> and <i>UBI</i> are the most suitable reference gene in the root knot and whole root of cucumber infected <i>M. incognita</i>, respectively, and <i>CACS</i> is the most suitable reference gene in the whole root of cucumber treated by <i>Pseudomonas</i>. The work first validated the most suitable reference genes for the normalization gene expression in cucumber by nematode infected or <i>Pseudomonas</i> inoculated, and these results would facilitate the further research on <i>M. incognita</i> or <i>Pseudomonas</i> soil rhizosphere microbe interaction with cucumber.
