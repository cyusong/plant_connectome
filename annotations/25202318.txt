['25202318', 'Regulation of primary metabolism is a central mechanism by which plants  coordinate their various responses to biotic and abiotic challenge. To identify  genes responsible for natural variation in primary metabolism, we focused on  cloning a locus from Arabidopsis thaliana that influences the level of TCA cycle  metabolites in planta. We found that the Met.V.67 locus was controlled by natural  variation in METABOLIC NETWORK MODULATOR 1 (MNM1), which encoded an AT-hook  motif-containing protein that was unique to the Brassicales lineage. MNM1 had  wide ranging effects on plant metabolism and displayed a tissue expression  pattern that was suggestive of a function in sink tissues. Natural variation  within MNM1 had differential effects during a diurnal time course, and this  temporal dependency was supported by analysis of T-DNA insertion and  over-expression lines for MNM1. Thus, the cloning of a natural variation locus  specifically associated with primary metabolism allowed us to identify MNM1 as a  lineage-specific modulator of primary metabolism, suggesting that the regulation  of primary metabolism can change during evolution.', '2014', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2014.00415', 'Kliebenstein']
