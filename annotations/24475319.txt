['24475319', 'Mechanosensing in plants is thought to be governed by sensory complexes  containing a Ca(2)(+)-permeable, mechanosensitive channel. The plasma membrane  protein MCA1 and its paralog MCA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana are involved in  mechanical stress-induced Ca(2)(+) influx and are thus considered as candidates for  such channels or their regulators. Both MCA1 and MCA2 were functionally expressed  in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus system in order to elucidate their molecular  natures. Because of the abundance of protein in these cells, MCA2 was chosen for  purification. Purified MCA2 in a detergent-solubilized state formed a tetramer,  which was confirmed by chemical cross-linking. Single-particle analysis of  cryo-electron microscope images was performed to depict the overall shape of the  purified protein. The three-dimensional structure of MCA2 was reconstructed at a  resolution of 26 A from 5,500 particles and appears to comprise a small  transmembrane region and large cytoplasmic region.', '2014', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0087724', 'Nagayama']
