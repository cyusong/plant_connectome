['15538655', 'Recent studies of glucose (Glc) sensing and signaling have revealed that Glc acts  as a critical signaling molecule in higher plants. Several Glc sensing-defective  Arabidopsis mutants have been characterized in detail, and the corresponding  genes encoding Glc-signaling proteins have been isolated. However, the full  complexity of Glc signaling in higher plants is not yet fully understood. Here,  we report the identification and characterization of a new Glc-insensitive  mutant, gaolaozhuangren2 (glz2), which was isolated from transposon mutagenesis  experiments in Arabidopsis. In addition to its insensitivity to Glc, the glz2  plant exhibits several developmental defects such as short stature with reduced  apical dominance, short roots, small and dark-green leaves, late flowering and  female sterility. Treatment with 4% Glc blocked expression of the OE33 gene in  wild-type plants, whereas expression of this gene was unchanged in the glz2  mutant plants. Taken together, our results suggest that the GLZ2 gene is required  for normal glucose response and development of Arabidopsis.', '2004 Dec', 'J Plant Res', '10.1007/s10265-004-0178-y', 'Huang']
