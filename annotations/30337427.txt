The secondary cell wall (SCW) of xylem vessel cells provides rigidity and strength that enables efficient water conduction throughout the plant. To gain insight into SCW deposition, we mutagenized <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN7-inducible plant lines, in which ectopic protoxylem vessel cell differentiation is synchronously induced. The <i>baculites</i> mutant was isolated based on the absence of helical SCW patterns in ectopically-induced protoxylem vessel cells, and mature baculites plants exhibited an <i>irregular xylem</i> (<i>irx</i>) mutant phenotype in mature plants. A single nucleic acid substitution in the <i>CELLULOSE SYNTHASE SUBUNIT 7</i> (<i>CESA7</i>) gene in <i>baculites</i> was identified: while the mutation was predicted to produce a C-terminal truncated protein, immunoblot analysis revealed that <i>cesa7<sup>bac</sup></i> mutation results in loss of production of CESA7 proteins, indicating that <i>baculites</i> is a novel <i>cesa7</i> loss-of-function mutant. In <i>cesa7<sup>bac</sup></i> , despite a lack of patterned cellulose deposition, the helically-patterned deposition of other SCW components, such as the hemicellulose xylan and the phenolic polymer lignin, was not affected. Similar phenotypes were found in another point mutation mutant <i>cesa7<sup>mur10-2</sup></i> , and an established knock-out mutant, <i>cesa7<sup>irx3-4</sup></i> Taken together, we propose that the spatio-temporal deposition of different SCW components, such as xylan and lignin, is not dependent on cellulose patterning.
