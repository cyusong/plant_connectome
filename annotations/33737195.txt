['33737195', 'The SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex is an evolutionarily conserved  histone acetyltransferase complex that has a critical role in histone  acetylation, gene expression, and various developmental processes in eukaryotes.  However, little is known about the composition and function of the SAGA complex  in plants. In this study, we found that the SAGA complex in Arabidopsis thaliana  contains not only conserved subunits but also four plant-specific subunits: three  functionally redundant paralogs, SCS1, SCS2A, and SCS2B (SCS1/2A/2B), and a  TAF-like subunit, TAFL. Mutations in SCS1/2A/2B lead to defective phenotypes  similar to those caused by mutations in the genes encoding conserved SAGA  subunits HAG1 and ADA2B, including delayed juvenile-to-adult phase transition,  late flowering, and increased trichome density. Furthermore, we demonstrated that  SCS1/2A/2B are required for the function of the SAGA complex in histone  acetylation, thereby promoting the transcription of development-related genes.  These results together suggest that SCS1/2A/2B are core subunits of the SAGA  complex in Arabidopsis. Compared with SAGA complexes in other eukaryotes, the  SAGA complexes in plants have evolved unique features that are necessary for  normal growth and development.', '2021 Jul 5', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2021.03.014', 'He']
