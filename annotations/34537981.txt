C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) are key cold-responsive transcription factors that play pleiotropic roles in the cold acclimation, growth, and development of plants. Cold-sensitive cbf knockout mutants and cold-tolerant CBF overexpression lines exhibit abnormal phenotypes at warm temperatures, suggesting that CBF activity is precisely regulated, and a critical threshold level must be maintained for proper plant growth under normal conditions. Cold-inducible CBFs also exist in warm-climate plants but as inactive disulfide-bonded oligomers. However, upon translocation to the nucleus under a cold snap, the h2-isotype of cytosolic thioredoxin (Trx-h2), reduces the oxidized (inactive) CBF oligomers and the newly synthesized CBF monomers, thus producing reduced (active) CBF monomers. Thus, the redox-dependent structural switching and functional activation of CBFs protect plants under cold stress.
