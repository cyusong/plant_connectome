['28939625', 'In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology  (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter  molecules to mediate signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to  downstream effector molecules. A seed-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like  gene (At5g26290) exhibiting aberrant gametogenesis led us to investigate the  developmental role of this gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The  mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes with such  features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed sterility, altered  Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in  megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other  well-characterized mutants. Seed sterility and reduced transmission frequency of  the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the  gene on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various genes  involved in such cellular and developmental pathways as regulation of  transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-mediated signaling,  and gametophyte development. The diverse phenotypes of the mutant and the altered  expression of key genes related to gametophyte and seed development could be  explained based on the functional similarly between At5g26290 and MATH-BTB domain  proteins that modulate gene expression through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome  system. These results show a novel link between a TRAF-like gene and reproductive  development in plants.', '2017 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00275', 'ORCID:']
