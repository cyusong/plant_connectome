Eleusine isolates (members of the Eleusine subgroup) of Pyricularia oryzae are divided into two groups, Ec-I and Ec-II, differentiated by molecular markers. A multilocus phylogenetic analysis and DNA fingerprinting suggested that Ec-I isolates are very close to Eragrostis isolates rather than Ec-II isolates. Infection assays revealed that Ec-II and Eragrostis isolates were exclusively virulent on finger millet and weeping lovegrass, respectively, whereas Ec-I isolates were virulent on both. The avirulence or virulence on weeping lovegrass perfectly corresponded to the presence or absence of an avirulence gene, PWL1; all Ec-II isolates carried an identical, functional PWL1, whereas none of Ec-I isolates or Eragrostis isolates carried it. A comparison of PWL1 flanking regions revealed that Ec-II isolates had a peculiar structure produced by an insertion (or translocation) of a DNA fragment carrying PWL1. Based on these results, a model was constructed which illustrated possible pathways to the establishment of the Eleusine subgroup.
