Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans. Increasing Se content in food crops offers an effective approach to reduce the widespread selenium deficiency problem in many parts of the world. In this study, we evaluated 30 diverse accessions of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) for their capacity to accumulate Se and their responses to different forms of Se in terms of plant growth, nutritional characteristics, and gene expression. Lettuce accessions responded differently to selenate and selenite treatment, and selenate is superior to selenite in inducing total Se accumulation. At least over twofold change in total Se levels between cultivars with high and low Se content was found. Synergistic relationship between Se and sulfur accumulation was observed in nearly all accessions at the selenate dosage applied. The change in shoot biomass varied between lettuce accessions and the forms of Se used. The growth-stimulated effect by selenate and the growth-inhibited effect by selenite were found to be correlated with the alteration of antioxidant enzyme activities. The different ability of lettuce accessions to accumulate Se following selenate treatment appeared to be associated with an altered expression of genes involved in Se/S uptake and assimilation. Our results provide important information for the effects of different forms of Se on plant growth and metabolism. They will also be of help in selecting and developing better cultivars for Se biofortification in lettuce.
