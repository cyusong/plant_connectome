Despite the enormous potential shown by recent biorefineries, the current bioeconomy still encounters multifaceted challenges. To develop a sustainable biorefinery in the future, multidisciplinary research will be essential to tackle technical difficulties. Herein, we leveraged a known plant genetic engineering approach that results in aldehyde-rich lignin via down-regulation of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (<i>CAD</i>) and disruption of monolignol biosynthesis. We also report on renewable deep eutectic solvents (DESs) synthesized from phenolic aldehydes that can be obtained from <i>CAD</i> mutant biomass. The transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana CAD</i> mutant was pretreated with the DESs and showed a twofold increase in the yield of fermentable sugars compared with wild type (WT) upon enzymatic saccharification. Integrated use of low-recalcitrance engineered biomass, characterized by its aldehyde-type lignin subunits, in combination with a DES-based pretreatment, was found to be an effective approach for producing a high yield of sugars typically used for cellulosic biofuels and biobased chemicals. This study demonstrates that integration of renewable DES with plant genetic engineering is a promising strategy in developing a closed-loop process.
