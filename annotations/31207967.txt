Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone that plays an important role in the defense response and stable growth of rice. In this study, we investigated the role of the JA-responsive valine-glutamine (VQ)-motif-containing protein OsVQ13 in JA signaling in rice. OsVQ13 was primarily located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The transgenic rice plants overexpressing <i>OsVQ13</i> exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and increased JA-induced resistance to <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), which is the bacteria that causes rice bacterial blight, one of the most serious diseases in rice. Furthermore, we identified a mitogen-activated protein kinase, OsMPK6, as an OsVQ13-associating protein. The expression of genes regulated by OsWRKY45, an important WRKY-type transcription factor for <i>Xoo</i> resistance that is known to be regulated by OsMPK6, was upregulated in <i>OsVQ13</i>-overexpressing rice plants. The grain size of <i>OsVQ13</i>-overexpressing rice plants was also larger than that of the wild type. These results indicated that OsVQ13 positively regulated JA signaling by activating the OsMPK6-OsWRKY45 signaling pathway in rice.
