Lipid acyl hydrolases (LAH) have received recently increased attention in the context of plant defense. Multiple structurally unrelated gene families have been annotated in Arabidopsis as encoding potential lipid deacylating enzymes with numerous members being transcriptionally activated upon biotic stress. Confirming in silico predictions, experimental data have illustrated the wide subcellular distribution of LAHs indicating they likely interact with distinct membrane systems to initiate specific cellular responses. While recombinant LAHs are active in vitro on a small set of polar lipids, precise knowledge of in vivo substrates and hydrolysis products is generally lacking. Functional analysis of a few LAHs has revealed their roles in initiating oxylipin biosynthesis, cell death execution, signalling or direct antimicrobial activity. The picture emerging is that pathogenic challenge triggers a complex network of lipid hydrolysis events across the cellular compartments resulting in changes in membrane structures and release of signal precursors involved in the building-up of an adequate immune response.
