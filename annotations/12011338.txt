['12011338', 'An ultraviolet-B (UV-B)-resistant mutant, uvi1 (UV-B insensitive 1), of  Arabidopsis was isolated from 1,280 M(1) seeds that had been exposed to ion beam  irradiation. The fresh weight of uvi1 under high-UV-B exposure was more than  twice that of the wild type. A root-bending assay indicated that root growth was  less inhibited by UV-B exposure in uvi1 than in the wild type. When the seedlings  were grown under white light, the UV-B dose required for 50% inhibition was about  6 kJ m(-2) for the wild type and 9 kJ m(-2) for uvi1. When the seedlings were  irradiated with UV-B in darkness, the dose required for 50% inhibition was about  1.5 kJ m(-2) for the wild type and 4 kJ m(-2) for uvi1. An enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay showed that the reduction in levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine  dimers (CPDs) under white light and of (6-4) photoproducts in darkness occurred  faster in uvi1 than in the wild type. These results indicate that uvi1 had  increased photoreactivation of CPDs and dark repair of (6-4) photoproducts,  leading to strong UV-B resistance. Furthermore, the transcript levels of PHR1  (CPD photolyase gene) were much higher in uvi1 than in the wild type both under  white light and after UV-B exposure. Placing the plants in the dark before UV-B  exposure decreases the early reduction of CPDs in the wild type but not in uvi1.  Our results suggest that UVI1 is a negative regulator of two independent DNA  repair systems.', '2002 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.010894', 'Watanabe']
