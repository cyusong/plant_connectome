['30466593', 'Induction and secretion of acid phosphatases is an adaptive response of plants to  phosphate starvation. The secreted acid phosphatases are believed to scavenge  phosphate from organophosphate compounds in the rhizosphere, thereby increasing  phosphate availability for plant absorption. To date, however, all of the  characterized phosphate starvation-induced secreted acid phosphatases in plants  belong to a unique acid phosphatases subfamily, called purple acid phosphatase.  In this work, we identified a phosphate starvation-induced secreted acid  phosphatase in Arabidopsis as a vegetative storage protein, AtVSP3. AtVSP3 exists  as a monomer with molecular weight of 29 kDa. The activity of recombinant AtVSP3  protein is activated by Mg(2+), Co(2+), and Ca(2+). AtVSP3 has an optimal pH of  6.5 for its APase activity and is relatively thermostable. The transcription of  AtVSP3 is induced in roots by phosphate starvation, and the accumulation of  AtVSP3 protein is high in roots and siliques. Additional research is needed to  determine the function of AtVSP3 in plant responses to stress conditions.', '2018 Dec', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.09.016', 'Liu']
