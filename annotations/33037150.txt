Plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are important players in response to pathogen infections. Verticillium and Fusarium wilts, caused by <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (<i>Vd</i>) and <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp <i>vasinfectum</i> (<i>Fov</i>), respectively, are among the most devastating diseases in cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp). To understand the cotton response to these soil-borne fungal pathogens, we performed a genome-wide in silico characterization and functional screen of diverse RLKs for their involvement in cotton wilt diseases. We identified <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> GhWAK7A, a wall-associated kinase, that positively regulates cotton response to both <i>Vd</i> and <i>Fov</i> infections. Chitin, the major constituent of the fungal cell wall, is perceived by lysin-motif-containing RLKs (LYKs/CERK1), leading to the activation of plant defense against fungal pathogens. A conserved chitin sensing and signaling system is present in cotton, including chitin-induced GhLYK5-GhCERK1 dimerization and phosphorylation, and contributes to cotton defense against <i>Vd</i> and <i>Fov</i> Importantly, GhWAK7A directly interacts with both GhLYK5 and GhCERK1 and promotes chitin-induced GhLYK5-GhCERK1 dimerization. GhWAK7A phosphorylates GhLYK5, which itself does not have kinase activity, but requires phosphorylation for its function. Consequently, GhWAK7A plays a crucial role in chitin-induced responses. Thus, our data reveal GhWAK7A as an important component in cotton response to fungal wilt pathogens by complexing with the chitin receptors.
