['28945799', 'Alkaline/neutral invertases (A/N-Inv), glucosidases that irreversibly hydrolyze  sucrose into glucose and fructose, play significant roles in plant growth,  development, and stress adaptation. They occur as multiple isoforms located in  the cytosol or organelles. In Arabidopsis thaliana, two mitochondrial A/N-Inv  genes (A/N-InvA and A/N-InvC) have already been investigated. In this study, we  functionally characterized A/N-InvH, a third Arabidopsis gene coding for a  mitochondrial-targeted protein. The phenotypic analysis of knockout mutant plants  (invh) showed a severely reduced shoot growth, while root development was not  affected. The emergence of the first floral bud and the opening of the first  flower were the most affected stages, presenting a significant delay. A/N-InvH  transcription is markedly active in reproductive tissues. It is also expressed in  the elongation and apical meristem root zones. Our results show that A/N-InvH  expression is not evident in photosynthetic tissues, despite being of relevance  in developmental processes and mitochondrial functional status. NaCl and mannitol  treatments increased A/N-InvH expression twofold in the columella root cap.  Moreover, the absence of A/N-InvH prevented ROS formation, not only in invh roots  of salt- and ABA-treated seedlings but also in invh control roots. We hypothesize  that this isoform may take part in the ROS/sugar (sucrose or its hydrolysis  products) signaling pathway network, involved in reproductive tissue development,  cell elongation, and abiotic stress responses.', '2017', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0185286', 'ORCID:']
