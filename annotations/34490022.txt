12-oxo-Phytodienoic acid (OPDA) is a primary precursor of (-)-jasmonic acid (JA), able to trigger autonomous signaling pathways that regulate a unique subset of jasmonate-responsive genes, activating and fine-tuning defense responses, as well as growth processes in plants. Recently, a number of studies have illuminated the physiol-molecular activities of OPDA signaling in plants, which interconnect the regulatory loop of photosynthesis, cellular redox homeostasis, and transcriptional regulatory networks, together shedding new light on (<i>i</i>) the underlying modes of cellular interfaces between growth and defense responses (e.g., fitness trade-offs or balances) and (<i>ii</i>) vital information in genetic engineering or molecular breeding approaches to upgrade own survival capacities of plants. However, our current knowledge regarding its mode of actions is still far from complete. This review will briefly revisit recent progresses on the roles and mechanisms of OPDA and information gaps within, which help in understanding the phenotypic and environmental plasticity of plants.
