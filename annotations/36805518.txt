Flower busd formation is an important plant growth process. It has been reported that dwarfing rootstocks can significantly affect the flower bud formation of scions. In this study, we found the dwarfing rootstock 'Yunnan' quince could significantly increase the flowering rate of 'Abbé Fetel' pear scions. The RNA-sequencing data revealed significant changes in the expression of genes related to hormone pathways. Furthermore, hormone analyses indicated that 'Yunnan' quince significantly decreased the GA<sub>3</sub> content and increased the cytokinin/auxin ratio in 'Abbé Fetel' pear apical buds. The hormone contents were consistent with the RNA-sequencing data. Moreover, we found the flower development-related genes PbAGL9 and PbCAL-A1 were significantly upregulated and PbTFL1 was significantly downregulated in 'Abbé Fetel'/'Yunnan' quince apical buds. To further clarify the relationship between hormones and flowering-related genes, a hormone response assay was carried out. We found the expression levels of PbCAl-A1, PbTFL1 and PbAGL9 were regulated by hormones including GA<sub>3</sub>, CPPU and NAA. Y1H and dual-luciferase assays indicated that PbAGL9 significantly decreased the promoter activity of PbTFL1. In summary, 'Yunnan' quince upregulated PbCAL-A1 and PbAGL9, and downregulated PbTFL1 expression by decreasing the GA<sub>3</sub> content and increasing the cytokinin/auxin ratio in 'Abbé Fetel' pear apical buds. Additionally, 'Yunnan' quince down-regulate PbTFL1 by upregulating the expression of PbAGL9, and eventually promoted floral induction in 'Abbé Fetel' pear.
