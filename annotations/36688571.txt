Chaenomeles speciosa is a plant with high ornamental value, and the color of its petals deepens obviously under drought stress. To understand the mechanism of drought-induced reddening of C. speciosa petal color, the metabolites and transcriptomics of petals from 4% PEG-8000-treated and control cuttings were analyzed. In this study, the analysis of metabolites revealed the accumulation of anthocyanins in petals of PEG-treated cuttings, indicating anthocyanins might be the reason for the deepening of petal color. By using transcriptomics, we identified CsMYB6 as an overexpressed transcription factor in PEG-treated samples. Transient overexpression and suppression of CsMYB6 revealed that it is a key transcription factor for anthocyanin synthesis. We identified genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis and constructed a network of drought- and anthocyanin-related genes (such as CsMYB6, CsbHLH111, CsANS, CsDFR, and CsUFGT). Further experiments indicated that CsMYB6 directly interacted with CsbHLH111, and this interaction increased the binding ability of CsMYB6 to the promoter regions of three structural genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis: CsANS, CsDFR, and CsUFGT. Our findings provide a molecular basis and new insight into drought-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in C. speciosa.
