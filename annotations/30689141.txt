This report reveals that the LMI1-like and KNOX1 genes coordinately control the leaf development and different combinations of those genes which produce diverse leaf shapes including broad, lobed and compound leaves. Class I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX1) genes are involved in compound leaf development and are repressed by the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1)-AS2 complex. Cotton plants have a variety of leaf shapes, including broad leaves and lobed leaves. GhOKRA, a LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY 1 (LMI1)-like gene, controls the development of an okra leaf shape. We cloned the corresponding cotton homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana AS1 and AS2 and seven KNOX1 genes. Through virus-induced gene silencing technology, we found that either GhAS1 or GhAS2-silenced cotton plants showed a great change in leaf shape from okra leaves to trifoliolate dissected leaves. In the shoot tips of these plants, the expression of the cotton ortholog of Knotted in A. thaliana 1 (KNAT1), GhKNOTTED1-LIKE2/3/4 (GhKNL2/3/4), was increased. However, GhKNOX1s-silenced plants maintained the wild-type okra leaves. A novel dissected-like leaf in A. thaliana was further generated by crossing plants constitutively expressing GhOKRA with either as1-101 or as2-101 mutant plants. The dissected-like leaves showed two different leaf vein patterns. This report reveals that the LMI1-like and KNOX1 genes coordinately control leaf development, and different combinations of these genes produce diverse leaf shapes including broad leaves, lobed leaves and compound leaves. This is the first report on the artificial generation of compound leaves from simple leaves in cotton.
