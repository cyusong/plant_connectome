The development of the angiosperm seed includes the accumulation of storage products, the loss of most of its water and the establishment of dormancy. While much is known about the pathways that initiate maturation during mid-embryogenesis or repress it after germination, only recently has it been shown that other mechanisms repress the program during early embryogenesis.Two recent reports have shown that microRNAs are critical regulators of maturation in Arabidopsis early embryogenesis. Two closely related trihelix transcription factors, ASIL1 and ASIL2, were identified as probable partially redundant repressors of early maturation downstream of the microRNA-synthesizing enzyme DICER-LIKE1. An overlap between the genes upregulated in asil1-1 and dcl1-15 mutants support this conclusion. ASIL2 orthologs are found across seed plants, indicating that their role in maturation might be conserved. ASIL1 arose from the ancestral ASIL2 clade by a gene duplication event in the Brassicaceae, although it is not clear whether its function has diverged.
