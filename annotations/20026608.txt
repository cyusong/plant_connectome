['20026608', 'Cold is a limiting environmental factor that adversely affects plant growth and  productivity. Calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling is believed to play a pivotal  role in plant response to cold stress, but its exact role is not clearly  understood. Here, we report that CRLK1, a novel calcium/calmodulin-regulated  receptor-like kinase, is crucial for cold tolerance in plants. CRLK1 has two  calmodulin-binding sites with different affinities as follows: one located at  residues 369-390 with a K(d) of 25 nm, and the other located at residues 28-112  with a K(d) of 160 nm. Calcium/calmodulin stimulated the kinase activity, but the  addition of chlorpromazine, a calmodulin antagonist, blocked its stimulation.  CRLK1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane, and its expression is  stimulated by cold and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Under normal growth  conditions, there is no noticeable phenotypic difference between wild-type and  crlk1 knock-out mutant plants. However, as compared with wild-type plants, the  crlk1 knock-out mutants exhibited an increased sensitivity to chilling and  freezing temperatures. Northern analysis showed that the induction of  cold-responsive genes, including CBF1, RD29A, COR15a, and KIN1 in crlk1 mutants,  is delayed as compared with wild-type plants. These results indicate that CRLK1  is a positive regulator of cold tolerance in plants. Furthermore, our results  suggest that CRLK1 plays a role in bridging calcium/calmodulin signaling and cold  signaling.', '2010 Mar 5', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M109.035659', 'Poovaiah']
