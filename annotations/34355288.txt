A synthetic peptide from the C-terminal end of C<sub>4</sub>-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is implicated in the proteolysis of the enzyme, and Glc-6P or phosphorylation of the enzyme modulate this effect. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a cytosolic, homotetrameric enzyme that performs a variety of functions in plants. Among them, it is primarily responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis pathway (C<sub>4</sub>-PEPC). Here we show that proteolysis of C<sub>4</sub>-PEPC by cathepsin proteases present in a semi-purified PEPC fraction was enhanced by the presence of a synthetic peptide containing the last 19 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the PEPC subunit (pC19). Threonine (Thr)944 and Thr948 in the peptide are important requirements for the pC19 effect. C<sub>4</sub>-PEPC proteolysis in the presence of pC19 was prevented by the PEPC allosteric effector glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6P) and by phosphorylation of the enzyme. The role of these elements in the regulation of PEPC proteolysis is discussed in relation to the physiological context.
