Instrumentation and methods for rapid screening and selection of plants with improved water use efficiency are essential to address current issues of global food and fuel security. A new imaging system that combines chlorophyll fluorescence and thermal imaging has been developed to generate images of assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) from whole plants or leaves under controlled environmental conditions. This is the first demonstration of the production of images of WUEi and the first to determine images of g s from themography at the whole-plant scale. Data are presented illustrating the use of this system for rapidly and non-destructively screening plants for alterations in WUEi by comparing Arabidopsis thaliana mutants (OST1-1) that have altered WUEi driven by open stomata, with wild-type plants. This novel instrument not only provides the potential to monitor multiple plants simultaneously, but enables intra- and interspecies variation to be taken into account both spatially and temporally. The ability to measure A, gs, and WUEi progressively was developed to facilitate and encourage the development of new dynamic protocols. Images illustrating the instrument's dynamic capabilities are demonstrated by analysing plant responses to changing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Applications of this system will augment the research community's need for novel screening methods to identify rapidly novel lines, cultivars, or species with improved A and WUEi in order to meet the current demands on modern agriculture and food production.
