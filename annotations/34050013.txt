Conventional methods of DNA sequence insertion into plants, using <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation or microprojectile bombardment, result in the integration of the DNA at random sites in the genome. These plants may exhibit altered agronomic traits as a consequence of disruption or silencing of genes that serve a critical function. Also, genes of interest inserted at random sites are often not expressed at the desired level. For these reasons, targeted DNA insertion at suitable genomic sites in plants is a desirable alternative. In this paper we review approaches of targeted DNA insertion in plant genomes, discuss current technical challenges, and describe promising applications of targeted DNA insertion for crop genetic improvement.
