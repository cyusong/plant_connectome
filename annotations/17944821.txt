Cytokinins are plant hormones that influence diverse processes of growth and development. In this study the cytokinin response regulators (RRs) were identified, annotated and characterized at the transcript level in Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa genotype Nisqually 1. The Populus genome was searched for genes that exhibit high sequence identity across their receiver domains. Gene structure was determined by prediction software and, where possible, corroborated by publicly available expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Thirty-three genes belonging to the cytokinin RR gene family were identified in Populus: 11 type As, 11 type Bs and 11 pseudo-RRs. Developmental and cytokinin-responsive expression of the Populus RRs was assessed by whole-genome microarrays and semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Populus RR type As and type Bs appear to be preferentially expressed in nodes, while pseudo-RRs are preferentially expressed in mature leaves. Seven type As and three type Bs were rapidly induced by exogenous cytokinin. Organ-preferred expression patterns suggest possible roles for type As and Bs in development and for pseudo-RRs in integration of environmental signals with plant function.
