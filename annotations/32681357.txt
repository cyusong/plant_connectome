The mutation of FAX1 (Fatty Acid Export 1) disrupts ROS homeostasis and suppresses transcription activity of DYT1-TDF1-AMS-MS188 genetic network, leading to atypical tapetum PCD and defective pollen formation in Arabidopsis. Fatty acids (FAs) have multiple important biological functions and exert diverse cellular effects through modulating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) homeostasis. Arabidopsis FAX1 (Fatty Acid Export 1) mediates the export of de novo synthesized FA from chloroplast and loss of function of FAX1 impairs male fertility. However, mechanisms underlying the association of FAX1-mediated FA export with male sterility remain enigmatic. In this study, by using an integrated approach that included morphological, cytological, histological, and molecular analyses, we revealed that loss of function of FAX1 breaks cellular FA/lipid homeostasis, which disrupts ROS homeostasis and suppresses transcriptional activation of the DYT1-TDF1-AMS-MS188 genetic network of anther development, impairing tapetum development and pollen wall formation, and resulting in male sterility. This study provides new insights into the regulatory network for male reproduction in plants, highlighting an important role of FA export-mediated ROS homeostasis in the process.
