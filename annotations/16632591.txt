Sucrose starvation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell culture was used to identify translationally regulated genes by DNA microarray analysis. Cells were starved by subculture without sucrose, and total and polysomal RNA was extracted between 6 and 48 h. Probes were derived from both RNA populations and used to screen oligonucleotide microarrays. Out of 25,607 screened genes, 224 were found to be differentially accumulated in polysomal RNA following starvation and 21 were found to be invariant in polysomal RNA while their total RNA abundance was modified. Most of the mRNA appears to be translationally repressed (183/245 genes), which is consistent with a general decrease in metabolic activities during starvation. The parallel transcriptional analysis identifies 268 regulated genes. Comparison of transcriptional and translational gene lists highlights the importance of translational regulation (mostly repression) affecting genes involved in cell cycle and cell growth, these being overrepresented in translationally regulated genes, providing a molecular framework for the arrest of cell proliferation following starvation. Starvation-induced translational control also affects chromatin regulation genes, such as the HD1 histone deacetylase, and the level of histone H4 acetylation was found to increase during starvation. This suggests that regulation of the global nuclear transcriptional activity might be linked to cytoplasmic translational regulations.
