Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which has been identified as a lipid-derived stress hormone, mediates plant resistance to biotic/abiotic stress. Understanding MeJA-induced plant defense provides insight into how they responding to environmental stimuli. In this work, the dynamic network analysis method was used to quantitatively identify the tipping point of growth-to-defense transition and detect the associated genes. As a result, 146 genes were detected as dynamic network biomarker (DNB) members and the critical defense transition was identified based on dense time-series RNA-seq data of MeJA-treated Arabidopsis thaliana. The GO functional analysis showed that these DNB genes were significantly enriched in defense terms. The network analysis between DNB genes and differentially expressed genes showed that the hub genes including SYP121, SYP122, WRKY33 and MPK11 play a vital role in plant growth-to-defense transition. Based on the dynamic network analysis of MeJA-induced plant resistance, we provide an important guideline for understanding the growth-to-defense transition of plants' response to environment stimuli. This study also provides a database with the key genes of plant defense induced by MeJA.
