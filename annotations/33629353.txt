Drought is one of the primary abiotic stresses, seriously implicating plant growth and productivity. Stomata play a crucial role in regulating drought tolerance. However, the molecular mechanism on stomatal movement-mediated drought tolerance remains unclear. Using genetic, molecular and biochemical techniques, we identified that the PdGNC directly activating the promoter of PdHXK1 by binding the GATC element, a hexokinase (HXK) synthesis key gene. Here, PdGNC, a member of the GATA transcription factor family, was greatly induced by abscisic acid and dehydration. Overexpressing PdGNC in poplar (Populus clone 717) resulted in reduced stomatal aperture with greater water-use efficiency and increased water deficit tolerance. By contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated poplar mutant gnc exhibited increased stomatal aperture and water loss with reducing drought resistance. PdGNC activates PdHXK1 (a hexokinase synthesis key gene), resulting in a remarkable increase in hexokinase activity in poplars subjected to water deficit. Furthermore, hexokinase promoted nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) production in guard cells, which ultimately reduced stomatal aperture and increased drought resistance. Together, PdGNC confers drought stress tolerance by reducing stomatal aperture caused by NO and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production via the direct regulation of PdHXK1 expression in poplars.
