Maize (Zea mays) is an important cereal crop worldwide. However, its yield and quality are adversely affected by salt stress resulting from soil hypersalinity. Exploring the regulatory mechanisms of stress responses is of vital importance to increase maize seed production. In the present study, we screened ethyl methanesulfonate-induced maize mutants and identified a salt-tolerant mutant. A single base was mutated in ZmWRKY20, leading to the formation of a truncated protein variant. A detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that this mutant had significantly higher resistance to wilting and lower reactive oxygen species levels than the inbred line B73. ZmWRKY20 showed transcriptional activity in yeast and specifically bound W-boxes according to the results of our yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual-luciferase assays. Overexpression of ZmWRKY20 decreased salt tolerance in maize. Transcriptome profiling revealed that ZmWRKY20 overexpression extensively reprogrammed genes involved in regulating defense and oxidation-reduction responses. The results substantiate that ZmWRKY20 is directly targeted to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) motif in the transcription factor ZmbZIP111. It was also verified that ZmWRKY20 interacts with ZmWRKY115 and both proteins act jointly to enhance ZmbZIP111 repression. The results indicate that the ZmWRKY20 and ZmWRKY115 transcription factors interact in the nucleus, leading to repression of ZmbZIP111 expression by directly binding its promoter, and increase the sensitivity of maize seedlings to salt stress. The current study improves our understanding of the complicated responses of maize to salt stress.
