['12783786', 'The generation of a specific cell shape requires differential growth, whereby  specific regions of the cell expand more relative to others. The Arabidopsis  crooked mutant exhibits aberrant cell shapes that develop because of mis-directed  expansion, especially during a rapid growth phase. GFP-aided visualization of the  F-actin cytoskeleton and the behavior of subcellular organelles in different  cell-types in crooked and wild-type Arabidopsis revealed that localized expansion  is promoted in cellular regions with fine F-actin arrays but is restricted in  areas that maintain dense F-actin. This suggested that a spatiotemporal  distinction between fine versus dense F-actin in a growing cell could determine  the final shape of the cell. CROOKED was molecularly identified as the plant  homolog of ARPC5, the smallest sub-unit of the ARP2/3 complex that in other  organisms is renowned for its role in creating dendritic arrays of fine F-actin.  Rescue of crooked phenotype by the human ortholog provides the first molecular  evidence for the presence and functional conservation of the complex in higher  plants. Our cell-biological and molecular characterization of CROOKED suggests a  general actin-based mechanism for regulating differential growth and generating  cell shape diversity.', '2003 Jul', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.00549', 'Hulskamp']
