['11851922', 'Despite the recent discovery that trehalose synthesis is widespread in higher  plants very little is known about its physiological significance. Here we report  on an Arabidopsis mutant (tps1), disrupted in a gene encoding the first enzyme of  trehalose biosynthesis (trehalose-6-phosphate synthase). The tps1 mutant is a  recessive embryo lethal. Embryo morphogenesis is normal but development is  retarded and stalls early in the phase of cell expansion and storage reserve  accumulation. TPS1 is transiently up-regulated at this same developmental stage  and is required for the full expression of seed maturation marker genes (2S2 and  OLEOSN2). Sucrose levels also increase rapidly in seeds during the onset of cell  expansion. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae trehalose-6-phosphate (T-6-P) is required  to regulate sugar influx into glycolysis via the inhibition of hexokinase and a  deficiency in TPS1 prevents growth on sugars (Thevelein and Hohmann, 1995). The  growth of Arabidopsis tps1-1 embryos can be partially rescued in vitro by  reducing the sucrose level. However, T-6-P is not an inhibitor of AtHXK1 or  AtHXK2. Nor does reducing hexokinase activity rescue tps1-1 embryo growth. Our  data establish for the first time that an enzyme of trehalose metabolism is  essential in plants and is implicated in the regulation of sugar  metabolism/embryo development via a different mechanism to that reported in S.  cerevisiae.', '2002 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01220.x', 'Graham']
