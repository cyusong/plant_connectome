In tomato, auxin and gibberellins (GAs) interact with each other to drive fruit growth and development. While the role of auxin in directing GA biosynthesis and signal is already known, very little information has been obtained about GA-mediated control of auxin signalling and response. Interestingly, we show that gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub> ) is able to modify the expression of several auxin signalling genes in the partial auxin-insensitive diageotropica (dgt) mutant, suggesting that GAs may override the control of DGT on auxin signal. Procera (pro) mutation, which confers a constitutively active GA signal, enhances the effects of exogenous auxin, indicating that PRO may act as a negative effector of auxin responses in fruits. Indeed, transcript modulation of some auxin/indole acetic acid and auxin response factor genes in auxin-treated dgt/pro fruits suggests that PRO controls their expression possibly bypassing DGT. It was also shown that GA biosynthesis, in response to auxin treatment, is largely controlled by DGT. It is therefore conceivable that the DGT-mediated increase of active GAs in auxin-treated or pollinated fruits would promote PRO degradation, which in turn activates part of the auxin signalling cascade.
