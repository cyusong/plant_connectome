Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are stress-responsive proteins that are conserved across all organisms. Heat shock protein 101 (HSP101) has an important role in thermotolerance owing to its chaperone activity. However, if and how it functions in development under nonstress conditions is not yet known. By using physiological, molecular, and genetic methods, we investigated the role of HSP101 in the control of flowering in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.) under nonstress conditions. Knockout and overexpression of HSP101 cause late and early flowering, respectively. Late flowering can be restored by rescue of HSP101. HSP101 regulates the expression of genes involved in the six known flowering pathways; the most negatively regulated genes are FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); downstream integrators of the flowering pathways are positively regulated. The late-flowering phenotype of loss-of-HSP101 mutants is suppressed by both the mutations of FLC and SVP. The responses of flowering time to exogenous signals do not change in HSP101 mutants. HSP101 is also found in nonspecific regions according to subcellular localization. We found that HSP101 promotes flowering under nonstress conditions and that this promotion depends on FLC and SVP. Our data suggest that this promotion could occur through a multiple gene regulation mechanism.
