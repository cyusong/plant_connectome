['36044943', 'Abiotic stresses such as salt and drought affect plants growth and development,  whereas the plant hormone ABA is able to regulate plant responses to abiotic  stresses by regulating downstream gene expression. Therefore characterization of  unknown function ABA responsive genes is able to identify novel regulators of  plant abiotic stress responses. We report here the characterization of AtS40-1, a  Group I DUF584 protein in the regulation of ABA and salt responses in  Arabidopsis. RT-PCR results show that the expression of AtS40-1 was dramatically  induced by ABA, but only slightly increase, if any, was observed for other three  Group I DUF584 genes including AtS40-1L, AtS40-2 and AtS40-3. Transfection assays  in Arabidopsis protoplasts show that all the four Group I DUF584 proteins were  predominately localized in nucleus and were able to repress the expression of the  co-transfected reporter gene. The roles of AtS40-1 in regulating plant response  to ABA and abiotic stress responses were analyzed, by using transgenic plants and  inactivation mutants. The results show that the ABA responses were increased in  the 35S:AtS40-1 transgenic plants, but decreased in the ats40-1 mutants. Similar  to AtS40-1, the results indicate that AtS40-1L, the most closely related DUF584  protein to AtS40-1, positively regulates ABA responses in Arabidopsis. However,  further decreased ABA responses were not observed in the ats40-1 ats40-1L double  mutants. On the other hand, salt tolerance was increased in the transgenic plants  overexpressing AtS40-1 or AtS40-1L, but decreased in the ats40-1 and ats40-1L  mutants. Quantitative RT-PCR results show that the ABA induced expression of the  ABA signaling regulator genes ABI3, ABI4 and ABA responsive gene RAB18 was  decreased, where as ABA signaling gene ABI1 was increased in the ats40-1 mutants.  These results suggest that AtS40-1 regulates ABA and salt responses in  Arabidopsis, possibly by affecting ABA induced expression of some ABA signaling  regulator genes.', '2022 Dec 20', 'Gene', '10.1016/j.gene.2022.146846', 'Wang']
