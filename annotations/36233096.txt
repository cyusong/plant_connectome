Plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) is one of the largest subfamilies of Aquaporins (<i>AQPs</i>) and plays an important role in plant growth and development, and resistance to abiotic stress. In this study, the full length of the <i>EuPIP1;1</i> cDNA was cloned from <i>Eucommia ulmoides</i> using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. The <i>EuPIP1;1</i> gene was induced by drought treatment and expressed in all tested tissues, with the highest expression level in fruit. The subcellular localization showed that <i>EuPIP1;1</i> was located in the plasma membrane. Constitutive overexpression of <i>EuPIP1;1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i><i>thaliana</i> could promote leaf growth and development, and accelerate bolting and flowering. Six genes related to growth and flowering (<i>AtPIF4</i>, <i>AtTCP14</i>, <i>AtCRY1</i>, <i>AtCRY2</i>, <i>AtFCA</i> and <i>AtFT</i>) were significantly up-regulated in transgenic lines. Further, <i>EuPIP1;1</i> gene improved resistance to drought and salt stress in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Under drought and salt stress treatment, the transgenic lines had a higher germination rate and accumulation of osmotic substances, lower membrane damage, and could maintain ion homeostasis. Our results suggest that <i>EuPIP1;1</i> plays an essential role in plant growth and development and in the response to drought and salt stress.
