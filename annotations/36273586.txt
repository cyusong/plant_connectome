The riboflavin derivatives FMN and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are critical cofactors for wide-ranging biological processes across all kingdoms of life. Although it is well established that these flavins can be readily interconverted, in plants, the responsible catalysts and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of an FAD synthetase encoded by the gene At5g03430, which we have designated AtFADS1 (A. thaliana FADS1). The catalytic properties of the FAD synthetase activity are similar to those reported for other FAD synthetases, except that we observed maximum activity with Zn<sup>2+</sup> as the associated divalent metal cation. Like human FAD synthetase, AtFADS1 exists as an apparent fusion with an ancestral FAD pyrophosphatase, a feature that is conserved across plants. However, we detected no pyrophosphatase activity with AtFADS1, consistent with an observed loss of a key catalytic residue in higher plant evolutionary history. In contrast, we determined that algal FADS1 retains both FAD synthetase and pyrophosphatase activity. We discuss the implications, including the potential for yet-unstudied biologically relevant noncatalytic functions, and possible evolutionary pressures that have led to the loss of FAD pyrophosphatase activity, yet universal retention of an apparently nonfunctional domain in FADS of land plants.
