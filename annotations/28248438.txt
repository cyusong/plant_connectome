Rice is vulnerable to cold stress. Seedlings are very sensitive to cold stress and this harms global rice production. The effects of cold on chloroplast development are well known, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we isolated a temperature-sensitive virescent (tsv) mutant that is extremely sensitive to cold stress. It displayed defective chloroplasts, decreased chlorophyll and zero survivorship under cold stress. We isolated and identified TSV by map-based cloning and rescue experiments, combined with genetic, cytological and molecular biological analyses. We found that TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, is a new type of virescent protein. A mutation in tsv causes premature termination of the gene product. The activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and the expression of genes participating in chlorophyll synthesis were severely reduced in the tsv mutant under cold stress, but not at normal temperatures. TSV expression was induced by low temperatures. Strikingly, TSV interacted with OsTrxZ (a subunit of PEP in chloroplasts) and enhanced OsTrxZ stability under low temperatures. We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ. These results provide novel insights into ways in which rice chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis are protected by TSV under cold stress.
