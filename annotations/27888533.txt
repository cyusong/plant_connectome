Rice diseases caused by multiple pathogen species are a major obstacle to achieving optimal yield. Using host pathogen species-non-specific broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) for rice improvement is an efficient way to control diseases. Recent advances in rice genomics and improved understanding of the mechanisms of rice-pathogen interactions have shown that using a single gene to improve rice BSR to multiple pathogen species is technically possible and the necessary resources exist. A variety of rice genes, including major disease resistance genes and defense-responsive genes, which function in pattern-triggered immunity signaling, effector-triggered immunity signaling or quantitative resistance, can mediate BSR to two or more pathogen species independently. These genes encode diverse proteins and function differently in promoting disease resistance, thus providing a relatively broad choice for different breeding programs. This updated knowledge will facilitate rice improvement with pathogen species-non-specific BSR via gene marker-assisted selection or biotechnological approaches.
