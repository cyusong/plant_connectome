This study showed that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, AgMYB2, functions in anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in purple celery. Anthocyanins are involved in tissue coloration and stress response in plants. Foods containing high anthocyanin content are also beneficial to human health. Purple celery accumulated amounts of anthocyanins in the petioles. The biosynthesis of anthocyanin in plants is mainly regulated by the R2R3-MYB transcription factor (TF). However, the R2R3-MYB TF that controls anthocyanin accumulation in purple celery remains unclear. In this study, an R2R3-MYB TF gene, AgMYB2, was cloned from purple celery and characterized as anthocyanin biosynthetic regulator. Sequence analysis indicated that AgMYB2 contained highly conserved R2R3 domain and two anthocyanin characteristic motifs, ANDV motif and KPRPR[S/T]F motif. The relative expression level of AgMYB2 in purple celery was significantly higher than that in non-purple celery at three developmental stages. Heterologous expression of AgMYB2 in Arabidopsis generated more anthocyanins and resulted in dark-purple leaves and flowers. The expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and the antioxidant activity of transgenic Arabidopsis carrying AgMYB2 were up-regulated. The determination of anthocyanin glycosylation activity of Arabidopsis crude enzyme verified the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory function of AgMYB2 at the protein level. The interaction between AgMYB2 and bHLH proteins was shown by yeast two-hybrid assay. The results will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple celery and provide an approach for cultivating plants with high anthocyanin content.
