Studies have shown that pathogenic bacteria infections induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants. Cyanide-resistant respiration, an energy-dissipating pathway in plants, has also been induced by a pathogenic bacteria infection. However, it is unknown whether the induction of cyanide-resistant respiration under the pathogenic bacteria infection was caused by ROS. In this study, two pathogenic Erwinia strains were used to infect potato tuber, and membrane lipid peroxidation levels and the cyanide-resistant respiration capacity were determined. In addition, StAOX expression and regulation by ROS in potato tuber were analyzed. Moreover, the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway in regulating cyanide-resistant respiration was determined. The results showed that ROS induced cyanide-resistant respiration in potato tuber infected by Erwinia. Cyanide-resistant respiration inhibited the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated the expression of calcium-dependent protein kinase (StCDPK1, StCDPK4, and StCDPK5) in potato, which indirectly controlled intracellular ROS levels. These results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism is involved in ROS-induced cyanide-resistant respiration.
