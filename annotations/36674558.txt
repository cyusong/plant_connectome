Small RNA (sRNA) has become an alternate biotechnology tool for sustaining eco-agriculture by enhancing plant solidity and managing environmental hazards over traditional methods. Plants synthesize a variety of sRNA to silence the crucial genes of pests or plant immune inhibitory proteins and counter adverse environmental conditions. These sRNAs can be cultivated using biotechnological methods to apply directly or through bacterial systems to counter the biotic stress. On the other hand, through synthesizing sRNAs, microbial networks indicate toxic elements in the environment, which can be used effectively in environmental monitoring and management. Moreover, microbes possess sRNAs that enhance the degradation of xenobiotics and maintain bio-geo-cycles locally. Selective bacterial and plant sRNA systems can work symbiotically to establish a sustained eco-agriculture system. An sRNA-mediated approach is becoming a greener tool to replace xenobiotic pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemical remediation elements. The review focused on the applications of sRNA in both sustained agriculture and bioremediation. It also discusses limitations and recommends various approaches toward future improvements for a sustained eco-agriculture system.
