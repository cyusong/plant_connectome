Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causes substantial damage and loss of yield in oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The molecular mechanisms of oilseed rape defense against Sclerotinia remain elusive. In this study, we found that in the early stages of B. napus infection a conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade mediated by BnaA03.MKK5-BnaA06.MPK3/BnaC03.MPK3 module phosphorylates the substrate BnWRKY33, enhancing its transcriptional activity. The activated BnWRKY33 binds to its own promoter and triggers a transcriptional burst of BnWRKY33, thus helping plants effectively resist the pathogenic fungi by enhancing the expression of phytoalexin synthesis-related genes. The expression of BnWRKY33 is fine-tuned during defense. Ongoing Sclerotinia infection induces BnaA03.WRKY28 and BnaA09.VQ12 expression. BnaA09.VQ12 interacts physically with BnaA03.WRKY28 to form a protein complex, causing BnaA03.WRKY28 to outcompete BnWRKY33 and bind to the BnWRKY33 promoter. BnaA03.WRKY28 induction suppresses BnWRKY33 expression in the later stages of infection but promotes branch formation in the leaf axils by regulating the expression of branching-related genes such as BnBRC1. BnaA03.WRKY28 participates in the trade-off between defense and growth. These findings suggest that oilseed rape plants may modulate defense-response strength and develop alternative reproduction and survival strategies in the face of lethal pathogens.
