Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, a very small fraction of the daylight spectrum, elicits changes in plant secondary metabolism that have large effects on plant-insect interactions. The signal transduction pathways that mediate these specific effects of solar UV-B are not known. We examined the role of jasmonate signaling by measuring responses to UV-B in wild-type and transgenic jasmonate-deficient Nicotiana attenuata plants in which a lipoxygenase gene (NaLOX3) was silenced (as-lox). In wild-type plants, UV-B failed to elicit the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) or the bioactive JA-isoleucine conjugate but amplified the response of jasmonate-inducible genes, such as trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI), to wounding and methyl jasmonate, and increased the accumulation of several phenylpropanoid derivatives. Some of these phenolic responses (accumulation of caffeoyl-polyamine conjugates) were completely lacking in as-lox plants, whereas others (accumulation of rutin and chlorogenic acid) were similar in both genotypes. In open field conditions, as-lox plants received more insect damage than wild-type plants, as expected, but the dramatic increase in resistance to herbivory elicited by UV-B exposure, which was highly significant in wild-type plants, did not occur in as-lox plants. We conclude that solar UV-B (1) uses jasmonate-dependent and -independent pathways in the elicitation of phenolic compounds, and (2) increases sensitivity to jasmonates, leading to enhanced expression of wound-response genes (TPI). The lack of UV-B-induced antiherbivore protection in as-lox plants suggests that jasmonate signaling plays a central role in the mechanisms by which solar UV-B increases resistance to insect herbivores in the field.
