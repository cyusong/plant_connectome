['21223384', 'The exine of the pollen wall shows an intricate pattern, primarily comprising  sporopollenin, a polymer of fatty acids and phenolic compounds. A series of  enzymes synthesize sporopollenin precursors in tapetal cells, and the precursors  are transported from the tapetum to the pollen surface. However, the mechanisms  underlying the transport of sporopollenin precursors remain elusive. Here, we  provide evidence that strongly suggests that the Arabidopsis ABC transporter  ABCG26/WBC27 is involved in the transport of sporopollenin precursors. Two  independent mutations at ABCG26 coding region caused drastic decrease in seed  production. This defect was complemented by expression of ABCG26 driven by its  native promoter. The severely reduced fertility of the abcg26 mutants was caused  by a failure to produce mature pollen, observed initially as a defect in  pollen-wall development. The reticulate pattern of the exine of wild-type  microspores was absent in abcg26 microspores at the vacuolate stage, and the vast  majority of the mutant pollen degenerated thereafter. ABCG26 was expressed  specifically in tapetal cells at the early vacuolate stage of pollen development.  It showed high co-expression with genes encoding enzymes required for  sporopollenin precursor synthesis, i.e. CYP704B1, ACOS5, MS2 and CYP703A2.  Similar to two other mutants with defects in pollen-wall deposition, abcg26  tapetal cells accumulated numerous vesicles and granules. Taken together, these  results suggest that ABCG26 plays a crucial role in the transfer of sporopollenin  lipid precursors from tapetal cells to anther locules, facilitating exine  formation on the pollen surface.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04412.x', 'Lee']
