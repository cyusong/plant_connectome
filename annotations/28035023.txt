The promotive effects of brassinosteroids (BRs) on plant growth and development have been widely investigated; however, it is not known whether BRs directly affect nutrient uptake. Here, we explored the possibility of a direct relationship between BRs and ammonium uptake via AMT1-type genes in rice (Oryza sativa). BR treatment increased the expression of AMT1;1 and AMT1;2, whereas in the mutant d61-1, which is defective in the BR-receptor gene BRI1, BR-dependent expression of these genes was suppressed. We then employed Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1), which is involved in BR homeostasis, to investigate BR-mediated AMT1 expression and its effect on NH4+ uptake in rice roots. AMT1;2 expression was lower in the ravl1 mutant, but higher in the RAVL1-overexpressing lines. EMSA and ChIP analyses showed that RAVL1 activates the expression of AMT1;2 by directly binding to E-box motifs in its promoter. Moreover, 15NH4+ uptake, cellular ammonium contents, and root responses to methyl-ammonium strongly depended on RAVL1 levels. Analysing AMT1;2 expression levels in different crosses between BRI1 and RAVL1 mutant and overexpression lines indicated that RAVL1 acts downstream of BRI1 in the regulation of AMT1;2. Thus, the present study shows how BRs may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of nutrient transporters to modulate their uptake capacity.
