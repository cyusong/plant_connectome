The specialized multilayered pollen wall plays multiple roles to ensure normal microspore development. The major components of the pollen wall (e.g. sporopollenin and lipidic precursors) are provided from the tapetum. Material export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes seven homologs of SEC23, a COPII component. However, the functional importance of this diversity remains elusive. Here, we analyzed knockout and knockdown lines for AtSEC23A and AtSEC23D, two of the A. thaliana SEC23 homologs, respectively. Single atsec23a and atsec23d mutant plants, despite normal fertility, showed an impaired exine pattern. Double atsec23ad mutant plants were semi-sterile and exhibited developmental defects in pollen and tapetal cells. Pollen grains of atsec23ad had defective exine and intine, and showed signs of cell degeneration. Moreover, the development of tapetal cells was altered, with structural abnormalities in organelles. AtSEC23A and AtSEC23D exhibited the characteristic localization pattern of COPII proteins and were highly expressed in the tapetum. Our work suggests that AtSEC23A and AtSEC23D may organize pollen wall development and exine patterning by regulating ER export of lipids and proteins necessary for pollen wall formation. Also, our results shed light on the functional heterogeneity of SEC23 homologs.
