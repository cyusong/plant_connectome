Plant resistance genes typically encode proteins with nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NLR) domains. Here we show that Ptr is an atypical resistance gene encoding a protein with four Armadillo repeats. Ptr is required for broad-spectrum blast resistance mediated by the NLR R gene Pi-ta and by the associated R gene Pi-ta2. Ptr is expressed constitutively and encodes two isoforms that are mainly localized in the cytoplasm. A two base pair deletion within the Ptr coding region in the fast neutron-generated mutant line M2354 creates a truncated protein, resulting in susceptibility to M. oryzae. Targeted mutation of Ptr in a resistant cultivar using CRISPR/Cas9 leads to blast susceptibility, further confirming its resistance function. The cloning of Ptr may aid in the development of broad spectrum blast resistant rice.
