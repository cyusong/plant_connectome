['17079273', 'The post-embryonic development of above-ground tissues in plants is dependent  upon the maintenance and differentiation of stem cells at the shoot meristem. The  Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS) transcription factor establishes an organizing center  within the shoot meristem that is essential for specification of stem-cell  identity in overlying cells. The CLAVATA (CLV) signaling pathway, including the  CLV1 receptor-kinase, promotes the differentiation of stem cells by limiting the  WUS expression domain, yet the mechanism of CLV signaling is largely unknown.  Previously, we have shown that mutations in two protein phosphatases, POLTERGEIST  (POL) and PLL1, partially suppress clv mutant phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate  that POL and PLL1 are integral components of the CLV1 signaling pathway. POL and  PLL1 are essential for stem-cell specification, and can also block stem-cell  differentiation when overexpressed. We provide extensive evidence that POL and  PLL1 act downstream of CLV signaling to maintain WUS expression and that they  regulate WUS at a transcriptional level. Our findings suggest that POL and PLL1  are central players in regulating the balance between stem-cell maintenance and  differentiation, and are the closest known factors to WUS regulation in the shoot  meristem.', '2006 Dec', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02652', 'Clark']
