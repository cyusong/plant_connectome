Alternative splicing (AS) is a major mechanism for gene expression in eukaryotes, increasing proteome diversity but also regulating transcriptome abundance. High temperatures have a strong impact on the splicing profile of many genes and therefore AS is considered as an integral part of heat stress response. While many studies have established a detailed description of the diversity of the RNAome under heat stress in different plant species and stress regimes, little is known on the underlying mechanisms that control this temperature-sensitive process. AS is mainly regulated by the activity of splicing regulators. Changes in the abundance of these proteins through transcription and AS, post-translational modifications and interactions with exonic and intronic <i>cis</i>-elements and core elements of the spliceosomes modulate the outcome of pre-mRNA splicing. As a major part of pre-mRNAs are spliced co-transcriptionally, the chromatin environment along with the RNA polymerase II elongation play a major role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing under heat stress conditions. Despite its importance, our understanding on the regulation of heat stress sensitive AS in plants is scarce. In this review, we summarize the current status of knowledge on the regulation of AS in plants under heat stress conditions. We discuss possible implications of different pathways based on results from non-plant systems to provide a perspective for researchers who aim to elucidate the molecular basis of AS under high temperatures.
