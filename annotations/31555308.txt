['31555308', "Many bacterial pathogens secret effectors into host cells to disable host  defenses and thus promote infection. The exocyst complex functions in the  transport and secretion of defense molecules, and loss of function of the EXO70B1  subunit leads to autoimmunity by activation of a truncated Toll/interleukin-1  receptor-nucleotide-binding sequence protein (TIR-NBS2; herein referred to as  TN2). Here, we show that EXO70B1 is required for pathogen-associated molecular  pattern-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. The effector AvrPtoB,  an E3 ligase from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) strain DC3000, associates  with EXO70B1. AvrPtoB ubiquitinates EXO70B1 and mediates EXO70B1 degradation via  the host's 26S proteasome in a manner requiring E3 ligase activity. AvrPtoB  enhances Pto DC3000 virulence by overcoming EXO70B1-mediated resistance.  Moreover, overexpression of AvrPtoB in Arabidopsis leads to autoimmunity, which  is partially dependent on TN2. Expression of TN2 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum  and Nicotiana benthamiana) triggers strong and rapid cell death, which is  suppressed by co-expression with EXO70B1 but reoccurs when co-expressed with  AvrPtoB. Taken together, our data highlight that AvrPtoB targets the Arabidopsis  thaliana EXO70 protein family member EXO70B1 to manipulate the defense molecule  secretion machinery or immunity.", '2019', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2019.01027', 'Tang']
