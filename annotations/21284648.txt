• Jasmonates are ubiquitous messengers in land plants essential for the activation of defense responses. However, their signaling properties, accumulation and metabolism vary substantially among species. Solanum nigrum is a wild Solanaceous species developed as a model to study defense responses. • Solanum nigrum plants transformed to silence the expression of key genes in jasmonate production (SnLOX3), conjugation (SnJAR4) and perception (SnCOI1) were generated to analyze the function of these genes in jasmonate accumulation and metabolism (studied by a combination of LC-MS/MS and (13) C-isotope labeling methods) and in signaling [studied by the systemic elicitation of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activity]. • In contrast with the early single jasmonic acid (JA) burst induced by wounding in wild-type (WT) plants, elicitation with insect oral secretions induced a later, second burst that was essential for the induction of systemic LAP activity, as demonstrated by ablation experiments. This induction was dependent on SnLOX3 and SnCOI1, but not on SnJAR4. In addition, the local accumulation of JA-glucose and JA-isoleucine was dependent on SnCOI1, whereas the accumulation of hydroxylated jasmonates was dependent on both SnCOI1 and SnJAR4. • The results demonstrate that SnLOX3, SnCOI1 and SnJAR4 have overlapping yet distinct roles in jasmonate signaling, differentially controlling jasmonate metabolism and the production of a systemic signal.
