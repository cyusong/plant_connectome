Legumes can form a nitrogen fixing symbiosis with soil bacteria called rhizobia (the RL symbiosis). They can also, like most plants, form symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which facilitate plants' phosphate nutrition. In both interactions, the symbionts are hosted inside the plant root. Nitrogen-fixing rhizobia are housed in intracellular symbiotic structures within nodules, while AM fungi form intracellular symbiotic structures, called arbuscules, within cortical root cells. These two endosymbioses present other similarities, including production by the microsymbionts of lipo-chitooligosaccharidic signals (Nod Factors and Myc-LCOs), and the involvement of common plant signaling elements. In Medicago truncatula, DMI3 encodes a calcium and calmodulin dependent protein kinase that is part of this common signaling pathway, while NFP encodes a LysM domain receptor-like kinase involved in Nod Factor perception. Using tissue specific promoters, we recently uncoupled the roles of NFP and DMI3 in the cortex and the epidermis of the root during the RL symbiosis. (1) Here, we provide additional data showing a cell autonomous tissular contribution of DMI3 in the AM symbiosis, and we comment on a non-cell autonomous cortical role of NFP during rhizobial infection.
