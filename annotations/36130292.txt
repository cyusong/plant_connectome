In Arabidopsis thaliana, the female gametophyte consists of two synergid cells, an egg cell, a diploid central cell, and three antipodal cells. CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT 1 (CKI1), a histidine kinase constitutively activating the cytokinin signaling pathway, specifies the central cell and restricts the egg cell. However, the mechanism regulating CKI1-dependent central cell specification is largely unknown. Here, we showed that the type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS10, 12, and 18 (ARR10/12/18) localize at the chalazal pole of the female gametophyte. Phenotypic analysis showed that the arr10 12 18 triple mutant is female sterile. We examined the expression patterns of embryo sac marker genes and found that the embryo sac of arr10 12 18 plants had lost central cell identity, a phenotype similar to that of the Arabidopsis cki1 mutant. Genetic analyses demonstrated that ARR10/12/18, CKI1, and ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN2, 3, and 5 (AHP2/3/5) function in a common pathway to regulate female gametophyte development. In addition, constitutively activated ARR10/12/18 in the cki1 embryo sac partially restored the fertility of cki1. Results of transcriptomic analysis supported the conclusion that ARR10/12/18 and CKI1 function together to regulate the identity of the central cell. Our results demonstrated that ARR10/12/18 function downstream of CKI1-AHP2/3/5 as core factors to determine cell fate of the female gametophyte.
