Sedum alfredii is a well known cadmium (Cd) hyperaccumulator native to China; however, the mechanism behind its hyperaccumulation of Cd is not fully understood. Through several hydroponic experiments, characteristics of Cd uptake and translocation were investigated in the hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) of S. alfredii in comparison with its non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE). The results showed that at Cd level of 10 microM measured Cd uptake in HE was 3-4 times higher than the implied Cd uptake calculated from transpiration rate. Furthermore, inhibition of transpiration rate in the HE has no essential effect on Cd accumulation in shoots of the plants. Low temperature treatment (4 degrees C) significantly inhibited Cd uptake and reduced upward translocation of Cd to shoots for 9 times in HE plants, whereas no such effect was observed in NHE. Cadmium concentration was 3-4-fold higher in xylem sap of HE, as compared with that in external uptake solution, whereas opposite results were obtained for NHE. Cadmium concentration in xylem sap of HE was significantly reduced by the addition of metabolic inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), in the uptake solutions, whereas no such effect was noted in NHE. These results suggest that Cd uptake and translocation is an active process in plants of HE S. alfredii, symplastic pathway rather than apoplastic bypass contributes greatly to root uptake, xylem loading and translocation of Cd to the shoots of HE, in comparison with the NHE plants.
