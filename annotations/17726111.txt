['17726111', "Ion signals are critical to regulating polarized growth in many cell types,  including pollen in plants and neurons in animals. Genetic evidence presented  here indicates that pollen tube growth requires cyclic nucleotide-gated channel  (CNGC) 18. CNGCs are nonspecific cation channels found in plants and animals and  have well established functions in excitatory signal transduction events in  animals. In Arabidopsis, male sterility was observed for two cngc18 null  mutations. CNGC18 is expressed primarily in pollen, as indicated from a  promoter::GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter analysis and expression profiling.  The underlying cause of sterility was identified as a defect in pollen tube  growth, resulting in tubes that were kinky, short, often thin, and unable to grow  into the transmitting tract. Expression of a GFP-tagged CNGC18 in mutant pollen  provided complementation and evidence for asymmetric localization of CNGC18 to  the plasma membrane at the growing tip, starting at the time of pollen grain  germination. Heterologous expression of CNGC18 in Escherichia coli resulted in a  time- and concentration-dependent accumulation of more Ca2+. Thus, CNGC18  provides a mechanism to directly transduce a cyclic nucleotide (cNMP) signal into  an ion flux that can produce a localized signal capable of regulating the pollen  tip-growth machinery. These results identify a CNGC that is essential to an  organism's life cycle and raise the possibility that CNGCs have a widespread role  in regulating cell-growth dynamics in both plant and animals.", '2007 Sep 4', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0701781104', 'Harper']
