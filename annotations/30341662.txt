We report coding and long noncoding RNAs in maize upon phytohormone gibberellin stimulation. Plant hormone gibberellin (GA) orchestrates various facets of biological processes. Dissection the transcriptomic dynamics upon GA stimulation has biological significance. Feature of maize transcriptome in response to GA application remains largely elusive. Herein, two types of plants, one was with normal height, the other was GA-sensitive dwarfism, were selected from advanced backcross population for GA<sub>3</sub> treatment with different concentrations. In control and GA<sub>3</sub>-treated plants, we identified a large number of coding and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) through sequencing eight ribosomal-depleted RNA libraries. Transcripts encoding GA biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes KS, GA20ox, GA3ox, and GA2ox were significantly differentially expressed in GA<sub>3</sub>-treated samples. A total of 78 protein-coding transcripts were shared between GA<sub>3</sub>-treated normal height and dwarf plants. Shared transcripts encoding terpene synthase, MYB transcription factor, and receptor-like protein kinase were co-regulated with their corresponding partners. Out of identified lncRNAs, 22 and 34 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs were responsive to GA application in normal height and dwarf plants, respectively. Shared GA-responsive lncRNAs were found in GA<sub>3</sub>-treated normal height and dwarf plants. Some lncRNAs corresponded to precursors of known miRNA, such as zma-miR528a and zma-miR528b. Multiple promising targets of significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs were discovered, including Lazy plant1 for auxin- and GA-mediated shoot gravitropism, bZIP transcription factor member for GA-controlled cell elongation. This study will improve our knowledge of GA-triggered transcriptome change and facilitate a comprehensive understanding of regulatory cascade centering on GA.
