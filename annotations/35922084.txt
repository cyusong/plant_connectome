An endophytic <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> (BsEB-1) was obtained from the roots of <i>Bletilla striata</i>. We investigated its growth-promoting properties and observed the impact of its inoculation on both the growth and polysaccharide content of <i>Bletilla striata</i> tubers. It was found that BsEB-1 possessed three growth-promoting activities: phosphate-solubilizing, produced indoleacetic acid (IAA) and siderophores, but had no nitrogen-fixing activity. BsEB-1 could rapidly attach to the root hairs of <i>Bletilla striata</i> tissue culture seedlings and endophytically colonize the region of maturation in the roots. It also significantly promoted the rooting and transplant survival rate of the seedlings, as well as the growth and expansion of the tubers, but did not increase their polysaccharide content. <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> BsEB-1 exhibits potential for applications in the artificial planting of <i>Bletilla striata.</i>
