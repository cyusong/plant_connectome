Dispersed H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) of the AGAMOUS (AG) genomic locus is mediated by CURLY LEAF (CLF), a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2. Previous reports have shown that the AG second intron, which confers AG tissue-specific expression, harbors sequences targeted by several positive and negative regulators. Using RACE reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we found that the AG intron 2 encodes several noncoding RNAs. RNAi experiment showed that incRNA4 is needed for CLF repressive activity. AG-incRNA4RNAi lines showed increased leaf AG mRNA levels associated with a decrease of H3K27me3 levels; these plants displayed AG overexpression phenotypes. Genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the AG-incRNA4 can associate with CLF to repress AG expression in leaf tissues through H3K27me3-mediated repression and to autoregulate its own expression level. The mechanism of AG-incRNA4-mediated repression may be relevant to investigations on tissue-specific expression of Arabidopsis MADS-box genes.
