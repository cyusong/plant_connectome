Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) originates from the subtropical region and is a warm-loving crop affected by low-temperature stress. Dehydrin (DHN) protein, a member of the Group 2 LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) family, plays an important role in plant abiotic stress. In this study, five maize DHN genes were screened based on the previous transcriptome sequencing data in our laboratory, and we performed sequence analysis and promoter analysis on these five DHN genes. The results showed that the promoter region has many cis-acting elements related to cold stress. The significantly upregulated <i>ZmDHN15</i> gene has been further screened by expression pattern analysis. The subcellular localization results show that <i>ZmDHN15</i> fusion protein is localized in the cytoplasm. To verify the role of <i>ZmDHN15</i> in cold stress, we overexpressed <i>ZmDHN15</i> in yeast and Arabidopsis. We found that the expression of <i>ZmDHN15</i> can significantly improve the cold resistance of yeast. Under cold stress, <i>ZmDHN15</i>-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed lower MDA content, lower relative electrolyte leakage, and less ROS (reactive oxygen species) when compared to wild-type plants, as well as higher seed germination rate, seedling survival rate, and chlorophyll content. Furthermore, analysis of the expression patterns of ROS-associated marker genes and cold-response-related genes indicated that <i>ZmDHN15</i> genes play an important role in the expression of these genes. In conclusion, the overexpression of the <i>ZmDHN15</i> gene can effectively improve the tolerance to cold stress in yeast and Arabidopsis. This study is important for maize germplasm innovation and the genetic improvement of crops.
