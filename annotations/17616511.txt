['17616511', 'We have functionally characterized an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene  AtHSD1 (At5g50600) that encodes a protein with homology to animal  11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants  overexpressing AtHSD1 (designated AOHSD plants) under the control of the  cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter showed increased growth and seed yield as  well as increased tolerance of saline stress and reduced seed dormancy. In canola  (Brassica napus), transgenic plants overexpressing AtHSD1 also outgrew wild-type  plants. AOHSD phenotypes were similar to those of plants that overproduced  brassinosteroids (BRs) or overexpressed the BR receptor gene BRI1. A  loss-of-function hsd mutant produced by RNA interference displayed a semi-dwarfed  phenotype with reduced sensitivity to BRs. In contrast, AOHSD plants were  hypersensitive to BRs and exhibited increased catabolism of abscisic acid (ABA).  Germination of AOHSD seeds was less sensitive to ABA, while hsd seed was more  sensitive to ABA during germination. AtHSD transcription was rapidly induced by  BR treatment in wild type and was expressed widely in aerial plant parts,  especially vascular tissues. This study demonstrates that AtHSD1 is involved in  regulating growth and development in plants and is likely to promote or mediate  BR effects. The gene has significant potential for improving growth and yield of  canola and other agricultural crops.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.100560', 'Cutler']
