['15589838', 'Telomere-binding proteins are required for forming the functional structure of  chromosome ends and regulating telomerase action. Although a number of candidate  proteins have been identified by homology searches to plant genome databases and  tested for their affinity to telomeric DNA sequences in vitro, there are minimal  data relevant to their telomeric function. To address this problem, we made a  collection of cDNAs of putative telomere-binding proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana  to analyse their protein-protein interactions with the yeast two-hybrid system.  Our results show that one myb-like protein, AtTRP1, interacts specifically with  AtKu70, the latter protein having a previously described role in plant telomere  metabolism. In analogy to the interaction between human Ku70 and TRF2 proteins,  our results suggest that AtTRP1 is a likely homolog of TRF2. The AtTRP1 domain  responsible for AtKu70 interaction occurs between amino acid sequence positions  80 and 269. The protein AtTRB1, a member of the single myb histone (Smh) family,  shows self-interaction and interactions to the Smh family proteins AtTRB2 and  AtTRB3. Protein AtTRB1 also interacts with AtPot1, the Arabidopsis homolog of  oligonucleotide-binding-fold-containing proteins which bind G-rich telomeric DNA.  In humans, the TRF1-complex recruits hPot1 to telomeres by protein-protein  interactions where it is involved in telomere length regulation. Possibly, AtTRB1  has a similar role in recruiting AtPot1.', '2004 Dec 17', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2004.11.021', 'Fajkus']
