This year marks the 100th anniversary of the experiments by Garner and Allard that showed that plants measure the duration of the night and day (the photoperiod) to time flowering. This discovery led to the identification of Flowering Locus T (FT) in Arabidopsis and Heading Date 3a (Hd3a) in rice as a mobile signal that promotes flowering in tissues distal to the site of cue perception. FT/Hd3a belong to the family of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs). Collectively, these proteins control plant developmental transitions and plant architecture. Several excellent recent reviews have focused on the roles of PEBPs in diverse plant species; here we will primarily highlight recent advances that enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of PEBPs and discuss critical open questions.
