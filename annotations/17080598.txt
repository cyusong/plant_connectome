The role of brassinosteroids (BRs) in plant function has been intensively studied in the last few years. Mutant analysis has demonstrated that the ability to synthesize, perceive and respond to BRs is essential to normal plant growth and development. Several key elements of BR response have been identified using both genetic and biochemical approaches, and molecular models that parallel Wingless (Wnt), transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling in animals have been proposed. Many studies have demonstrated the role of BRs, alone and in interaction with other plant hormones, in processes such as cell elongation and seed germination. In contrast, little is known about how the sensing of BRs is connected to specific physiological responses such as stress resistance. There remain many open questions about how these connections are made.
