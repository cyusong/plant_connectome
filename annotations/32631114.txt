Environmental factors such as photoperiod, temperature, phytohormones, sugars, and soil nutrients can affect the development of axillary meristems and emergence of shoot branches in plants. We investigated how an extended period of cold exposure to <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants before and after inflorescence meristem differentiation would affect plant growth and shoot branching. The number of rosette leaves and shoot branches increased when wild type (WT) juvenile seedlings, but not adult plants, were subjected to a prolonged cold exposure (10/7°C day/night cycle). As the duration of cold exposure to WT juvenile seedlings increased, so too did the rosette area, number of leaves, and rosette branches revealing an extended period of vegetative growth. The prolonged cold treatment also increased the primary inflorescence stem height and number of cauline branches in WT plants revealing a delay in reproductive development that could be altered by early (<i>set domain group 8; sdg8</i>) and late (<i>methyltransferase 1; met1</i>) flowering mutants. The axillary buds/leaf and rosette branches/leaf ratios declined significantly in WT, yet were enhanced in the loss-of-function of <i>carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7</i> (<i>ccd7</i>) and <i>teosinte branched 1</i> (<i>brc1</i>) hyper-branched mutants. This indicated that axillary meristem differentiation continued during the cold exposure, which did not directly impact axillary bud formation or shoot branching. We conclude that a prolonged cold exposure to juvenile seedlings prior to inflorescence meristem development extended vegetative growth and delayed the reproductive phase to allow additional leaf primordia and axillary meristems to differentiate that enhanced the number of shoot branches in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
