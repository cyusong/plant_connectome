['23042274', 'The immunogold technique with anti-diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2)  antibody revealed in A. thaliana embryo and root meristematic cells gold  particles manifesting the presence of DGAT2 in ER as well as in lipid bodies.  This being so, lipid synthesis could take place both in ER and in the lipid  bodies. The presence of microtubules around the lipid bodies was evidenced under  transmission EM. Detection of tubulin around the lipid bodies using the  immunogold technique with anti-a-tubulin is in agreement with the above  observations. Connection of lipid bodies with microtubules was also detected by  us in other plants where they probably participated in lipid synthesis. A similar  phenomenon may take place in A. thaliana.', '2012 Oct 8', 'Folia Histochem Cytobiol', '10.5603/19752', 'Polit']
