['17993626', 'We report that the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant sensitive to ABA and drought2  (sad2), which harbors a T-DNA insertion in an importin beta-like gene, is more  tolerant to UV-B radiation than the wild type. Analysis of cyclobutane pyrimidine  dimer accumulation revealed that less DNA damage occurred in sad2 than in the  wild type during UV-B treatment. No significant growth difference was observed  between sad2 and the wild type when treated with the genotoxic drug methyl  methanesulfonate, suggesting that SAD2 functions in UV-B protection rather than  in DNA damage repair. Whereas the R2R3-type transcription repressor MYB4 has  previously been shown to negatively regulate the transcription of cinnamate  4-hydroxylase (C4H) and thus to regulate the synthesis of sinapate esters,  expression of both MYB4 and C4H and accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds were  significantly higher in sad2 than in the wild type. MYB4 did not localize to the  nucleus in the sad2 mutant, suggesting that SAD2 is required for MYB4 nuclear  trafficking. SAD2 and MYB4 coimmunoprecipitated, indicating that these proteins  localize in the same complex in vivo. MYB4 protein specifically bound to its own  promoter in gel shift assays and repressed its own expression, demonstrating that  MYB4 protein and mRNA are part of a negative autoregulatory loop. This feedback  loop is altered in the sad2 mutant due to the absence of MYB4 protein in the  nucleus, leading to the constitutive expression of MYB4 and C4H and resulting in  accumulation of UV-absorbing pigments that shield the plant from UV-B radiation.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048900', 'Guo']
