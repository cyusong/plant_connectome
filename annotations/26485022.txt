['26485022', 'A subset of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana is known to be up-regulated in response  to a wide range of different environmental stress factors. However, not all of  these genes are characterized as yet with respect to their functions. In this  study, we used transgenic knockout, overexpression and reporter gene approaches  to try to elucidate the biological roles of five unknown multiple-stress  responsive genes in Arabidopsis. The selected genes have the following locus  identifiers: At1g18740, At1g74450, At4g27652, At4g29780 and At5g12010. Firstly,  T-DNA insertion knockout lines were identified for each locus and screened for  altered phenotypes. None of the lines were found to be visually different from  wildtype Col-0. Secondly, 35S-driven overexpression lines were generated for each  open reading frame. Analysis of these transgenic lines showed altered phenotypes  for lines overexpressing the At1g74450 ORF. Plants overexpressing the  multiple-stress responsive gene At1g74450 are stunted in height and have reduced  male fertility. Alexander staining of anthers from flowers at developmental stage  12-13 showed either an absence or a reduction in viable pollen compared to  wildtype Col-0 and At1g74450 knockout lines. Interestingly, the effects of stress  on crop productivity are most severe at developmental stages such as male  gametophyte development. However, the molecular factors and regulatory networks  underlying environmental stress-induced male gametophytic alterations are still  largely unknown. Our results indicate that the At1g74450 gene provides a  potential link between multiple environmental stresses, plant height and pollen  development. In addition, ruthenium red staining analysis showed that At1g74450  may affect the composition of the inner seed coat mucilage layer. Finally,  C-terminal GFP fusion proteins for At1g74450 were shown to localise to the  cytosol.', '2015', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0140368', 'Harberd']
