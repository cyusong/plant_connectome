High temperature (HT) can affect the accumulation of seed storage materials and cause adverse effects on the yield and quality of rice. DNA methylation plays an important role in plant growth and development. Here, we identified a new demethylase gene OsDML4 and discovered its function in cytosine demethylation to affect endosperm formation. Loss of function of OsDML4 induced chalky endosperm only under HT and dramatically reduced the transcription and accumulation of glutelins and 16 kDa prolamin. The expression of two transcription factor genes RISBZ1 and RPBF was significantly decreased in the osdml4 mutants, which caused adverse effects on the formation of protein bodies (PBs) with greatly decreased PB-II number, and incomplete and abnormally shaped PB-IIs. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis of seeds at 15 d after pollination revealed much higher global methylation levels of CG, CHG, and CHH contexts in the osdml4 mutants compared with the wild type. Moreover, the RISBZ1 promoter was hypermethylated but the RPBF promoter was almost unchanged under HT. No significant difference was detected between the wild type and osdml4 mutants under normal temperature. Our study demonstrated a novel OsDML4-mediated DNA methylation involved in the formation of chalky endosperm only under HT and provided a new perspective in regulating endosperm development and the accumulation of seed storage proteins in rice.
