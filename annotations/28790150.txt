Phosphorylation of histone H3 affects transcription, chromatin condensation, and chromosome segregation. However, the role of phosphorylation of histone H2A remains unclear. Here, we found that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> MUT9P-LIKE-KINASE (MLK4) phosphorylates histone H2A on serine 95, a plant-specific modification in the histone core domain. Mutations in <i>MLK4</i> caused late flowering under long-day conditions but no notable phenotype under short days. MLK4 interacts with CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), which allows MLK4 to bind to the <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) promoter. CCA1 interacts with YAF9a, a co-subunit of the Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase (SWR1) and NuA4 complexes, which are responsible for incorporating the histone variant H2A.Z into chromatin and histone H4 acetylase activity, respectively. Importantly, loss of <i>MLK4</i> function led to delayed flowering by decreasing phosphorylation of H2A serine 95, along with attenuated accumulation of H2A.Z and the acetylation of H4 at <i>GI</i>, thus reducing <i>GI</i> expression. Together, our results provide insight into how phosphorylation of H2A serine 95 promotes flowering time and suggest that phosphorylation of H2A serine 95 modulated by MLK4 is required for the regulation of flowering time and is involved in deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z and H4 acetylation in Arabidopsis.
