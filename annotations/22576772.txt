The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family is highly expanded in terrestrial plants. Arabidopsis contains 450 PPR genes, which represents 2% of the total protein-coding genes. PPR proteins are eukaryote-specific RNA-binding proteins implicated in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism of organellar genes. Most PPR proteins affect a single or small subset of gene(s), acting in a gene-specific manner. Studies over the last 10 years have revealed the significance of this protein family in coordinated gene expression in different compartments: the nucleus, chloroplast and mitochondrion. Here, we summarize recent studies addressing the mechanistic aspect of PPR proteins.
