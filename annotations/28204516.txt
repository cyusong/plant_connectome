Flavonols are one of the largest groups of flavonoids that confer benefits for the health of plants and animals. Flavonol glycosides are the predominant flavonoids present in the model legume Lotus japonicus. The molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of flavonol glycosides as yet remain unknown in L. japonicus. In the present study, we identified a total of 188 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) in L. japonicus by genome-wide searching. Notably, 12 UGTs from the UGT72 family were distributed widely among L. japonicus chromosomes, expressed in all tissues, and showed different docking scores in an in silico bioinformatics docking analysis. Further enzymatic assays showed that five recombinant UGTs (UGT72AD1, UGT72AF1, UGT72AH1, UGT72V3, and UGT72Z2) exhibit activity toward flavonol, flavone, and isoflavone aglycones. In particular, UGT72AD1, UGT72AH1, and UGT72Z2 are flavonol-specific UGTs with different kinetic properties. In addition, the overexpression of UGT72AD1 and UGT72Z2 led to increased accumulation of flavonol rhamnosides in L. japonicus and Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, the increase of kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside in transgenic A. thaliana inhibited root growth as compared with the wild-type control. These results highlight the significance of the UGT72 family in flavonol glycosylation and the role of flavonol rhamnosides in plant growth.
