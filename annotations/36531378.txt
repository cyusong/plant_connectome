Photoperiod responsiveness is important to soybean production potential and adaptation to local environments. Varieties from temperate regions generally mature early and exhibit extremely low yield when grown under inductive short-day (SD) conditions. The long-juvenile (LJ) trait is essentially a reduction and has been introduced into soybean cultivars to improve yield in tropical environments. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based bulked segregant analysis (BSA) to simultaneously map qualitative genes controlling the LJ trait in soybean. We identified two genomic regions on scaffold_32 and chromosome 18 harboring loci <i>LJ32</i> and <i>LJ18</i>, respectively. Further, we identified <i>LJ32</i> on the 228.7-kb scaffold_32 as the soybean pseudo-response-regulator gene <i>Tof11</i> and <i>LJ18</i> on a 301-kb region of chromosome 18 as a novel <i>PROTEIN FLOWERING LOCUS T-RELATED</i> gene, <i>Glyma.18G298800</i>. Natural variants of both genes contribute to LJ trait regulation in tropical regions. The molecular identification and functional characterization of <i>Tof11</i> and <i>LJ18</i> will enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the LJ trait and provide useful genetic resources for soybean molecular breeding in tropical regions.
