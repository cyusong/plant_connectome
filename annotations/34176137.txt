Hydraulic conductance is recognized as a major determinant of gas exchange and productivity. However, whether this also applies to seedlings, a critically important stage for vegetation regeneration, has been largely unknown. We analyzed the hydraulic and stomatal conductance of leaves and shoots for 6-wk-old Acer pseudoplatanus seedlings emerging in different lowland and treeline habitats and under glasshouse conditions, respectively, as well as on 9-, 15- and 18-wk-old plants, and related findings to leaf and xylem anatomical traits. Treeline seedlings had higher leaf area-specific shoot hydraulic conductance (K<sub>shoot-L</sub> ), and stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ), associated with wider xylem conduits, lower leaf area and higher stomatal density than lowland and glasshouse-grown plants. Across the first 18 wk of development, seedlings increased four-fold in absolute shoot hydraulic conductance (K<sub>shoot</sub> ) and declined by half in K<sub>shoot-L</sub> , with correlated shifts in xylem and leaf anatomy. Distal leaves had higher leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub> ) and g<sub>s</sub> compared to basal leaves. Seedlings show strong variation across growth environments and ontogenetic shifts in hydraulic and anatomical parameters. Across growth sites, ontogenetic stages and leaf orders, g<sub>s</sub> was tightly correlated with K<sub>shoot-L</sub> and K<sub>leaf</sub> , balancing hydraulic supply with demand for the earliest stages of seedling establishment.
