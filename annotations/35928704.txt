<i>Aglaonema commutatum</i> is one of the most popular foliage plants with abundant leaf phenotypes; therefore, anthocyanin coloration is a vital economic trait in <i>A. commutatum</i>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis and its regulation remain unclear. In this study, <i>AcMYB1</i> and <i>AcbHLH1</i>, transcription factor genes related to an R2R3-myeloblast (MYB) and a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), respectively, were isolated from <i>A. commutatum</i> "Red Valentine" and functionally characterized. AcMYB1 and AcbHLH1 were found to interact by Y2H and BiFC assay. <i>AcMYB1</i> was grouped into the AN2 subgroup and shared high homology with the known regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Gene expression analysis showed that both <i>AcMYB1</i> and <i>AcbHLH1</i> have similar expression patterns to anthocyanin structural genes and correlate with anthocyanin distribution in different tissues of <i>A. commutatum</i>. Light strongly promoted anthocyanin accumulation by upregulating the expression of anthocyanin-related genes in <i>A. commutatum</i> leaves. Ectopic expression of <i>AcMYB1</i> in tobacco remarkably increased anthocyanin accumulation in both vegetative and reproductive tissues at various developmental stages. These results provide insights into the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in <i>A. commutatum</i> and are useful for breeding new <i>A. commutatum</i> cultivars with enhanced ornamental value.
