Understanding the precise regulatory mechanisms of plant development and stress responses at the post-translational level is currently a topic of intensive research. Protein ubiquitination, including the sequential performances of ubiquitin-activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes, is a refined post-translational modification ubiquitous in all eukaryotes. Plants are an integral part of our ecosystem and, as sessile organisms, the ability to perceive internal and external signals and to adapt well to various environmental challenges is crucial for their survival. Over recent decades, extensive studies have demonstrated that protein ubiquitination plays key roles in multiple plant developmental stages (e.g. seed dormancy and germination, root growth, flowering time control, self-incompatibility and chloroplast development) and several abiotic stress responses (e.g. drought and high salinity), by regulating the abundance, activities or subcellular localizations of a variety of regulatory polypeptides and enzymes. Importantly, diverse E3 ligases are involved in these regulatory pathways by mediating phytohormone and light signaling or other pathways. In this updated review, we mainly summarize recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory roles of protein ubiquitination in plant development and plant-environment interactions, and primarily focus on different types of E3 ligases because they play critical roles in determining substrate specificity.

E1: !activates! ubiquitin
E2: !conjugates! ubiquitin
E3: !mediates! phytohormone/light signaling
E3: !regulates! abundance/activity/localization of regulatory polypeptides/enzymes
E3: !determines! substrate specificity
