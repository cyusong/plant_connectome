Recent research is beginning to reveal how intricate networks of hormones and transcription factors coordinate the complex patterning of the gynoecium, the female reproductive structure of flowering plants. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding of how auxin biosynthesis, transport, and responses together generate specific gynoecial domains. This review also highlights areas where future research endeavours are likely to provide additional insight into the homeostatic molecular mechanisms by which auxin regulates gynoecium development.

auxin: !synthesizes! gynoecial domains
hormones: !affects! auxin biosynthesis
transcription factors: !affects! auxin transport
auxin: !represses! gynoecium development
