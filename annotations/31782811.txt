The 90 kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) is widely involved in various developmental processes and stress responses in plants. However, the molecular chaperone HSP90-constructed protein complex and its function in cassava remain elusive. In this study, we report that HSP90 is essential for drought stress resistance in cassava by regulating abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) using two specific protein inhibitors of HSP90 (geldanamycin (GDA) and radicicol (RAD)). Among 10 MeHSP90s, the transcript of MeHSP90.9 is largely induced during drought stress. Further investigation identifies MeWRKY20 and MeCatalase1 as MeHSP90.9-interacting proteins. MeHSP90.9-, MeWRKY20-, or MeCatalase1-silenced plants through virus-induced gene silencing display drought sensitivity in cassava, indicating that they are important to drought stress response. MeHSP90.9 can promote the direct transcriptional activation of MeWRKY20 on the W-box element of MeNCED5 promoter, encoding a key enzyme in ABA biosynthesis. Moreover, MeHSP90.9 positively regulates the activity of MeCatalase1, and MeHSP90.9-silenced cassava leaves accumulate more H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> under drought stress. Taken together, we demonstrate that the MeHSP90.9 chaperone complex is a regulator of drought stress resistance in cassava.
