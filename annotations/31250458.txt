Shigella, which infects primates, can be transmitted via fresh vegetables; however, its molecular interactions with plants have not been elucidated. Here, we show that four Shigella strains, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri 2a, and S. flexneri 5a, proliferate at different levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. Microscopic studies revealed that these bacteria were present inside leaves and damaged plant cells. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged S. boydii and S. flexneri 5a colonized leaves only, whereas S. flexneri 2a colonized both leaves and roots. Using Shigella mutants lacking type III secretion systems (T3SSs), we found that T3SSs that regulate the pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in bacterial proliferation in Arabidopsis. Strikingly, the immunosuppressive activity of two T3S effectors, OspF and OspG, was required for proliferation of Shigella in Arabidopsis. Of note, delivery of OspF or OspG effectors inside plant cells upon Shigella inoculation was confirmed using a split GFP system. These findings demonstrate that the human pathogen Shigella can proliferate in plants by adapting immunosuppressive machinery used in the original host human.
