['20442275', 'Cytidinediphosphate diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) catalyzes the formation of  cytidinediphosphate diacylglycerol, an essential precursor of anionic  phosphoglycerolipids like phosphatidylglycerol or -inositol. In plant cells, CDS  isozymes are located in plastids, mitochondria, and microsomes. Here, we show  that these isozymes are encoded by five genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). Alternative translation initiation or alternative splicing of CDS2 and  CDS4 transcripts can result in up to 10 isoforms. Most of the cDNAs encoding the  various plant isoforms were functionally expressed in yeast and rescued the  nonviable phenotype of the mutant strain lacking CDS activity. The closely  related genes CDS4 and CDS5 were found to encode plastidial isozymes with similar  catalytic properties. Inactivation of both genes was required to obtain  Arabidopsis mutant lines with a visible phenotype, suggesting that the genes have  redundant functions. Analysis of these Arabidopsis mutants provided further  independent evidence for the importance of plastidial phosphatidylglycerol for  structure and function of thylakoid membranes and, hence, for photoautotrophic  growth.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.156422', 'Frentzen']
