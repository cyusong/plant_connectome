Flavonol synthase (FLS) is a key enzyme for the formation of flavonols, which are a subclass of the flavonoids. FLS catalyzes the conversion of dihydroflavonols to flavonols. The enzyme belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODD) superfamily. We characterized the <i>FLS</i> gene family of <i>Brassica napus</i> that covers 13 genes, based on the genome sequence of the <i>B. napus</i> cultivar Express 617. The goal was to unravel which <i>BnaFLS</i> genes are relevant for seed flavonol accumulation in the amphidiploid species <i>B. napus</i>. Two <i>BnaFLS1</i> homeologs were identified and shown to encode bifunctional enzymes. Both exhibit FLS activity as well as flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) activity, which was demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in planta</i>. <i>BnaFLS1-1</i> and <i>-2</i> are capable of converting flavanones into dihydroflavonols and further into flavonols. Analysis of spatio-temporal transcription patterns revealed similar expression profiles of <i>BnaFLS1</i> genes. Both are mainly expressed in reproductive organs and co-expressed with the genes encoding early steps of flavonoid biosynthesis. Our results provide novel insights into flavonol biosynthesis in <i>B. napus</i> and contribute information for breeding targets with the aim to modify the flavonol content in rapeseed.
