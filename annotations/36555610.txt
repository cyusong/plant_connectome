Environmental pollution of heavy metals has received growing attention in recent years. Heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury can cause physiological and morphological disturbances which adversely affect the growth and quality of crops. Wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) can accumulate high contents of heavy metals in its edible parts. Understanding wheat response to heavy metal stress and its management in decreasing heavy metal uptake and accumulation may help to improve its growth and grain quality. Very recently, emerging advances in heavy metal toxicity and phytoremediation methods to reduce heavy metal pollution have been made in wheat. Especially, the molecular mechanisms of wheat under heavy metal stress are increasingly being recognized. In this review, we focus on the recently described epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, ionomics and multi-omics combination, as well as functional genes uncovering heavy metal stress in wheat. The findings in this review provide some insights into challenges and future recommendations for wheat under heavy metal stress.
