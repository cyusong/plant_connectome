['34626184', 'Pollen tube growth and penetration in female tissues are essential for the  transfer of sperm to the embryo sac during plant pollination. Despite its  importance during pollination, little is known about the mechanisms that mediate  pollen tube growth in female tissues. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis  thaliana pollen/pollen tube-specific gene, SKU5-SIMILAR 13 (SKS13), which was  critical for the growth of pollen tubes in the transmitting tract. The SKS13  protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and pollen tube walls at the  apical region. In comparison with wild-type pollen tubes, those of the sks13  mutants burst more frequently when grown in vitro. Additionally, the growth of  sks13 pollen tubes was retarded in the transmitting tract, thereby resulting in  decreased male fertility. The accumulation of pectin and cellulose in the cell  wall of sks13 pollen tubes was altered, and the content of jasmonic acid (JA) in  sks13 pollen was reduced. The pollen tubes treated with an inhibitor of JA  biosynthesis grew much more slowly and had an altered distribution of pectin,  which is similar to the pollen tube phenotypes of the SKS13 mutation. Our results  suggest that SKS13 is essential for pollen tube growth in the transmitting tract  by mediating the biosynthesis of JA that modifies the components of pollen tube  cell walls.', '2022 Jan 27', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erab448', 'ORCID:']
