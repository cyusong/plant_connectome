Biological N<sub>2</sub> fixation in feather-mosses is one of the largest inputs of new nitrogen (N) to boreal forest ecosystems; however, revealing the fate of newly fixed N within the bryosphere (i.e. bryophytes and their associated organisms) remains uncertain. Herein, we combined <sup>15</sup>N tracers, high resolution secondary ion mass-spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and a molecular survey of bacterial, fungal and diazotrophic communities, to determine the origin and transfer pathways of newly fixed N<sub>2</sub> within feather-moss (<i>Pleurozium schreberi</i>) and its associated microbiome. NanoSIMS images reveal that newly fixed N<sub>2</sub>, derived from cyanobacteria, is incorporated into moss tissues and associated bacteria, fungi and micro-algae. These images demonstrate that previous assumptions that newly fixed N<sub>2</sub> is sequestered into moss tissue and only released by decomposition are not correct. We provide the first empirical evidence of new pathways for N<sub>2</sub> fixed in feather-mosses to enter the boreal forest ecosystem (i.e. through its microbiome) and discuss the implications for wider ecosystem function.
