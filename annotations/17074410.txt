The effect of three sugars and their amino derivatives on violaxanthin cycle enzymes activity was investigated in duckweed (Lemna trisulca), a model water-plant. No effect of sugars and amino sugars on violaxanthin de-epoxidase was observed independent of incubation time; however, epoxidation of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin was inhibited. The minimum amino sugar concentrations causing maximum inhibition of zeaxanthin epoxidation have been estimated. Amino sugars but not sugars caused more than a 50% inhibition of zeaxanthin epoxidation in duckweed after a 24h incubation when applied at a concentration of 0.5%. Incubation with amino sugars under a 6d photoperiod enhanced the inhibitory effect. Zeaxanthin epoxidation was completely inhibited under such conditions, whereas only a minor inhibitory effect was observed in sugar treated plants. The strong amino sugar inhibition of zeaxanthin epoxidase activity represents additional evidence for the creation of an unstable carotenoid carbocation in the molecular mechanism of epoxidation.
