Grain size is an important component of quality and harvest traits in the field of rice breeding. Although numerous quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of grain size in rice have been reported, the molecular mechanisms of these QTLs remain poorly understood, and further research on QTL observation and candidate gene identification is warranted. In our research, we developed a suite of F2 intercross populations from a cross of 9311 and CG. These primary populations were used to map QTLs conferring grain size, evaluated across three environments, and then subjected to bulked-segregant analysis-seq (BSA-seq). In total, 4, 11, 12 and 14 QTLs for grain length (GL), grain width (GW), 1000-grain weight (TGW), and length/width ratio (LWR), respectively, were detected on the basis of a single-environment analysis. In particular, over 200 splicing-related sites were identified by whole-genome sequencing, including one splicing-site mutation with G>A at the beginning of intron 4 on Os03g0841800 (qGL3.3), producing a smaller open reading frame, without the third and fourth exons. A previous study revealed that the loss-of-function allele caused by this splicing site can negatively regulate rice grain length. Furthermore, qTGW2.1 and qGW2.3 were new QTLs for grain width. We used the near-isogenic lines (NILs) of these GW QTLs to study their genetic effects on individuals and pyramiding, and found that they have additive effects on GW. In summary, these discoveries provide a valuable genetic resource, which will facilitate further study of the genetic polymorphism of new rice varieties in rice breeding.
