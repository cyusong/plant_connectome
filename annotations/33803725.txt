The proteins with lysin motif (LysM) are carbohydrate-binding protein modules that play a critical role in the host-pathogen interactions. The plant LysM proteins mostly function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense chitin to induce the plant's immunity. In contrast, fungal LysM blocks chitin sensing or signaling to inhibit chitin-induced host immunity. In this review, we provide historical perspectives on plant and fungal LysMs to demonstrate how these proteins are involved in the regulation of plant's immune response by microbes. Plants employ LysM proteins to recognize fungal chitins that are then degraded by plant chitinases to induce immunity. In contrast, fungal pathogens recruit LysM proteins to protect their cell wall from hydrolysis by plant chitinase to prevent activation of chitin-induced immunity. Uncovering this coevolutionary arms race in which LysM plays a pivotal role in manipulating facilitates a greater understanding of the mechanisms governing plant-fungus interactions.
