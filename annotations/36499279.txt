Nitric oxide (NO) has been recognized as a gasotransmitter in the mainstream of plant research since the beginning of the 21st century. It is produced in plant tissue and the environment. It influences plant physiology during every ontogenetic stage from seed germination to plant senescence. In this review, we demonstrate the increased interest in NO as a regulatory molecule in combination with other signalling molecules and phytohormones in the information network of plant cells. This work is a summary of the current knowledge on NO action in seeds, starting from seed pretreatment techniques applied to increase seed quality. We describe mode of action of NO in the regulation of seed dormancy, germination, and aging. During each stage of seed physiology, NO appears to act as a key agent with a predominantly beneficial effect.
