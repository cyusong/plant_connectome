Plants have mechanisms allowing them to acclimate to intense light conditions, which involves the dissipation of excess light energy. These mechanisms allow plants to perform photosynthesis efficiently and, therefore, must be accurately and precisely controlled. However, how plants dissipate excess light energy has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein we report the identification of a gene, which we named Fluctuating-Light-Acclimation Protein1 (FLAP1), that is conserved in oxygenic phototrophs. We show that Arabidopsis FLAP1 is associated with chloroplast thylakoid and envelope membranes and that the flap1 mutant shows delayed non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) relaxation during induction of photosynthesis at moderate light intensity. Under fluctuating light conditions, NPQ levels in the flap1 mutant were higher than those in the wild type during the high light period, and the mutant exhibited a pale-green phenotype. These findings suggest that FLAP1 is involved in NPQ control, which is important for an acclimation response to fluctuating light.
