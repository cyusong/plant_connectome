['25425661', 'DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana is maintained by at least four different  enzymes: DNA methyltransferase1 (MET1), chromomethylase3 (CMT3), domains  rearranged methyltransferase2 (DRM2), and chromomethylase2 (CMT2). However, DNA  methylation is established exclusively by the enzyme DRM2, which acts in the  RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Some RdDM components belong to gene  families and have partially redundant functions, such as the endoribonucleases  dicer-like 2, 3, and 4, and involved in de novo2 (IDN2) interactors IDN2-like 1  and 2. Traditional mutagenesis screens usually fail to detect genes if they are  redundant, as the loss of one gene can be compensated by a related gene. In an  effort to circumvent this issue, we used coexpression data to identify closely  related genes that are coregulated with genes in the RdDM pathway. Here we report  the discovery of two redundant proteins, SNF2-ring-helicase-like1 and -2 (FRG1  and -2) that are putative chromatin modifiers belonging to the SNF2 family of  helicase-like proteins. Analysis of genome-wide bisulfite sequencing shows that  simultaneous mutations of FRG1 and -2 cause defects in methylation at specific  RdDM targeted loci. We also show that FRG1 physically associates with  Su(var)3-9-related SUVR2, a known RdDM component, in vivo. Combined, our results  identify FRG1 and FRG2 as previously unidentified components of the RdDM  machinery.', '2014 Dec 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1420515111', 'Ausin']
