Although stomata are typically found in greater numbers on the abaxial surface, wheat flag leaves have greater densities on the adaxial surface. We determine the impact of this less common stomatal patterning on gaseous fluxes using a novel chamber that simultaneously measures both leaf surfaces. Using a combination of differential illuminations and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at each leaf surface, we found that mesophyll cells associated with the adaxial leaf surface have a higher photosynthetic capacity than those associated with the abaxial leaf surface, which is supported by an increased stomatal conductance (driven by differences in stomatal density). When vertical gas flux at the abaxial leaf surface was blocked, no compensation by adaxial stomata was observed, suggesting each surface operates independently. Similar stomatal kinetics suggested some co-ordination between the two surfaces, but factors other than light intensity played a role in these responses. Higher photosynthetic capacity on the adaxial surface facilitates greater carbon assimilation, along with higher adaxial stomatal conductance, which would also support greater evaporative leaf cooling to maintain optimal leaf temperatures for photosynthesis. Furthermore, abaxial gas exchange contributed c. 50% to leaf photosynthesis and therefore represents an important contributor to overall leaf gas exchange.
