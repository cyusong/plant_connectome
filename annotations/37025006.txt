Microalgae hold the enormous potential to provide a safe and sustainable source of high-value compounds, acting as carbon-fixing biofactories that could help to mitigate rapidly progressing climate change. Bioengineering microalgal strains will be key to optimizing and modifying their metabolic outputs, and to render them competitive with established industrial biotechnology hosts, such as bacteria or yeast. To achieve this, precise and tunable control over transgene expression will be essential, towards which a key strategy is the development and rational design of synthetic promoters. Among green microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represents the reference species for bioengineering and synthetic biology; however, the repertoire of functional synthetic promoters for this species, and for microalgae generally, is limited in comparison to other commercial chassis, emphasizing the need to expand the current microalgal gene expression toolbox. Here, we discuss state-of-the-art promoter analyses and highlight areas of research required to advance synthetic promoter development in C. reinhardtii. In particular, we exemplify high-throughput studies performed in other model systems that could be applicable to microalgae and propose novel approaches to interrogating algal promoters. We lastly outline the major limitations hindering microalgal promoter development, while providing novel suggestions and perspectives for how to overcome them.
