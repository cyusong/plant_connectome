Plants employ two different types of immune receptors, cell surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins (NLRs), to cope with pathogen invasion. Both immune receptors often share similar downstream components and responses but it remains unknown whether a PRR and an NLR assemble into the same protein complex or two distinct receptor complexes. We have previously found that the small GTPase OsRac1 plays key roles in the signaling of OsCERK1, a PRR for fungal chitin, and of Pit, an NLR for rice blast fungus, and associates directly and indirectly with both of these immune receptors. In this study, using biochemical and bioimaging approaches, we revealed that OsRac1 formed two distinct receptor complexes with OsCERK1 and with Pit. Supporting this result, OsCERK1 and Pit utilized different transport systems for anchorage to the plasma membrane (PM). Activation of OsCERK1 and Pit led to OsRac1 activation and, concomitantly, OsRac1 shifted from a small to a large protein complex fraction. We also found that the chaperone Hsp90 contributed to the proper transport of Pit to the PM and the immune induction of Pit. These findings illuminate how the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit orchestrate rice immunity through the small GTPase OsRac1.
