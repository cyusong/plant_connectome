Autopolyploids often show growth advantages over their diploid progenitors because of their increased photosynthetic activity; however, the underlying molecular basis of such mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to characterize autotetraploid pak choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) at the physiological, cellular and molecular levels. Autotetraploid pak choi has thicker leaves than its diploid counterparts, with relatively larger intercellular spaces and cell size and greater grana thylakoid height. Photosynthetic data showed that the relative electron transport rate (rETR) was markedly higher in autotetraploid than in diploid pak choi. Transcriptomic data revealed that the expressions of genes involved in 'photosynthesis' biological process and 'thylakoids' cellular component were mainly regulated in autotetraploids. Overall, our findings suggested that the increased rETR in the thylakoids contributed to the increased photosynthetic capacity of autotetraploid leaves. Furthermore, we found that the enhanced rETR is associated with increased BrPetC expression, which is likely altered by histone modification. The ectopic expression of BrPetC in Arabidopsis thaliana led to increased rETR and biomass, which were decreased in BrPetC-silenced pak choi. Autotetraploid pak choi also shows altered hormone levels, which was likely responsible for the increased drought resistance and the impaired powdery mildew resistance of this lineage. Our findings further our understanding on how autotetraploidy provides growth advantages to plants.
