Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), induces disease resistance to the Fusarium head blight fungus <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and barley, but it is unknown at which stage of the infection it acts. Since the rate of haustorial formation of an obligate biotrophic barley powdery mildew fungus <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i> (<i>Bgh</i>) was significantly reduced in NMN-treated coleoptile epidermal cells, the possibility that NMN induces resistance to the biotrophic stage of <i>F. graminearum</i> was investigated. The results show that NMN treatment caused the wandering of hyphal growth and suppressed the formation of appressoria-like structures. Furthermore, we developed an experimental system to monitor the early stage of infection in real-time and analyzed the infection behavior. We observed that the hyphae elongated windingly by NMN treatment. These results suggest that NMN potentiates resistance to the biotrophic invasion of <i>F. graminearum</i> as well as <i>Bgh</i>.
