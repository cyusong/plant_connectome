['21217641', 'We have analysed the role of RBR (retinoblastoma related), the Arabidopsis  homologue of the tumour suppressor Retinoblastoma protein (pRb), during meiosis.  We characterise the rbr-2 mutation, which causes a loss of RBR in male meiocytes.  The rbr-2 plants exhibit strongly reduced fertility, while vegetative growth is  generally unaffected. The reduced fertility is due to a meiotic defect that  results in reduced chiasma formation and subsequent errors in chromosome  disjunction. Immunolocalisation studies in wild-type meiocytes reveal that RBR is  recruited as foci to the chromosomes during early prophase I in a DNA  double-strand-break-dependent manner. In the absence of RBR, expression of  several meiotic genes is reduced. The localisation of the recombinases AtRAD51  and AtDMC1 is normal. However, localisation of the MutS homologue AtMSH4 is  compromised. Additionally, polymerisation of the synaptonemal complex protein  AtZYP1 is abnormal. Together, these data indicate that loss of RBR during meiosis  results in a reduction of crossover formation and an associated failure in  chromosome synapsis. Our results indicate that RBR has an important role in  meiosis affecting different aspects of this complex process.', '2011 Feb 16', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2010.344', 'Berger']
