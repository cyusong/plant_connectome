['23658225', "Gene expression in plant mitochondria involves a complex collaboration of  transcription initiation and termination, as well as subsequent mRNA processing  to produce mature mRNAs. In this study, we describe the function of the  Arabidopsis mitochondrial stability factor 1 (MTSF1) gene and show that it  encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein essential for the 3'-processing of  mitochondrial nad4 mRNA and its stability. The nad4 mRNA is highly destabilized  in Arabidopsis mtsf1 mutant plants, which consequently accumulates low amounts of  a truncated form of respiratory complex I. Biochemical and genetic analyses  demonstrated that MTSF1 binds with high affinity to the last 20 nucleotides of  nad4 mRNA. Our data support a model for MTSF1 functioning in which its  association with the last nucleotides of the nad4 3' untranslated region  stabilizes nad4 mRNA. Additionally, strict conservation of the MTSF1-binding  sites strongly suggests that the protective function of MTSF1 on nad4 mRNA is  conserved in dicots. These results demonstrate that the mRNA stabilization  process initially identified in plastids, whereby proteins bound to RNA  extremities constitute barriers to exoribonuclease progression occur in plant  mitochondria to protect and concomitantly define the 3' end of mature  mitochondrial mRNAs. Our study also reveals that short RNA molecules  corresponding to pentatricopeptide repeat-binding sites accumulate also in plant  mitochondria.", '2013 Jul', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkt337', 'Mireau']
