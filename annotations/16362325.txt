Sedum alfredii Hance can accumulate Zn in shoots over 2%. Leaf and stem Zn concentrations of the hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) were 24- and 28-fold higher, respectively, than those of the nonhyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE), whereas 1.4-fold more Zn was accumulated in the roots of the NHE. Approximately 2.7-fold more Zn was stored in the root vacuoles of the NHE, and thus became unavailable for loading into the xylem and subsequent translocation to shoot. Long-term efflux of absorbed 65Zn indicated that 65Zn activity was 6.8-fold higher in shoots but 3.7-fold lower in roots of the HE. At lower Zn levels (10 and 100 microM), there were no significant differences in 65Zn uptake by leaf sections and intact leaf protoplasts between the two ecotypes except that 1.5-fold more 65Zn was accumulated in leaf sections of the HE than in those of the NHE after exposure to 100 microM for 48 h. At 1,000 microM Zn, however, approximately 2.1-fold more Zn was taken up by the HE leaf sections and 1.5-fold more 65Zn taken up by the HE protoplasts as compared to the NHE at exposure times >16 h and >10 min, respectively. Treatments with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or ruptured protoplasts strongly inhibited 65Zn uptake into leaf protoplasts for both ecotypes. Citric acid and Val concentrations in leaves and stems significantly increased for the HE, but decreased or had minimal changes for the NHE in response to raised Zn levels. These results indicate that altered Zn transport across tonoplast in the root and stimulated Zn uptake in the leaf cells are the major mechanisms involved in the strong Zn hyperaccumulation observed in S. alfredii H.
