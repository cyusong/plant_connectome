['19995737', 'The Tic55 (Translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts, 55 kDa)  protein was identified in pea as a putative regulator, possibly linking  chloroplast protein import to the redox state of the photosynthetic machinery.  Two Tic55 homologs have been proposed to exist in Arabidopsis: atTic55-II and  AtPTC52 (Protochlorophyllide-dependent Translocon Component, 52 kDa; has also  been called atTic55-IV). Our phylogenetic analysis shows that atTic55-II is an  ortholog of psTic55 from pea (Pisum sativum), and that AtPTC52 is a more distant  homolog of the two. AtPTC52 was included in this study to rule out possible  functional links between the proteins in Arabidopsis. No detectable mutant  phenotypes were found in two independent T-DNA knockout mutant plant lines for  each Arabidopsis protein, when compared with wild-type: visible appearance,  chlorophyll content, photosynthetic performance, and chloroplast protein import,  for example, were all normal. Both wild-type and tic55-II mutant chloroplasts  exhibited deficient protein import when treated with diethylpyrocarbonate,  indicating that Tic55 is not the sole target of this reagent in relation to  protein import. Furthermore, ptc52 mutant chloroplasts were not defective with  respect to pPORA import, which was previously reported to involve PTC52 in  barley. Thus, we conclude that atTic55-II and AtPTC52 are not strictly required  for functional protein import in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Nov', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssp079', 'Aronsson']
