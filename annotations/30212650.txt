['30212650', 'Microbial patterns are recognized by cell-surface receptors to initiate  pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in plants. Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases  (RLCKs), such as BIK1, and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are engaged  during PTI to activate the NADPH oxidase RBOHD for reactive oxygen species (ROS)  production. It is unknown whether protein kinases besides CPKs and RLCKs  participate in RBOHD regulation. We screened mutants in all ten Arabidopsis MAP4  kinases (MAP4Ks) and identified the conserved MAP4K SIK1 as a positive regulator  of PTI. sik1 mutants were compromised in their ability to elicit the ROS burst in  response to microbial features and exhibited compromised PTI to bacterial  infection. SIK1 directly interacts with, phosphorylates, and stabilizes BIK1 in a  kinase activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, SIK1 directly interacts with and  phosphorylates RBOHD upon flagellin perception. Thus, SIK1 positively regulates  immunity by stabilizing BIK1 and activating RBOHD to promote the extracellular  ROS burst.', '2018 Sep 12', 'Cell Host Microbe', '10.1016/j.chom.2018.08.007', 'Coaker']
