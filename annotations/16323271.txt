Carotenoids and tocopherols are lipophilic antioxidants with important functions in plants and humans. Due to their nutritional value and putative health benefits, they have become a focus of intensive research. The identification of all genes of the carotenoid and tocopherol biosynthesis has enabled the manipulation of their biosynthetic pathways, aiming for quantitative and qualitative improvement. In plants, carotenoids and tocopherols are of crucial importance because of their protective abilities, which help to keep them alive even under light stress conditions. A wealth of information has accumulated concerning the responses of plants to various environmental stress factors. Here, we summarize some of the recent data concentrating on the impact and possible interaction of lipophilic antioxidants in mutants and transgenic plants with altered status of lipophilic antioxidants.
