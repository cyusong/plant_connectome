The asymmetric distribution of auxin plays a fundamental role in plant gravitropism, yet little is understood about how its lateral distribution stimulates growth. In the present work, the asymmetric distribution not only of auxin, but also that of gibberellins (GAs), was observed in rice leaf sheath bases following gravistimulation. Gravistimulation induced the transient accumulation of greater amounts of both IAA and GA in the lower halves of the leaf sheath bases of rice seedlings. OsGA3ox1, a gene of active GA synthesis, was differentially induced by gravistimulation. Furthermore, 2,3,5-tri-iodobenzoic acid (TIBA), an inhibitor of auxin transport, substantially decreased the asymmetric distribution of IAA and the gradient of OsGA3ox1 expression. Externally applied GA(3) restored the gravitropic curvature of rice leaf sheaths inhibited by either TIBA or by ancymidol, a GA synthesis inhibitor. The expression of XET (encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylase) was differentially induced in the lower halves of gravistimulated leaf sheath bases and was also up-regulated by exogenous IAA and GA(3). Both ancymidol and TIBA decreased the gradient of XET expression. These data suggest that the asymmetric distribution of auxin effected by gravistimulation induced a gradient of GAs via asymmetric expression of OsGA3ox1 in rice leaf sheath bases, and hence caused the asymmetric expression of XET. Cell wall loosening in the curvature site of the leaf sheath triggered by the expression of XET would contribute to gravitropic growth.
