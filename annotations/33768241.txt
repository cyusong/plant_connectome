Because of their abundance and extensive phosphorylation, numerous thylakoid proteins stand out amongst the phosphoproteins of plants and algae. In particular, subunits of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) and of photosystem II (PSII) are dynamically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in response to light conditions and metabolic demands. These phosphorylations are controlled by evolutionarily conserved thylakoid protein kinases and counteracting protein phosphatases, which have distinct but partially overlapping substrate specificities. The best characterized are the kinases STATE TRANSITION 7 (STN7/STT7) and STATE TRANSITION 8 (STN8), and the antagonistic phosphatases PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1/THYLAKOID-ASSOCIATED PHOSPHATASE 38 (PPH1/TAP38) and PHOTOSYSTEM II CORE PHOSPHATASE (PBCP). The phosphorylation of LHCII is mainly governed by STN7 and PPH1/TAP38 in plants. LHCII phosphorylation is essential for state transitions, a regulatory feedback mechanism that controls the allocation of this antenna to either PSII or PSI, and thus maintains the redox balance of the electron transfer chain. Phosphorylation of several core subunits of PSII, regulated mainly by STN8 and PBCP, correlates with changes in thylakoid architecture, the repair cycle of PSII after photodamage as well as regulation of light harvesting and of alternative routes of photosynthetic electron transfer. Other kinases, such as the PLASTID CASEIN KINASE II (pCKII), also intervene in thylakoid protein phosphorylation and take part in the chloroplast kinase network. While some features of thylakoid phosphorylation were conserved through the evolution of photosynthetic eukaryotes, others have diverged in different lineages possibly as a result of their adaptation to varied environments.
