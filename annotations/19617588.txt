['19617588', 'Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) tryptophan-proline-proline (WPP)-domain  proteins, WPP1 and WPP2, are plant-unique, nuclear envelope-associated proteins  of unknown function. They have sequence similarity to the nuclear  envelope-targeting domain of plant RanGAP1, the GTPase activating protein of the  small GTPase Ran. WPP domain-interacting tail-anchored protein 1 (WIT1) and WIT2  are two Arabidopsis proteins containing a coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal  predicted transmembrane domain. They are required for RanGAP1 association with  the nuclear envelope in root tips. Here, we show that WIT1 also binds WPP1 and  WPP2 in planta, we identify the chaperone heat shock cognate protein 70-1  (HSC70-1) as in vivo interaction partner of WPP1 and WPP2, and we show that  HSC70-1 interacts in planta with WIT1. WIT1 and green fluorescent protein  (GFP)-WIT1 are targeted to the nuclear envelope in Arabidopsis. In contrast,  GFP-WIT1 forms large cytoplasmic aggregates when overexpressed transiently in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermis cells. Coexpression of HSC70-1 significantly  reduces GFP-WIT1 aggregation and permits association of most GFP-WIT1 with the  nuclear envelope. Significantly, WPP1 and WPP2 show the same activity. A WPP1  mutant with reduced affinity for GFP-WIT1 fails to decrease its aggregation.  While the WPP-domain proteins act on a region of WIT1 containing the coiled-coil  domain, HSC70-1 additionally acts on the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Taken  together, our data suggest that both HSC70-1 and the WPP-domain proteins play a  role in facilitating WIT1 nuclear envelope targeting, which is, to our knowledge,  the first described in planta activity for the WPP-domain proteins.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.143404', 'Meier']
