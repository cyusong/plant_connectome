We discuss mechanisms and factors that influence levels and stability of expressed heterologous proteins in crop plants. We have seen substantial progress in this field over the past two decades in model experimental organisms such as Arabidopsis and tobacco. There is no question such studies have resulted in furthering our understanding of key processes in the plant cell and the elaboration of sophisticated models to explain underlying mechanisms that might influence the fate, levels and stability of expression of recombinant heterologous proteins in plants. However, very often, such information is not applicable outside these laboratory experimental models. In order to generate a knowledge basis that can be used to achieve high levels and stability of heterologous proteins in relevant crop plants it is imperative to perform such studies on the target crops. With this in mind, we discuss key elements of the process at the DNA, RNA and protein levels. We believe it is essential to discuss recombinant protein production in crops in a holistic manner in order to develop a comprehensive knowledge base that will in turn serve plant biotechnology applications well.
