The pyrenoid is a membrane-less organelle that exists in various photosynthetic organisms, such as algae, and wherein most global CO<sub>2</sub> fixation occurs. Two papers from the Jonikas lab in this issue of Cell provide new insights into the structure, protein composition, and dynamics of this important organelle.
