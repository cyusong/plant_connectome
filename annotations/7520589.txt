['7520589', 'Two distinct cDNA clones encoding carbonic anhydrase (CA) were isolated from an  Arabidopsis thaliana lambda YES library. One of these clones, CA1, encodes a  36.1-kD polypeptide and is essentially the same as a previously reported  Arabidopsis CA cDNA (C.A. Raines, P.R. Horsnell, C. Holder, J.C. Lloyd [1992]  Plant Mol Biol 20: 1143-1148). Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence from  this clone with other plant CAs suggests the presence of a chloroplastic transit  peptide, which, when cleaved, would render a mature protein of 24.3 kD. The other  identified clone, CA2, encodes a 28.3-kD polypeptide, which in addition to other  residue changes, is 78 amino acids shorter at the N terminus than the primary  product of CA1. The two cDNAs exhibit 76.9% sequence similarity at the DNA level  and 84.6% identity between the predicted amino acid sequences. A polyclonal  antibody generated against pea CA (N. Majeau, J.R. Coleman [1991] Plant Physiol  100: 1077-1078) hybridized to two protein bands (25 and 28 kD) from a total leaf  extract and to only one band (25 kD) from a chloroplastic protein extract. The  data suggest that the CA2 protein is an extrachloroplastic form of CA, presumably  localized in the cytoplasm. Southern analysis indicated that CA1 and CA2 are  encoded by different genes. Northern analysis of total leaf RNA resulted in  hybridization of CA1- and CA2-derived probes to two transcripts of 1.47 and 1.2  kb, respectively. These data provide additional evidence that the CA2 clone is a  full-length cDNA and that two transcribed CA genes are present in the Arabidopsis  genome. Transcript levels of CA1 and CA2 decreased 70 and 20%, respectively, when  mature plants were transferred to dark for 24 h. Seedlings germinated in the dark  showed CA1 and CA2 transcript abundance levels of 4 and 22%, respectively, when  compared with light-germinated seedlings. These data suggest that expression of  CA1 is light regulated and dependent of leaf and/or chloroplast development. A  possible role for cytoplasmic CA in the plant cell is discussed.', '1994 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.2.707', 'Coleman']
