['14675452', "Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins in non-plant systems are known to play  important roles in both constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-messenger  RNAs (pre-mRNAs). Recently, we isolated a novel SR protein (SR45), which  interacts with U1 snRNP 70K protein, a key protein involved in 5' splice site  recognition. SR45 is found only in plants and is unique in having two SR domains  separated by an RNA recognition motif (RRM). To study the localization and  dynamics of SR45, we expressed it as a fusion to green fluorescent protein (GFP)  in cultured cells and transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The SR45 is localized  exclusively to nuclei. In interphase nuclei, GFP-SR45 was found both in speckles  and nucleoplasm. The speckles exhibited intranuclear movements and changes in  morphology. Inhibition of transcription and protein phosphorylation resulted in  redistribution of SR45 to bigger speckles. The change in the number and  morphology of speckles caused by inhibition of transcription was blocked by an  inhibitor of phosphatases. These results indicate that transcription activity of  the cell and protein (de)phosphorylation regulate the intranuclear distribution  of SR45.", '2003 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01932.x', 'Reddy']
