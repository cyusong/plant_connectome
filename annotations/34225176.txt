Tea is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, and trichome formation in tea plant leaves impairs their commercial value. In Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, trichome formation is negatively regulated by the CPC family genes, which encode R3-type MYB transcription factors. Here, we identified six CPC-like genes in a tea plant (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis) for the first time. Simulated three-dimensional structure of the MYB domains of all the six CPC-like proteins exhibited negative charge on the surface, as observed on that of the Arabidopsis CPC protein that does not bind to DNA, indicating their similarity with regard to molecular interaction. We further found that the six CPC-like genes were differentially expressed in different developmental stages of tea leaves, and four out of the six genes were upregulated in the youngest 1st leaves, which formed more trichomes than other older leaves. Although it does not establish a causal link, the correlation between differential expression of CPC-like genes and variable trichome formation suggests that the R3-type MYB transcription factors are potential precipitating factors in affecting the value of tea leaf.
