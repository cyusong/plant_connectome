['10950871', 'Sugars have signaling roles in a wide variety of developmental processes in  plants. To elucidate the regulatory components that constitute the glucose  signaling network governing plant growth and development, we have isolated and  characterized two Arabidopsis glucose insensitive mutants, gin5 and gin6, based  on a glucose-induced developmental arrest during early seedling morphogenesis.  The T-DNA-tagged gin6 mutant abrogates the glucose-induced expression of a  putative transcription factor, ABI4, previously shown to be involved in  seed-specific abscisic acid (ABA) responses. Thus, ABI4 might be a regulator  involved in both glucose- and seed-specific ABA signaling. The characterization  of the gin5 mutant, on the other hand, reveals that glucose-specific accumulation  of ABA is essential for hexokinase-mediated glucose responses. Consistent with  this result, we show that three ABA-deficient mutants (aba1-1, aba2-1, and  aba3-2) are also glucose insensitive. Exogenous ABA can restore normal glucose  responses in gin5 and aba mutants but not in gin6 plants. Surprisingly, only abi4  and abi5-1 but not other ABA-insensitive signaling mutants (abi1-1, abi2-1, and  abi3-1) exhibit glucose insensitivity, indicating the involvement of a distinct  ABA signaling pathway in glucose responses. These results provide the first  direct evidence to support a novel and central role of ABA in plant glucose  responses mediated through glucose regulation of both ABA levels by GIN5 and ABA  signaling by GIN6/ABI4.', '2000 Aug 15', 'Genes Dev', None, 'Leon']
