['25316062', 'Rab proteins, key players in vesicular transport in all eukaryotic cells, are  post-translationally modified by lipid moieties. Two geranylgeranyl groups are  attached to the Rab protein by the heterodimeric enzyme Rab geranylgeranyl  transferase (RGT) alphabeta. Partial impairment in this enzyme activity in Arabidopsis,  by disruption of the AtRGTB1 gene, is known to influence plant stature and  disturb gravitropic and light responses. Here it is shown that mutations in each  of the RGTB genes cause a tip growth defect, visible as root hair and pollen tube  deformations. Moreover, FM 1-43 styryl dye endocytosis and recycling are affected  in the mutant root hairs. Finally, it is demonstrated that the double mutant,  with both AtRGTB genes disrupted, is non-viable due to absolute male sterility.  Doubly mutated pollen is shrunken, has an abnormal exine structure, and shows  strong disorganization of internal membranes, particularly of the endoplasmic  reticulum system.', '2015 Jan', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eru412', 'Swiezewska']
