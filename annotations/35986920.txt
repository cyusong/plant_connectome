DELLA proteins are important repressors of gibberellin signaling, regulating plant development and defense responses through crosstalk with various phytohormones. Sugarcane ScGAI encodes a DELLA protein that regulates culm development. However, it is unclear which transcription factors mediate the transcription of ScGAI. Here, we identified two different ScGAI promoter sequences that cooperatively regulate ScGAI transcription. We also identified a nuclear-localized AP2 family transcription factor, ScAIL1, which inhibits the transcription of ScGAI by directly binding to two ScGAI promoters. ScAIL1 was expressed in all sugarcane tissues tested and was induced by gibberellin and various stressors, including NaCl, polyethylene glycol, and pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Overexpression of ScAIL1 in rice significantly improved resistance to bacterial blight and rice blast, while reducing growth and development. In addition, several genes associated with stress responses were significantly up-regulated in transgenic rice overexpressing ScAIL1. Endogenous phytohormone content and expression analysis further revealed that ScAIL1-overexpressing lines improved resistance to bacterial blight and rice blast instead of promoting growth, and that this response was associated with increased jasmonic acid synthesis and gibberellin inactivation. These results provide molecular evidence that the role of ScAIL1 in the plant defense response is related to jasmonic acid and gibberellin signaling.
