Stomatal closure-associated actin-binding protein 1 (SCAB1) regulates stomatal closure by mediating actin filament reorganization in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Our previous study showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) binds to SCAB1 and inhibits its oligomerization, thereby inhibiting its activity on F-actin in guard cells during stomatal closure. In this study, we show that another phospholipid, phosphatidic acid (PA), also binds to SCAB1 and inhibits its actin-bundling activity but not its actin-binding activity. F-actin bundling was promoted <i>in vivo</i> by treating Col-0 seedlings with <i>n</i>-butanol, a suppressor of PA production, but this effect was absent in the <i>scab1</i> mutant. These results indicate that the signaling molecule PA is involved in the modulation of SCAB1 activity in F-actin reorganization.

SCAB1: !mediates! actin filament reorganization 
PI3P: !binds to! SCAB1 
PA: !binds to! SCAB1 
n-butanol: !suppresses! PA production 
SCAB1: !promotes! F-actin bundling
