Plant roots can absorb sugars from the rhizosphere, which reduces the consumption of carbon derived from photosynthesis. However, the underlying mechanisms that roots use to control sugar absorption from soil are poorly understood. Here, we identified an apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) hexose transporter, MdHT1.2, that functions on the root epidermis to absorb glucose (Glc) from the rhizosphere. Based on RNA-seq data, MdHT1.2 showed the highest expression level among 29 MdHT genes in apple roots. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that MdHT1.2 was mainly expressed in the epidermal cells of fine roots and its protein was located on the plasma membrane. The roots of transgenic apple and Solanum lycopersicum lines overexpressing MdHT1.2 had an increased capability to absorb Glc when fed with [13C]-labeled Glc or 2-NBDG, whereas silencing MdHT1.2 in apple showed the opposite results. Further studies established that MdHT1.2-mediated Glc absorption from the rhizosphere changed the carbon assimilate allocation between apple shoot and root, which regulated plant growth. Additionally, a grafting experiment in tomato confirmed that increasing the Glc uptake capacity in the root overexpressing MdHT1.2 could facilitate carbohydrate partitioning to the fruit. Collectively, our study demonstrated that MdHT1.2 functions on the root epidermis to absorb rhizospheric Glc, which regulates the carbohydrate allocation for plant growth and fruit sugar accumulation.
