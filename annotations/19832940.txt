Partial peptide sequence of a 36 kDa protein from common bean embryo axes showed 100% identity with a reported beta-subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein from soybean. Analysis of the full sequence showed 96.6% identity with the reported soybean G(beta)-subunit, 86% with RACK1B and C from Arabidopsis and 66% with human and mouse RACK1, at the amino acid level. In addition, it showed 85.5, 85 and 83% identities with arcA from Solanum lycopersicum, Arabidopsis (RACK1A) and Nicotiana tabacum, respectively. The amino acid sequence displayed seven WD40 domains and two sites for activated protein kinase C binding. The protein showed a constant expression level but the mRNA had a maximum at 32 h post-imbibition. Western immunoblotting showed the protein in vegetative plant tissues, and in both microsomal and soluble fractions from embryo axes. Synthetic auxin treatment during germination delayed the peak of RACK1 mRNA expression to 48 h but did not affect the protein expression level while the polar auxin transport inhibitor, naphtylphtalamic acid had no effect on either mRNA or protein expression levels. Southern blot and genomic DNA amplification revealed a small gene family with at least one member without introns in the genome. Thus, the RACK1/arcA homolog from common bean has the following features: (1) it is highly conserved; (2) it is both soluble and insoluble within the embryo axis; (3) it is encoded by a small gene family; (4) its mRNA has a peak of expression at the time point of germination stop and (5) its expression is only slightly affected by auxin but unaffected by an auxin transport blocker.
