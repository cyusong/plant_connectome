The internal boundary between inner and outer microsporangia within anthers is essential for male fertility of vascular plants. Dehiscence zones embedded in the boundary release pollen for fertilization. However, the molecular mechanism underlying boundary formation in anthers remains poorly understood. Here, we report that microRNA166 (miR166) and its target <i>PHABULOSA</i> (<i>PHB</i>) regulate <i>SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE</i> (<i>SPL/NZZ</i>), which controls microsporogenesis. In developing anthers of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the expression domains of miR165/6 and <i>SPL/NZZ</i> are overlapped and rearranged synchronously. Dominant mutation of <i>PHB</i> suppresses <i>SPL/NZZ</i> expression on the adaxial sides of stamens, resulting in a thickened boundary, whereas activation of <i>MIR166g</i> up-regulates <i>SPL/NZZ</i> expression, leading to ectopic microsporogenesis in the boundary. PHB limits the expression domains of <i>SPL/NZZ</i> to facilitate construction of the boundary, while miR166 preserves the expression domains of <i>SPL/NZZ</i> by inhibiting <i>PHB</i> to allow the inner microsporangia to take shape. Subsequently, PHB activates the key stem cell maintainer <i>WUSCHEL</i> in anthers to restrict the stomium cells to the boundary so that dehiscence zones develop and release pollen properly. These findings link adaxial/abaxial polarity to microsporogenesis in building of the internal boundary of anthers and thus advance the concepts underlying the establishment of the internal structure of male organs.
