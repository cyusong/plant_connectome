Ericaceae (the heather family) is a large and diverse group of plants that forms elaborate symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, and includes several nonphotosynthetic lineages. Using an extensive sample of fully mycoheterotrophic (MH) species, we explored inter- and intraspecific variation as well as selective constraints acting on the plastomes of these unusual plants. The plastomes of seven MH genera were analysed in a phylogenetic context with two geographically disparate individuals sequenced for Allotropa, Monotropa, and Pityopus. The plastomes of nonphotosynthetic Ericaceae are highly reduced in size (c. 33-41 kbp) and content, having lost all photosynthesis-related genes, and are reduced to encoding housekeeping genes as well as a protease subunit (clpP)-like and acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit D (accD)-like open reading frames. Despite an increase in the rate of their nucleotide substitutions, the remaining protein-coding genes are typically under purifying selection in full MHs. We also identified ribosomal proteins under relaxed or neutral selection. These plastomes also exhibit striking structural rearrangements. Intraspecific variation within MH Ericaceae ranges from a few differences (Allotropa) to extensive population divergences (Monotropa, Hypopitys), which indicates that cryptic speciation may be occurring in several lineages. The pattern of gene loss within fully MH Ericaceae plastomes suggests an advanced state of degradation.
