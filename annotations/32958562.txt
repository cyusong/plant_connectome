Phosphorus and nitrogen are essential macronutrients for plant growth and crop production. During phosphate (Pi) starvation, plants enhanced Pi but reduced nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>) uptake capacity, and the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that a GARP-type transcription factor NITRATE-INDUCIBLE, GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIOANL REPRESSOR1.2 (NIGT1.2) coordinately modulates Pi and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> uptake in response to Pi starvation. Overexpression of <i>NIGT1.2</i> increased Pi uptake capacity but decreased NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> uptake capacity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Furthermore, the <i>nigt1.1 nigt1.2</i> double mutant displayed reduced Pi uptake but enhanced NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> uptake under low-Pi stress. During Pi starvation, NIGT1.2 directly up-regulated the transcription of the Pi transporter genes <i>PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1;1</i> (<i>PHT1;1</i>) and <i>PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1;4</i> (<i>PHT1;4</i>) and down-regulated expression of NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> transporter gene <i>NITRATE TRANSPORTER1.1</i> (<i>NRT1.1</i>) by binding to <i>cis</i>-elements in their promoters. Further genetic assays demonstrated that <i>PHT1;1</i>, <i>PHT1;4</i>, and <i>NRT1.1</i> were genetically epistatic to <i>NIGT1.2</i> We also identified similar regulatory pathway in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). These data demonstrate that the transcription factor NIGT1.2 plays a central role in modulating low-Pi-dependent uptake of Pi and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>, tending toward maintenance of the phosphorus to nitrogen balance in plants during Pi starvation.
