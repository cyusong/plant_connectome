['21710975', 'Plant nodulin-26 intrinsic proteins (NIPs) are members of the aquaporin  superfamily that serve as multifunctional transporters of uncharged metabolites.  In Arabidopsis thaliana, a specific NIP pore subclass, known as the NIP II  proteins, is represented by AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1, which encode channel proteins  expressed in roots and leaf nodes, respectively, that participate in the  transport of the critical cell wall nutrient boric acid. Modeling of the protein  encoded by the AtNIP7;1 gene shows that it is a third member of the NIP II pore  subclass in Arabidopsis. However, unlike AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1 proteins, which  form constitutive boric acid channels, AtNIP7;1 forms a channel with an extremely  low intrinsic boric acid transport activity. Molecular modeling and molecular  dynamics simulations of AtNIP7;1 suggest that a conserved tyrosine residue  (Tyr81) located in transmembrane helix 2 adjacent to the aromatic arginine (ar/R)  pore selectivity region stabilizes a closed pore conformation through interaction  with the canonical Arg220 in ar/R region. Substitution of Tyr81 with a Cys  residue, characteristic of established NIP boric acid channels, results in  opening of the AtNIP7;1 pore that acquires a robust, transport activity for boric  acid as well as other NIP II test solutes (glycerol and urea). Substitution of a  Phe for Tyr81 also opens the channel, supporting the prediction from MD  simulations that hydrogen bond interaction between the Tyr81 phenol group and the  ar/R Arg may contribute to the stabilization of a closed pore state. Expression  analyses show that AtNIP7;1 is selectively expressed in developing anther tissues  of young floral buds of A. thaliana, principally in developing pollen grains of  stage 9-11 anthers. Because boric acid is both an essential nutrient as well as a  toxic compound at high concentrations, it is proposed that Tyr81 modulates  transport and may provide an additional level of regulation for this transporter  in male gametophyte development.', '2011 Aug 9', 'Biochemistry', '10.1021/bi2004476', 'Roberts']
