['27694846', 'Ethylene gas is essential for many developmental processes and stress responses  in plants. EIN2 plays a key role in ethylene signalling but its function remains  enigmatic. Here, we show that ethylene specifically elevates acetylation of  histone H3K14 and the non-canonical acetylation of H3K23 in etiolated seedlings.  The up-regulation of these two histone marks positively correlates with  ethylene-regulated transcription activation, and the elevation requires EIN2.  Both EIN2 and EIN3 interact with a SANT domain protein named EIN2 nuclear  associated protein 1 (ENAP1), overexpression of which results in elevation of  histone acetylation and enhanced ethylene-inducible gene expression in an  EIN2-dependent manner. On the basis of these findings we propose a model where,  in the presence of ethylene, the EIN2 C terminus contributes to downstream  signalling via the elevation of acetylation at H3K14 and H3K23. ENAP1 may  potentially mediate ethylene-induced histone acetylation via its interactions  with EIN2 C terminus.', '2016 Oct 3', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms13018', 'Qiao']
