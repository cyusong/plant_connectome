['26222830', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are critical signaling modules  that mediate the transduction of extracellular stimuli into intracellular  response. A relatively large number of MAPKKKs have been identified in a variety  of plant genomes but only a few of them have been studied for their biological  function. In the present study, we identified an Arabidopsis Raf-like MAPKKK gene  Raf43 and studied its function in biotic and abiotic stress response using a  T-DNA insertion mutant raf43-1 and two Raf43-overexpressing lines Raf43-OE#1 and  Raf43-OE#13. Expression of Raf43 was induced by multiple abiotic and biotic  stresses including treatments with drought, mannitol and oxidative stress or  defense signaling molecule salicylic acid and infection with necrotrophic fungal  pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Seed germination and seedling root growth of raf43-1  were significantly inhibited on MS medium containing mannitol, NaCl, H2O2 or  methyl viologen (MV) while seed germination and seedling root growth of the  Raf43-OE#1 and Raf43-OE#13 lines was similar to wild type Col-0 under the above  stress conditions. Soil-grown raf43-1 plants exhibited reduced tolerance to MV,  drought and salt stress. Abscisic acid inhibited significantly seed germination  and seedling root growth of the raf43-1 line but had no effect on the two  Raf43-overexpressing lines. Expression of stress-responsive RD17 and DREB2A genes  was significantly down-regulated in raf43-1 plants. However, the raf43-1 and  Raf43-overexpressing plants showed similar disease phenotype to the wild type  plants after infection with B. cinerea or Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.  Our results demonstrate that Raf43, encoding for a Raf-like MAPKKK, is required  for tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis.', '2015', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0133975', 'Song']
