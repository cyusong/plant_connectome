['21831199', 'GEX1 is a plasma membrane protein that is conserved among plant species, and has  previously been shown to be expressed in sperm cells and some sporophytic  tissues. Here we show that GEX1 is also expressed in the embryo sac before  cellularization, in the egg cell after cellularization, in the zygote/embryo  immediately after fertilization and in the pollen vegetative cell. We  functionally characterize GEX1 in Arabidopsis thaliana, and show that it is a  versatile protein that performs functions during male and female gametophyte  development, and during early embryogenesis. gex1-1/+ plants, which synthesize a  truncated GEX1 mRNA encoding a protein lacking the predicted cytoplasmic domain,  but still targeted to the plasma membrane, had embryos that arrested before the  pre-globular stage. gex1-3/+ plants, carrying a null GEX1 allele, had defects  during male and female gametophyte development, and during early embryogenesis.  Using an antisense GEX1 transgenic line we demonstrate that the predicted GEX1  extracellular domain is sufficient and necessary for GEX1 function during the  development of both gametophytes. The predicted cytoplasmic domain is necessary  for correct early embryogenesis and mediates homodimer formation at the plasma  membrane. We propose that dimerization of GEX1 in the zygote might be an upstream  step in a signaling cascade regulating early embryogenesis.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04713.x', 'McCormick']
