Organisation and patterning of the vascular network in land plants varies in different taxonomic, developmental and environmental contexts. In leaves, the degree of vascular strand connectivity influences both light and CO<sub>2</sub> harvesting capabilities as well as hydraulic capacity. As such, developmental mechanisms that regulate leaf venation patterning have a direct impact on physiological performance. Development of the leaf venation network requires the specification of procambial cells within the ground meristem of the primordium and subsequent proliferation and differentiation of the procambial lineage to form vascular strands. An understanding of how diverse venation patterns are manifest therefore requires mechanistic insight into how procambium is dynamically specified in a growing leaf. A role for auxin in this process was identified many years ago, but questions remain. In this review we first provide an overview of the diverse venation patterns that exist in land plants, providing an evolutionary perspective. We then focus on the developmental regulation of leaf venation patterns in angiosperms, comparing patterning in eudicots and monocots, and the role of auxin in each case. Although common themes emerge, we conclude that the developmental mechanisms elucidated in eudicots are unlikely to fully explain how parallel venation patterns in monocot leaves are elaborated.
