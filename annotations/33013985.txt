MYB transcription factors are involved in many biological processes, including metabolism, stress response and plant development. In our previous work, <i>ZmMYB59</i> was down-regulated by deep sowing during maize seed germination. However, there are few reports on seed germination regulated by MYB proteins. In this study, to examine its functions during seed germination, <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation was exploited to generate <i>ZmMYB59</i> overexpression (OE) tobacco and rice. In T<sub>2</sub> generation transgenic tobacco, germination rate, germination index, vigor index and hypocotyl length were significantly decreased by 25.0-50.9, 34.5-54.4, 57.5-88.3, and 21.9-31.3% compared to wild-type (WT) lines. In T<sub>2</sub> generation transgenic rice, above corresponding parameters were notably reduced by 39.1-53.8, 51.4-71.4, 52.5-74.0, and 28.3-41.5%, respectively. On this basis, antioxidant capacity and endogenous hormones were determined. The activities of catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase of OE lines were significantly lower than those of WT, suggesting that <i>ZmMYB59</i> reduced their oxidation resistance. As well, <i>ZmMYB59</i> overexpression extremely inhibited the synthesis of gibberellin A1 (GA<sub>1</sub>) and cytokinin (CTK), and promoted the synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) concurrently. Taken together, it proposed that ZmMYB59 was a negative regulator during seed germination in tobacco and rice, which also contributes to illuminate the molecular mechanisms regulated by MYB transcription factors.
