Different abiotic stresses induce <i>OsTZF1</i>, a tandem CCCH-type zinc finger domain gene, in rice. Here, we report that transgenic rice plants overexpressing <i>OsTZF1</i> under own promoter (<i>P<sub>OsTZF1</sub>:OsTZF1-</i>OX [for overexpression]) transferred to soil showed normal growth similar to vector control plants. The <i>P<sub>OsTZF1</sub>:OsTZF1-</i>OX produced normal leaves without any lesion mimic phenotype and exhibited normal seed setting. The <i>P<sub>OsTZF1</sub>:OsTZF1-</i>OX plants showed significantly increased tolerance to salt and drought stresses and enhanced post stress recovery. Microarray analysis revealed a total of 846 genes up-regulated and 360 genes down-regulated in <i>P<sub>OsTZF1</sub>:OsTZF1-</i>OX salt-treated plants. Microarray analysis of <i>P<sub>OsTZF1:</sub>OsTZF1-</i>OX plants showed the regulation of many abiotic stress tolerance genes. These results suggest that <i>OsTZF1</i>-OX under own promoter show abiotic stress tolerance and produces no pleiotropic effect on phenotype of transgenic rice plant.
