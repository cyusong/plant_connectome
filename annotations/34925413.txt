['34925413', 'SmD3 is a core component of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) that is  essential for pre-mRNA splicing. The role of Arabidopsis SmD3 in plant immunity  was assessed by testing sensitivity of smd3a and smd3b mutants to Pseudomonas  syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 infection and its pathogenesis effectors  flagellin (flg22), EF-Tu (elf18) and coronatine (COR). Both smd3 mutants  exhibited enhanced susceptibility to Pst accompanied by marked changes in the  expression of key pathogenesis markers. mRNA levels of major biotic stress  response factors were also altered upon treatment with Pseudomonas effectors. Our  genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the smd3b-1 mutant infected with Pst,  verified by northern and RT-qPCR, showed that lack of SmD3-b protein deregulates  defense against Pst infection at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional  levels including defects in splicing and an altered pattern of alternative  splicing. Importantly, we show that SmD3-b dysfunction impairs mainly stomatal  immunity as a result of defects in stomatal development. We propose that it is  the malfunction of the stomata that is the primary cause of an altered mutant  response to the pathogen. Other changes in the smd3b-1 mutant involved enhanced  elf18- and flg22-induced callose deposition, reduction of flg22-triggered  production of early ROS and boost of secondary ROS caused by Pst infection.  Together, our data indicate that SmD3 contributes to the plant immune response  possibly via regulation of mRNA splicing of key pathogenesis factors.', '2021', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2021.765003', 'Kufel']
