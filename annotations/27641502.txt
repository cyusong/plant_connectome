['27641502', 'Aerobic organisms survive low oxygen (O2) through activation of diverse  molecular, metabolic, and physiological responses. In most plants, root water  permeability (in other words, hydraulic conductivity, Lpr) is downregulated under  O2 deficiency. Here, we used a quantitative genetics approach in Arabidopsis to  clone Hydraulic Conductivity of Root 1 (HCR1), a Raf-like MAPKKK that negatively  controls Lpr. HCR1 accumulates and is functional under combined O2 limitation and  potassium (K(+)) sufficiency. HCR1 regulates Lpr and hypoxia responsive genes,  through the control of RAP2.12, a key transcriptional regulator of the core  anaerobic response. A substantial variation of HCR1 in regulating Lpr is observed  at the Arabidopsis species level. Thus, by combinatorially integrating two soil  signals, K(+) and O2 availability, HCR1 modulates the resilience of plants to  multiple flooding scenarios.', '2016 Sep 22', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.068', 'Maurel']
