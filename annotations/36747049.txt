Malic acid accumulation in the vacuole largely determines acidity and perception of sweetness of apple. It has long been observed that reduction in malate level is associated with increase in ethylene production during the ripening process of climacteric fruits, but the molecular mechanism linking ethylene to malate reduction is unclear. Here, we show that ethylene-modulated WRKY transcription factor 31 (WRKY31)-Ethylene Response Factor 72 (ERF72)-ALUMINUM ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER 9 (Ma1) network regulates malate accumulation in apple fruit. ERF72 binds to the promoter of ALMT9, a key tonoplast transporter for malate accumulation of apple, transcriptionally repressing ALMT9 expression in response to ethylene. WRKY31 interacts with ERF72, suppressing its transcriptional inhibition activity on ALMT9. In addition, WRKY31 directly binds to the promoters of ERF72 and ALMT9, transcriptionally repressing and activating ERF72 and ALMT9, respectively. The expression of WRKY31 decreases in response to ethylene, lowering the transcription of ALMT9 directly and via its interactions with ERF72. These findings reveal that the regulatory complex WRKY31 forms with ERF72 responds to ethylene, linking the ethylene signal to ALMT9 expression in reducing malate transport into the vacuole during fruit ripening.
