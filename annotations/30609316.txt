Grass species display a wide array of inflorescences ranging from highly branched compound/panicle inflorescences to unbranched spike inflorescences. The unbranched spike is a characteristic feature of the species of tribe Triticeae, including economically important crops, such as wheat and barley. In this review, we describe two important developmental genetic mechanisms regulating spike inflorescence architecture in barley and wheat. These include genetic regulation of (i) row-type pathway specific to Hordeum species and (ii) unbranched spike development in barley and wheat. For a comparative understanding, we describe the branched inflorescence phenotypes of rice and maize along with unbranched Triticeae inflorescences. In the end, we propose a simplified model describing a probable mechanism leading to unbranched spike formation in Triticeae species.

Row-type pathway: !regulates! Spike inflorescence architecture 
Hordeum species: !exhibits! Row-type pathway 
Barley/Wheat: !develops! Unbranched spike 
Rice/Maize: !displays! Branched inflorescence phenotypes 
Triticeae species: !forms! Unbranched spike
