Climatic change, intensive agriculture, and worsening water quality induce abiotic stress conditions for plants. Among these factors, salinity stress is a limit factor for plant growth. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the phytohormones role and oxidative metabolism in response to salt stress of two genotypes of tomato cv. Grand Brix and cv. Marmande RAF, the crops were carried out in a growth chamber. Salinity stress reduces biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) in both genotypes, this effect being greater in cv. Marmande RAF. These results, together with main stress indicator response, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>, indicate that cv. Marmande RAF is more sensitive to Saline stress. Grand Brix showed less oxidative stress, because it presented greater detoxification of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, due to SOD enzyme activity induction and greater antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, Grand Brix has a better hormonal profile adapted to salt stress resistance, the accumulation of IAA, GA4 and CKs and their beneficial role against oxidative stress could make the difference between resistance and sensitivity to salt stress. On the other hand, a lower ACC concentration, ethylene precursor, combined with a greater O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup> detoxification in the cv. Grand Brix could play a fundamental role in tolerance to saline stress. Besides, an increase in ABA levels promotes better stomatal closure, better photosynthesis control and a lower rate of water loss. This data could be essential to select plants with greater resistance to saline stress.
