It has been found that coleoptiles of dark-grown rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings undergo regular circumnutation in circular orbits with periods of about 180 min. Both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements were observed, but individual coleoptiles continued to rotate only in one direction. Light-grown seedlings did not show circumnutation. In fact, dark-grown seedlings were found to cease circumnutating in response to a pulse of red light (R). This light-induced inhibition of circumnutation was demonstrated to involve both a FR-inducible very-low-fluence response, solely mediated by phytochrome A, and a FR-reversible low-fluence response, mediated by phytochrome B and/or C. The R-induced inhibition of circumnutation showed temporal agreement with the R-induced inhibition of coleoptile growth, suggesting that the former results from the latter. However, about 25% of growth activity remained after R treatment, indicating that circumnutation is more specifically regulated by phytochrome. The R-treated coleoptile showed gravitropism. Investigation of the growth differential for gravitropic curvature revealed that gravitropic responsiveness was rather enhanced by R. The results suggested that gravitropism is not a cause of circumnutation. It remained probable, however, that gravity perception is a part of the mechanism of circumnutation. It is speculated that the circumnutation investigated aids the seedling shoot in growing through the soil.
