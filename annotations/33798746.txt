Virus-derived small interference RNAs (vsiRNAs) not only suppress virus infection in plants via induction of RNA silencing but also enhance virus infection by regulating host defensive gene expression. However, the underlying mechanisms that control vsiRNA-mediated host immunity or susceptibility remain largely unknown. In this study, we generated several transgenic wheat lines using four artificial microRNA expression vectors carrying vsiRNAs from Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) RNA1. Laboratory and field tests showed that two transgenic wheat lines expressing amiRNA1 were highly resistant to WYMV infection. Further analyses showed that vsiRNA1 could modulate the expression of a wheat thioredoxin-like gene (TaAAED1), which encodes a negative regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the chloroplast. The function of TaAAED1 in ROS scavenging could be suppressed by vsiRNA1 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, transgenic expression of amiRNA1 in wheat resulted in broad-spectrum disease resistance to Chinese wheat mosaic virus, Barley stripe mosaic virus, and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici infection, suggesting that vsiRNA1 is involved in wheat immunity via ROS signaling. Collectively, these findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism underlying the arms race between viruses and plants.
