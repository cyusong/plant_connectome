MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in plant development and stress responses, and a growing number of studies suggest that miRNAs are promising targets for crop improvement because they participate in the regulation of diverse, important agronomic traits. MicroRNA398 (miR398) is a conserved miRNA in plants and has been shown to control multiple stress responses and plant growth in a variety of species. There are many studies on the stress response and developmental regulation of miR398. To systematically understand its function, it is necessary to summarize the evolution and functional roles of miR398 and its target genes. In this review, we analyze the evolution of miR398 in plants and outline its involvement in abiotic and biotic stress responses, in growth and development and in model and non-model plants. We summarize recent functional analyses, highlighting the role of miR398 as a master regulator that coordinates growth and diverse responses to environmental factors. We also discuss the potential for fine-tuning miR398 to achieve the goal of simultaneously improving plant growth and stress tolerance.
