<i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i> (common ice plant) is a halophyte species that has adapted to extreme conditions. In this study, we cloned a <i>McHB7</i> transcription factor gene from the ice plant. The expression of <i>McHB7</i> was significantly induced by 500 mM NaCl and it reached the peak under salt treatment for 7 days. The <i>McHB7</i> protein was targeted to the nucleus. <i>McHB7</i>-overexpressing in ice plant leaves through <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation led to 25 times more <i>McHB7</i> transcripts than the non-transformed wild type (WT). After 500 mM NaCl treatment for 7 days, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) and water content of the transgenic plants were higher than the WT, while malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased in the transgenic plants. A total of 1082 and 1072 proteins were profiled by proteomics under control and salt treatment, respectively, with 22 and 11 proteins uniquely identified under control and salt stress, respectively. Among the 11 proteins, 7 were increased and 4 were decreased after salt treatment. Most of the proteins whose expression increased in the <i>McHB7</i> overexpression (OE) ice plants under high salinity were involved in transport regulation, catalytic activities, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and response to stimulus. The results demonstrate that the <i>McHB7</i> transcription factor plays a positive role in improving plant salt tolerance.
