Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DAG) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), and both DAG and PA are lipid mediators in the cell. Here we show that DGK1 in rice (Oryza sativa) plays important roles in root growth and development. Two independent OsDGK1-knockout (dgk1) lines exhibited a higher density of lateral roots (LRs) and thinner seminal roots (SRs), whereas OsDGK1-overexpressing plants displayed a lower LR density and thicker SRs than wild-type (WT) plants. Overexpression of OsDGK1 led to a decline in the DGK substrate DAG whereas specific PA species decreased in dgk1 roots. Supplementation of DAG to OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness whereas application of PA to dgk1 seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness to those of the WT. In addition, treatment of rice seedlings with the DGK inhibitor R59022 increased the level of DAG and decreased PA, which also restored the root phenotype of OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings close to that of the WT. Together, these results indicate that DGK1 and associated lipid mediators modulate rice root architecture; DAG promotes LR formation and suppresses SR growth whereas PA suppresses LR number and promotes SR thickness.
