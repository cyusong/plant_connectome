SCL3 inhibits transcriptional activity of IDD-DELLA complex by acting as a co-repressor and repression activity is enhanced in the presence of GAF1 in a TOPLESS-independent manner. GRAS [GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE (GAI), REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA) and SCARECROW (SCR)] proteins are a family of plant-specific transcriptional regulators that play diverse roles in development and signaling. GRAS family DELLA proteins act as growth repressors by inhibiting gibberellin (GA) signaling in response to developmental and environmental cues. DELLAs also act as co-activators of transcription factor GAI-ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 (GAF1)/INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 (IDD2), the GAF1-DELLA complex activating transcription of GAF1 target genes. GAF1 also interacts with TOPLESS (TPL), a transcriptional co-repressor, in the absence of DELLA, the GAF1-TPL complex repressing transcription of the target genes. SCARECROW-LIKE3 (SCL3), another member of the GRAS family, is thought to inhibit transcriptional activity of the IDD-DELLA complex through competitive interaction with IDD. Here, we also revealed that SCL3 inhibits transcriptional activation by the GAF1-DELLA complex via repression activity rather than via competitive inhibition of the GAF1-DELLA interaction. Moreover, the repression activity of SCL3 was enhanced by GAF1 in a TPL-independent manner. While the GRAS domain of DELLA has transcriptional activation activity, that of SCL3 has repression activity. SCL3 also inhibited transcriptional activity of GAF1-RGA fusion proteins. Results from the co-immunoprecipitation assays and the yeast three-hybrid assay suggested the possibility that SCL3 forms a ternary complex with GAF1 and DELLA. These findings provide important information on DELLA-regulated GA signaling and new insight into the transcriptional repression mechanism.
