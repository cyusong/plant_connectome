Vernalization accelerates flowering after prolonged winter cold. Transcriptional and epigenetic changes are known to be involved in the regulation of the vernalization response. Despite intensive applications of next-generation sequencing in diverse aspects of plant research, genome-wide transcriptome and epigenome profiling during the vernalization response has not been conducted. In this work, to our knowledge, we present the first comprehensive analyses of transcriptomic and epigenomic dynamics during the vernalization process in Arabidopsis thaliana. Six major clusters of genes exhibiting distinctive features were identified. Temporary changes in histone H3K4me3 levels were observed that likely coordinate photosynthesis and prevent oxidative damage during cold exposure. In addition, vernalization induced a stable accumulation of H3K27me3 over genes encoding many development-related transcription factors, which resulted in either inhibition of transcription or a bivalent status of the genes. Lastly, FLC-like and VIN3-like genes were identified that appear to be novel components of the vernalization pathway.
