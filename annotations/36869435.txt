The phytohormones, jasmonates (JAs), mediate many plant developmental processes and their responses to important environmental stresses, such as herbivore attack. Bioactive JAs are perceived by CORONATINE INSENSITIVE (COI)-receptors, and associated JAZ proteins, to activate downstream responses. To date, the JA receptors of the important monocot crop plant, rice, remain to be explored. Here, we studied all three rice COI proteins, OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2, by ligand binding, genome editing, and phenotyping and examining some of the responsible mechanisms for the different responses. OsCOI2 binds to most individual OsJAZs in the presence of endogenous JA ligands, as OsCOI1a /1b do, albeit with greater partner selectivity. Single mutants of each OsCOI and OsCOI1a/1b double mutants were constructed by CRIPSR-Cas9-based genome editing and used to phenotype developmental and defense responses. OsCOI1b is involved in root growth and grain-size control and plays overlapping roles with OsCOI1a in spikelet development, while OsCOI2 regulates leaf senescence, male sterility, root growth, and grain size. All OsCOIs mediated resistance to the devastating rice pest, the brown planthopper. However, the defense sectors regulated by OsCOI1a/1b and OsCOI2 clearly differed. Our results revealed that all three OsCOIs are functional JA receptors that play diverse roles in regulating downstream JA responses.
