['28348169', 'Angiosperm seed development is a paradigm of tissue cross-talk. Proper seed  formation requires spatial and temporal coordination of the fertilization  products - embryo and endosperm - and the surrounding seed coat maternal tissue.  In early Arabidopsis seed development, all seed integuments were thought to  respond homogenously to endosperm growth. Here, we show that the sub-epidermal  integument cell layer has a unique developmental program. We characterized the  cell patterning of the sub-epidermal integument cell layer, which initiates a  previously uncharacterized extra cell layer, and identified TRANSPARENT TESTA 16  and SEEDSTICK MADS box transcription factors as master regulators of its polar  development and cell architecture. Our data indicate that the differentiation of  the sub-epidermal integument cell layer is insensitive to endosperm growth alone  and to the repressive mechanism established by FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT  ENDOSPERM and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 Polycomb group proteins. This work  demonstrates the different responses of epidermal and sub-epidermal integument  cell layers to fertilization.', '2017 Apr 15', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.146274', 'ORCID:']
