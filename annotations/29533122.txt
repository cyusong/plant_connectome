Previous study reported a novel type of self-discrimination in the tendrils of the vine Cayratia japonica (Vitaceae). However, whether self-discrimination in tendrils is common in vine plant species has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated whether tendrils of Momordica charantia var. pavel (Cucurbitaceae), Cucumis sativus (Cucurbitaceae) and Passiflora caerulea (Passifloraceae) can discriminate self and non-self plants. We also investigated whether the tendrils of M. charantia and C. sativus can discriminate differences in cultivars to determine the discrimination ability for genetic similarity. We found that tendrils of the M. charantia and P. caerulea were more likely to coil around non-self plant than self plants, but not in C. sativus. Our findings support the common occurrence of self-discrimination in tendrils in different plant taxa, although some species lacked it. Furthermore, tendrils of M. charantia more rapidly coil around different cultivars than around same cultivars. The tendrils of M. charantia may can discriminate differences in cultivars.
