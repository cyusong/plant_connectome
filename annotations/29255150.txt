The RNA exosome provides eukaryotic cells with an essential 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic activity, which processes or eliminates many classes of RNAs. Its nine-subunit core (Exo9) is structurally related to prokaryotic phosphorolytic exoribonucleases. Yet, yeast and animal Exo9s have lost the primordial phosphorolytic capacity and rely instead on associated hydrolytic ribonucleases for catalytic activity. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis Exo9 has retained a distributive phosphorolytic activity, which contributes to rRNA maturation processes, the hallmark of exosome function. High-density mapping of 3' extremities of rRNA maturation intermediates reveals the intricate interplay between three exoribonucleolytic activities coordinated by the plant exosome. Interestingly, the analysis of RRP41 protein diversity across eukaryotes suggests that Exo9's intrinsic activity operates throughout the green lineage, and possibly in some earlier-branching non-plant eukaryotes. Our results reveal a remarkable evolutionary variation of this essential RNA degradation machine in eukaryotes.
