['26744214', 'We show that NITRATE REGULATORY GENE2 (NRG2), which we identified using forward  genetics, mediates nitrate signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. A mutation in NRG2  disrupted the induction of nitrate-responsive genes after nitrate treatment by an  ammonium-independent mechanism. The nitrate content in roots was lower in the  mutants than in the wild type, which may have resulted from reduced expression of  NRT1.1 (also called NPF6.3, encoding a nitrate transporter/receptor) and  upregulation of NRT1.8 (also called NPF7.2, encoding a xylem nitrate  transporter). Genetic and molecular data suggest that NRG2 functions upstream of  NRT1.1 in nitrate signaling. Furthermore, NRG2 directly interacts with the  nitrate regulator NLP7 in the nucleus, but nuclear retention of NLP7 in response  to nitrate is not dependent on NRG2. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes  involved in four nitrogen-related clusters including nitrate transport and  response to nitrate were differentially expressed in the nrg2 mutants. A nitrogen  compound transport cluster containing some members of the NRT/PTR family was  regulated by both NRG2 and NRT1.1, while no nitrogen-related clusters showed  regulation by both NRG2 and NLP7. Thus, NRG2 plays a key role in nitrate  regulation in part through modulating NRT1.1 expression and may function with  NLP7 via their physical interaction.', '2016 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00567', 'ORCID:']
