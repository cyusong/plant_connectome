The Arabidopsis ACD11 gene encodes a sphingosine transfer protein and was identified by the accelerated cell death phenotype of the loss of function acd11 mutant, which exhibits heightened expression of genes involved in the disease resistance hypersensitive response (HR). We used ACD11 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an Arabidopsis cDNA library to identify ACD11 interacting proteins. One interactor identified is a protein of unknown function with an RNA recognition motif (RRM) designated BPA1 (binding partner of ACD11). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the ACD11-BPA1 interactions in vivo and in vitro. Two other ACD11 interactors (PRA7 and PRA8) are homologous to each other and to mammalian PRA1, and both were subsequently shown to interact with BPA1 in yeast. A fourth interactor (VAP27-1) is homologous to mammalian VAP-A, and was found to interact more strongly with a homolog of ACD11 than ACD11 itself. All interactors were shown to be associated with membrane fractions, suggesting that ACD11 function could be related to the regulation of membrane compartments.
