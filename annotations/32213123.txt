ABA regulates abiotic stress tolerance in plants via activating/repressing gene expression. However, the functions of many ABA response genes remained unknown. C/VIFs are proteinaceous inhibitors of the CWI and VI invertases. We report here the involvement of C/VIF1 in regulating ABA response and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. We found that the expression level of <i>C/VIF1</i> was increased in response to ABA treatment. By using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we generated transgene-free <i>c/vif1</i> mutants. We also generated <i>C/VIF1</i> overexpression plants by expressing <i>C/VIF1</i> under the control of the <i>35S</i> promoter. We examined ABA response of the <i>35S:C/VIF1</i> transgenic plants and the <i>c/vif1</i> mutants by using seed germination and seedling greening assays, and found that the <i>35S:C/VIF1</i> transgenic plants showed an enhanced sensitivity to ABA treatment in both assays. On the other hand, the <i>c/vif1</i> mutants showed slight enhanced tolerance to ABA only at the early stage of germination. We also found that salt tolerance was reduced in the <i>35S:C/VIF1</i> transgenic plants in seed germination assays, but slightly increased in the <i>c/vif1</i> mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>C/VIF1</i> is an ABA response gene, and C/VIF1 is involved in the regulation of ABA response and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.
