To increase our knowledge of anaphase promoting complex (APC/C) function during plant development, we characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA-insertion line where the T-DNA fell within the 5' regulatory region of the APC10 gene. The insert disrupted endogenous expression, resulting in overexpression of APC10 mRNA from the T-DNA- internal CaMV 35S promoter, and increased APC10 protein. Overexpression of APC10 produced phenotypes resembling those of known auxin and ethylene mutants, and increased expression of two tested auxin-regulated genes, small auxin up RNA (SAUR) 15 and SAUR24. Taken together, our data suggests that elevated APC10 likely mimics auxin and ethylene sensitive phenotypes, expanding our understanding of proteolytic processes in hormone regulation of plant development.
