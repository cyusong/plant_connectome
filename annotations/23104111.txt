Sulfur (S) deficiency is prevailing all over the world and becoming an important issue for crop improvement through maximising its utilization efficiency by plants for sustainable agriculture. Its interaction with other regulatory molecules in plants is necessary to improve our understanding on its role under changing environment. Our knowledge on the influence of S on ethylene signaling is meagre although it is a constituent of cysteine (Cys) required for the synthesis of reduced glutathione (GSH) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), a precursor of ethylene biosynthesis. Thus, there may be an interaction between S assimilation, ethylene signaling and plant responses under optimal and stressful environmental conditions. The present review emphasizes that responses of plants to S involve ethylene action. This evaluation will provide an insight into the details of interactive role of S and ethylene signaling in regulating plant processes and prove profitable for developing sustainability under changing environmental conditions.
