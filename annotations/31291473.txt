The tendency of closely related plant species to share natural enemies has been suggested to limit their co-occurrence and performance, but we lack a deep understanding on how mutualistic interactions such as the mycorrhizal symbiosis affect plant-plant interactions depending on the phylogenetic relatedness of the interacting plants. We hypothesise that the effect of the mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant-plant facilitative interactions depends on the phylogenetic distance between the nurse and facilitated plants. A recently published meta-analysis compiled the strength of plant facilitative interactions in the presence or absence (or reduced abundance) of mycorrhizal fungi. We use phylogenetically informed Bayesian linear models to test whether the effect size is influenced by the phylogenetic distance between the plant species involved in each plant facilitative interaction. Conspecific facilitative interactions are more strongly enhanced by mycorrhizal fungi than interactions between closely related species. In heterospecific interactions, the effect of the mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant facilitation increases with the phylogenetic distance between the nurse and facilitated plant species. Our result showing that the effect of mycorrhizal symbiosis on the facilitation interactions between plants depends on their phylogenetic relatedness provides new mechanisms to understand how facilitation is assembling ecological communities.
