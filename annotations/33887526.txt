Plant electrical signals, an early event in the plant-stimulus interaction, rapidly transmit information generated by the stimulus to other organs, and even the whole plant, to promote the corresponding response and trigger a regulatory cascade. In recent years, many promising state-of-the-art technologies applicable to study plant electrophysiology have emerged. Research focused on expression of genes associated with electrical signals has also proliferated. We propose that it is appropriate for plant electrical signals to be considered in the form of a "plant electrophysiological phenotype". This review synthesizes research on plant electrical signals from a novel, interdisciplinary perspective, which is needed to improve the efficient aggregation and use of plant electrical signal data and to expedite interpretation of plant electrical signals.
