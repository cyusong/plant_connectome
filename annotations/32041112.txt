Abscisic acid (ABA) insensitive 5 (ABI5)-a core transcription factor of the ABA signaling pathway-is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of seed germination and early seedling growth. ABI5 interacts with other phytohormone signals to regulate plant growth and development, and stress responses in Arabidopsis, but little is known about the functions of ABI5 in potatoes. Here, we find that StABI5 is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development and photosynthesis. Genetic analysis indicates that StABI5 overexpression transgenic potato lines accelerate dark-induced leaf yellowing and senescence. The chlorophyll contents of overexpressed StABI5 transgenic potato lines were significantly decreased in comparison to those of wild-type Desiree potatoes under dark conditions. Additionally, the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis shows that many metabolic processes are changed in overexpressed StABI5 transgenic potatoes. Most of the genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation are significantly down-regulated, especially the chlorophyll a-b binding protein, photosystem I, and photosystem II. These observations indicate that StABI5 negatively regulates chloroplast development and photosynthesis, and provides some insights into the functions of StABI5 in regard to potato growth.
