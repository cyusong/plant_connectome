['9238019', 'To understand the structure, role, and regulation of individual Ca2+ pumps in  plants, we have used yeast as a heterologous expression system to test the  function of a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana (ECA1). ECA1 encoded a 116-kDa  polypeptide that has all the conserved domains common to P-type Ca2+ pumps (EC  3.6.1.38). The amino acid sequence shared more identity with  sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (53%) than with plasma membrane (32%) Ca2+  pumps. Yeast mutants defective in a Golgi Ca2+ pump (pmr1) or both Golgi and  vacuolar Ca2+ pumps (pmr1 pmc1 cnb1) were sensitive to growth on medium  containing 10 mM EGTA or 3 mM Mn2+. Expression of ECA1 restored growth of either  mutant on EGTA. Membranes were isolated from the pmr1 pmc1 cnb1 mutant  transformed with ECA1 to determine if the ECA1 polypeptide (ECA1p) could be  phosphorylated as intermediates of the reaction cycle of Ca2+-pumping ATPases. In  the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, ECA1p formed a Ca2+-dependent [32P]phosphoprotein  of 106 kDa that was sensitive to hydroxylamine. Cyclopiazonic acid, a blocker of  animal sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps, inhibited the formation of  the phosphoprotein, whereas thapsigargin did not. Immunoblotting with an antibody  against the carboxyl tail showed that ECA1p was associated mainly with the  endoplasmic reticulum membranes isolated from Arabidopsis plants. The results  support the model that ECA1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum-type Ca2+ pump in  Arabidopsis. The ability of ECA1p to restore growth of mutant pmr1 on medium  containing Mn2+, and the formation of a Mn2+-dependent phosphoprotein suggested  that ECA1p may also regulate Mn2+ homeostasis by pumping Mn2+ into endomembrane  compartments of plants.', '1997 Aug 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.94.16.8579', 'Sze']
