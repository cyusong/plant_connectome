Given their sessile nature, it is critical for the survival of plants to adapt to their environment. Accordingly, plants have evolved the ability to sense seasonal changes to govern developmental fates such as the floral transition. Temperature and day length are among the seasonal cues that plants sense. We recently reported that VIN3-LIKE 1 (VIL1) is involved in mediating the flowering response to both cold and day length via regulation of two related genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM), respectively.

FLC: !mediates! flowering response to cold
FLM: !mediates! flowering response to day length
