Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX), the unique respiratory terminal oxidase in plants, catalyzes the energy wasteful cyanide (CN)-resistant respiration and plays a role in optimizing photosynthesis. Recent studies from our group indicated that AOX plays a crucial role in chloroplast protection under extreme environments, such as high light (HL). Genetic data suggest that AOX is upregulated by light that was mediated by photoreceptors (phytochromes, phototropins and cryptochromes), and it also might have a particular role in relieving the overreduction of chloroplasts. Physiological analyses further suggest that AOX is essential for the dark-to-light transition, especially in de-etiolation course. In this mini-review, we highlight recent progresses in understanding the beneficial interaction between photosynthesis and mitochondria metabolism and discuss the possible role and mechanism of AOX in dissipation of excess reduced equivalents for chloroplasts under high light condition.
