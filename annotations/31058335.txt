Plant -specific lysin-motif receptor-like kinases (LysM-RLKs) are implicated in the perception of N-acetyl glucosamine-containing compounds, some of which are important signal molecules in plant-microbe interactions. Among these, both lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and chitooligosaccharides (COs) are proposed as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal symbiotic signals. COs can also activate plant defence, although there are scarce data about CO production by pathogens, especially nonfungal pathogens. We tested Medicago truncatula mutants in the LysM-RLK MtLYK9 for their abilities to interact with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis and the oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches. This prompted us to analyse whether A. euteiches can produce COs. Compared with wild-type plants, Mtlyk9 mutants had fewer infection events and were less colonised by the AM fungus. By contrast, Mtlyk9 mutants were more heavily infected by A. euteiches and showed more disease symptoms. Aphanomyces euteiches was also shown to produce short COs, mainly CO II, but also CO III and CO IV, and traces of CO V, both ex planta and in planta. MtLYK9 thus has a dual role in plant immunity and the AM symbiosis, which raises questions about the functioning and the ancestral origins of such a receptor protein.
