['19304934', 'Plasma membrane proteins internalized by endocytosis and targeted for degradation  are sorted into lumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by the endosomal  sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Here, we show that  the Arabidopsis thaliana ESCRT-related CHARGED MULTIVESICULAR BODY  PROTEIN/CHROMATIN MODIFYING PROTEIN1A (CHMP1A) and CHMP1B proteins are essential  for embryo and seedling development. Double homozygous chmp1a chmp1b mutant  embryos showed limited polar differentiation and failed to establish bilateral  symmetry. Mutant seedlings show disorganized apical meristems and rudimentary  true leaves with clustered stomata and abnormal vein patterns. Mutant embryos  failed to establish normal auxin gradients. Three proteins involved in auxin  transport, PINFORMED1 (PIN1), PIN2, and AUXIN-RESISTANT1 (AUX1) mislocalized to  the vacuolar membrane of the mutant. PIN1 was detected in MVB lumenal vesicles of  control cells but remained in the limiting membrane of chmp1a chmp1b MVBs. The  chmp1a chmp1b mutant forms significantly fewer MVB lumenal vesicles than the wild  type. Furthermore, CHMP1A interacts in vitro with the ESCRT-related proteins At  SKD1 and At LIP5. Thus, Arabidopsis CHMP1A and B are ESCRT-related proteins with  conserved endosomal functions, and the auxin carriers PIN1, PIN2, and AUX1 are  ESCRT cargo proteins in the MVB sorting pathway.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.064865', 'Otegui']
