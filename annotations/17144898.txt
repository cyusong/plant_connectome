['17144898', 'The Arabidopsis pad2-1 mutant belongs to a series of non-allelic  camalexin-deficient mutants. It was originally described as showing enhanced  susceptibility to virulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae and was later shown to  be hyper-susceptible to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora brassicae (formerly P.  porri). Surprisingly, in both pathosystems, the disease susceptibility of pad2-1  was not caused by the camalexin deficiency, suggesting additional roles of PAD2  in disease resistance. The susceptibility of pad2-1 to P. brassicae was used to  map the mutation to the gene At4g23100, which encodes gamma-glutamylcysteine  synthetase (gamma-ECS, GSH1). GSH1 catalyzes the first committed step of  glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. The pad2-1 mutation caused an S to N transition  at amino acid position 298 close to the active center. The conclusion that PAD2  encodes GSH1 is supported by several lines of evidence: (i) pad2-1 mutants  contained only about 22% of wild-type amounts of GSH, (ii) genetic  complementation of pad2-1 with wild-type GSH1 cDNA restored GSH production,  accumulation of camalexin in response to P. syringae and resistance to P.  brassicae and P. syringae, (iii) another GSH1 mutant, cad2-1, showed pad2-like  phenotypes, and (iv) feeding of GSH to excised leaves of pad2-1 restored  camalexin production and resistance to P. brassicae. Inoculation of Col-0 with P.  brassicae caused a coordinated increase in the transcript abundance of GSH1 and  GSH2, the gene encoding the second enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, and resulted in  enhanced foliar GSH accumulation. The pad2-1 mutant showed enhanced  susceptibility to additional pathogens, suggesting an important general role of  GSH in disease resistance of Arabidopsis.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02938.x', 'Mauch']
