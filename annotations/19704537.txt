Nep1-like proteins (NLPs) are a novel family of microbial elicitors of plant necrosis that induce a hypersensitive-like response in dicot plants. The spatial structure and role of these proteins are yet unknown. In a paper published in BMC Plant Biology (2008; 8:50) we have proposed that the core region of Nep1-like proteins (NLPs) belong to the Cupin superfamily. Based on what is known about the Cupin superfamily, in this addendum to the paper we discuss how NLPs could form oligomers.

Nep1-like proteins: !belong to! Cupin superfamily
NLPs: !form! oligomers
