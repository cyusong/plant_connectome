['21188077', 'The aminotransferase gene family in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana consists  of 44 genes. Twenty six of these enzymes are classified as characterized meaning  that the reaction(s) that the enzyme catalyzes are documented using experimental  means. The remaining 18 enzymes are uncharacterized and are therefore deemed  putative. Our laboratory is interested in elucidating the function(s) of the  remaining putative aminotransferase enzymes. To this end, we have identified and  partially characterized an aminotransferase (TAT) enzyme from Arabidopsis  annotated by the locus tag At5g36160. The full-length cDNA was cloned and the  purified recombinant enzyme was characterized using in vitro and in vivo  experiments. In vitro analysis showed that the enzyme is capable of  interconverting L-Tyrosine and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and L-Phenylalanine and  phenylpyruvate. In vivo analysis by functional complementation showed that the  gene was able to complement an E. coli with a background of aminotransferase  mutations that confers auxotrophy for L-Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine.', '2010', 'Biochem Res Int', '10.1155/2010/549572', 'Hudson']
