Stem node has been found to be a hub for controlling mineral nutrient distribution in gramineous plants. However, the characteristics of stem nodes associated with whole-plant carbon partitioning in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) and their responses to nitrogen (N) availability remains elusive. Maize plants were grown in greenhouse under low to high N supply. Plant growth, sugar accumulation, and sugar transporters in nodes and leaves, as well as the anatomical structure of nodes, were investigated at vegetative phase. When compared to N-sufficient plants, low-N availability stunted growth and resulted in 49-64% less sugars in leaves, which was attributed to low photosynthesis or the accelerated carbon export, as evidenced by more <sup>13</sup>C detected further below leaf tips. Invariably higher sugar concentrations were found in the stem nodes, rather than in the leaves across N treatments, indicating a crucial role of nodes in facilitating whole-plant carbon partitioning. More and smaller vascular bundles and phloem were observed in stem nodes of N-deficient plants, while higher sugar levels were found in the bottom nodes than in the upper ones. Low-N availability upregulated the gene expressions of sugar transporters, which putatively function in nodes such as <i>ZmSWEETs</i> and <i>ZmSUTs</i> at the bottom stem, but suppressed them in the upper ones, showing a developmental impact on node function. Further, greater activity of sugar transporters in the bottom nodes was associated with less sugars in leaves. Overall, these results highlighted that stem nodes may play an important role in facilitating long-distance sugar transport in maize.
