['17586656', 'NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (NTRs) are key regulatory enzymes  determining the redox state of the thioredoxin system. The Arabidopsis thaliana  genome has two genes coding for NTRs (NTRA and NTRB), both of which encode  mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms. Surprisingly, plants of the ntra ntrb  knockout mutant are viable and fertile, although with a wrinkled seed phenotype,  slower plant growth, and pollen with reduced fitness. Thus, in contrast with  mammals, our data demonstrate that neither cytosolic nor mitochondrial NTRs are  essential in plants. Nevertheless, in the double mutant, the cytosolic  thioredoxin h3 is only partially oxidized, suggesting an alternative mechanism  for thioredoxin reduction. Plant growth in ntra ntrb plants is hypersensitive to  buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis,  and thioredoxin h3 is totally oxidized under this treatment. Interestingly, this  BSO-mediated growth arrest is fully reversible, suggesting that BSO induces a  growth arrest signal but not a toxic accumulation of activated oxygen species.  Moreover, crossing ntra ntrb with rootmeristemless1, a mutant blocked in root  growth due to strongly reduced glutathione synthesis, led to complete inhibition  of both shoot and root growth, indicating that either the NTR or the glutathione  pathway is required for postembryonic activity in the apical meristem.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.050849', 'Meyer']
