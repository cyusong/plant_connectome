Diatoms are microalgae well known for their high variability and high primary productivity, being responsible for about 20% of the annual global carbon fixation. Moreover, they are interesting as potential feedstocks for the production of biofuels and high-value lipids and carotenoids. Diatoms exhibit trophic flexibility and, under certain conditions, they can grow mixotrophically by combing photosynthesis and respiration. So far, only a few species of diatoms have been tested for their mixotrophic metabolism; in some cases, they produced more biomass and with higher lipid content when grown under this condition. Phaeodactylum tricornutum is the most studied diatom species for its mixotrophic metabolism due to available genome sequence and molecular tools. However, studies in additional species are needed to better understand the conservation of this process in diatoms and its potential in industrial applications. Here, we describe the photosynthetic and respiratory pathways involved in mixotrophy and provide an overview of the trophic variability in diatoms. This review also highlights promising areas of industrial applications for diatoms when cultivated under mixotrophy.
