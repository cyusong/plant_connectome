The kernel row number (KRN) of an ear is an important trait related to yield and domestication in maize. Exploring the underlying genetic mechanisms of KRN has great research significance and application potential. In the present study, N531 with a KRN of 18-22 and SLN with a KRN of 4-6 were used as the recurrent parent and the donor parent, respectively, to develop two introgression lines (ILs), IL_A and IL_B, both of which have common negative-effect alleles from SLN on chromosomes 1, 5 and 10 and significantly reduced inflorescence meristem (IM) diameter and KRN compared with those of N531. We used RNA-Seq to investigate the transcriptome profiles of 5-mm immature ears of N531, IL_A and IL_B. We identified a total of 2872 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between N531 and IL_A, 2428 DEGs between N531 and IL_B and 1811 DEGs between IL_A and IL_B. A total of 1252 DEGs were detected as overlapping DEGs, and 89 DEGs were located on the common introgression fragments. Furthermore, three DEGs (Zm00001d013277, Zm00001d015310 and Zm00001d015377) containing three SNPs associated with KRN were identified using regional association mapping. These results will facilitate our understanding of ear development and provide important candidate genes for further study on KRN.
