Pseudogenes, nonfunctional genomic sequences derived from functional protein-coding genes, form by duplication or retrotransposition, and loss of gene function by disabling mutations. Studies on the evolution and functional aspects of plant pseudogenes are limited, despite their abundance in the plant genome. To date, most researches on pseudogenes focus on mammals. Here, we summarized current knowledge on pseudogenes including the historical and recent progress, analyzes their essential roles in gene regulation in hope of further stimulating researches in plant species for understanding gene regulation and evolution.
