Cell fate determination in plants relies on positional cues. To investigate the position-dependent gene regulation in plants, we focused on shoot epidermal cell specification, which occurs only in the outermost cells. <i>ATML1</i>, which encodes an HD-ZIP class IV transcription factor, is a positive regulator of shoot epidermal cell identity. Despite the presence of a weak <i>ATML1</i> promoter activity in the inner cells, ATML1 protein was detected mostly in the outermost cells, which suggests that ATML1 accumulation is inhibited in the inner cells. ATML1 nuclear localization was reduced in the epidermis and there was a positive, albeit weak, correlation between the amount of ATML1 in the nuclei and the expression of a direct target of ATML1. Nuclear accumulation of ATML1 was more strongly inhibited in the inner cells than in the outermost cells. Domain deletion analyses revealed that the ZLZ-coding sequence was necessary and partially sufficient for the post-transcriptional repression of <i>ATML1</i> Our results suggest that post-transcriptional repressions contribute to the restriction of master transcriptional regulator activity in specific cells to enable position-dependent cell differentiation.
