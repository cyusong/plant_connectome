Shifts in pollination may drive adaptive diversification of reproductive systems within plant lineages. The monophyletic genus Schiedea is a Hawaiian lineage of 32 extant species, with spectacular diversity in reproductive systems. Biotic pollination is the presumed ancestral condition, but this key element of the life history and its role in shaping reproductive systems has remained undocumented. We observed floral visitors to two species of Schiedea and conducted field experiments to test pollinator effectiveness. We used choice tests to compare attraction of pollinators to species hypothesized to be biotically vs wind-pollinated. Pseudoschrankia brevipalpis (Erebidae), a recently described moth species known only from O'ahu, visited hermaphroditic Schiedea kaalae and S. hookeri and removed nectar from their unique tubular nectary extensions. Pseudoschrankia brevipalpis effectively pollinates S. kaalae; single visits to emasculated flowers resulted in pollen transfer. In choice tests, P. brevipalpis strongly preferred these hermaphroditic species over two subdioecious species capable of wind pollination. A shift from biotic to abiotic pollination is clearly implicated in the diversification of reproductive systems within Schiedea. Abundant pollination by a previously unknown native moth in experimental and restored populations suggests the potential for restoration to re-establish native plant-pollinator interactions critical for production of outcrossed individuals with high fitness.
