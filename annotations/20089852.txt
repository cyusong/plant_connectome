['20089852', 'RPK1 (receptor-like protein kinase 1) localizes to the plasma membrane and  functions as a regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis. In our  current study, we investigated the effect of RPK1 disruption and overproduction  upon plant responses to drought stress. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing the  RPK1 protein showed increased ABA sensitivity in their root growth and stomatal  closure and also displayed less transpirational water loss. In contrast, a mutant  lacking RPK1 function, rpk1-1, was found to be resistant to ABA during these  processes and showed increased water loss. RPK1 overproduction in these  transgenic plants thus increased their tolerance to drought stress. We performed  microarray analysis of RPK1 transgenic plants and observed enhanced expression of  several stress-responsive genes, such as Cor15a, Cor15b, and rd29A, in addition  to H(2)O(2)-responsive genes. Consistently, the expression levels of  ABA/stress-responsive genes in rpk1-1 had decreased compared with wild type. The  results suggest that the overproduction of RPK1 enhances both the ABA and drought  stress signaling pathways. Furthermore, the leaves of the rpk1-1 plants exhibit  higher sensitivity to oxidative stress upon ABA-pretreatment, whereas transgenic  plants overproducing RPK1 manifest increased tolerance to this stress. Our  current data suggest therefore that RPK1 overproduction controls reactive oxygen  species homeostasis and enhances both water and oxidative stress tolerance in  Arabidopsis.', '2010 Mar 19', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M109.051938', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
