The cytochrome c550-deficient mutant (psbV-disruptant) of Synechocystis requires a high concentration of Cl(-) in the culture medium to support photosynthetic oxygen evolution. From this disruptant, we isolated spontaneous suppressor mutants that are able to grow photoautotrophically in the absence of Cl(-). Three independent mutations were identified: one was a deletion in slr0753 and two were a transposition of related insertion sequences in the same slr0753. The deduced product of slr0753 belongs to a novel group of the superfamily of ion efflux pumps and ion transporters. These results suggest that Slr0753 exports Cl(-) or a related anion, which is essential for PSII oxygen evolution.
