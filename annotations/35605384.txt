Psoralea corylifolia L. is a popular herb and has long been used in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine owing to its extensive pharmacological activities, especially in the treatment of various shin diseases. To date, the systematic evaluation and selection of the optimum reference genes for gene expression analysis of P. corylifolia were not reported. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a method for gene expression quantification. Selecting appropriate reference genes is the prerequisite for accurate normalization of RT-qPCR results. This study assessed the expression stability of 10 candidate reference genes under different abiotic stresses. First, amplification primers for RT-qPCR were designed and received testing and optimization. Then, expression data from each candidate gene were evaluated based on three statistical algorithms, and their results were further integrated into a comprehensive ranking based on the geometric mean. Additionally, one target gene, i.e., 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO), was used to validate the effectiveness of the selected reference. Our analysis suggested that thioredoxin-like protein YLS8 (YLS8), TIP41-like family protein (TIP41), and cyclophilin 2 (CYP2) genes provided superior expression normalization under different abiotic stresses. Overall, this work constitutes the first effort to select optimal endogenous controls for RT-qPCR studies of gene expression in P. corylifolia. It also provides a reasonable normalization standard and basis for further analysis of the gene expression of bioactive components in P. corylifolia.
