Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays an important role in many developmental processes and biotic/abiotic stress responses in plants. Although serotonin biosynthetic pathways in plants have been uncovered, knowledge of the mechanisms of serotonin accumulation is still limited, and no regulators have been identified to date. Here, we identified the basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP18 as a positive regulator of serotonin biosynthesis in rice. Overexpression of <i>OsbZIP18</i> strongly induced the levels of serotonin and its early precursors (tryptophan and tryptamine), resulting in stunted growth and dark-brown phenotypes. A function analysis showed that OsbZIP18 activated serotonin biosynthesis genes (including <i>tryptophan decarboxylase 1 (OsTDC1)</i>, <i>tryptophan decarboxylase 3</i> (<i>OsTDC3</i>), and <i>tryptamine 5-hydroxylase</i> (<i>OsT5H</i>)) by directly binding to the ACE-containing or G-box <i>cis</i>-elements in their promoters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <i>OsbZIP18</i> is induced by UV-B stress, and experiments using UV-B radiation showed that transgenic plants overexpressing <i>OsbZIP18</i> exhibited UV-B stress-sensitive phenotypes. Besides, exogenous serotonin significantly exacerbates UV-B stress of <i>OsbZIP18</i>_OE plants, suggesting that the excessive accumulation of serotonin may be responsible for the sensitivity of <i>OsbZIP18</i>_OE plants to UV-B stress. Overall, we identified a positive regulator of serotonin biosynthesis and demonstrated that UV-B-stress induced serotonin accumulation, partly in an OsbZIP18-dependent manner.
