['21771120', 'In plants, the exogenous transgene transcribing inverted-repeat (exo-IR)  sequences produces double-stranded RNAs that are processed by DCL4. The 21-nt  small interfering RNAs generated function as mobile signals to trigger non-cell  autonomous silencing of target endogenes in the neighboring 10-15 cells. The  potential involvement of nuclear silencing pathway components in signal spreading  or sensing in target cells is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the exo-IR  silencer (exo-Pdsi) is negatively autoregulated through methylation spreading,  which acts in cis to reinforce the self-silencing of the silencer. Mutations  affecting nuclear proteins DRD1 and Pol V (NRPE1 or NRPD2) relieved exo-Pdsi  self-silencing, resulting in higher levels of Pdsi transcripts, which increased  the non-cell autonomous silencing of endo-PDS. Our results suggest that in an  experimental silencing pathway, methylation spreading on a silencer transgene may  not have a direct endogenous plant counterpart when the protein-encoding gene is  the target. DRD1-Pol V-dependent de novo methylation, by acting in cis to  reinforce self-silencing of exo-IR, may play a role in restraining the  inappropriate silencing of active protein-coding genes in plants.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04714.x', 'Guo']
