['23321421', 'Phytochromes (phys) encompass a diverse collection of biliproteins that enable  cellular light perception by photoconverting between a red-light-absorbing ground  state (Pr) and a far-red light-absorbing active state (Pfr). Based on the central  role of plant phys in controlling numerous agriculturally important processes,  their rational redesign offers great promise toward accelerating crop  improvement. Employing as templates the available three-dimensional models of the  photosensory module within bacterial phys, we report here our initial attempt to  apply structure-guided mutagenesis to phy engineering using Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) phyB, the dominant isoform in light-grown plants, as the  example. A collection of phyB mutants was generated affecting the bilin-binding  pocket that altered photochemistry, thermal stability, and/or nuclear  localization patterns, some of which also impacted phenotypic outputs. Of  particular interest are the Y361F substitution, which created Arabidopsis plants  with greatly enhanced light sensitivity, mutants variably altered in Pfr-to-Pr  thermal reversion and nuclear aggregation, and the D307A substitution, which  failed to photoconvert from Pr to Pfr and display light-induced nuclear  aggregation but retained some biological activity and accelerated turnover in red  light. Taken together, this collection provides variants potentially useful to  agriculture as well as new tools to better understand the molecular mechanisms  underpinning phy signaling.', '2013 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.208892', 'Vierstra']
