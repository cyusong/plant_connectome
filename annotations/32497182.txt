Biomass and grain yield are key agronomic traits in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor); however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these traits are not well understood. Here, we characterized the biomass yield 1 (by1) mutant, which displays a dramatically altered phenotype that includes reduced plant height, narrow stems, erect and narrow leaves, and abnormal floral organs. Histological analysis suggested that these phenotypic defects are mainly caused by inhibited cell elongation and abnormal floral organ development. Map-based cloning revealed that BY1 encodes a 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) that catalyses the first step of the shikimate pathway. BY1 was localized in chloroplasts and was ubiquitously distributed in the organs examined, particularly in the roots, stems, leaves, and panicles, which was consistent with its role in biomass production and grain yield. Transcriptome analysis and metabolic profiling revealed that BY1 was involved in primary metabolism and that it affected the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites, especially flavonoids. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that BY1 affects biomass and grain yield in sorghum by regulating primary and secondary metabolism via the shikimate pathway. Moreover, our results provide important insights into the relationship between plant development and metabolism.
