['31236659', 'Two redundant nucleoporin genes Nup98a and Nup98b bypass the CO-check point in  photoperiodic signaling and integrated signals from multiple pathways to directly  target FT for flowering control in Arabidopsis. Flowering regulation is an  important and widely studied plant development event. Even though nucleoporin  Nup98 has been proven to play pivotal roles in the growth and development of  mammalian cells and yeast, it is still unknown if Nup98 participates in flowering  control in plants. In this study, we investigated the function of two Nup98  homologs, Nup98a and Nup98b, in flowering regulation in Arabidopsis. The results  showed that Nup98a and Nup98b redundantly inhibit flowering through multiple  pathways including clock, photoperiod, and age pathways. Single mutants of nup98a  and nup98b do not show any obvious abnormal phenotypes compared to wild-type  plants; however, the nup98a1 nup98b1 double mutant displays early flowering.  Significantly, Nup98a/Nup98b gate flowering in a CONSTANS (CO)-independent mode.  Therefore, Nup98a/Nup98b bypasses the CO checkpoint in photoperiodic signaling  and integrated signals from multiple pathways to directly target FLOWERING LOCUS  T (FT) for flowering control. In addition, our results provide a line of genetic  evidence for uncoupling the mechanism of flowering and senescence at  Nup98a/Nup98b genes in Arabidopsis, which are classically recognized as two  coupled developmental events.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-019-02442-w', 'Zhang']
