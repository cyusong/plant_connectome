['22190635', 'In contrast to animals, plant germ cells are formed along with accessory cells in  specialized haploid generations, termed gametophytes. The female gametophyte of  flowering plants consists of four different cell types, which exert distinct  functions in the reproductive process. For successful fertilization, the  development of the four cell types has to be tightly coordinated; however, the  underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. We have previously isolated the  lachesis (lis) mutant, which forms supernumerary gametes at the expense of  adjacent accessory cells. LIS codes for the Arabidopsis homolog of the pre-mRNA  splicing factor PRP4 and shows a dynamic expression pattern in the maturing  female gametophyte. Here, we used LIS as a molecular tool to study cell-cell  communication in the female gametophyte. We show that reducing LIS transcript  amounts specifically in the egg cell, affects the development of all female  gametophytic cells, indicating that cell differentiation in the female  gametophyte is orchestrated by the egg cell. Among the defects observed is the  failure of homotypic nuclei fusion in the central cell and, as a consequence, a  block in endosperm formation. LIS-mediated egg cell signaling, thus, provides a  safeguard mechanism that prevents the formation of nurturing tissue in the  absence of a functional egg cell.', '2012 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.075234', 'Gross-Hardt']
