Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important genetically controlled mechanism used by many angiosperms to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding. A multiallelic S-locus allows discrimination between 'self' (incompatible) pollen from 'nonself' pollen at the pistil. Interaction of matching pollen and pistil S-determinants allows 'self' recognition and triggers rejection of incompatible pollen. The S-determinants for Papaver rhoeas (poppy) are PrsS and PrpS. PrsS is a small secreted protein that acts as a signalling ligand to interact with its cognate pollen S-determinant PrpS, a small novel transmembrane protein. Interaction of PrsS with incompatible pollen stimulates increases in cytosolic free Ca(2+) and involves influx of Ca(2+) and K(+). Data implicate involvement of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling in the SI response. Downstream targets include the cytoskeleton, a soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase, Pr-p26.1, and a MAP kinase, PrMPK9-1. A major focus for SI-induced signalling is to initiate programmed cell death (PCD). In this review we provide an overview of our understanding of SI, with focus on how the signals and components are integrated, in particular, how reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and the actin cytoskeleton feed into a PCD network. We also discuss our recent functional expression of PrpS in Arabidopsis thaliana pollen in the context of understanding how PCD signalling systems may have evolved.
