The use of the 13C : 12C isotopic ratio (delta13C) of leaf-respired CO2 to trace carbon fluxes in plants and ecosystems is limited by little information on temporal variations in delta13C of leaf dark-respired CO2 (delta13Cr) under field conditions. Here, we explored variability in delta13Cr and its relationship to key respiratory substrates from collections of leaf dark-respired CO2, carbohydrate extractions and gas exchange measurements over 24-h periods in two Quercus canopies. Throughout both canopies, delta13Cr became progressively 13C-enriched during the photoperiod, by up to 7%, then 13C-depleted at night relative to the photoperiod. This cycle could not be reconciled with delta13C of soluble sugars (delta13Css), starch (delta13Cst), lipids (delta13Cl), cellulose (delta13Cc) or with calculated photosynthetic discrimination (Delta). However, photoperiod progressive enrichment in delta13Cr was correlated with cumulative carbon assimilation (r2 = 0.91). We concluded that there is considerable short-term variation in delta13Cr in forest canopies, that it is consistent with current hypotheses for 13C fractionation during leaf respiration, that leaf carbohydrates cannot be used as surrogates for delta13Cr, and that diel changes in leaf carbohydrate status could be used to predict changes in delta13Cr empirically.
