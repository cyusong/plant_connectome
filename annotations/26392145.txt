['26392145', 'State transitions are an important photosynthetic short-term response that  maintains the excitation balance between photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). In  plants, when PSII is preferentially excited, LHCII, the main heterotrimeric light  harvesting complex of PSII, is phosphorylated by the STN7 kinase, detaches from  PSII and moves to PSI to equilibrate the relative absorption of the two  photosystems (State II). When PSI is preferentially excited LHCII is  dephosphorylated by the PPH1 (TAP38) phosphatase, and returns to PSII (State I).  Phosphorylation of LHCII that remain bound to PSII has also been observed.  Although the kinetics of LHCII phosphorylation are well known from a qualitative  standpoint, the absolute phosphorylation levels of LHCII (and its isoforms) bound  to PSI and PSII have been little studied. In this work we thoroughly investigated  the phosphorylation level of the Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 isoforms that compose LHCII in  PSI-LHCII and PSII-LHCII supercomplexes purified from WT and state transition  mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that, at most, 40% of the monomers that  make up PSI-bound LHCII trimers are phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was much  lower in PSII-bound LHCII trimers reaching only 15-20%. Dephosphorylation assays  using a recombinant PPH1 phosphatase allowed us to investigate the role of the  two isoforms during state transitions. Our results strongly suggest that a single  phosphorylated Lhcb2 is sufficient for the formation of the PSI-LHCII  supercomplex. These results are a step towards a refined model of the state  transition phenomenon and a better understanding of the short-term response to  changes in light conditions in plants.', '2015 Dec', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.09.005', 'Caffarri']
