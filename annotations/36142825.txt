<i>Fusarium</i> wilt caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (<i>Fol</i>) is a common disease that affects tomatoes, which can cause the whole plant to wilt and seriously reduce the production of tomatoes in greenhouses. In this study, the morphological indexes, photosynthetic performance and incidence rate of NSY50 under <i>Fol</i> infection were evaluated. It was found that NSY50 could improve the growth of tomato seedlings and significantly reduce the incidence rate of <i>Fusarium</i> wilt. However, the molecular mechanism of NSY50 that induces resistance to <i>Fusarium</i> wilt is still unclear. We used transcriptomic methods to analyze NSY50-induced resistance to <i>Fol</i> in tomatoes. The results showed that plant defense related genes, such as <i>PR</i> and <i>PAL</i>, were highly expressed in tomato seedlings pretreated with NSY50. At the same time, photosynthetic efficiency, sucrose metabolism, alkaloid biosynthesis and terpene biosynthesis were significantly improved, which played a positive role in reducing the damage caused by <i>Fol</i> infection and enhancing the disease tolerance of seedlings. Through transgenic validation, we identified an important tomato NAC transcription factor, <i>SlNAP1</i>, which was preliminarily confirmed to be effective in relieving the detrimental symptoms induced by <i>Fol</i>. Our findings reveal that <i>P. polymyxa</i> NSY50 is an effective plant-growth-promoting rhizosphere bacterium and also a biocontrol agent of soil-borne diseases, which can significantly improve the resistance of tomato to <i>Fusarium</i> wilt.
