['25902521', 'A broad range of parasites rely on the functions of effector proteins to subvert  host immune response and facilitate disease development. The notorious  Phytophthora pathogens evolved effectors with RNA silencing suppression activity  to promote infection in plant hosts. Here we report that the Phytophthora  Suppressor of RNA Silencing 1 (PSR1) can bind to an evolutionarily conserved  nuclear protein containing the aspartate-glutamate-alanine-histidine-box RNA  helicase domain in plants. This protein, designated PSR1-Interacting Protein 1  (PINP1), regulates the accumulation of both microRNAs and endogenous small  interfering RNAs in Arabidopsis. A null mutation of PINP1 causes embryonic  lethality, and silencing of PINP1 leads to developmental defects and  hypersusceptibility to Phytophthora infection. These phenotypes are reminiscent  of transgenic plants expressing PSR1, supporting PINP1 as a direct virulence  target of PSR1. We further demonstrate that the localization of the Dicer-like 1  protein complex is impaired in the nucleus of PINP1-silenced or PSR1-expressing  cells, indicating that PINP1 may facilitate small RNA processing by affecting the  assembly of dicing complexes. A similar function of PINP1 homologous genes in  development and immunity was also observed in Nicotiana benthamiana. These  findings highlight PINP1 as a previously unidentified component of RNA silencing  that regulates distinct classes of small RNAs in plants. Importantly,  Phytophthora has evolved effectors to target PINP1 in order to promote infection.', '2015 May 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1421475112', 'Ma']
