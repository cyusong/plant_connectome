Photosynthetic symptoms of acute Cd stress can be remedied by elevated Fe supply. To shed more light on the most important aspects of this recovery, the detailed Fe trafficking and accumulation processes as well as the changes in the status of the photosynthetic apparatus were investigated in recovering poplar plants. The Cd-free, Fe-enriched nutrient solution induced an immediate intensive Fe uptake. The increased Fe/Cd ratio in the roots initiated the translocation of Fe to the leaf with a short delay that ultimately led to the accumulation of Fe in the chloroplasts. The chloroplast Fe uptake was directly proportional to the Fe translocation to leaves. The accumulation of PSI reaction centers and the recovery of PSII function studied by Blue-Native PAGE and chlorophyll a fluorescence induction measurements, respectively, began in parallel to the increase in the Fe content of chloroplasts. The initial reorganization of PSII was accompanied by a peak in the antennae-based non-photochemical quenching. In conclusion, Fe accumulation of the chloroplasts is a process of prime importance in the recovery of photosynthesis from acute Cd stress.
