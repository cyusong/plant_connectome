['16028120', 'Golgins are a family of coiled-coil proteins that are associated with the Golgi  apparatus. They are necessary for tethering events in membrane fusion and may act  as structural support for Golgi cisternae. Here we report on the identification  of an Arabidopsis golgin which is a homologue of CASP, a known transmembrane  mammalian and yeast golgin. Similar to its homologues, the plant CASP contains a  long N-terminal coiled-coil region protruding into the cytosol and a C-terminal  transmembrane domain with amino acid residues which are highly conserved across  species. Through fluorescent protein tagging experiments, we show that plant CASP  localizes at the plant Golgi apparatus and that the C-terminus of this protein is  sufficient for its localization, as has been shown for its mammalian counterpart.  In addition, we demonstrate that the plant CASP is able to localize at the  mammalian Golgi apparatus. However, mutagenesis of a conserved tyrosine in the  transmembrane domain revealed that it is necessary for ER export and Golgi  localization of the Arabidopsis CASP in mammalian cells, but is not required for  its correct localization in plant cells. These data suggest that mammalian and  plant cells have different mechanisms for concentrating CASP in the Golgi  apparatus.', '2005 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-4618-4', 'Brandizzi']
