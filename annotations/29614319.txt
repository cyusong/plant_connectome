Understanding how plants respond to drought can benefit drought resistance (DR) breeding. Using a non-destructive phenotyping facility, 51 image-based traits (i-traits) for 507 rice accessions were extracted. These i-traits can be used to monitor drought responses and evaluate DR. High heritability and large variation of these traits was observed under drought stress in the natural population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of i-traits and traditional DR traits identified 470 association loci, some containing known DR-related genes. Of these 470 loci, 443 loci (94%) were identified using i-traits, 437 loci (93%) co-localized with previously reported DR-related quantitative trait loci, and 313 loci (66.6%) were reproducibly identified by GWAS in different years. Association networks, established based on GWAS results, revealed hub i-traits and hub loci. This demonstrates the feasibility and necessity of dissecting the complex DR trait into heritable and simple i-traits. As proof of principle, we illustrated the power of this integrated approach to identify previously unreported DR-related genes. OsPP15 was associated with a hub i-trait, and its role in DR was confirmed by genetic transformation experiments. Furthermore, i-traits can be used for DR linkage analyses, and 69 i-trait locus associations were identified by both GWAS and linkage analysis of a recombinant inbred line population. Finally, we confirmed the relevance of i-traits to DR in the field. Our study provides a promising novel approach for the genetic dissection and discovery of causal genes for DR.
