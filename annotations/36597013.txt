To screen candidate fungal genes that may relate to avirulence genes corresponding to the host resistance genes, we characterized two field isolates of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> that cause rice blast disease, especially in northeast China, and performed whole-genome resequencing of these two isolates. The genome assembly and annotation data was submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Our study unveils the predicted fungal effectors of two dominant <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates in northeast China, providing a resource for <i>Avr</i> genes to clone.
