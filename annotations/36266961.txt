Extensive mutational screening studies have documented genes regulating anther and pollen development. Knowledge concerning how formation of male germinal cell is arithmetically controlled in natural populations, under different environmental conditions, is lacking. We counted pollen number within a single anther and a maize-teosinte BC<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> recombinant inbred line population to identify ZmCCT10 as a major determinant of pollen number variation. ZmCCT10 was originally identified as a photoperiod-sensitive negative regulator of flowering. ZmCCT10 inactivation, after transposon insertion within its promoter, is proposed to have accelerated maize spread toward higher latitudes, thus allowing temperate maize to flower under long-day conditions. We showed that the active ZmCCT10 allele decreased pollen formation. As different active and inactive ZmCCT10 alleles have been found in natural maize populations, this represents the first report of a gene controlling pollen number in a crop natural population. These findings suggest that higher pollen number, which provides a competitive advantage in open-pollinated populations, may have been one of the major driving forces for the selection of an inactive ZmCCT10 allele during tropical maize domestication. We provide evidence that ZmCCT10 has opposite effects on cell proliferation of archesporial and tapetum cells and it modulates expression of key regulators during early anther development.
