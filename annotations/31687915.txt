<i>Monilinia laxa</i> is the causal agent of brown rot on stone fruit, and it can cause heavy yield losses during field production and postharvest storage. This article reports the draft genome assembly of the <i>M. laxa</i> Mlax316 strain, obtained using a hybrid genome assembly with both Illumina short-reads and PacBio long-reads sequencing technologies. The complete draft genome consists of 49 scaffolds with total size of 42.81 Mb, and scaffold N<sub>50</sub> of 2,449.4 kb. Annotation of the <i>M. laxa</i> assembly identified 11,163 genes and 12,424 proteins which were functionally annotated. This new genome draft improves current genomic resources available for <i>M. laxa</i> and represents a useful tool for further research into its interactions with host plants and into evolution in the <i>Monilinia</i> genus.
