A desiccation-tolerant cyanobacterium, Nostoc commune, shows unique responses to dehydration. These responses are: (i) loss of PSII activity in parallel with the loss of photosynthesis; (ii) loss of PSI activity; and (iii) dissipation of light energy absorbed by pigment-protein complexes. In this study, the deactivation of PSII is shown to be important in avoiding photoinhibition when the Calvin-Benson cycle is repressed by dehydration. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that dissipation of light energy absorbed by PSII blocks photoinhibition under strong light in dehydrated states.
