In the past 30 years enormous progress was made in plant membrane biology and transport physiology, a fact reflected in the appearance of textbooks. The first book dedicated to 'Membrane Transport in Plants' was published on the occasion of the 'International Workshop on Membrane Transport in Plants' held at the Nuclear Research Center, Jülich, Germany [Zimmermann and Dainty (eds) 1974] and was followed in 1976 by a related volume 'Transport in plants II' in the 'Encyclopedia of plant physiology' [Lüttge and Pitman (eds) 1976]. A broad spectrum of topics including thermodynamics of transport processes, water relations, primary reactions of photosynthesis, as well as more conventional aspects of membrane transport was presented. The aim of the editors of the first book was to bring advanced thermodynamical concepts to the attention of biologists and to show physical chemists and biophysicist what the more complex biological systems were like. To bundle known data on membrane transport in plants and relevant fields for mutual understanding, interdisciplinary research and clarification of problems were considered highly important for further progress in this scientific area of plant physiology. The present review will critically evaluate the progress in research in membrane transport in plants that was achieved during the past. How did 'Membrane Transport in Plants' progress within the 30 years between the publication of the first book about this topic (Zimmermann and Dainty 1974), a recent one with the same title (Blatt 2004), and today?
