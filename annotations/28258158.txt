['28258158', 'The influence of the histone variant H2A.Z on transcription remains a  long-standing conundrum. Here, by analyzing the actin-related protein6 mutant,  which is impaired in H2A.Z deposition, and by H2A.Z profiling in stress  conditions, we investigated the impact of this histone variant on gene expression  in Arabidopsis thaliana We demonstrate that the arp6 mutant exhibits anomalies in  response to osmotic stress. Indeed, stress-responsive genes are overrepresented  among those hyperactive in arp6. In wild-type plants, these genes exhibit high  levels of H2A.Z in the gene body. Furthermore, we observed that in  drought-responsive genes, levels of H2A.Z in the gene body correlate with  transcript levels. H2A.Z occupancy, but not distribution, changes in parallel  with transcriptional changes. In particular, we observed H2A.Z loss upon  transcriptional activation and H2A.Z gain upon repression. These data suggest  that H2A.Z has a repressive role in transcription and counteracts unwanted  expression in noninductive conditions. However, reduced activity of some genes in  arp6 is associated with distinct behavior of H2A.Z at their +1 nucleosome, which  exemplifies the requirement of this histone for transcription. Our data support a  model where H2A.Z in gene bodies has a strong repressive effect on transcription,  whereas in +1 nucleosomes, it is important for maintaining the activity of some  genes.', '2017 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00573', 'ORCID:']
