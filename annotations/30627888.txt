['30627888', 'Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain 13 (LBD13), which is expressed in emerged lateral  roots and encodes a transcriptional activator, plays an important role in lateral  root formation in Arabidopsis. Lateral roots (LRs) are major determinants of root  system architecture, contributing to the survival strategies of plants. Members  of the LBD gene family encode plant-specific transcription factors that play key  roles in plant organ development. Several LBD genes, such as LBD14, 16, 18, 29,  and 33, have been shown to play important roles in regulating LR development in  Arabidopsis. In the present study, we show that LBD13 is expressed in emerged LRs  and LR meristems of elongated LRs and regulates LR formation in Arabidopsis.  Transient gene expression assays with Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that LBD13  is localized to the nucleus and harbors transcription-activating potential.  Knock-down of LBD13 expression by RNA interference resulted in reduced LR  formation, whereas overexpression of LBD13 enhanced LR formation in transgenic  Arabidopsis. Analysis of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression under the control of  the LBD13 promoter showed that GUS staining was detected in LRs emerged from the  primary root, but not in LR primordia. Moreover, both the distribution of LR  primordium number and developmental kinetics of LR primordia were not affected  either by knock-down or by overexpression of LBD13. Taken together, these results  suggest that LBD13 is a nuclear-localized transcriptional activator and controls  LR formation during or after LR emergence.', '2019 Apr', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-018-03087-x', 'ORCID:']
