* Root respiration, stomatal conductance, leaf transpiration and photosynthetic rates were measured in phytotron and field-grown plants following the application of 5 or 10 nM lumichrome, 10 nM ABA (abscisic acid) and 10 ml of 0.2 OD600 infective rhizobial cells. * Providing soybean and cowpea roots with their respective homologous rhizobia and/or purified lumichrome increased the concentration of this molecule in xylem sap and leaf extracts. Relative to control, rhizobial inoculation and lumichrome application significantly increased root respiration in maize, decreased it in lupin, but had no effect on the other test species. * Applying either lumichrome (10 nM), infective rhizobial cells or ABA to roots of plants for 44 h in growth chambers altered leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration in cowpea, lupin, soybean, Bambara groundnut and maize, but not in pea or sorghum. Where stomatal conductance was increased by lumichrome application or rhizobial inoculation, it resulted in increased leaf transpiration relative to control plants. Treating roots of field plants of cowpea with this metabolite up to 63 d after planting showed decreased stomatal conductance, which affected CO2 intake and reduction by Rubisco. * The effect of rhizobial inoculation closely mirrored that of lumichrome application to roots, indicating that rhizobial effects on these physiological activities were most likely due to lumichrome released into the rhizosphere.
