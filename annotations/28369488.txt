Nitrogen (N) is frequently a limiting factor for tree growth and development. Because N availability is extremely low in forest soils, trees have evolved mechanisms to acquire and transport this essential nutrient along with biotic interactions to guarantee its strict economy. Here we review recent advances in the molecular basis of tree N nutrition. The molecular characteristics, regulation, and biological significance of membrane proteins involved in the uptake and transport of N are addressed. The regulation of N uptake and transport in mycorrhized roots and transcriptome-wide studies of N nutrition are also outlined. Finally, several areas of future research are suggested.

N: !limits! Tree Growth
Membrane Proteins: !involved in! N Uptake & Transport 
Mycorrhized Roots: !regulate! N Uptake & Transport 
Transcriptome-Wide Studies: !outline! N Nutrition
