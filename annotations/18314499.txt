['18314499', 'Tocopherols (vitamin E) are synthesized in plastids and have long been assumed to  have essential functions restricted to these organelles. We previously reported  that the vitamin e-deficient2 (vte2) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is defective  in transfer cell wall development and photoassimilate transport at low  temperature (LT). Here, we demonstrate that LT-treated vte2 has a distinct  composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): lower levels of linolenic  acid (18:3) and higher levels of linoleic acid (18:2) compared with the wild  type. Enhanced 18:3 oxidation was not involved, as indicated by the limited  differences in oxidized lipid species between LT-treated vte2 and the wild type  and by a lack of impact on the LT-induced vte2 phenotype in a vte2 fad3 fad7 fad8  quadruple mutant deficient in 18:3. PUFA changes in LT-treated vte2 occur  primarily in phospholipids due to reduced conversion of dienoic to trienoic fatty  acids in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway. Introduction of the ER fatty  acid desaturase mutation, fad2, and to a lesser extent the plastidic fad6  mutation into the vte2 background suppressed the LT-induced vte2 phenotypes,  including abnormal transfer cell wall development. These results provide  biochemical and genetic evidence that plastid-synthesized tocopherols modulate ER  PUFA metabolism early in the LT adaptation response of Arabidopsis.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054718', 'Dellapenna']
