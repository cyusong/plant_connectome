Plant hormones can adjust the physiology and development of plants to enhance their adaptation to biotic and abiotic challenges. Jasmonic acid (JA), one of the immunity hormones in plants, triggers genome-wide transcriptional changes in response to insect attack and wounding. Although JA is known to affect the development of trichomes, epidermal appendages that form a protective barrier against various stresses, it remains unclear how JA interacts with developmental programs that regulate trichome development. In this study, we show that JA affects trichome length in tomato by releasing the transcriptional repression mediated by Jasmonate ZIM (JAZ) proteins. We identified SlJAZ4, a negative regulator preferentially expressed in trichomes, as the critical component in JA signaling in tomato trichomes. We also identified a homeodomain-leucine zipper gene, SlHD8, as the downstream regulator of JA signaling that promotes trichome elongation. SlHD8 is also highly expressed in trichomes and physically interacts with SlJAZ4. Loss-of-function mutations in SlHD8 caused shorter trichomes, a phenotype that was only partially rescued by methyl jasmonate treatment. Our dual-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR assays revealed that SlHD8 regulates trichome elongation by directly binding to the promoters of a set of cell-wall-loosening protein genes and activating their transcription. Together, our findings define SlHD8-SlJAZ4 as a key module mediating JA-induced trichome elongation in tomato.
