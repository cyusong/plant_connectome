Starch metabolism is linked to plant growth, yet blocking its biosynthesis has species-specific consequences. In a new study, plastidial phosphoglucomutase is knocked out in aspen trees using CRISPR-Cas9, limiting starch production and altering photosynthesis, but growth, bud break and wood production proceed unaffected.
