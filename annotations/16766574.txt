Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key antioxidant enzyme present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells as a first line of defense against the accumulation of superoxide radicals. In olive leaves, the SOD enzymatic system was characterized and was found to be comprised of three isozymes, an Mn-SOD, an Fe-SOD and a CuZn-SOD. Transcript expression analysis of whole leaves showed that the three isozymes represented 82, 17 and 0.8% of the total SOD expressed, respectively. Using the combination of laser capture microdissection (LCM) and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the expression of these SOD isozymes was studied in different cell types of olive leaves, including spongy mesophyll, palisade mesophyll, xylem and phloem. In spongy mesophyll cells, the isozyme proportion was similar to that in whole leaves, but in the other cells the proportion of expressed SOD isozymes was different. In palisade mesophyll cells, Fe-SOD was the most abundant, followed by Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD, but in phloem cells Mn-SOD was the most prominent isozyme, and Fe-SOD was present in trace amounts. In xylem cells, only the Mn-SOD was detected. On the other hand, the highest accumulation of superoxide radicals was localized in vascular tissue which was the tissue with the lowest level of SOD transcripts. These data show that in olive leaves, each SOD isozyme has a different gene expression depending on the cell type of the leaf.
