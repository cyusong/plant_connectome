Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) are mainly involved in the activation of genes in response to heat stress as well as other abiotic and biotic stresses. The growth, development, reproduction, and yield of strawberry are strongly limited by extreme temperatures and droughts. In this study, we used Illumina sequencing and obtained transcriptome data set from <i>Fragaria × ananassa</i> Duchessne cv. Toyonoka. Six contigs and three unigenes were confirmed to encode HSF proteins (FaTHSFs). Subsequently, we characterized the biological functions of two particularly selected unigenes, <i>FaTHSFA2a</i> and <i>FaTHSFB1a</i>, which were classified into class A2 and B HSFs, respectively. Expression assays revealed that <i>FaTHSFA2a</i> and <i>FaTHSFB1a</i> expression was induced by heat shock and correlated well with elevated ambient temperatures. Overexpression of <i>FaTHSFA2a</i> and <i>FaTHSFB1a</i> resulted in the activation of their downstream stress-associated genes, and notably enhanced the thermotolerance of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants. Besides, both FaTHSFA2a and FaTHSFB1a fusion proteins localized in the nucleus, indicating their similar subcellular distributions as transcription factors. Our yeast one-hybrid assay suggested that FaTHSFA2a has trans-activation activity, whereas FaTHSFB1a expresses trans-repression function. Altogether, our annotated transcriptome sequences provide a beneficial resource for identifying most genes expressed in octoploid strawberry. Furthermore, HSF studies revealed the possible insights into the molecular mechanisms of thermotolerance, thus rendering valuable molecular breeding to improve the tolerance of strawberry in response to high-temperature stress.
