Soyasaponins are specialized metabolites present in soybean seeds that affect the taste and quality of soy-based foods. The composition of the sugar chains attached to the aglycone moiety of soyasaponins is regulated by genetic loci such as sg-1, sg-3 and sg-4. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Sg-3 gene, which is responsible for conjugating the terminal (third) glucose (Glc) at the C-3 sugar chain of soyasaponins. The gene Glyma.10G104700 is disabled in the sg-3 cultivar, 'Mikuriya-ao', due to the deletion of genomic DNA that results in the absence of a terminal Glc residue on the C-3 sugar chain. Sg-3 encodes a putative glycosyltransferase (UGT91H9), and its predicted protein sequence has a high homology with that of the product of GmSGT3 (Glyma.08G181000; UGT91H4), which conjugates rhamnose (Rha) to the third position of the C-3 sugar chain in vitro. A recombinant Glyma.10G104700 protein could utilize UDP-Glc as a substrate to conjugate the third Glc to the C-3 sugar chain, and introducing a functional Glyma.10G104700 transgene into the mutant complemented the sg-3 phenotype. Conversely, induction of a premature stop codon mutation in Glyma.10G104700 (W270*) resulted in the sg-3 phenotype, suggesting that Glyma.10G104700 was Sg-3. The gmsgt3 (R339H) mutant failed to accumulate soyasaponins with the third Rha at the C-3 sugar chain, and the third Glc and Rha conjugations were both disabled in the sg-3 gmsgt3 double mutant. These results demonstrated that Sg-3 and GmSGT3 are non-redundantly involved in conjugation of the third Glc and Rha at the C-3 sugar chain of soyasaponins, respectively.
