The delivery and expression of exogenous genes in plant cells have been of particular interest for plant research and biotechnology. Here, we present results demonstrating a simple DNA transfection system in plants. Short arginine-rich intracellular delivery peptide, a protein transduction domain, was capable of delivering plasmid DNA into living plant cells non-covalently. This peptide-mediated DNA delivery conferred several advantages, such as nuclear targeting, non-toxic effect, and ease of preparation without protoplast formulation. Thus, this novel technology shall provide a powerful tool to investigate gene function in vivo, and lay the foundation for the production of transgenic plants in future.
