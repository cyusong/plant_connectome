Saline-alkali stress is a major environmental stress affecting the growth and development of plants such as <i>Sorbus pohuashanensis.</i> Although ethylene plays a crucial role in plant response to saline-alkaline stress, its mechanism remains elusive. The mechanism of action of ethylene (ETH) may be related to the accumulation of hormones, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Ethephon is the exogenous ethylene donor. Therefore, for the present study we initially used different concentrations of ethephon (ETH) to treat <i>S. pohuashanensis</i> embryos and identified the best treatment concentration and method to promote the release of dormancy and the germination of <i>S. pohuashanensis</i> embryos. We then analyzed the physiological indexes, including endogenous hormones, ROS, antioxidant components, and reactive nitrogen, in embryos and seedlings to elucidate the mechanism via which ETH manages stress. The analysis showed that 45 mg/L was the best concentration of ETH to relieve the embryo dormancy. ETH at this concentration improved the germination of <i>S. pohuashanensis</i> by 183.21% under saline-alkaline stress; it also improved the germination index and germination potential of the embryos. Further analysis revealed that ETH treatment increased the levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), gibberellin (GA), soluble protein, nitric oxide (NO), and glutathione (GSH); increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), nitrate reductase (NR), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS); and decreased the levels of abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide anion, and malondialdehyde (MDA) of <i>S. pohuashanensis</i> under saline-alkali stress. These results indicate that ETH mitigates the inhibitory effects of saline-alkali stress and provides a theoretical basis by which to establish precise control techniques for the release of seed dormancy of tree species.
