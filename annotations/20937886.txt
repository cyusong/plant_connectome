['20937886', 'Posttranslational modifications of histones play important roles in modulating  chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. We have previously shown that  more than two thirds of Arabidopsis genes contain histone H3 methylation at  lysine 4 (H3K4me) and that trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3) is preferentially  located at actively transcribed genes. In addition, several Arabidopsis mutants  with locus-specific loss of H3K4me have been found to display various  developmental abnormalities. These findings suggest that H3K4me3 may play  important roles in maintaining the normal expression of a large number of genes.  However, the major enzyme(s) responsible for H3K4me3 has yet to be identified in  plants, making it difficult to address questions regarding the mechanisms and  functions of H3K4me3. Here we described the characterization of SET DOMAIN GROUP  2 (SDG2), a large Arabidopsis protein containing a histone lysine  methyltransferase domain. We found that SDG2 homologs are highly conserved in  plants and that the Arabidopsis SDG2 gene is broadly expressed during  development. In addition, the loss of SDG2 leads to severe and pleiotropic  phenotypes, as well as the misregulation of a large number of genes. Consistent  with our finding that SDG2 is a robust and specific H3K4 methyltransferase in  vitro, the loss of SDG2 leads to a drastic decrease in H3K4me3 in vivo. Taken  together, these results suggest that SDG2 is the major enzyme responsible for  H3K4me3 in Arabidopsis and that SDG2-dependent H3K4m3 is critical for regulating  gene expression and plant development.', '2010 Oct 26', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1010478107', 'Zhang']
