Many plants have been known for centuries to have medicinal importance with potential beneficial effects on health. Phytotherapeutic compounds are well known to play a globally significant role, in particular in the management and treatment of various chronic diseases. Among these, diabetes can cause long term damage to the body other than having a relevant economic burden on society being among the costliest chronic diseases. This motivated the focus of the proposed Special Issue, intended to develop and exploit the potential role of plants in the management and treatment of diabetes. The main topics included are: (i) description and use of medicinal plants for diabetes management; (ii) the elucidation and delineation of their main components, properties (anti-hyperglycaemic, hypoglicaemic, anti-infiammatory, apoptotic agents, etc.), (iii) the mechanism of action (in vitro and in vivo studies); (iv) formulation of nutraceuticals, botanicals, and dietary supplements useful as tools as an alternative or support to anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies; (v) development of new markers.
