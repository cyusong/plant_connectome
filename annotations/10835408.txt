['10835408', 'The short integuments 2 (sin2) mutation arrests cell division during integument  development of the Arabidopsis ovule and also has subtle pleiotropic effects on  both sepal and pistil morphology. Genetic interactions between sin2 and other  ovule mutations show that cell division, directionality of growth, and cell  expansion represent at least partially independent processes during integument  development. Double-mutant analyses also reveal that SIN2 shares functional  redundancy with HUELLENLOS in ovule primordium outgrowth and proximal-distal  patterning and with TSO1 in promotion of normal morphological development of the  four whorls of primary floral organs. All of these observations are consistent  with SIN2 being a promoter of growth and cell division during reproductive  development, with a primary role in these processes during integument  development. On the basis of the floral pleiotropic effects observed in a  majority of ovule mutants, including sin2, we postulate a relationship between  ovule genes and the evolutionary origin of some processes regulating flower  morphology.', '2000 Jun', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/155.2.899', 'Gasser']
