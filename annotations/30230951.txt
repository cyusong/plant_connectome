Exposure of Arabidopsis leaves to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) results in the selective nitration of specific proteins, such as PsbO1. The 9th tyrosine residue (<sup>9</sup>Tyr) of PsbO1 has been identified as the nitration site. This nitration is triggered by light and inhibited by photosynthetic electron transport inhibitors. During protein nitration, tyrosyl and NO<sub>2</sub> radicals are formed concurrently and combine rapidly to form 3-nitrotyrosine. A selective oxidation mechanism for <sup>9</sup>Tyr of PsbO1 is required. We postulated that, similar to <sup>161</sup>Tyr of D1, <sup>9</sup>Tyr of PsbO1 is selectively photo-oxidized by photosynthetic electron transport in response to illumination to a tyrosyl radical. In corroboration, after reappraising our oxygen evolution analysis, the nitration of PsbO1 proved responsible for decreased oxygen evolution from the thylakoid membranes. NO<sub>2</sub> is reportedly taken into cells as nitrous acid, which dissociates to form NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> may be oxidized into NO<sub>2</sub> by the oxygen-evolving complex. Light may synchronize this reaction with tyrosyl radical formation. These findings suggest a novel role for PsbO1 in photosynthetic electron transport.
