Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) serve as specific cues to higher trophic levels. Novel, exotic herbivores entering native foodwebs may disrupt the infochemical network as a result of changes in HIPV profiles. Here, we analysed HIPV blends of native Brassica rapa plants infested with one of 10 herbivore species with different coexistence histories, diet breadths and feeding modes. Partial least squares (PLS) models were fitted to assess whether HIPV blends emitted by Dutch B. rapa differ between native and exotic herbivores, between specialists and generalists, and between piercing-sucking and chewing herbivores. These models were used to predict the status of two additional herbivores. We found that HIPV blends predicted the evolutionary history, diet breadth and feeding mode of the herbivore with an accuracy of 80% or higher. Based on the HIPVs, the PLS models reliably predicted that Trichoplusia ni and Spodoptera exigua are perceived as exotic, leaf-chewing generalists by Dutch B. rapa plants. These results indicate that there are consistent and predictable differences in HIPV blends depending on global herbivore characteristics, including coexistence history. Consequently, native organisms may be able to rapidly adapt to potentially disruptive effects of exotic herbivores on the infochemical network.
