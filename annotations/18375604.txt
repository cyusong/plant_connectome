Changes in nuclear DNA content and cell size of adaxial and abaxial epidermal pavement cells were investigated using bright light-induced leaf expansion of Phaseolus vulgaris plants. In primary leaves of bean plants grown under high (sunlight) or moderate (ML; photon flux density, 163 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) light, most adaxial epidermal pavement cells had a nucleus with the 4C amount of DNA, whereas most abaxial pavement cells had a 2C nucleus. In contrast, plants grown under low intensity white light (LL; 15 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) for 13 d, when cell proliferation of epidermal pavement cells had already finished, had a 2C nuclear DNA content in most adaxial pavement cells. When these LL-grown plants were transferred to ML, the increase in irradiance raised the frequency of 4C nuclei in adaxial but not in abaxial pavement cells within 4 d. On the other hand, the size of abaxial pavement cells increased by 53% within 4 d of transfer to ML and remained unchanged thereafter, whereas adaxial pavement cells continuously enlarged for 12 d. This suggests that the increase in adaxial cell size after 4 d is supported by the nuclear DNA doubling. The different responses between adaxial and abaxial epidermal cells were not induced by the different light intensity at both surfaces. It was shown that adaxial epidermal cells have a different property than abaxial ones.
