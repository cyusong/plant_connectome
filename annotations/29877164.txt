The type 2A protein phosphatases (PP2As) are holoenzymes in all eukaryotes but their activators remain unknown in filamentous fungi. Fusarium graminearum contains three PP2As (FgPp2A, FgSit4, and FgPpg1), which play critical roles in fungal growth, development, and virulence. Here, we identified two PP2A activators (PTPAs), FgRrd1 and FgRrd2, and found that they control PP2A activity in a PP2A-specific manner. FgRrd1 interacts with FgPpg1, but FgRrd2 interacts with FgPp2A and very weakly with FgSit4. Furthermore, FgRrd2 activates FgPp2A via regulating FgPp2A methylation. Phenotypic assays showed that FgRrd1 and FgRrd2 regulate mycelial growth, conidiation, sexual development, and lipid droplet biogenesis. More importantly, both FgRrd1 and FgRrd2 interact with RNA polymerase II, subsequently modulating its enrichments at the promoters of mycotoxin biosynthesis genes, which is independent on PP2A. In addition, FgRrd2 modulates response to phenylpyrrole fungicide, via regulating the phosphorylation of kinase FgHog1 in the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway, and to caffeine, via modulating FgPp2A methylation. Taken together, results of this study indicate that FgRrd1 and FgRrd2 regulate multiple physiological processes via different regulatory mechanisms in F. graminearum, which provides a novel insight into understanding the biological functions of PTPAs in fungi.
