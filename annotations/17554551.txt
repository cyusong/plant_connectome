In the tip-growing filamentous cell of the xanthophycean alga Vaucheria terrestris sensu Götz, a new growing tip develops in the non-growing, cylindrical region of the cell that was exposed by local illumination. The present study examined changes in the strength and extensibility of the cell wall of the new growing tip and in the matrix components of the inner surface of the cell wall. The internal pressure required to rupture the cell walls decreased remarkably during the early to middle stages of growing tip development, but the cell wall hardly extended before rupture. In contrast, during the middle and late stages of development, cell walls were extended by internal pressure. Atomic force microscopy revealed that protease-resistant, fine granular matrix components were present only at the apical portion of a normal growing tip, and were absent in the non-growing cylindrical region. In the early and middle stages of new growing tip development, these matrix components appeared in the cell walls in patches. These results suggest that first cell wall strength decreases and then cell wall extensibility increases in the development of new growing tips, and that protease-resistant, fine granular matrix components may be involved in rendering a cell wall extensible.
