The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) comprise one of the largest gene families in plants, and participate in various physiological processes, but the physiological role and regulatory function of the majority of bHLHs remain poorly understood. Here, a total of 56 putative CsbHLH genes were identified in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) based on a genome-wide analysis. The CsbHLH genes, except four members, were distributed throughout nine chromosomes and divided into 19 subgroups. Most of the CsbHLH genes were responsive to cold stress, with the greatest up-regulation being observed in CsbHLH18. CsbHLH18 is localized in the nuclei and has transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of CsbHLH18 conferred enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic tobacco. The transgenic plants accumulated significantly less reactive oxygen species (ROS), concurrent with increased activities and transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes. In contrast, knockdown of bHLH18 by RNAi in trifoliate orange promoted cold susceptibility, accompanied by down-regulation of antioxidant genes and accumulation of more ROS. Protein-DNA interaction assays demonstrate that CsbHLH18 directly and specifically binds to and activates the promoter of CsPOD. Taken together, these findings indicate that CsbHLH18 plays a positive role in cold tolerance through, at least partly, modulation of ROS homeostasis by directly regulating the antioxidant gene.
