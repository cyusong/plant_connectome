Respiratory metabolism includes the reactions of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, but is also directly linked with many other metabolic pathways such as protein and lipid biosynthesis and photosynthesis via photorespiration. Furthermore, any change in respiratory activity can impact the redox status of the cell and the production of reactive oxygen species. In this review, it is discussed how respiration is regulated and what alternative pathways are known that increase the metabolic flexibility of this vital metabolic process. By looking at the adaptive responses of respiration to hypoxia or changes in the oxygen availability of a cell, the integration of regulatory responses of various pathways is illustrated.
