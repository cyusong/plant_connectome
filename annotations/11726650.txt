['11726650', 'This study characterizes the expression and functional significance of the member  of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family At2-MMP from Arabidopsis. By  transcript analysis, expression of At2-MMP was found in leaves and roots of  juvenile Arabidopsis and leaves, roots, and inflorescences of mature flowering  plants showing strong increase of transcript abundance with aging. Cell  specificity of expression of At2-MMP was studied by in situ hybridizations in  leaves and flowers of Arabidopsis. In leaves, the gene was expressed in the  phloem, in developing xylem elements, epidermal cells, and neighboring mesophyll  cell layers. In flowers, signals were localized in pistils, ovules, and  receptacles. In an Arabidopsis mutant (at2-mmp-1) carrying a tDNA insertion in  At2-MMP, neither germination nor development of plants was modified in comparison  to the wild type in the juvenile rosette stage. Starting with the onset of  shoots, growth of roots, leaves, and shoots was inhibited compared with the wild  type, and the plants were characterized by late flowering. Besides the flowering,  at2-mmp-1 plants showed fast degradation of chlorophyll in leaves and early  senescence. These results demonstrate the involvement of At2-MMP in plant growth,  morphogenesis, and development with particular relevance for flowering and  senescence.', '2002 Feb 15', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M106197200', 'Dietz']
