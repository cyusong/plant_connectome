Nearly 200 plant genomes have been sequenced over the last two years, and new functions of plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have been revealed. Therefore, timely update of the plant miRNA databases by incorporating miRNAs from the newly sequenced species and functional information is required to provide useful resources for advancing plant miRNA research. Here we report the update of PmiREN2.0 (https://pmiren.com/) with an addition of 19 363 miRNA entries from 91 plants, doubling the amount of data in the original version. Meanwhile, abundant regulatory information centred on miRNAs was added, including predicted upstream transcription factors through binding motifs scanning and elaborate annotation of miRNA targets. As an example, a genome-wide regulatory network centred on miRNAs was constructed for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees of conserved miRNA families were built to expand the understanding of miRNA evolution across the plant lineages. These data are helpful to deduce the regulatory relationships concerning miRNA functions in diverse plants. Beside the new data, a suite of design tools was incorporated to facilitate experimental practice. Finally, a forum named 'PmiREN Community' was added for discussion and resource and new discovery sharing. With these upgrades, PmiREN2.0 should serve the community better and accelerate miRNA research in plants.
