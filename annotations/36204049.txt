Cysteine-rich poly comb-like protein (<i>CPP</i>) is a member of cysteine-rich transcription factors that regulates plant growth and development. In the present work, we characterized twelve <i>CPP</i> transcription factors encoding genes in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Phylogenetic analyses classified <i>CPP</i> genes into six clades. Sequence logos analyses between <i>G. max</i> and <i>G. soja</i> amino acid residues exhibited high conservation. The presence of growth and stress-related <i>cis</i>-acting elements in the upstream regions of <i>GmCPPs</i> highlight their role in plant development and tolerance against abiotic stress. <i>Ka/Ks</i> levels showed that <i>GmCPPs</i> experienced limited selection pressure with limited functional divergence arising from segmental or whole genome duplication events. By using the PAN-genome of soybean, a single nucleotide polymorphism was identified in <i>GmCPP-6</i>. To perform high throughput genotyping, a kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) marker was developed. Association analyses indicated that <i>GmCPP-6-T</i> allele of <i>GmCPP-6</i> (in exon region) was associated with higher thousand seed weight under both water regimes (well-water and water-limited). Taken together, these results provide vital information to further decipher the biological functions of <i>CPP</i> genes in soybean molecular breeding.
