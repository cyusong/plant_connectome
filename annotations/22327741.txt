['22327741', 'Plant cells are encased by a cellulose-containing wall that is essential for  plant morphogenesis. Cellulose consists of beta-1,4-linked glucan chains assembled  into paracrystalline microfibrils that are synthesized by plasma membrane-located  cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes. Associations with hemicelluloses are  important for microfibril spacing and for maintaining cell wall tensile strength.  Several components associated with cellulose synthesis have been identified;  however, the biological functions for many of them remain elusive. We show that  the chitinase-like (CTL) proteins, CTL1/POM1 and CTL2, are functionally  equivalent, affect cellulose biosynthesis, and are likely to play a key role in  establishing interactions between cellulose microfibrils and hemicelluloses.  CTL1/POM1 coincided with CESAs in the endomembrane system and was secreted to the  apoplast. The movement of CESAs was compromised in ctl1/pom1 mutant seedlings,  and the cellulose content and xyloglucan structures were altered. X-ray analysis  revealed reduced crystalline cellulose content in ctl1 ctl2 double mutants,  suggesting that the CTLs cooperatively affect assembly of the glucan chains,  which may affect interactions between hemicelluloses and cellulose. Consistent  with this hypothesis, both CTLs bound glucan-based polymers in vitro. We propose  that the apoplastic CTLs regulate cellulose assembly and interaction with  hemicelluloses via binding to emerging cellulose microfibrils.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.094672', 'Persson']
