Delftia sp. strain JD2 is a betaproteobacterium characterized as a plant growth-promoting bacterium with a 'helper' function, enhancing the performance of rhizobial inoculant strains during the coinoculation of alfalfa and clover. In this work we analyzed i) the effect of the coinoculation with Bradyrhizobium elkanii and Delftia sp. strain JD2 strains on the performance of soybean plants and ii) the production of a few secondary plant metabolites that would explain the positive effect of coinoculation on the growth and development of soybean plants. The results showed a beneficial effect of coinoculation on soybean growth, nodulation rate, and pulse yield, with the concomitant benefit for the agricultural economy. In addition, based on a metabolomics approach, we demonstrated that a different pattern of plant metabolites is being produced at different stages of plant growth. The new information suggests that the coinoculation of soybean changes the primary and secondary metabolism of the plant, including changes in the metabolic status of main and secondary nodules within the plant. The relevance of producing a different pattern of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments, flavonoids, organic acids, and carbohydrates are discussed. Finally, we propose that JD2 could be used together with bradyrhizobia to manipulate the chemical composition of plant tissues, promoting the nutritional benefits and health of soybean.
