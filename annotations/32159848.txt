DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that regulates multiple processes, such as gene expression and genome stability. Mutants and pharmacological treatments have been instrumental in the study of this mark in plants, although their genome-wide effect complicates the direct association between changes in methylation and a particular phenotype. A variety of tools that allow locus-specific manipulation of DNA methylation can be used to assess its direct role in specific processes, as well as to create novel epialleles. Recently, new tools that recruit the methylation machinery directly to target loci through programmable DNA-binding proteins have expanded the tool kit available to researchers. This review provides an overview of DNA methylation in plants and discusses the tools that have recently been developed for its manipulation.
