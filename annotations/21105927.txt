['21105927', 'The green peach aphid (GPA) (Myzus persicae Sulzer) is an important sap-sucking  pest of a large variety of plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis  utilizes a combination of defenses that deter insects from settling on the plant,  limit insect feeding and curtail insect reproduction. We demonstrate that the  previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis MPL1 (MYZUS PERSICAE-INDUCED LIPASE1) gene  has an important role in defense against the GPA. MPL1 expression was rapidly  induced to high level in GPA-infested plants. Furthermore, the GPA population was  larger on the mpl1 mutant than the wild-type (WT) plant. In contrast,  constitutive over-expression of MPL1 from the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S gene  promoter curtailed the size of the GPA population. Insect settling and feeding  behavior were unaffected on the mpl1 mutant. However, compared with the  phloem-sap enriched petiole exudate from the WT plant, mpl1 petiole exudate was  deficient in an activity that restricts insect reproduction on a synthetic diet.  Furthermore, MPL1 was required for the heightened accumulation of an antibiotic  activity in petiole exudate of the Arabidopsis ssi2 mutant, which exhibits  enhanced resistance to GPA. These results indicate that MPL1 has an essential  function in antibiosis against GPA. The MPL1 protein exhibits homology to lipases  and recombinant MPL1 has lipase activity, thus suggesting that a MPL1-dependent  lipid, or a product thereof, has an important role in antibiosis against GPA.', '2010 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04378.x', 'Shah']
