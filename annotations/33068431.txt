Photosystems possess distinct fluorescence emissions at low (77K) temperature. PSI emits in the long-wavelength region at ~710-740 nm. In diatoms, a successful clade of marine primary producers, the contribution of PSI-associated emission (710-717 nm) has been shown to be relatively small. However, in the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the source of the long-wavelength emission at ~710 nm (F710) remains controversial. Here, we addressed the origin and modulation of F710 fluorescence in this alga grown under continuous and intermittent light. The latter condition led to a strong enhancement in F710. Biochemical and spectral properties of the photosynthetic complexes isolated from thylakoid membranes were investigated for both culture conditions. F710 emission appeared to be associated with PSI regardless of light acclimation. To further assess whether PSII could also contribute to this emission, we decreased the concentration of PSII reaction centres and core antenna by growing cells with lincomycin, a chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor. The treatment did not diminish F710 fluorescence. Our data suggest that F710 emission originates from PSI under the conditions tested and is enhanced in intermittent light-grown cells due to increased energy flow from the FCP antenna to PSI.
