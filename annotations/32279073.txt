Plant nitrogen (N), acquired mainly in the form of nitrate and ammonium from soil, dominates growth and development, and high-yield crop production relies heavily on N fertilization. The mechanisms of root adaptation to altered supply of N forms and concentrations have been well characterized and reviewed, while reports concerning the effects of N on the architecture of vegetative and reproductive organs are limited and are widely dispersed in the literature. In this review, we summarize the nitrate and amino acid regulation of shoot branching, flowering, and panicle development, as well as the N regulation of cell division and expansion in shaping plant architecture, mainly in cereal crops. The basic regulatory steps involving the control of plant architecture by the N supply are auxin-, cytokinin-, and strigolactone-controlled cell division in shoot apical meristem and gibberellin-controlled inverse regulation of shoot height and tillering. In addition, transport of amino acids has been shown to be involved in the control of shoot branching. The N supply may alter the timing and duration of the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive growth phase, which in turn may affect cereal crop architecture, particularly the structure of panicles for grain yield. Thus, proper manipulation of N-regulated architecture can increase crop yield and N use efficiency.
