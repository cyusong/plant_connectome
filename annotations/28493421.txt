Concluding remarks 941 Acknowledgements 941 References 941 SUMMARY: Proteolysis is a central regulatory mechanism of protein homeostasis and protein function that affects all aspects of plant life. Higher plants encode for hundreds of proteases, but their physiological substrates and hence their molecular functions remain mostly unknown. Current quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables unbiased large-scale interrogation of the proteome and its modifications. Here we provide an overview of proteomics techniques that allow profiling of changes in protein abundance, measurement of proteome turnover rates, identification of protease cleavage sites in vivo and in vitro and determination of protease sequence specificity. We discuss how these techniques can help to reveal protease substrates and determine plant protease function, illustrated by recent studies on selected plant proteases.
