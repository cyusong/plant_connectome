Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of stripe rust, is a destructive pathogen of Triticum aestivum (wheat), threatening wheat production worldwide. Pst delivers hundreds of effectors to manipulate processes in its hosts during infection. The SGT1 (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1), RAR1 (required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (heat-shock protein 90) proteins form a chaperone complex that acts as a core modulator in plant immunity. However, little is known about how Pst effectors target this immune component to suppress plant immunity. Here, we identified a Pst effector PstSIE1 that interacts with TaSGT1 in wheat and is upregulated during the early infection stage. Transient expression of PstSIE1 suppressed cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana induced by VmE02 and PcNLP2. Transgenic expression of PstSIE1-RNAi constructs in wheat significantly reduced the virulence of Pst. Overexpression of PstSIE1 in wheat increased the number of rust pustules and reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating that PstSIE1 functions as an important pathogenicity factor in Pst. PstSIE1 was found to compete with TaRAR1 to bind TaSGT1, thus disrupting the formation of the TaRAR1-TaSGT1 subcomplex. Taken together, PstSIE1 is an important Pst effector targeting the immune component TaSGT1 and involved in suppressing wheat defense.
