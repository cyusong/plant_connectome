Although bacterial host colonization is a dynamic process that requires population growth, studies often focus on comparing bacterial populations at a given time point. However, this may not reflect the dynamics of the colonization process. Time-course assays provide important insights into the dynamics of host colonization but are laborious and may still lack resolution for immediate processes affecting populations. An alternative way to address this issue, using widely accessible tools (such as quantitative PCR [qPCR]), is to take advantage of the relationship between bacterial chromosomal replication and cell division to determine population growth status at the sampling time. Conceptually, the ratio between the number of copies at the origin of replication and that at the terminus of replication should be correlated with the measured bacterial growth rate. This peak-to-trough ratio (PTR) to estimate instantaneous population growth status was tested with the slow-growing plant-pathogenic bacterium <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>. We found no correlation between PTR and the measured growth rate when using genome-level data but overall sequencing depth of coverage trends matched theoretical expectations. On the other hand, the population growth status of <i>X. fastidiosa</i> was predicted by PTR when using qPCR data, which was improved by the pretreatment of cells with a photoreactive DNA-binding dye. Our results suggest that PTR could be used to determine <i>X. fastidiosa</i> growth status both in planta and in insect vectors. We expect PTR will perform better with fast-growing bacterial pathogens, potentially becoming a powerful tool for easily and quickly assessing population growth status.
