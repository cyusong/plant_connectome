Improving the agronomic use of recycled nutrients derived from organic waste is one of the priorities within the measures adopted by the European community to reduce environmental issues but remains an unexplored area of research. This study focused on investigating the possibility of using innovative fertilizer solutions in hydroponic systems for the growth of agricultural plants. To this purpose, a liquid fraction [aqueous hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) liquid (AHL)] derived from HTC of cow manure digestate was chemically characterized (pH, electrical conductivity, mineral elements, and organic compounds such as phytotoxins), diluted with distilled water (1:30, 1:60, and 1:90, v/v) to reduce its potential phytotoxicity, and used to grow hydroponic maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) plants instead of the classical full-strength nutrient solution. The results indicated that the dilution ratio 1:30 of the AHL solution maintained a high level of toxicity for the plants (phytotoxic substances, especially Na and alkalinity), inducing the arrest of their growth. Differently, the two other dilution ratios (i.e., 1:60 and 1:90) seemed to considerably limit the levels of toxicity, since they allowed the plants to develop. However, these dilution ratios were poor in nutrient elements, inducing alteration in photosynthesis and an onset of deficiency symptoms such as pronounced leaf chlorosis. In view of an eco-friendly approach, future studies are, therefore, needed to identify the correct species-specific dilution ratio to supply both low levels of phytotoxins and adequate content of essential nutrients for appropriate plant growth and development. Furthermore, in order to lower specific Na phytotoxicity, treatments are of utmost importance before using AHL as a fertilizer solution.
