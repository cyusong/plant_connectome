<i>Pyrenophora teres</i> f. <i>teres</i> is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen and causal agent of net form net blotch (NFNB), a significant disease of barley. RNA-seq data encompassing asymptomatic and subsequent necrotrophic phases of the pathogen was obtained for <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>teres</i> isolate W1-1 in NFNB-sensitive cultivar Baudin. Host genes notably regulated during infection included concerted induction of over half the repertoire of disease resistance genes, together with genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes, characteristic of a hypersensitive response. Several systemic acquired resistance response genes were suppressed and there was a complete absence of defense-related thionin gene expression. In <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>teres</i>, genes involved in hydrolase activities and cell-wall catabolic processes were induced during infection, while nitrate assimilation and response to oxidative stress processes were suppressed. Timecourse data allowed a number of predicted <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>teres</i> effector genes with differing expression profiles to be identified that may underlie barley sensitivity to NFNB. Candidate genes involved in the host-pathogen interaction provide a basis for functional characterization and control strategies based on fungicide or mutation targets, which will facilitate further research aimed at controlling NFNB disease.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
