Although flavonoids play multiple roles in plant growth and development, the involvement in plant self-incompatibility (SI) have not been reported. In this research, the fertility of transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> dihydroflavonol 4-reductase gene, <i>GbDFR6</i>, were investigated. To explore the possible physiological defects leading to the failure of embryo development in transgenic tobacco plants, functions of pistils and pollen grains were examined. Transgenic pistils pollinated with pollen grains from another tobacco plants (either transgenic or wild-type), developed full of well-developed seeds. In contrast, in self-pollinated transgenic tobacco plants, pollen-tube growth was arrested in the upper part of the style, and small abnormal seeds developed without fertilization. Although the mechanism remains unclear, our research may provide a valuable method to create SI tobacco plants for breeding.
