The underlying mechanisms that determine whether two species can form a successful graft union (graft compatibility) remain obscure. Two prominent hypotheses are (1) the more closely related species are, the higher the graft success and (2) the vascular anatomy at the graft junction influences graft success. In this paper these two hypotheses are examined in a systematic way using graft combinations selected from a range of (a) phylogenetically close and more distant legume species, (b) species displaying different germination patterns and (c) scions and rootstocks possessing contrasting stem tissues and vascular patterns. Relatedness of species was not a good predictor of graft compatibility, as vascular reconnection can occur between distantly related species and can fail to occur in some more closely related species. Similarly, neither the stem tissues present at the graft junction nor the vascular anatomy correlated with the success of vascular reconnection. Relatedness and stem anatomy therefore do not appear to be the determining factors in successful vascular reconnection after grafting in legumes. These results are discussed in conjunction with other hypotheses such as the role of auxin.

Relatedness: !not a good predictor of! graft compatibility
Vascular anatomy: !does not correlate with! success of vascular reconnection
