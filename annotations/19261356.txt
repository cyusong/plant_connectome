Senescence of tobacco leaves is distributed non-uniformly over a leaf blade. While photosynthetic competence and expression of photosynthesis-associated genes decline in interveinal areas of the leaf lamina with advancing age of the leaf, they are maintained at high levels in the tissue surrounding the veins. In contrast, expression of senescence-associated genes (SAG) was enhanced in both areas of the leaf blade. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide was shown to precede the phase of senescence initiation in the veinal tissue. In the interveinal tissue, the level of hydrogen peroxide was increased with senescence progression and paralleled by an increase in the level of superoxide anions. It is hypothesized that the spatial differences in superoxide anions are important for the non-uniform down-regulation of photosynthesis-associated genes (PAG), while hydrogen peroxide is responsible for up-regulation of SAG.
