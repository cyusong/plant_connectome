The number of known proteins associated with plant lipid droplets (LDs) is small compared with other organelles. Many aspects of LD biosynthesis and degradation are unknown, and identifying and characterizing candidate LD proteins could help elucidate these processes. Here, we analyzed the proteome of LD-enriched fractions isolated from tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) pollen tubes. Proteins that were highly enriched in comparison with the total or cytosolic fraction were further tested for LD localization via transient expression in pollen tubes. One of these proteins, PLANT UBX DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN10 (PUX10), is a member of the plant UBX domain-containing (PUX) protein family. This protein localizes to LDs via a unique hydrophobic polypeptide sequence and can recruit the AAA-type ATPase CELL DIVISION CYCLE48 (CDC48) protein via its UBX domain. PUX10 is conserved in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and expressed in embryos, pollen tubes, and seedlings. In <i>pux10</i> knockout mutants in Arabidopsis, LD size is significantly increased. Proteomic analysis of <i>pux10</i> mutants revealed a delayed degradation of known LD proteins, some of which possessed ubiquitination sites. We propose that PUX10 is involved in a protein degradation pathway at LDs, mediating an interaction between polyubiquitinated proteins targeted for degradation and downstream effectors such as CDC48.
