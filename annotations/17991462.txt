['17991462', 'EFFECTORS OF TRANSCRIPTION2 (ET) are plant-specific regulatory proteins  characterized by the presence of two to five C-terminal DNA- and Zn-binding  repeats, and a highly conserved cysteine pattern. We describe the structural  characterization of the three member Arabidopsis thaliana ET gene family and  reveal some allelic sequence polymorphisms. A mutation analysis showed that AtET2  affects the expression of various KNAT genes involved in the maintenance of the  undifferentiated state of cambial meristem cells. It also plays a role in the  regulation of GA5 (gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase) and the cell-cycle-related  GASA4. A correlation was established between AtET2 expression and the cellular  differentiation state. AtET-GFP fusion proteins shuttle between the cytoplasm and  nucleus, with the AtET2 product prevented from entering the nucleus in  non-differentiating cells. Within the nucleus, AtET2 probably acts via a single  strand cutting domain. A more general regulatory role for ET factors is proposed,  governing cell differentiation in cambial meristems, a crucial process for the  development of plant vascular tissues.', '2008 Jan 1', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.09.061', 'Baumlein']
