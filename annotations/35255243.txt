Autophagy is a conserved system from yeast to mammals that mediates the degradation and renovation of cellular components. This process is mainly driven by numerous autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. Among these components, the ATG1/ATG13 complex plays an essential role in initiating autophagy, sensing nutritional status signals, recruiting downstream ATG proteins to the autophagosome formation site, and governing autophagosome formation. In this review, we will focus on the ATG1/ATG13 kinase complex, summarizing and discussing the current views on the composition, structure, function, and regulation of this complex in plants.
