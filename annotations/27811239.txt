['27811239', 'Environmental stresses are universally encountered by microbes, plants, and  animals. Yet systematic studies of stress-responsive transcription factor (TF)  networks in multicellular organisms have been limited. The phytohormone abscisic  acid (ABA) influences the expression of thousands of genes, allowing us to  characterize complex stress-responsive regulatory networks. Using chromatin  immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identified genome-wide targets of 21  ABA-related TFs to construct a comprehensive regulatory network in Arabidopsis  thaliana Determinants of dynamic TF binding and a hierarchy among TFs were  defined, illuminating the relationship between differential gene expression  patterns and ABA pathway feedback regulation. By extrapolating regulatory  characteristics of observed canonical ABA pathway components, we identified a new  family of transcriptional regulators modulating ABA and salt responsiveness and  demonstrated their utility to modulate plant resilience to osmotic stress.', '2016 Nov 4', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aag1550', 'Ecker']
