Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) type I signal peptidases (ER SPases I) are vital proteases that cleave signal peptides from secreted proteins. However, the specific function of ER SPase I in plants has not been genetically characterized, and the substrate is largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a maize (Zea mays) miniature seed6 (mn6) mutant. The loss-of-function mn6 mutant exhibited severely reduced endosperm size. Map-based cloning and molecular characterization indicated that Mn6 is an S26-family ER SPase I, with Gly102 (box E) in Mn6 critical for protein function during processing. Mass spectrometric and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that Mn6 is predominantly involved in processing carbohydrate synthesis-related proteins, including the cell wall invertase miniature seed1 (Mn1), which is specifically expressed in the basal endosperm transfer layer. RNA and protein expression levels of Mn1 were both significantly downregulated in the mn6 mutant. Due to the significant reduction in cell wall invertase activity in the transfer cell layer, mutation of Mn6 caused dramatic defects in endosperm development. These results suggest that proper maturation of Mn1 by Mn6 may be a crucial step for proper seed filling and maize development.
