['21139087', 'Sulfiredoxin (Srx) couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the energetically  unfavorable process of reducing the inactive sulfinic form of 2-cysteine  peroxiredoxins (Prxs) to regenerate its active form. In plants, Srx as well as  typical 2-cysteine Prx have been considered as enzymes with exclusive chloroplast  localization. This work explores the subcellular localization of Srx in pea  (Pisum sativum) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Immunocytochemistry,  analysis of protein extracts from isolated intact organelles, and cell-free  posttranslational import assays demonstrated that plant Srx also localizes to the  mitochondrion in addition to plastids. The dual localization was in line with the  prediction of a signal peptide for dual targeting. Activity tests and  microcalorimetric data proved the interaction between Srx and its mitochondrial  targets Prx IIF and thioredoxin. Srx catalyzed the retroreduction of the inactive  sulfinic form of atypical Prx IIF using thioredoxin as reducing agent.  Arabidopsis Srx also reduced overoxidized human Prx V. These results suggest that  plant Srx could play a crucial role in the regulation of Prx IIF activity by  controlling the regeneration of its overoxidized form in mitochondria, which are  sites of efficient reactive oxygen species production in plants.', '2011 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.166504', 'Lazaro']
