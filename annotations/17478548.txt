['17478548', 'Arabidopsis contains four Lon protease-like proteins (AtLon1-AtLon4), predicted  to be localized in different cellular organelles, including mitochondria,  peroxisomes and plastids. A notable question is whether Lon is present in  chloroplasts, since it is absent from cyanobacteria and thus appears to have been  lost during the evolution of photosynthetic organisms. Based on in vivo transient  assays, we found that AtLon4 is dually targeted to both mitochondria and  chloroplasts. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis localized AtLon4 to the  thylakoids. Thus, in spite of its absence from basal photosynthetic organisms,  our results suggest the presence of Lon in plant plastids.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcm052', 'Sakamoto']
