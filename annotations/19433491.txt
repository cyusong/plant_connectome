Thioglucoside glucohydrolase (myrosinase), TGG1, is a strikingly abundant protein in Arabidopsis guard cells. We investigated responses of tgg1-3, tgg2-1 and tgg1-3 tgg2-1 mutants to abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to clarify whether two myrosinases, TGG1 and TGG2, function during stomatal closure. ABA, MeJA and H(2)O(2) induced stomatal closure in wild type, tgg1-3 and tgg2-1, but failed to induce stomatal closure in tgg1-3 tgg2-1. All mutants and wild type showed Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closure and ABA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)production. A model is discussed in which two myrosinases redundantly function downstream of ROS production and upstream of cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation in ABA and MeJA signaling in guard cells.
