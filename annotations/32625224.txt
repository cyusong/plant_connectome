Induced plant responses to insect herbivores are well studied, but we know very little about responses to gastropod feeding. We aim to identify the temporal dynamics of signaling- and defense-related plant responses after slug feeding in relation to induced resistance. We exposed <i>Solanum dulcamara</i> plants to feeding by the gray field slug (GFS; <i>Deroceras reticulatum</i>) for different periods and tested disks of local and systemic leaves in preference assays. Induced responses were analyzed using metabolomics and transcriptomics. GFS feeding induced local and systemic responses. Slug feeding for 72 h more strongly affected the plant metabolome than 24 h feeding. It increased the levels of a glycoalkaloid (solasonine), phenolamides, anthocyanins, and trypsin protease inhibitors as well as polyphenol oxidase activity. Phytohormone and transcriptome analyses revealed that jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and salicylic acid signaling were activated. GFS feeding upregulated more genes than that it downregulated. The response directly after feeding was more than five times higher than after an additional 24 h without feeding. Our research showed that GFS, like most chewing insects, triggers anti-herbivore defenses by activating defense signaling pathways, resulting in increased resistance to further slug feeding. Slug herbivory may therefore impact other herbivores in the community.
