Both the antiporter CHX23 (Cation/Proton Exchangers 23) and auxin transporter PIN8 (PIN-FORMED 8) are localized in the ER and regulate pollen growth in Arabidopsis. But how these two proteins regulate pollen growth remains to be studied. Here, we report that CHX23 and PIN8 act coordinately in regulating pollen growth. The chx23 mutant was reduced in pollen growth and normally shaped pollen grains, and complementation with CHX23 restored both pollen growth and normal pollen morphology. NAA treatments showed that CHX23 was crucial for pollen auxin homeostasis. The pin8 chx23 double mutant was decreased in pollen growth and normal pollen grains, indicating the joint effort of CHX23 and PIN8 in pollen growth. In vivo germination assay showed that CHX23 and PIN8 were involved in the early stage of pollen growth. CHX23 and PIN8 also function collaboratively in maintaining pollen auxin homeostasis. PIN8 depends on CHX23 in regulating pollen morphology and response to NAA treatments. CHX23 co-localized with PIN8, but there was no physical interaction. KCl and NaCl treatments showed that pollen growth of chx23 was reduced less than Col-0; pin8 chx23 was reduced less than chx23 and pin8. Together, CHX23 may regulate PIN8 function and hence pollen growth through controlling K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis mediated by its transport activity.
