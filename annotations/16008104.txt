Suspension cell cultures of Helianthus annuus L. were previously established for the production of the most active component of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, by optimizing medium composition and culture conditions. In the present work, the possibility of enhancing alpha-tocopherol production by the addition of jasmonic acid to the culture medium was investigated both in sunflower and Arabidopsis cell cultures. A considerable increase (49% and 66%, respectively) of alpha-tocopherol production was obtained in both, after a 72-h treatment with 5 microM jasmonic acid. The modulation of alpha-tocopherol levels in plant cell cultures can provide useful hints for a regulatory impact on tocopherol metabolism.
