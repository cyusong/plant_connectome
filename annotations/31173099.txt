Cellulases play important roles in the shedding of plant organs; however, little is yet known about the functions of cellulase genes during the process of organ abscission. Abnormal fruitlet abscission is a serious problem in the production of litchi (Litchi chinensis), an economically important fruit widely grown in South Asia. In this study, two abscission-accelerating treatments (carbohydrate stress and application of ethephon) were evaluated in litchi fruitlets. Cell wall degradation and cell separation were clearly observed in the abscission zones of treated fruitlets, consistent with enhanced cellulase activities and reduced cellulose contents. The expression of two cellulase genes (LcCEL2 and LcCEL8) was strongly associated with abscission. Floral organs of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing LcCEL2 or LcCEL8 showed remarkably precocious abscission. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient expression experiments demonstrated that a novel homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor, LcHB2, could directly bind to and activate HD-binding cis-elements in the LcCEL2 and LcCEL8 promoters. Our results provide new information regarding the transcriptional regulation of the cellulase genes responsible for cell wall degradation and cell separation during plant organ shedding, and raise the possibility of future manipulation of litchi fruitlet abscission by modulation of the activities of these two cellulases.
