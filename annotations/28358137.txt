['28358137', "Extensins are plant cell wall glycoproteins that act as scaffolds for the  deposition of the main wall carbohydrate polymers, which are interlocked into the  supramolecular wall structure through intra- and inter-molecular iso-di-tyrosine  crosslinks within the extensin backbone. In the conserved canonical extensin  repeat, Ser-Hyp(4), serine and the consecutive C4-hydroxyprolines (Hyps) are  substituted with an alpha-galactose and 1-5 beta- or alpha-linked arabinofuranoses (Arafs),  respectively. These modifications are required for correct extended structure and  function of the extensin network. Here, we identified a single Arabidopsis  thaliana gene, At3g57630, in clade E of the inverting Glycosyltransferase family  GT47 as a candidate for the transfer of Araf to Hyp-arabinofuranotriose  (Hyp-beta1,4Araf-beta1,2Araf-beta1,2Araf) side chains in an alpha-linkage, to yield  Hyp-Araf(4) which is exclusively found in extensins. T-DNA knock-out mutants of  At3g57630 showed a truncated root hair phenotype, as seen for mutants of all  hitherto characterized extensin glycosylation enzymes; both root hair and glycan  phenotypes were restored upon reintroduction of At3g57630. At3g57630 was named  Extensin Arabinose Deficient transferase, ExAD, accordingly. The occurrence of  ExAD orthologs within the Viridiplantae along with its' product, Hyp-Araf(4),  point to ExAD being an evolutionary hallmark of terrestrial plants and charophyte  green algae.", '2017 Mar 30', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep45341', 'Petersen']
