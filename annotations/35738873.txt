Plants can adjust their growth to specific times of the day and season. Different photoperiods result in distinct growth patterns, which correlate with specific carbon-partitioning strategies in source (leaves) and sink (roots) organs. Therefore, external cues such as light, day length, and temperature need to be integrated with intracellular processes controlling overall carbon availability and anabolism. The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a signalling hub where environmental signals, circadian information, and metabolic processes converge to regulate plant growth. TOR complex mutants display altered patterns of root growth and starch levels. Moreover, depletion of TOR or reduction in cellular energy levels affect the pace of the clock by extending the period length, suggesting that this pathway could participate in circadian metabolic entrainment. However, this seems to be a mutual interaction, since the TOR pathway components are also under circadian regulation. These results strengthen the role of this signalling pathway as a master sensor of metabolic status, integrating day length and circadian cues to control anabolic processes in the cell, thus promoting plant growth and development. Expanding this knowledge from Arabidopsis thaliana to crops will improve our understanding of the molecular links connecting environmental perception and growth regulation under field conditions.
