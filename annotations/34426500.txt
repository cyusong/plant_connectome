Active nitrifiers and rapid nitrification are major contributing factors to nitrogen losses in global wheat production. Suppressing nitrifier activity is an effective strategy to limit <i>N</i> losses from agriculture. Production and release of nitrification inhibitors from plant roots is termed "biological nitrification inhibition" (BNI). Here, we report the discovery of a chromosome region that controls BNI production in "wheat grass" <i>Leymus racemosus</i> (Lam.) Tzvelev, located on the short arm of the "Lr#3Ns<sup>b</sup>" (Lr#n), which can be transferred to wheat as T3BL.3Ns<sup>b</sup>S (denoted Lr#n-SA), where 3BS arm of chromosome 3B of wheat was replaced by 3Ns<sup>b</sup>S of <i>L. racemosus</i> We successfully introduced T3BL.3Ns<sup>b</sup>S into the wheat cultivar "Chinese Spring" (CS-Lr#n-SA, referred to as "BNI-CS"), which resulted in the doubling of its BNI capacity. T3BL.3Ns<sup>b</sup>S from BNI-CS was then transferred to several elite high-yielding hexaploid wheat cultivars, leading to near doubling of BNI production in "BNI-MUNAL" and "BNI-ROELFS." Laboratory incubation studies with root-zone soil from field-grown BNI-MUNAL confirmed BNI trait expression, evident from suppression of soil nitrifier activity, reduced nitrification potential, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Changes in <i>N</i> metabolism included reductions in both leaf nitrate, nitrate reductase activity, and enhanced glutamine synthetase activity, indicating a shift toward ammonium nutrition. Nitrogen uptake from soil organic matter mineralization improved under low N conditions. Biomass production, grain yields, and <i>N</i> uptake were significantly higher in BNI-MUNAL across <i>N</i> treatments. Grain protein levels and breadmaking attributes were not negatively impacted. Wide use of BNI functions in wheat breeding may combat nitrification in high <i>N</i> input-intensive farming but also can improve adaptation to low <i>N</i> input marginal areas.
