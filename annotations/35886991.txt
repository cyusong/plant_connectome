The in vitro cultures of plant stem cells and stem cell-like cells can be established from tissues containing meristematic cells. Chemical compounds-as well as their production potential-is among the emerging topics of plant biotechnology. We induced the callus cell biomass growth and characterized the parameters indicating the presence of stem cells or stem cell-like cells. Four types of explants (stem, petiole, leaf, root) from <i>Sida hermaphrodita</i> (L.) Rusby and various combinations of auxins and cytokinins were tested for initiation of callus, growth of sub-cultivated callus biomass, and establishment of stem cells or stem cell-like cells. Induction of callus and its growth parameters were significantly affected both by the explant type and the combination of used plant growth hormones and regulators. The responsibility for callus initiation and growth was the highest in stem-derived explants containing cambial meristematic cells. Growth parameters of callus biomass and specific characteristics of vacuoles confirmed the presence of stem cells or stem cell-like cells in sub-cultivated callus cell biomass. Establishment of in vitro stem cell or stem cell-like cell cultures in <i>S. hermaphrodita</i> can lead to the development of various applications of in vitro cultivation systems as well as alternative applications of this crop.
