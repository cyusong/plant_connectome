['16830178', 'ARF GTPases play a central role in regulating membrane dynamics and protein  transport in eukaryotic cells. ARF-like (ARL) proteins are close relatives of the  ARF regulators of vesicular transport, but their function in plant cells is  poorly characterized. Here, by means of live cell imaging and site-directed  mutagenesis, we have investigated the cellular function of the plant GTPase ARL1.  We provide direct evidence for a role of this ARL family member in the  association of a plant golgin with the plant Golgi apparatus. Our data reveal the  existence of key residues within the conserved GRIP-domain of the golgin and  within the GTPase ARL1 that are central to ARL1-GRIP interaction. Mutations of  these residues abolish the interaction of GRIP with the GTP-bound ARL1 and induce  a redistribution of GRIP into the cytosol. This indicates that the localization  of GRIP to the Golgi apparatus is strongly influenced by the interaction of GRIP  with Golgi-localized ARL1. Our results assign a cellular role to a member of the  Arabidopsis ARL family in the plant secretory pathway and propose mechanisms for  localization of peripheral golgins to the plant Golgi apparatus.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-006-0022-y', 'Brandizzi']
