Rice is an important staple food crop that feeds over half of the human population, particularly in developing countries. Increasing salinity is a major challenge for continuing rice production. Though rice is affected by salinity at all the developmental stages, it is most sensitive at the early seedling stage. The yield thus depends on how many seedlings can withstand saline water at the stage of transplantation, especially in coastal farms. The rapid development of "omics" approaches has assisted researchers in identifying biological molecules that are responsive to salt stress. Several salinity-responsive quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to salinity tolerance have been identified and validated, making it essential to narrow down the search for the key genes within QTLs. Owing to the impressive progress of molecular tools, it is now clear that the response of plants toward salinity is highly complex, involving multiple genes, with a specific role assigned to the repertoire of transcription factors (TF). Targeting the TFs for improving salinity tolerance can have an inbuilt advantage of influencing multiple downstream genes, which in turn can contribute toward tolerance to multiple stresses. This is the first comparative study for TF-driven salinity tolerance in contrasting rice cultivars at the seedling stage that shows how tolerant genotypes behave differently than sensitive ones in terms of stress tolerance. Understanding the complexity of salt-responsive TF networks at the seedling stage will be helpful to alleviate crop resilience and prevent crop damage at an early growth stage in rice.
