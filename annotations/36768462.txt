Flavonoids have been shown to have anti-oxidative effects, as well as other health benefits (e.g., anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor functions). Luteolin (3', 4', 5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid found in vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs, including celery, broccoli, green pepper, navel oranges, dandelion, peppermint, and rosemary. Luteolin has multiple useful effects, especially in regulating inflammation-related symptoms and diseases. In this paper, we summarize the studies about the immunopharmacological activity of luteolin on anti-inflammatory, anti-cardiovascular, anti-cancerous, and anti-neurodegenerative diseases published since 2018 and available in PubMed or Google Scholar. In this review, we also introduce some additional formulations of luteolin to improve its solubility and bioavailability.
