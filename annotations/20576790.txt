Individuals, families, networks, and botanic gardens have made records of flowering times of a wide range of plant species over many years. These data can highlight year to year changes in seasonal events (phenology) and those datasets covering long periods draw interest for their perspective on plant responses to climate change. Temperate flowering phenology is complex, using environmental cues such as temperature and photoperiod to attune flowering to appropriate seasonal conditions. Here we give an overview of flowering phenological recording, outline different patterns of flowering, and look at the interpretation of datasets in relation to seasonal and climatic change.
