['21441434', 'The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an essential ubiquitin protein  ligase, regulates mitotic progression and exit by enhancing degradation of cell  cycle regulatory proteins, such as CYCB1;1, whose transcripts are upregulated by  DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). DUO1 is required for cell division in male gametophytes and  is a target of microRNA 159 (miR159) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Whether APC/C is  required for DUO1-dependent CYCB1;1 regulation is unknown. Mutants in both APC8  and APC13 had pleiotrophic phenotypes resembling those of mutants affecting  microRNA biogenesis. We show that these apc/c mutants had reduced miR159 levels  and increased DUO1 and CYCB1;1 transcript levels and that APC/C is required to  recruit RNA polymerase II to MIR159 promoters. Thus, in addition to its role in  degrading CYCB1;1, APC/C stimulates production of miR159, which downregulates  DUO1 expression, leading to reduced CYCB1;1 transcription. Both MIR159 and  APC8-yellow fluorescent protein accumulated in unicellular microspores and  bicellular pollen but decreased in tricellular pollen, suggesting that spatial  and temporal regulation of miR159 by APC/C ensures mitotic progression.  Consistent with this, the percentage of mature pollen with no or single  sperm-like cells increased in apc/c mutants and plants overexpressing APC8  partially mimicked the duo1 phenotype. Thus, APC/C is an integrator that  regulates both microRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation of CYCB1;1 and  degradation of CYCB1;1.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.083980', 'McCormick']
