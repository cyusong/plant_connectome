A candidate gene, designate PpRPH, in the D locus was identified to control fruit acidity in peach. Fruit acidity has a strong impact on organoleptic quality of fruit. Peach fruit acidity is controlled by a large-effect D locus on chromosome 5. In this study, the D locus was mapped to a 509-kb interval, with two markers, 5dC720 and 5C1019, co-segregating with the non-acid/acid trait of peach fruit. Within this interval, a candidate gene encoding a putative small protein, designated PpRPH, showed a consistency between gene expression and fruit acidity, with up- and down-regulation in non-acidic and acidic fruits, respectively. Transient ectopic expression of PpRPH in tobacco leaves caused an increase of pH by approximately 40% compared to the control transformed with empty vector. Whereas, the concentrations of citrate and malate decreased significantly by 22% and 37%, respectively, with respect to the empty vector control. All these results suggest that PpRPH is a strong candidate gene of the D locus. These findings contribute to our overall understanding of the complex mechanism underlying fruit acidity in peach as well as that in other fruit crops.
