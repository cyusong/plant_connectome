To disentangle the role of polygalacturonase (PG) genes in strawberry softening, the two PG genes most expressed in ripe receptacles, FaPG1 and FaPG2, were down-regulated. Transgenic ripe fruits were firmer than those of the wild type when PG genes were silenced individually. Simultaneous silencing of both PG genes by transgene stacking did not result in an additional increase in firmness. Cell walls from ripe fruits were characterized by a carbohydrate microarray. Higher signals of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan I pectin epitopes in polysaccharide fractions tightly bound to the cell wall were observed in the transgenic genotypes, suggesting a lower pectin solubilization. At the transcriptomic level, the suppression of FaPG1 or FaPG2 alone induced few transcriptomic changes in the ripe receptacle, but the amount of differentially expressed genes increased notably when both genes were silenced. Many genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes were down-regulated. The expression of a putative high affinity potassium transporter was induced in all transgenic genotypes, indicating that cell wall weakening and loss of cell turgor could be linked. These results suggest that, besides the disassembly of pectins tightly linked to the cell wall, PGs could play other roles in strawberry softening, such as the release of oligogalacturonides exerting a positive feedback in softening.
