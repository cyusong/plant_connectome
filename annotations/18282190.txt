Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, in association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase, EC 2.7.1.137) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4 kinase, EC 2.7.1.67), play a key role in regulation of fundamental cell processes. We present evidence for a relationship between alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) secretion regulated by GA and levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Microsomal membranes were incubated in the presence of [gamma-(32)P]ATP, and radiolabeled membrane lipids were extracted and separated by TLC using a boric acid system. Treatment of aleurone layers with GA for short or long periods of time increased PI4 kinase activity. To evaluate the effect of PtdIns(4)P levels on GA signaling, we used phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of PI4 kinase activity. PAO reversibly reduced the alpha-amylase secretion and protoplast cell vacuolation in a dose-dependent manner. Wortmannin showed a similar inhibitory effect on alpha-amylase secretion and PI4 kinase activity. GA evoked only a long-term increase in PI3 kinase activity, which was also affected by PAO. The effect of PAO was suppressed by the reducing agent 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL), leading to restoration of secretion, vacuolation and PI4 kinase activity. In contrast, the effect of PAO on PI3 kinase activity was not abolished by BAL, suggesting that PI3 kinase is not involved in the secretion process. Likewise, the compound LY294002 inhibited PI3 kinase but had no effect on the secretion process. These findings indicate that PI4 kinase acts as a positive regulator of early GA signaling in aleurone.
