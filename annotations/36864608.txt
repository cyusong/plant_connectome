Although microRNA408 (miR408) is a highly conserved miRNA, the miR408 response to salt stress differs among plant species. Here, we show that miR408 transcripts are strongly repressed by salt stress and methyl viologen treatment in maize (Zea mays). Application of N, N1-dimethylthiourea partly relieved the NaCl-induced down-regulation of miR408. Transgenic maize overexpressing MIR408b is hypersensitive to salt stress. Overexpression of MIR408b enhanced the rate of net Na+ efflux, caused Na+ to locate in the inter-cellular space, reduced lignin accumulation, and reduced the number of cells in vascular bundles under salt stress. We further demonstrated that miR408 targets ZmLACCASE9 (ZmLAC9). Knockout of MIR408a or MIR408b or overexpression of ZmLAC9 increased the accumulation of lignin, thickened the walls of pavement cells, and improved salt tolerance of maize. Transcriptome profiles of the wild-type and MIR408b-overexpressing transgenic maize with or without salt stress indicated that miR408 negatively regulates the expression of cell wall biogenesis genes under salt conditions. These results indicate that miR408 negatively regulates salt tolerance by regulating secondary cell wall development in maize.
