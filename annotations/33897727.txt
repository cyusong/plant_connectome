Arginine deimination, also referred to as citrullination of proteins by L-arginine deiminases, is a post-translational modification affecting histone modifications, epigenetic transcriptional regulation, and proteolysis in animals but has not been reported in higher plants. Here we report, firstly, that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> proteome contains proteins with a specific citrullination signature and that many of the citrullinated proteins have nucleotide-binding regulatory functions. Secondly, we show that changes in the citrullinome occur in response to cold stress, and thirdly, we identify an <i>A. thaliana</i> protein with peptidyl arginine deiminase activity that was shown to be calcium-dependent for many peptide substrates. Taken together, these findings establish this post-translational modification as a hitherto neglected component of cellular reprogramming during stress responses.
