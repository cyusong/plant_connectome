In vascular plants, the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (NDH-C) is assembled from five distinct subcomplexes, the membrane-spanning (subM) and the luminal (subL) subcomplexes, as well as subA, subB, and subE. The assembly process itself is poorly understood. Vascular plant genomes code for two related intrinsic thylakoid proteins, photosynthesis-affected mutant68 (PAM68), a photosystem II assembly factor, and photosynthesis-affected mutant68-like (PAM68L). As we show here, inactivation of Arabidopsis thaliana PAM68L in the pam68l-1 mutant identifies PAM68L as an NDH-C assembly factor. The mutant lacks functional NDH holocomplexes and accumulates three distinct NDH-C assembly intermediates (subB, subM, and subA+L), which are also found in mutants defective in subB assembly (ndf5) or subM expression (chlororespiratory reduction4-3 mutant). NDH-C assembly in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 and the moss Physcomitrella patens does not require PAM68 proteins, as demonstrated by the analysis of knockout lines for the single-copy PAM68 genes in these species. We conclude that PAM68L mediates the attachment of subB- and subM-containing intermediates to a complex that contains subA and subL. The evolutionary appearance of subL and PAM68L during the transition from mosses like P. patens to flowering plants suggests that the associated increase in the complexity of the NDH-C might have been facilitated by the recruitment of evolutionarily novel assembly factors like PAM68L.
