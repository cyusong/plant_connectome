Bri1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1)-interacting receptor-like kinase (BIR) proteins have been shown to play important roles in regulating growth and development, pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, and cell death in the model plant, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We identified four BIR family members in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), including <i>SlBIR3</i>, an ortholog of <i>AtBIR3</i> from <i>A. thaliana</i>. <i>SlBIR3</i> is predicted to encode a membrane localized non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinase that, based on protein sequence, does not have autophosphorylation activity but that can be phosphorylated in vivo. We established that SlBIR3 interacts with SlBAK1 and AtBAK1 using yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation and maltose-binding protein pull down assays. We observed that <i>SlBIR3</i> overexpression in tomato (cv. micro-tom) and <i>A. thaliana</i> has weak effect on growth and development through brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. <i>SlBIR3</i> overexpression in <i>A. thaliana</i> suppressed flg22-induced defense responses, but did not affect infection with the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> (<i>Pst</i>DC3000). This result was confirmed using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in tomato in conjunction with <i>Pst</i>DC3000 infection. Overexpression of <i>SlBIR3</i> in tomato (cv. micro-tom) and <i>A. thaliana</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. In addition, co-silencing <i>SlBIR3</i> with <i>SlSERK3A</i> or <i>SlSERK3B</i> using VIGS and the tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-RNA2 vector containing fragments of both the <i>SlSERK3</i> and <i>SlBIR3</i> genes induced spontaneous cell death, indicating a cooperation between the two proteins in this process. In conclusion, our study revealed that <i>SlBIR3</i> is the ortholog of <i>AtBIR3</i> and that it participates in BR, PTI, and cell death signaling pathways.
