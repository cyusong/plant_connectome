['17651368', 'Scanning DNA sequences for mutations and polymorphisms has become one of the most  challenging, often expensive and time-consuming obstacles in many molecular  genetic applications, including reverse genetic and clinical diagnostic  applications. Enzymatic mutation detection methods are based on the cleavage of  heteroduplex DNA at the mismatch sites. These methods are often limited by the  availability of a mismatch-specific endonuclease, their sensitivity in detecting  one allele in a pool of DNA and their costs. Here, we present detailed  biochemical analysis of five Arabidopsis putative mismatch-specific  endonucleases. One of them, ENDO1, is presented as the first endonuclease that  recognizes and cleaves all types of mismatches with high efficiency. We report on  a very simple protocol for the expression and purification of ENDO1. The ENDO1  system could be exploited in a wide range of mutation diagnostic tools. In  particular, we report the use of ENDO1 for discovery of point mutations in the  gibberellin 3beta-hydrolase gene of Pisum sativum. Twenty-one independent mutants  were isolated, five of these were characterized and two new mutations affecting  internodes length were identified. To further evaluate the quality of the mutant  population we screened for mutations in four other genes and identified 5-21 new  alleles per target. Based on the frequency of the obtained alleles we concluded  that the pea population described here would be suitable for use in a large  reverse-genetics project.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03201.x', 'Bendahmane']
