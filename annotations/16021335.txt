['16021335', 'The Arabidopsis gene COI1 is required for jasmonic acid (JA)-induced growth  inhibition, resistance to insect herbivory, and resistance to pathogens. In  addition, COI1 is also required for transcription of several genes induced by  wounding or by JA. Here, we use microarray gene transcription profiling of wild  type and coi1 mutant plants to examine the extent of the requirement of COI1 for  JA-induced and wound-induced gene transcription. We show that COI1 is required  for expression of approximately 84% of 212 genes induced by JA, and for  expression of approximately 44% of 153 genes induced by wounding. Surprisingly,  COI1 was also required for repression of 53% of 104 genes whose expression was  suppressed by JA, and for repression of approximately 46% of 83 genes whose  expression was suppressed by wounding. These results indicate that COI1 plays a  pivotal role in wound- and JA signalling.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-7306-5', 'Turner']
