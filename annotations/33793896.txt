Stomata are small pores on the surface of land plants that facilitate gas exchange for photosynthesis while minimizing water loss. The function of stomata is pivotal for plant growth and survival. Intensive research on the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has discovered key peptide signaling pathways, transcription factors, and polarity components that together drive proper stomatal development and patterning. In this review, we focus on recent findings that have revealed co-option of peptide-receptor kinase signaling modules-utilized for diverse developmental processes and immune response. We further discuss an emerging connection between extrinsic signaling and intrinsic polarity modules. These findings have further enlightened our understanding of this fascinating developmental process.
