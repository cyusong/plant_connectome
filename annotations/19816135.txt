Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells triggers a protective response, termed the ER stress response or the unfolded protein response, to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recently we characterized the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) membrane-bound basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor AtbZIP60 involved in the ER stress response. We reported that AtbZIP60 is activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), a mechanism by which a membrane-bound transcription factor is released by proteolytic cleavage. We presented evidence that the AtbZIP60 protein resides in the ER membrane under unstressed conditions and is activated by proteolytic cleavage in response to ER stress to translocate into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. Further analysis, however, showed that this cleavage is independent of the function of Arabidopsis homologs of S1P and S2P proteases, which mediate the proteolytic cleavage of the mammalian transcription factor ATF6. Thus AtbZIP60 is an ER stress transducer activated by a novel RIP mechanism that may be unique to plants.
