Two homologous, chloroplast located CAAX proteases were identified to be functional redundancy in determining soybean leaf color, and they probably play essential roles in regulating light harvesting and absorption during photosynthesis process. Leaf color mutants are ideal materials for studying photosynthesis and chlorophyll metabolism. The soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yellowing leaf (yl) variation is a recombinant mutant characterized by yellow foliage, which derived from the specific cross between green seed-coated and yellow seed-coated soybean varieties. Molecular cloning and subsequent gene silencing revealed that the yellow leaf trait of yl was controlled by two recessive nuclear genes, glyma11g04660 and glyma01g40650, named as YL1 and YL2 respectively, and the latter was confirmed to be same as the earlier reported green seed-coat gene G. Both YL1 and YL2 belonged to chloroplast-located proteases possessing Abi domain, and these genes were expressed in various tissues, especially in young leaves. In yl, the expression of YL1 and YL2 were suppressed in most tissues, and the young leaf of yl presented an increased maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) as well as enhanced net photosynthesis activity (Pn), indicating that YL1 and YL2 are involved in light absorption regulation during photosynthesis process. Collectively, the identification and description of YL1 and YL2 in our study provides insights for the regulatory mechanism of photosynthesis process, and these findings will further assist to clarify the close relationship between photosynthesis and chlorophyll metabolism.
