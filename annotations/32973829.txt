Glycerol, a compatible solute, has previously been found to act as an osmoprotectant in some marine <i>Chlamydomonas</i> species and several species of <i>Dunaliella</i> from hypersaline ponds. Recently, <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and <i>Dunaliella salina</i> were shown to make glycerol with an unusual bidomain enzyme, which appears to be unique to algae, that contains a phosphoserine phosphatase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Here we report that two psychrophilic species of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>C</i>. spp. UWO241 and ICE-MDV) from Lake Bonney, Antarctica also produce high levels of glycerol to survive in the lake's saline waters. Glycerol concentration increased linearly with salinity and at 1.3 M NaCl, exceeded 400 mM in <i>C</i>. sp. UWO241, the more salt-tolerant strain. We also show that both species expressed several isoforms of the bidomain enzyme. An analysis of one of the isoforms of <i>C</i>. sp. UWO241 showed that it was strongly upregulated by NaCl and is thus the likely source of glycerol. These results reveal another adaptation of the Lake Bonney <i>Chlamydomonas</i> species that allow them to survive in an extreme polar environment.
