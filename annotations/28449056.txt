Sugars are the main carbon and energy source in cells, but they can also act as signaling molecules that affect the whole plant life cycle. Certain tissues can produce sugars and supply them to others, and this plant tissue heterogeneity makes sugar signaling a highly complex process that requires elements capable of perceiving changes in sugar concentrations among different tissues, cell compartments and developmental stages. In plants, the regulatory effects of glucose (Glc) have been the most studied to date. The first Glc sensor identified in plants was hexokinase (HXK), which is currently recognized as a dual-function protein. In addition to its catalytic activity, this enzyme can also repress the expression of some photosynthetic genes in response to high internal Glc concentrations. Additionally, the catalytic activity of HXKs has a profound impact on cell metabolism and other sugar signaling pathways that depend on phosphorylated hexoses and intermediate glycolytic products. HXKs are the only proteins that are able to phosphorylate Glc in plants, since no evidence has been provided to date concerning the existence of a glucokinase. Moreover, the intracellular localization of HXKs seems to be crucial to their activity and sensor functions. Recently, two new and surprising functions have been described for HXKs. In this review, we discuss the versatility of HXKs in regard to their catalytic and glucose sensor activities, intracellular location, protein-protein and hormone interactions, as well as how these HXK characteristics influence plant growth and development, in an effort to understand this enzyme's role in improving plant productivity.
