The present review addresses the advances of the identification methods, functions, and transportation mechanism of long-distance transport RNAs between rootstock and scion. In addition, we highlight the cognitive processes and potential mechanisms of graft hybridization. Phloem, the main transport channel of higher plants, plays an important role in the growth and development of plants. Numerous studies have identified a large number of RNAs, including mRNAs, miRNAs, siRNAs, and lncRNAs, in the plant phloem. They can not only be transported to long distances across the grafting junction in the phloem, but also act as signal molecules to regulate the growth, development, and stress resistance of remote cells or tissues, resulting in changes in the traits of rootstocks and scions. Many mobile RNAs have been discovered, but their detection methods, functions, and long-distance transport mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In addition, grafting hybridization, a phenomenon that has been questioned before, and which has an important role in selecting for superior traits, is gradually being recognized with the emergence of new evidence and the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer between parasitic plants. In this review, we outline the species, functions, identification methods, and potential mechanisms of long-distance transport RNAs between rootstocks and scions after grafting. In addition, we summarize the process of recognition and the potential mechanisms of graft hybridization. This study aimed to emphasize the role of grafting in the study of long-distance signals and selection for superior traits and to provide ideas and clues for further research on long-distance transport RNAs and graft hybridization.
