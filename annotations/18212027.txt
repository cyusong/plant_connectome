Post-translational modifications of histones, including acetylation, play a key role in modulating dynamic changes in chromatin structure and gene activity. Histone acetylation is modulated through the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases. HDA6 is a RPD3-type histone deacetylase in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis HDA6 mutant, axe1-5, and HDA6 RNA-interfering (HDA6-RNAi) plants displayed higher levels of acetylated H3 compared with wild-type, suggesting that HDA6 affects histone acetylation levels globally. The expression of the jasmonate responsive genes, PDF1.2, VSP2, JIN1, and ERF1, was down-regulated in axe1-5 and HDA6-RNAi plants. Furthermore, axe1-5 and HDA6-RNAi plants displayed increased leaf longevity compared with the wild type. The expression of the senescence-associated genes, SAG12 and SEN4, was down-regulated in the axe1-5 and HDA6-RNAi plants. In addition, axe1-5 and HDA6-RNAi plants displayed late-flowering. The expression of FLC was up-regulated and hyperacetylated in axe1-5 and HDA6-RNAi plants, suggesting that HDA6 is required to deacetylate FLC chromatin and thereby repress its expression. Our results suggest that HDA6 is involved in jasmonate response, senescence, and flowering in Arabidopsis.
