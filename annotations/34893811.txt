Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is an important economic crop for both sugar and biomass, the yields of which are negatively affected by flowering. The molecular mechanisms controlling flowering in sugarcane are nevertheless poorly understood. RNA-seq data analysis and database searches have enabled a comprehensive description of the PEBP gene family in sugarcane. It is shown to consist of at least 13 FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-like genes, two MOTHER OF FT AND TFL (MFT)-like genes, and four TERMINAL FLOWER (TFL)-like genes. As expected, these genes all show very high homology to their corresponding genes in Sorghum, and also to FT-like, MFT-like, and TFL-like genes in maize, rice, and Arabidopsis. Functional analysis in Arabidopsis showed that the sugarcane ScFT3 gene can rescue the late flowering phenotype of the Arabidopsis ft-10 mutant, whereas ScFT5 cannot. High expression levels of ScFT3 in leaves of short day-induced sugarcane plants coincided with initial stages of floral induction in the shoot apical meristem as shown by histological analysis of meristem dissections. This suggests that ScFT3 is likely to play a role in floral induction in sugarcane; however, other sugarcane FT-like genes may also be involved in the flowering process.
