Long-term overgrazing (OG) is one of the key drivers of global grassland degradation with severe loss of productivity and ecosystem functions, which may result in stress memory such as smaller stature of grassland plants. However, how the OG-induced stress memory could be regulated by phytohormones is unknown. In this study, we investigated the changes of four phytohormones of cloned offspring of <i>Leymus chinensis</i> that were developed from no-grazing (NG) plants and OG plants with a grazing history of 30 years. The concentrations of auxin (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA) in OG plant leaves were 45% and 20% lower than control, respectively. Meanwhile, the level of abscisic acid (ABA) in OG leaves nearly doubled compared with that in NG leaves. The situation was quite similar in roots. Unexpectedly, no significant changes in the jasmonic acid (JA) level were observed between OG and NG plants. The changes in gene expression patterns between OG and NG plants were also investigated by transcriptomic analysis. In total, 302 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between OG and NG plants, which were mainly classified into the functions of synthesis, receptor, and signal transduction processes of phytohormones. The expression of 24 key genes related to the biosynthesis and signal transduction of IAA and GA was downregulated in OG plants. Among them, <i>OASA1</i> and <i>AO1</i> (regulating the biosynthesis of IAA and ABA, respectively) were reduced significantly by 88 and 92%, respectively. In addition, the content of secondary metabolites related to plant defense such as flavonoids and phenols was also increased in leaves. Taken together, the decrease of positive plant growth-related hormones (IAA and GA) together with the increase of plant stress-related hormones or factors (ABA, flavonoids, and phenols) induced the growth-defense trade-offs for <i>L. chinensis</i> adaptation to long-term OG stress. The findings reported in this study shed new light on the mechanism of plant-animal interaction in the grassland ecosystem and provide a deeper insight into optimizing grazing management and sustainable utilization of grassland.
