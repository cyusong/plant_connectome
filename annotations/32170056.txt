Perception of pathogenic effectors in plants often relies on nucleotide-binding domain (NBS) and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) proteins. Some NLRs contain additional domains that function as integrated decoys for pathogen effector targets and activation of immune signalling. Wheat stripe rust is one of the most devastating diseases of crop plants. Here, we report the cloning of YrU1, a stripe rust resistance gene from the diploid wheat Triticum urartu, the progenitor of the A genome of hexaploid wheat. YrU1 encodes a coiled-coil-NBS-leucine-rich repeat protein with N-terminal ankyrin-repeat and C-terminal WRKY domains, representing a unique NLR structure in plants. Database searches identify similar architecture only in wheat relatives. Transient expression of YrU1 in Nicotiana benthamiana does not induce cell death in the absence of pathogens. The ankyrin-repeat and coiled-coil domains of YrU1 self-associate, suggesting that homodimerisation is critical for YrU1 function. The identification and cloning of this disease resistance gene sheds light on NLR protein function and may facilitate breeding to control the devastating wheat stripe rust disease.
