The ability to distinguish self from non-self allows organisms to protect themselves against attackers. Sagebrush plants use volatile cues emitted by clipped neighbors to adjust their defenses against herbivores. Recently, we reported that cues from genetically identical 'self' clones were more effective at reducing damage than were cues from 'non-self' clones. This indicates that plants can distinguish self from non-self through volatiles and respond differentially. Identity recognition may be an essential step in enabling plants to behave cooperatively. Emission of cues which enable other plant tissues (on the same or other individual) to respond appropriately to herbivore risk may have evolved if cues are aimed primarily at self tissue.
