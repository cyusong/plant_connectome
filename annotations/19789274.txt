The poplar GT8E and GT8F glycosyltransferases have previously been shown to be associated with wood formation, but their roles in the biosynthesis of wood components are not known. Here, we show that PoGT8E and PoGT8F are expressed in vessels and fibers during wood formation and their encoded proteins are predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum. We demonstrate that expression of PoGT8E and PoGT8F in the Arabidopsis parvus mutant rescues the defects in the content and structure of glucuronoxylan conferred by the parvus mutation. These findings suggest that PoGT8E and PoGT8F are involved in glucuronoxylan biosynthesis during wood formation in poplar.
