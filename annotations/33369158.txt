Plants are colonized by various microorganisms in natural environments. While many studies have demonstrated key roles of the rhizosphere microbiota in regulating biological processes such as nutrient acquisition and resistance against abiotic and biotic challenges, less is known about the role of the phyllosphere microbiota and how it is established and maintained. This review provides an update on current understanding of phyllosphere community assembly and the mechanisms by which plants and microbes establish the phyllosphere microbiota for plant health.
