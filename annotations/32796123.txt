UV-B light is a potential stress factor in plants, but how plants coordinate growth and UV-B stress responses is not well understood. Here, we report that brassinosteroid (BR) signaling inhibits UV-B stress responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and various crops by controlling flavonol biosynthesis. We further demonstrate that BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) mediates the tradeoff between plant growth and UV-B defense responses. BES1, a master transcription factor involved in BR signaling, represses the expression of transcription factor genes <i>MYB11</i>, <i>MYB12</i>, and <i>MYB111</i>, which activate flavonol biosynthesis. BES1 directly binds to the promoters of these <i>MYBs</i> in a BR-enhanced manner to repress their expression, thereby reducing flavonol accumulation. However, exposure to broadband UV-B down-regulates <i>BES1</i> expression, thus promoting flavonol accumulation. These findings demonstrate that BR-activated BES1 not only promotes growth but also inhibits flavonoid biosynthesis. UV-B stress suppresses the expression of <i>BES1</i> to allocate energy to flavonoid biosynthesis and UV-B stress responses, allowing plants to switch from growth to UV-B stress responses in a timely manner.
