Species and hybrids of Eucalyptus are the world's most widely planted hardwood trees. They are cultivated across a wide range of latitudes and therefore environmental conditions. In this context, comprehensive metabolomics approaches have been used to assess how different temperature regimes may affect the metabolism of three species of Eucalyptus, E. dunnii, E. grandis and E. pellita. Young plants were grown for 53 d in the greenhouse and then transferred to growth chambers at 10°C, 20°C or 30°C for another 7 d. In all three species the leaf chlorophyll content was positively correlated to temperature, and in E. pellita the highest temperature also resulted in a significant increase in stem biomass. Comprehensive metabolomics was performed using untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. This approach enabled the comparison of the relative abundance of 88 polar primary metabolites from GC-MS and 625 semi-polar secondary metabolites from LC-MS. Using principal components analysis, a major effect of temperature was observed in each species which was larger than that resulting from the genetic background. Compounds mostly affected by temperature treatment were subsequently selected using partial least squares discriminant analysis and were further identified. These putative annotations indicated that soluble sugars and several polyphenols, including tannins, triterpenes and alkaloids were mostly influenced.
