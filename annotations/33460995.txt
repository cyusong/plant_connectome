Recombinant proteins play an important role in many areas of our lives. For example, recombinant enzymes are used in the food and chemical industries and as high-quality proteins for research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The production of recombinant proteins is still dominated by expression systems based on microbes and mammalian cells, although the manufacturing of recombinant proteins in plants - known as molecular farming - has been promoted as an alternative, cost-efficient strategy for three decades. Several molecular farming products have reached the market, but the number of success stories has been limited by industrial inertia driven by perceptions of low productivity, the high cost of downstream processing, and regulatory hurdles that create barriers to translation. Here, we discuss the technical and economic factors required for the successful commercialization of molecular farming, and consider potential future directions to enable the broader application of production platforms based on plants.
