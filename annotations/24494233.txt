RAR 1 is identified as a critical protein involved in plant innate immunity. We investigated the role of RAR 1 in Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation based on the previous findings that accessory proteins associated with the E3 ligase complex such as SGT1, which tightly interacts with RAR 1, play a role in the transformation process. RAR1 gene silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis rar1 mutant analyses suggested that RAR1 is required for early stages of Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. This finding further illustrates that RAR 1, along with SGT1, that serve as a HSP90 co-chaperone is important for Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation.
