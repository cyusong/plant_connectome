The Medicago truncatula DMI2 gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase that is essential for symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. While phenotypic analyses have provided a description for the host's responses mediated by DMI2, a lack of tools for in vivo biochemical analysis has hampered efforts to elucidate the mechanisms by which DMI2 mediates symbiotic signal transduction. Here, we report stably transformed M. truncatula lines that express a genomic DMI2 construct that is fused to a dual-affinity tag containing three copies of the hemagglutinin epitope and a single StrepII tag (gDMI2:HAST). gDMI2: HAST complements the dmi2-1 mutation, and transgenic plants expressing this construct behave similarly to wild-type plants. We show that the expression patterns of gDMI2:HAST recapitulate those of endogenous DMI2 and that we can detect and purify DMI2:HAST from microsomal root and nodule extracts. Using this line, we show that DMI2 resides in a high-molecular weight complex, which is consistent with our observation that DMI2:GFP localizes to plasma membrane-associated puncta and cytoplasmic vesicles. We further demonstrate that Nod factor (NF) perception increases the abundance of DMI2 vesicles. These tools should be a valuable resource for the Medicago community to dissect the biochemical function of DMI2.
