Adiponectin is a 30kDa protein exclusively produced and secreted from adipocytes and as a cytokine has been found to link obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Production of biologically active adiponectin in large scale is desirable for pharmaceutical applications. Mouse adiponectin cDNA was used for developing transgenic sweet potato plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The presence of the transgene was verified by PCR and DNA gel blot analysis. Further investigated were five independent transgenic lines, all of which expressed high levels of adiponectin mRNA. Immuno blot analysis with a mouse adiponectin antiserum revealed that, in addition to a 29 kDa-protein which co-migrates with the adiponectin protein produced in Escherichia coli cells, a 31 kDa-protein was produced, indicative of a post-translational modification of the protein. The transgenic plants did not show obvious differences in growth rate and morphology in response to adiponectin production.
