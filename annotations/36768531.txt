Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs), a family of proteins with high sequence similarity to thaumatin, are shown to be involved in plant defense, and are thus classified into the pathogenesis related protein family 5. <i>Ammopiptanthus nanus</i> is a rare evergreen broad-leaved shrub distributed in the temperate zone of Central Asia, which has a high tolerance to low-temperature stress. To characterize <i>A. nanus</i> TLPs and understand their roles in low-temperature response in <i>A. nanus</i>, a comprehensive analysis of the structure, evolution, and expression of TLP family proteins was performed. A total of 31 <i>TLP</i> genes were detected in the <i>A. nanus</i> genome, and they were divided into four groups based on their phylogenetic positions. The majority of the AnTLPs contained the conserved cysteine residues and were predicted to have the typical three-dimensional structure of plant TLPs. The primary modes of gene duplication of the AnTLP family genes were segmental duplication. The promoter regions of most <i>AnTLP</i> genes contain multiple cis-acting elements related to environmental stress response. Gene expression analysis based on transcriptome data and fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis revealed that several <i>AnTLP</i> genes were involved in cold-stress response. We further showed that a cold-induced <i>AnTLP</i> gene, <i>AnTLP13</i>, was localized in apoplast, and heterologous expression of the <i>AnTLP13</i> in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and yeast cells and tobacco leaves enhanced low-temperature stress tolerance when compared with the control cells or seedlings. Our study provided important data for understanding the roles of TLPs in plant response to abiotic stress.
