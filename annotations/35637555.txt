During germination, seed reserves are mobilised to sustain the metabolic and energetic demands of plant growth. Mitochondrial respiration is presumably required to drive germination in several species, but only recently its role in this process has begun to be elucidated. Using Arabidopsis thaliana lines with changes in the levels of the respiratory chain component cytochrome c (CYTc), we investigated the role of this protein in germination and its relationship with hormonal pathways. Cytochrome c deficiency causes delayed seed germination, which correlates with decreased cyanide-sensitive respiration and ATP production at the onset of germination. In addition, CYTc affects the sensitivity of germination to abscisic acid (ABA), which negatively regulates the expression of CYTC-2, one of two CYTc-encoding genes in Arabidopsis. CYTC-2 acts downstream of the transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4), which binds to a region of the CYTC-2 promoter required for repression by ABA and regulates its expression. The results show that CYTc is a main player during seed germination through its role in respiratory metabolism and energy production. In addition, the direct regulation of CYTC-2 by ABI4 and its effect on ABA-responsive germination establishes a link between mitochondrial and hormonal functions during this process.
