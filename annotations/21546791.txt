Rice (Oryza sativa cv. Dongjin) plants responded to treatment with methanol by inducing the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as serotonin derivatives which include feruloylserotonin and 4-coumaroylserotonin. This response was not only a dose dependence on methanol showing a maximum effect with 1% methanol concentration, but also methanol specific. No other solvents such as ethanol, atetaldehyde, isopropanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid showed the induced synthesis of serotonin derivatives as methanol did. The methanol induced synthesis of serotonin derivatives was completely blocked by the addition of abscisic acid (ABA), and significantly inhibited by the additions of zeatin and indoleacetic acid (IAA). However, gibberellic acid (GA) had little effect on the action of methanol. Finally, the induced synthesis of serotonin derivatives upon methanol treatment was closely associated with the transient increase in the activity of key enzyme of serotonin N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (SHT) which catalyzes the condensation of serotonin and phenolic-CoA into serotonin derivatives.
