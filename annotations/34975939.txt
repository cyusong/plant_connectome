Upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) is widely planted around the world for its natural fiber, and producing high-quality fiber is essential for the textile industry. CCRI70 is a hybrid cotton plant harboring superior yield and fiber quality, whose recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was developed from two upland cotton varieties (sGK156 and 901-001) and were used here to investigate the source of high-quality related alleles. Based on the material of the whole population, a high-density genetic map was constructed using specific locus-amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). It contained 24,425 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, spanning a distance of 4,850.47 centimorgans (cM) over 26 chromosomes with an average marker interval of 0.20 cM. In evaluating three fiber quality traits in nine environments to detect multiple environments stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs), we found 289 QTLs, of which 36 of them were stable QTLs and 18 were novel. Based on the transcriptome analysis for two parents and two RILs, 24,941 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, 473 of which were promising genes. For the fiber strength (FS) QTLs, 320 DEGs were identified, suggesting that pectin synthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signaling pathways could influence FS, and several transcription factors may regulate fiber development, such as <i>GAE6</i>, <i>C4H</i>, <i>OMT1</i>, <i>AFR18</i>, <i>EIN3</i>, <i>bZIP44</i>, and <i>GAI</i>. Notably, the marker D13_56413025 in <i>qFS-chr18-4</i> provides a potential basis for enhancing fiber quality of upland cotton <i>via</i> marker-assisted breeding and gene cloning of important fiber quality traits.
