The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in the regulation of stomatal movements under water-deficit conditions. The identification of ABA receptors and the ABA signaling core consisting of PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, PP2C protein phosphatases and SnRK2 protein kinases has led to studies that have greatly advanced our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms mediating ABA-induced stomatal closure in the past decade. This review focuses on recent progress in illuminating the regulatory mechanisms of ABA signal transduction, and the physiological importance of basal ABA signaling in stomatal regulation by CO<sub>2</sub> and, as hypothesized here, vapor-pressure deficit. Furthermore, advances in understanding the interactions of ABA and other stomatal signaling pathways are reviewed here. We also review recent studies investigating the use of ABA signaling mechanisms for the manipulation of stomatal conductance and the enhancement of drought tolerance and water-use efficiency of plants.
