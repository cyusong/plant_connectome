Premature leaf senescence has a negative influence on the yield and quality of cotton, and several genes have been found to regulate leaf senescence. Howeer, many underlying transcription factors are yet to be identified. In this study, a NAP-like transcription factor (GhNAP) was isolated from Gossypium hirsutum. GhNAP has the typical NAC structure and a conserved novel subdomain in its divergent transcription activation region (TAR). GhNAP was demonstrated to be a nuclear protein, and it showed transcriptional activation activity in yeast. Furthermore, the expression of GhNAP was closely associated with leaf senescence. GhNAP could rescue the delayed-senescence phenotype of the atnap null mutant. Overexpression of GhNAP could cause precocious senescence in Arabidopsis. However, down-regulation of GhNAP delayed leaf senescence in cotton, and affected cotton yield and its fibre quality. Moreover, the expression of GhNAP can be induced by abscisic acid (ABA), and the delayed leaf senescence phenotype in GhNAPi plants might be caused by the decreased ABA level and reduced expression level of ABA-responsive genes. All of the results suggested that GhNAP could regulate the leaf senescence via the ABA-mediated pathways and was further related to the yield and quality in cotton.
