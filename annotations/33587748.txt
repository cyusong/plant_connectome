Plant cells contain two types of vacuoles, the lytic vacuole (LV) and protein storage vacuole (PSV). LVs are present in vegetative cells, whereas PSVs are found in seed cells. The physiological functions of the two types of vacuole differ. Newly synthesized proteins must be transported to these vacuoles via protein trafficking through the endomembrane system for them to function. Recently, significant advances have been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking to these organelles. Despite these advances, the relationship between the trafficking mechanisms to the LV and PSV remains unclear. Some aspects of the trafficking mechanisms are common to both types of vacuole, but certain aspects are specific to trafficking to either the LV or PSV. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the components involved in protein trafficking to both the LV and PSV and compare them to examine the extent of overlap in the trafficking mechanisms. In addition, we discuss the interconnection between the LV and PSV provided by the protein trafficking machinery and the implications for the identity of these organelles.

LV: !transports proteins to! PSV
Protein trafficking: !connects! LV and PSV
Protein trafficking: !involves components! common and specific to LV/PSV
