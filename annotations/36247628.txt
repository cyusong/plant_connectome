Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a global disease with no effective medication. The fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) can reverse this liver dysfunction, but requires targeted delivery to the liver, which can be achieved <i>via</i> oral administration. Therefore, we fused FGF21 to transferrin (Tf) <i>via</i> a furin cleavage site (F), to promote uptake from the intestine into the portal vein, yielding FGF21-F-Tf, and established its production in both seeds and leaves of commercial <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivars, compared their expression profile and tested the bioavailability and bioactivity in feeding studies. Since biopharmaceuticals need to be produced in a contained environment, e.g., greenhouses in case of plants, the seed production was increased in this setting from 239 to 380 g m<sup>-2</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> seed mass with costs of 1.64 € g<sup>-1</sup> by side branch induction, whereas leaves yielded 8,193 g m<sup>-2</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> leave mass at 0.19 € g<sup>-1</sup>. FGF21-F-Tf expression in transgenic seeds and leaves yielded 6.7 and 5.6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> intact fusion protein, but also 4.5 and 2.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> additional Tf degradation products. Removing the furin site and introducing the liver-targeting peptide PLUS doubled accumulation of intact FGF21-transferrin fusion protein when transiently expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> from 0.8 to 1.6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, whereas truncation of transferrin (nTf338) and reversing the order of FGF21 and nTf338 increased the accumulation to 2.1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and decreased the degradation products to 7% for nTf338-FGF21-PLUS. Application of partially purified nTf338-FGF21-PLUS to FGF21<sup>-/-</sup> mice by oral gavage proved its transfer from the intestine into the blood circulation and acutely affected hepatic mRNA expression. Hence, the medication of NASH <i>via</i> oral delivery of nTf338-FGF21-PLUS containing plants seems possible.
