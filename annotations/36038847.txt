The primary root is the first organ to perceive the stress signals for abiotic stress. In this study, maize plants subjected to drought, heat and combined stresses displayed a significantly reduced primary root length. Metabolic and transcriptional analyses detected 72 and 5,469 differentially expressed metabolites and genes in response to stress conditions, respectively. The functional annotation of differentially expressed metabolites and genes indicated that primary root development was mediated by pathways involving phenylalanine metabolism, hormone metabolism and signaling under stress conditions. Furthermore, we found that the concentration of salicylic acid and two precursors, shikimic acid and phenylalanine, showed rapid negative accumulation after all three stresses. The expression levels of some key genes involved in salicylic acid metabolism and signal transduction were differentially expressed under stress conditions. This study extends our understanding of the mechanism of primary root responses to abiotic stress tolerance in maize.
