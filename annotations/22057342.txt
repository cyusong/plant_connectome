The mobilization of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in planta is a complex process regulated by a number of developmental and environmental cues. Plants possess many Pi transporters that acquire Pi from the rhizosphere and translocate it throughout the plant. A few members of the high-affinity Pht1 family of Pi transporters have been functionally characterized and, for the most part, have been shown to be involved in Pi acquisition. We recently demonstrated that the Arabidopsis Pi transporter, Pht1;5, plays a key role in translocating Pi between tissues. Loss-of-function pht1;5 mutant seedlings accumulated more P in shoots relative to wild type but less in roots. In contrast, overexpression of Pht1;5 resulted in a lower P shoot:root ratio compared with wild type. Also, the rosette leaves of Pht1;5-overexpression plants senesced early and contained less P, whereas reproductive organs accumulated more P than those of wild type. Herein we report the molecular response of disrupting Pht1;5 expression on other factors known to modulate P distribution. The results reveal reciprocal mis-regulation of PHO1, miR399d, and At4 in the pht1;5 mutant and Pht1;5-overexpressor, consistent with the corresponding changes in P distribution in these lines. Together our studies reveal a complex role for Pht1;5 in regulating Pi homeostasis.
