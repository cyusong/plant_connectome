Both biotic and abiotic factors continually affect the phyllospheric ecology of plants. A better understanding of the drivers of phyllospheric community structure and multitrophic interactions is vital for developing plant protection strategies. In this study, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was applied to study how summer climatic factors and bacterial wildfire disease have affected the composition and assembly of the bacterial community of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.) phyllosphere. Our results indicated that three time series groups (T1, T2 and T3) formed significantly distinct clusters. The neutral community model (NCM) and beta nearest taxon index (betaNTI) demonstrated that the overall bacterial community assembly was predominantly driven by stochastic processes. Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) further showed that the complete set of the morbidity and climatic variables together could explain 35.7% of the variation of bacterial communities. The node numbers of the molecular ecological networks (MENs) showed an overall uptrend from T1 to T3. Besides, <i>Pseudomonas</i> is the keystone taxa in the MENs from T1 to T3. PICRUSt2 predictions revealed significantly more abundant genes of osmoprotectant biosynthesis/transport in T2, and more genes for pathogenicity and metabolizing organic substrate in T3. Together, this study provides insights into spatiotemporal patterns, processes and response mechanisms underlying the phyllospheric bacterial community.
