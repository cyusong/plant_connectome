['30486488', 'Plants adapt to abiotic stresses by complex mechanisms involving various  stress-responsive genes. Here, we identified a DEAD-box RNA helicase (RH) gene,  AtRH17, in Arabidopsis, involved in salt-stress responses using activation  tagging, a useful technique for isolating novel stress-responsive genes. AT895,  an activation tagging line, was more tolerant than wild type (WT) under NaCl  treatment during germination and seedling development, and AtRH17 was activated  in AT895. AtRH17 possesses nine well-conserved motifs of DEAD-box RHs, consisting  of motifs Q, I, Ia, Ib, and II-VI. Although at least 12 orthologs of AtRH17 have  been found in various plant species, no paralog occurs in Arabidopsis. AtRH17  protein is subcellularily localized in the nucleus. AtRH17-overexpressing  transgenic plants (OXs) were more tolerant to high concentrations of NaCl and  LiCl compared with WT, but no differences from WT were detected among seedlings  exposed to mannitol and freezing treatments. Moreover, in the mature plant stage,  AtRH17 OXs were also more tolerant to NaCl than WT, but not to drought,  suggesting that AtRH17 is involved specifically in the salt-stress response.  Notably, transcriptions of well-known abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and  ABA-independent stress-response genes were similar or lower in AtRH17 OXs than WT  under salt-stress treatments. Taken together, our findings suggest that AtRH17, a  nuclear DEAD-box RH protein, is involved in salt-stress tolerance, and that its  overexpression confers salt-stress tolerance via a pathway other than the  well-known ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways.', '2018 Nov 28', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms19123777', 'ORCID:']
