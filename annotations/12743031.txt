['12743031', 'In eukaryotes, enzymes of different subcellular compartments participate in the  assembly of membrane lipids. As a consequence, interorganelle lipid transfer is  extensive in growing cells. A prominent example is the transfer of membrane lipid  precursors between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the photosynthetic  thylakoid membranes in plants. Mono- and digalactolipids are typical  photosynthetic membrane lipids. In Arabidopsis, they are derived from one of two  pathways, either synthesized de novo in the plastid, or precursors are imported  from the ER, giving rise to distinct molecular species. Employing a  high-throughput robotic screening procedure generating arrays of spot  chromatograms, mutants of Arabidopsis were isolated, which accumulated unusual  trigalactolipids. In one allelic mutant subclass, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1,  the primary defect caused a disruption in the biosynthesis of ER-derived  thylakoid lipids. Secondarily, a processive galactosyltransferase was activated,  leading to the accumulation of oligogalactolipids. Mutations in a permease-like  protein of the outer chloroplastic envelope are responsible for the primary  biochemical defect. It is proposed that this protein is part of a lipid transfer  complex.', '2003 May 15', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/cdg234', 'Benning']
