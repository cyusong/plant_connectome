Vegetative axillary bud dormancy and outgrowth is regulated by several hormonal and environmental signals. In perennials, the dormancy induced by hormonal and environmental signals has been categorized as eco-, endo- or paradormancy. Over the past several decades para-dormancy has primarily been investigated in eudicot annuals. Recently, we initiated a study using the monoculm phyB mutant (phyB-1) and the freely branching near isogenic wild type (WT) sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) to identify molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways regulating dormancy and out-growth of axillary buds in the grasses. In a paper published in the January 2010 issue of Plant Cell and Environment, we reported the role of branching genes in the inhibition of bud outgrowth by phyB, shade and defoliation signals. Here we present a model that depicts the molecular mechanisms and pathways regulating axillary bud dormancy induced by shade and defoliation signals in the grasses.

phyB: !inhibits! bud outgrowth 
shade: !induces! para-dormancy 
defoliation: !induces! para-dormancy 
branching genes: !regulate! dormancy and outgrowth of axillary buds
