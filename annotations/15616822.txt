The introgressed small-chromosome segment of Agropyron elongatum (Host.) Neviski (Thinopyrum ponticum Podp.) in F5 line II-1-3 of somatic hybrid between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and A. elongatum was localized by sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and karyotype data. Karyotype analysis offered basic data of arm ratios and relative lengths of 21 pairs of chromosomes in parent wheat Jinan177 and hybrid II-1-3. Using special high repetitive sequences pSc119.2 and pAs1 for FISH, the entire B- and D-genome chromosomes were detected. The FISH pattern of hybrid II-1-3 was the same as that of parent wheat. GISH using whole genomic DNA from A. elongatum as probe determined the alien chromatin. Sequential GISH and FISH, in combination with some of the karyotype data, localized the small chromosome segments of A. elongatum on the specific sites of wheat chromosomes 2AL, 1BL, 5BS, 1DL, 2DL and 6DS. FISH with probe OPF-03(1296) from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) detected E-genome chromatin of A. elongatum, which existed in all of the small chromosome segments introgressed. Microsatellite primers characteristic for the chromosome arms above were used to check the localization and reveal the genetic identity. These methods are complementary and provide comprehensive information about the genomic constitution of the hybrid. The relationship between hybrid traits and alien chromatin was discussed.
