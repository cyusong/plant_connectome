Plants modify their internal states to adapt to environmental stresses. Under environmental stress conditions, plants restrict their growth and development and activate defense responses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a major phytohormone that plays a crucial role in the osmotic stress response. In osmotic stress adaptation, plants regulate stomatal closure, osmoprotectant production, and gene expression. Here, we isolated <i>CaPRR2</i> - encoding a pseudo response regulator protein - from the leaves of pepper plants (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>). After exposure to ABA and environmental stresses, such as drought and salt stresses, <i>CaPRR2</i> expression in pepper leaves was significantly altered. Under drought and salt stress conditions, <i>CaPRR2</i>-silenced pepper plants exhibited enhanced osmotic stress tolerance, characterized by an enhanced ABA-induced stomatal closing and high MDA and proline contents, compared to the control pepper plants. Taken together, our data indicate that CaPRR2 negatively regulates osmotic stress tolerance.
