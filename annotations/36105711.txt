Black rot caused by the vascular pathogenic bacterium <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i> (<i>Xcc</i>) is widespread in Brassicaceae plants and an infectious disease that causes large yield losses in oil seed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.). Improvement of resistance through breeding is a crucial strategy to prevent black rot disease in <i>B. napus</i>, but presently hampered by insufficient understanding of <i>Xcc-</i>Brassica interactions. This study compares two EMS-mutagenized <i>B. napus</i> lines that show contrasting resistance levels to their susceptible progenitor. Patterns of differential gene expression between these <i>B. napus</i> lines were evaluated at three time points post inoculation by comparative RNA-seq analysis. In line with the observed disease phenotypes, the susceptible line ZS9m<i>Xcc</i>S-1 displayed a steady amount of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different time points of infection, whereas the resistant line ZS9m<i>Xcc</i>R-1 displayed a gradual increase in DEGs throughout the course of infection. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) pinpointed multiple defense-related hub genes with potential central roles in immunity, including the cell surface receptor genes <i>CRK11</i> and <i>BIR1</i>, and the associated downstream regulatory genes <i>WRKY11</i> and <i>PBL30</i>. KEGG analysis of DEGs belonging to two distinct co-expression modules revealed enriched pathways associated with defense, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling, receptor-mediated immunity, and phytohormone balance. Taken together, our comparative transcriptome analysis provides new avenues to unravel the mechanisms underlying black rot resistance in <i>B. napus</i>.
