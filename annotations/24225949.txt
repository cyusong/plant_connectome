['24225949', 'Chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex mediates cyclic electron  transport around photosystem I and chlororespiration in angiosperms. The Src  homology 3 domain (SH3)-like fold protein NdhS/CRR31 is an NDH subunit that is  necessary for high affinity binding of ferredoxin, indicating that chloroplast  NDH functions as a ferredoxin:plastoquinone oxidoreductase. However, the  mechanism of the interaction between NdhS and ferredoxin is unclear. In this  study, we analyzed their interaction in planta by using site-directed mutagenesis  of NdhS. In general, binding of ferredoxin to its target proteins depends on  electrostatic interaction. In silico analysis predicted the presence of a  positively charged pocket in the SH3-like domain of NdhS, where nine charged  residues are highly conserved among plants. Systematic alteration of these sites  with neutral glutamine revealed that only arginine 193 was required for high NDH  activity in vivo. Further replacement of arginine 193 with negatively charged  aspartate or glutamate or hydrophobic alanine significantly decreased the  efficiency of ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reduction by NDH in ruptured  chloroplasts. Similar results were obtained in in vivo analyses of NDH activity  and electron transport. From these results, we propose that the positive charge  of arginine 193 in the SH3-like domain of NdhS is critical for electrostatic  interaction with ferredoxin in vivo.', '2013 Dec 20', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M113.511584', 'Shikanai']
