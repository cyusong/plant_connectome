Maintenance of mitotic cell clusters such as meristematic cells depends on their capacity to maintain the balance between cell division and cell differentiation necessary to control organ growth. In the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem, the antagonistic interaction of two hormones, auxin and cytokinin, regulates this balance by positioning the transition zone, where mitotically active cells lose their capacity to divide and initiate their differentiation programs. In animals, a major regulator of both cell division and cell differentiation is the tumor suppressor protein RETINOBLASTOMA. Here, we show that similarly to its homolog in animal systems, the plant RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) protein regulates the differentiation of meristematic cells at the transition zone by allowing mRNA accumulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR19 (ARF19), a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation. We show that both RBR and the cytokinin-dependent transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR12 are required to activate the transcription of ARF19, which is involved in promoting cell differentiation and thus root growth.

RBR: !activates! ARF19
ARF19: !promotes! cell differentiation
cytokinin: !regulates! transition zone
ARF19: !regulates! root growth
RBR: !interacts with! ARR12
ARR12: !regulates! transcription of ARF19
