Powdery mildew (PM) disease, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Podosphaera xanthii, is the most reported and destructive disease on cultivated Cucurbita species all over the world. Recently, the appearance of highly aggressive P. xanthii isolates has led to PM outbreaks even in resistant crops, making disease management a very difficult task. To challenge this, breeders rely on genetic characteristics for PM control. Analysis of commercially available intermediate resistance courgette (Cucurbita pepo L. var. cylindrica) varieties using cytological, molecular, and biochemical approaches showed that the plants were under a primed state and induced systemic acquired resistance (SAR) responses, exhibiting enhanced callose production, upregulation of salicylic acid (SA) defense signaling pathway genes, and accumulation of SA and defense metabolites. Additionally, the intermediate resistant varieties showed an altered epigenetic landscape in histone marks that affect transcriptional activation. We demonstrated that courgette plants had enriched H3K4me3 marks on SA-BINDING PROTEIN 2 and YODA (YDA) genes of the Pm-0 interval introgression, a genomic region that confers resistant to Cucurbits against P. xanthii. The open chromatin of SA-BINDING PROTEIN 2 and YDA genes was consistent with genes' differential expression, induced SA pathway, altered stomata characteristics, and activated SAR responses. These findings demonstrate that the altered epigenetic landscape of the intermediate resistant varieties modulates the activation of SA-BINDING PROTEIN 2 and YDA genes leading to induced gene transcription that primes courgette plants.
