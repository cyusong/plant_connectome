['7732004', 'A cDNA corresponding to a putative phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C  (PI-PLC) in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana was cloned by use of the  polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA, designated cAtPLC1, encodes a putative  polypeptide of 561 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 64 kDa. The putative  product includes so-called X and Y domains found in all PI-PLCs identified to  date. In mammalian cells, there are three types of PI-PLC, PLC-beta, -gamma, and  -delta. The overall structure of the putative AtPLC1 protein is most similar to  that of PLC-delta, although the AtPLC1 protein is much smaller than PLCs from  other organisms. The recombinant AtPLC1 protein synthesized in Escherichia coli  was able to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and this activity was  completely dependent on Ca2+, as observed also for mammalian PI-PLCs. These  results suggest that the AtPLC1 gene encodes a genuine PI-PLC of a higher plant.  Northern blot analysis showed that the AtPLC1 gene is expressed at very low  levels in the plant under normal conditions but is induced to a significant  extent under various environmental stresses, such as dehydration, salinity, and  low temperature. These observations suggest that AtPLC1 might be involved in the  signal-transduction pathways of environmental stresses and that an increase in  the level of AtPLC1 might amplify the signal, in a manner that contributes to the  adaptation of the plant to these stresses.', '1995 Apr 25', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.92.9.3903', 'Shinozaki']
