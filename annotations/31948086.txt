Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroidal phytohormones which are key regulators of diverse processes during whole life cycle of plants. Studies conducted in the dicot model species <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> have allowed identification and characterization of various components of the BR signaling. It is currently known that the BR signaling is interconnected at various stages with other phytohormonal and stress signaling pathways. It enables a rapid and efficient adaptation of plant metabolism to constantly changing environmental conditions. However, our knowledge about mechanism of the BR signaling in the monocot species is rather limited. Thus, identification of new components of the BR signaling in monocots, including cereals, is an ongoing process and has already led to identification of some monocot-specific components of the BR signaling. It is of great importance as disturbances in the BR signaling influence architecture of mutant plants, and as a consequence, the reaction to environmental conditions. Currently, the modulation of the BR signaling is considered as a target to enhance yield and stress tolerance in cereals, which is of particular importance in the face of global climate change.
