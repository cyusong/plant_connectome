The leaf erectness profile has been used to optimize plant architecture since erect leaves can enhance photosynthesis and dry matter production by greater sunlight capture. Brassinosteroid is a recent class of phytohormones that has been related to a more erect profile. There are no reports in the literature of the genetic variability of leaf angle in doubled haploid durum wheat populations; most studies on leaf angle have focused on the inheritance. Our aim was to study the genetic variation in flag and penultimate leaf angle in a durum wheat doubled haploid mapping population, identifying and mapping quantitative trait loci influencing leaf angle. An F(1)-derived doubled haploid population of 89 lines from the cross Strongfield/Blackbird was used to construct a genetic map using 423 molecular marker loci. Two greenhouse experiments and one field test were conducted using an alpha lattice in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The leaf angle was measured on flag and penultimate leaf with a protractor at three different growth stages. The results indicated poor to moderate correlations between the position of the leaf angle and the growth stage. Transgressive segregation beyond Strongfield and Blackbird of leaf angle was observed for all environments. Putative trait loci were identified on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4B, 5B and 7A. This work helps to understand the genetics of leaf angle in durum wheat.
