Fusarium wilt of spinach, caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i>, is an important disease during warm conditions in production regions with acid soils, yet little is known about what confers pathogenicity to spinach in <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i> genetically. To identify candidate fungal genes that contribute to spinach Fusarium wilt, each of 69 geographically diverse <i>F. oxysporum</i> isolates was tested for pathogenicity on each of three spinach inbreds. Thirty-nine isolates identified as <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i> caused quantitative differences in disease severity among the inbreds that revealed two distinct pathogenicity groups of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i>. Putative effector gene profiles, predicted from whole-genome sequences generated for nine <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i> isolates and five nonpathogenic, spinach-associated <i>F. oxysporum</i> (NPS) isolates, distinguished the <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i> isolates from the NPS isolates, and separated the <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i> isolates into two groups. Five of the putative effector genes appeared to be unique to <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i>, as they were not found in 222 other publicly available genome assemblies of <i>F. oxysporum</i>, implicating potential involvement of these genes in pathogenicity to spinach. In addition, two combinations of the 14 known <i>Secreted in Xylem</i> (<i>SIX</i>) genes that have been affiliated with host pathogenicity in other formae speciales of <i>F. oxysporum</i> were identified in genome assemblies of the nine <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i> isolates, either <i>SIX8</i> and <i>SIX9</i> or <i>SIX4</i>, <i>SIX8</i>, and <i>SIX14</i>. Characterization of these putative effector genes should aid in understanding mechanisms of pathogenicity in <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i>, developing molecular tools for rapid detection and quantification of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>spinaciae</i>, and breeding for resistance to Fusarium wilt in spinach.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
