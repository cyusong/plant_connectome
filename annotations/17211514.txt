Wheat is the most widely adapted crop to abiotic stresses and considered an excellent system to study stress tolerance in spite of its genetic complexity. Recent studies indicated that several hundred genes are either up- or down-regulated in response to stress treatment. To elucidate the function of some of these genes, an interactome of proteins associated with abiotic stress response and development in wheat was generated using the yeast two-hybrid GAL4 system and specific protein interaction assays. The interactome is comprised of 73 proteins, generating 97 interactions pairs. Twenty-one interactions were confirmed by bimolecular fluorescent complementation in Nicotiana benthamiana. A confidence-scoring system was elaborated to evaluate the significance of the interactions. The main feature of this interactome is that almost all bait proteins along with their interactors were interconnected, creating a spider web-like structure. The interactome revealed also the presence of a "cluster of proteins involved in flowering control" in three- and four-protein interaction loops. This network provides a novel insight into the complex relationships among transcription factors known to play central roles in vernalization, flower initiation and abscisic acid signaling, as well as associations that tie abiotic stress with other regulatory and signaling proteins. This analysis provides useful information in elucidating the molecular mechanism associated with abiotic stress response in plants.
