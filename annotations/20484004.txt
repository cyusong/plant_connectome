['20484004', 'Hsp70 family proteins function as motors driving protein translocation into  mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Whether Hsp70 is involved in protein  import into chloroplasts has not been resolved. We show here Arabidopsis thaliana  knockout mutants of either of the two stromal cpHsc70s, cpHsc70-1 and cpHsc70-2,  are defective in protein import into chloroplasts during early developmental  stages. Protein import was found to be affected at the step of precursor  translocation across the envelope membranes. From solubilized envelope membranes,  stromal cpHsc70 was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with importing precursors  and stoichiometric amounts of Tic110 and Hsp93. Moreover, in contrast with  receptors at the outer envelope membrane, cpHsp70 is important for the import of  both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic proteins. These data indicate that  cpHsc70 is part of the chloroplast translocon for general import and is important  for driving translocation into the stroma. We further analyzed the relationship  of cpHsc70 with the other suggested motor system, Hsp93/Tic40. Chloroplasts from  the cphsc70-1 hsp93-V double mutant had a more severe import defect than did the  single mutants, suggesting that the two proteins function in parallel. The  cphsc70-1 tic40 double knockout was lethal, further indicating that cpHsc70-1 and  Tic40 have an overlapping essential function. In conclusion, our data indicate  that chloroplasts have two chaperone systems facilitating protein translocation  into the stroma: the cpHsc70 system and the Hsp93/Tic40 system.', '2010 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.071415', 'Li']
