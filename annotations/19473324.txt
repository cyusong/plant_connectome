['19473324', "In foliar organs of dicots, veins are arranged in a highly branched or  reticulated pattern for efficient distribution of water, photosynthates and  signaling molecules. Recent evidence suggests that the patterns rely in part on  regulation of intracellular vesicle transport and cell polarity in selected cells  during leaf development. The sorting of vesicle cargos to discrete cellular sites  is regulated in yeast and animal cells by the binding of specific  phosphoinositides (PIs). We report here that, in the plant Arabidopsis, specific  PIs guide the vesicle traffic that is essential for polarized and continuous vein  pattern formation. Mutations in SFC/VAN3, an ADP-ribosylation factor  GTPase-activating protein (ARF GAP) with a PI-binding pleckstrin homology domain,  result in discontinuous vein patterns. Plants with mutations in both CVP2 and  CVL1, which encode inositol polyphosphate 5'-phosphatases that generate the  specific PI ligand for the pleckstrin homology domain of SFC/VAN3,  phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PI(4)P), have a discontinuous vein  phenotype identical to that of sfc/van3 mutants. Single cvp2 or cvl1 mutants show  weak and no discontinuous vein phenotypes, respectively, suggesting that they act  redundantly. We propose that these two 5'-phosphatases regulate vein continuity  and cell polarity by generating a specific PI ligand for SFC/VAN3.", '2009 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03920.x', 'Nelson']
