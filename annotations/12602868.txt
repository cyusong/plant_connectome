['12602868', "The Arabidopsis genome possesses a number of sequences that are predicted to  encode proteins that are similar to mammalian and yeast polyadenylation factor  subunits. One of these resides on chromosome V and has the potential to encode a  polypeptide related to the 100 kDa subunit of the mammalian cleavage and  polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). This gene encodes a ca. 2400  nucleotide mRNA that in turn can be translated to yield a polypeptide that is 39%  identical to the mammalian CPSF100 protein. Antibodies raised against the  Arabidopsis protein recognized distinctive polypeptides in nuclear extracts  prepared from pea and wheat germ, consistent with the hypothesis that the  Arabidopsis protein is resident in a nuclear polyadenylation complex.  Interestingly, the Arabidopsis CPSF100 was found to interact with a portion of a  nuclear poly(A) polymerase. This interaction was attributable to a 60 amino acid  domain in the CPSF100 polypeptide and the N-terminal 220 amino acids of the  poly(A) polymerase. An analogous interaction has yet to be described in other  eukaryotes. The interaction with PAP thus indicates that the plant CPSF100  polypeptide is likely part of the 3'-end processing machinery, but suggests that  this complex may function differently in plants than it does in mammals and  yeast.", '2003 Feb', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1022035219500', 'Hunt']
