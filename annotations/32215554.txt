Light and temperature shape the developmental trajectory and morphology of plants. Changes in chromatin organization and nuclear architecture can modulate gene expression and lead to short- and long-term plant adaptation to the environment. Here, we review recent reports investigating how changes in chromatin composition, structure, and topology modulate gene expression in response to fluctuating light and temperature conditions resulting in developmental and physiological responses. Furthermore, the potential application of novel revolutionary techniques, such Hi-C, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and padlock-FISH, to study the impact of environmental stimuli such as light and temperature on nuclear compartmentalization in plants is discussed.
