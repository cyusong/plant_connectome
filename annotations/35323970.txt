Drought significantly affects stomatal regulation, leading to the reduced growth and productivity of plants. Plant 14-3-3 proteins were reported to participate in drought response by regulating the activities of a wide array of target proteins. However, the molecular evolution, expression pattern and physiological functions of 14-3-3s under drought stress remain unclear. In this study, a comparative genomic analysis and the tissue-specific expression of 14-3-3s revealed the highly conserved and early evolution of 14-3-3s in green plants and duplication and expansion of the 14-3-3s family members in angiosperms. Using barley (Hordeum vulgare) for the functional characterization of 14-3-3 proteins, the transcripts of five members out of six Hv14-3-3s were highly induced by drought in the drought-tolerant line, XZ141. Suppression of the expression of Hv14-3-3A through barley stripe mosaic virus-virus induced gene silencing resulted in significantly increased drought sensitivity and stomatal density as well as significantly reduced net CO2 assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) in barley. Moreover, we showed the functional interactions between Hv14-3-3s and key proteins in drought and stomatal responses in plants-such as Open Stomata 1 (HvOST1), Slow Anion Channel 1 (HvSLAC1), three Heat Shock Proteins (HvHSP90-1/2/5) and Dehydration-Responsive Element-Binding 3 (HvDREB3). Taken together, we propose that 14-3-3s are highly evolutionarily conserved proteins and that Hv14-3-3s represent a group of the core regulatory components for the rapid stomatal response to drought in barley. This study will provide important evolutionary and molecular evidence for future applications of 14-3-3 proteins in breeding drought-tolerant crops in a changing global climate.
