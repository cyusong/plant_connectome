The VlMYBA subfamily of transcription factors has been known to be the functional regulators in anthocyanin biosynthesis in red grapes. In this study, the expressions of the VlMYBA1-2 and VlMYBA 2 genes, and the responses of the VlMYBA1-2/2 promoters to ABA and ACC treatments in Kyoho grape berries are examined through quantitative real-time PCR analysis and the transient expression assay. The results show that the expressions of VlMYBA1-2/2 increase dramatically after véraison and reach their highest levels when the berries are nearly fully ripe. Exogenous ABA promotes the expressions of VlMYBA1-2/2, whereas the ACC treatment increases the expression of VlMYBA2, however, it has no effect on VlMYBA1-2. The ABA treatment has a faster and stronger effect on berry pigmentation than ACC does. The VlMYBA1-2 promoter sequence contains two ABA response elements (ABRE) but no ethylene response element (ERE), whereas the VlMYBA2 promoter sequence contains two ABRE and one ERE in the upstream region of the start codon. The VlMYBA2 promoter can be activated by both ABA (more effective) and ACC, whereas the VlMYBA1-2 promoter can be activated by ABA only. In sum, ABA can promote the coloring of Kyoho grape by the promotion of VlMYBA1-2/2 transcriptions via activating the response of their promoters to ABA, whereas ethylene only regulates VlMYBA2 through the response activation of its promoter to ACC which partially enhances the coloring.
