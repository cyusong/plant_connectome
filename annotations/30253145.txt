Heterosis, also known as 'hybrid vigor', is a well-known phenomenon whereby hybrid offspring resulting from cross pollination exhibit greater vigor than either parent. Here, Hochholdinger and Baldauf provide an overview of this fascinating biological phenomenon and what is known about the underlying genetics and mechanisms.
