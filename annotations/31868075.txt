Abiotic stress is a major threat to plant growth and development, resulting in extensive crop loss worldwide. Plants react to abiotic stresses through physiological, biochemical, molecular, and genetic adaptations that promote survival. Exploring the molecular mechanisms involved in abiotic stress responses across various plant species is essential for improving crop yields in unfavorable environments. Halophytes are characterized as plants that survive to reproduce in soils containing high salt concentrations, and thus act as an ideal model to comprehend complicated genetic and physiological mechanisms of salinity stress tolerance. Plant ecologists classify halophytes into three main groups: euhalophytes, recretohalophytes, and pseudo-halophytes. Recent genetic and molecular research has showed complicated regulatory networks by which halophytes coordinate stress adaptation and tolerance. Furthermore, investigation of natural variations in these stress responses has supplied new perspectives on the evolution of mechanisms that regulate tolerance and adaptation. This review discusses the current understanding of the genetic mechanisms that contribute to salt-stress tolerance among different classes of halophytes.
