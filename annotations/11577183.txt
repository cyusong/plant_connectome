['11577183', 'The gene encoding voltage-gated channel with high affinity for Ca(2+) permeation  has not been cloned from plants. In the present study, we isolated a full-length  cDNA encoding a putative Ca(2+ )channel (AtTPC1) from Arabidopsis. AtTPC1 has two  conserved homologous domains, both of which contain six transmembrane segments  (S1-S6) and a pore loop (P) between S5 and S6 in each domain, and has the highest  homology with the two pore channel TPC1 recently cloned from rat. The overall  structure is similar to the half of the general structure of alpha-subunits of  voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels from animals. AtTPC1 rescued the Ca(2+) uptake  activity of a yeast mutant cch1. Sucrose-induced luminescence, which reflects a  cytosolic free Ca(2+) increase in aequorin-expressing Arabidopsis leaves, was  enhanced by overexpression of AtTPC1 and suppressed by antisense expression of  it. Sucrose-H(+) symporters AtSUC1 and 2, which depolarize membrane potential of  cells receiving sucrose, also depressed a Ca(2+) increase by their antisense  expression. These results suggest that AtTPC1 mediates a voltage-activated Ca(2+  )influx in Arabidopsis leaf cells.', '2001 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pce145', 'Muto']
