['20739305', 'Arabidopsis ATSIP2 has recently been suggested to be a raffinose synthase gene.  However, it has high amino acid identity to functionally characterized alkaline  alpha-galactosidases from Cucumis melo and Zea mays. Using the Sf9 insect cell  expression system, we demonstrate that recombinant ATSIP2 is a genuine alkaline  alpha-galactosidase with a distinct substrate specificity for raffinose, and not a  raffinose synthase. A beta-glucuronidase reporter construct using the ATSIP2  promoter shows that ATSIP2 is strongly expressed in sink tissues of Arabidopsis,  i.e. sink leaves and non-xylem parts of the root stele, suggesting a  physiological function in raffinose phloem unloading.', '2010 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcq127', 'Keller']
