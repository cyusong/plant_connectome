['11461929', "The established pathways from serine to ethanolamine are indirect and involve  decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Here we show that plants can decarboxylate  serine directly. Using a radioassay based on ethanolamine (Etn) formation,  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent l-serine decarboxylase (SDC) activity was  readily detected in soluble extracts from leaves of diverse species, including  spinach, Arabidopsis, and rapeseed. A putative Arabidopsis SDC cDNA was  identified by searching GenBank for sequences homologous to other amino acid  decarboxylases and shown by expression in Escherichia coli to encode a soluble  protein with SDC activity. This cDNA was further authenticated by complementing  the Etn requirement of a yeast psd1 psd2 mutant. In a parallel approach, a cDNA  was isolated from a rapeseed library by its ability to complement the Etn  requirement of a yeast cho1 mutant and shown by expression in E. coli to specify  SDC. The deduced Arabidopsis and rapeseed SDC polypeptides are 90% identical,  lack obvious targeting signals, and belong to amino acid decarboxylase group II.  Recombinant Arabidopsis SDC was shown to exist as a tetramer and to contain  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. It does not attack d-serine, l-phosphoserine, other  l-amino acids, or phosphatidylserine and is not inhibited by Etn, choline, or  their phosphoesters. As a soluble, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzyme, SDC contrasts  sharply with phosphatidylserine decarboxylases, which are membrane proteins that  have a pyruvoyl cofactor.", '2001 Sep 21', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M106038200', 'Hanson']
