In order to examine whether polyamines (PAs) modify the functioning of the scavenging system and oxidative stress levels in water-stressed plants, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings were treated with spermidine (Spd) prior to dehydration, and stress-evoked changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), guaiacol peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) activities, H(2)O(2) and superoxide radical levels were determined. Free PA content during Spd treatment and during the stress period were also determined. Exogenous application of Spd differentially influenced enzymes of the antioxidative system under stress conditions; we observed an increase of guaiacol peroxidase activity, and, to a lesser degree, a reduction of SOD and catalase activities in Spd-treated plants in comparison to untreated stressed plants. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical contents were also reduced in stressed plants after Spd pretreatment. These positive effects were observed in the case of 1mM Spd concentration. A higher concentration (3mM) influenced negative, more significant stress-induced changes, but a lower concentration (0.1mM) had a very limited effect. In summary, PAs are able to moderate the activities of scavenging system enzymes and to influence oxidative stress intensity.

Spermidine: !moderates! scavenging system enzymes
Spermidine: !influences! oxidative stress intensity
Scavenging system enzymes: !increase! guaiacol peroxidase activity
Scavenging system enzymes: !reduce! SOD and catalase activities
Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical contents: !reduce! in stressed plants after Spd pretreatment
