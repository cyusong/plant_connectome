Here we examined the mechanism of propagation of variation potential (VP) induced by burning in wheat leaves. Participation of hydraulic and chemical mechanisms in VP transmission was analyzed by optical coherent tomography and a radioactive tracer method, respectively. The speed of the hydraulic signal considerably exceeded the VP velocity. Investigation of a chemical substance spreading from the zone of local wounding was based on experimental data for radioactive marker transmission derived with a one-dimensional diffusion equation. The speed of the marker transmission was in accordance with VP velocity. The elimination of the potential transmission of a chemical signal by a timed severing of the leaf between the burn site and the recorded site blocked VP propagation. We suggest that a VP is formed by the transmission of a wound substance, the velocity of which is likely increased by hydraulic wave propagation.
