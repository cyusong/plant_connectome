['9620857', 'To investigate the relationship between cytosine methylation and gene silencing  in Arabidopsis, we constructed strains containing the ddm1 hypomethylation  mutation and a methylated and silenced PAI2 tryptophan biosynthetic gene (MePAI2)  that results in a blue fluorescent plant phenotype. The ddm1 mutation had both an  immediate and a progressive effect on PAI gene silencing. In the first  generation, homozygous ddm1 MePAI2 plants displayed a weakly fluorescent  phenotype, in contrast to the strongly fluorescent phenotype of the DDM1 MePAI2  parent. After two generations of inbreeding by self-pollination, the ddm1/ddm1  lines became nonfluorescent. The progressive loss of fluorescence correlated with  a progressive loss of methylation from the PAI2 gene. These results indicate that  methylation is necessary for maintenance of PAI gene silencing and that  intermediate levels of DNA methylation are associated with intermediate gene  silencing. The results also support our earlier hypothesis that ddm1 homozygotes  act as "epigenetic mutators" by accumulating heritable changes in DNA methylation  that can lead to changes in gene expression.', '1998 Jun 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.12.11.1714', 'Richards']
