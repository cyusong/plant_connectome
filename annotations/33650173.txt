Cell wall invertase (CWIN) hydrolyses sucrose into glucose and fructose in the extracellular matrix and plays crucial roles in assimilate partitioning and sugar signalling. However, the molecular regulators controlling CWIN gene transcription remain unknown. As the first step to address this issue, we performed bioinformatic and transgenic studies, which identified a cohort of transcription factors (TFs) modulating CWIN gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses identified 18 TFs as putative regulators of the expression of AtCWIN2 and AtCWIN4 that are predominantly expressed in Arabidopsis reproductive organs. Among them, MYB21, ARF6, ARF8, AP3 and CRC were subsequently shown to be the most likely regulators of CWIN gene expression based on molecular characterization of the respective mutant of each candidate TF. More specifically, the obtained data indicate that ARF6, ARF8 and MYB21 regulate CWIN2 expression in the anthers and CWIN4 in nectaries, anthers and petals, whereas AP3 and CRC were determined primarily to regulate the transcriptional activity of CWIN4. TF-promoter interaction assays demonstrated that ARF6 and ARF8 directly control CWIN2 and CWIN4 transcription with AP3 activating CWIN4. The involvement of ARF8 in regulating CWIN4 expression was further supported by the finding that enhanced CWIN4 expression partially recovered the short silique phenotype displayed by the arf8-3 mutant. The identification of the five TFs regulating CWIN expression serves as a launching pad for future studies to dissect the upstream molecular network underpinning the transcription of CWINs and provides a new avenue, potentially, to engineer assimilate allocation and reproductive development for improving seed yield.
