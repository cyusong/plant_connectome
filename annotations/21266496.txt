In maize (Zea mays L.), chloroplast development progresses from the basal meristem to the mature leaf tip, and light is required for maturation to photosynthetic competence. During chloroplast greening, it was found that chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is extensively degraded, falling to undetectable levels in many individual chloroplasts for three maize cultivars, as well as Zea mexicana (the ancestor of cultivated maize) and the perennial species Zea diploperennis. In dark-grown maize seedlings, the proplastid-to-etioplast transition is characterized by plastid enlargement, cpDNA replication, and the retention of high levels of cpDNA. When dark-grown seedlings are transferred to white light, the DNA content per plastid increases slightly during the first 4 h of illumination and then declines rapidly to a minimum at 24 h during the etioplast-to-chloroplast transition. Plastid autofluorescence (from chlorophyll) continues to increase as cpDNA declines, whereas plastid size remains constant. It is concluded that the increase in cpDNA that accompanies plastid enlargement is a consequence of cell and leaf growth, rather than illumination, whereas light stimulates photosynthetic capacity and cpDNA instability. When cpDNA from total tissue was monitored by blot hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR, no decline following transfer from dark to light was observed. The lack of agreement between DNA per plastid and cpDNA per cell may be attributed to nupts (nuclear sequences of plastid origin).
