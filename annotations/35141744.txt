The chloroplast is essential for photosynthesis, plant growth and development. As semiautonomous organelles, the biogenesis and development of chloroplasts need to be well-regulated during plant growth and stress responses. Low or high ambient temperatures are adverse environmental stresses that affect crop growth and productivity. As sessile organisms, plants regulate the development and function of chloroplasts in a fluctuating temperature environment to maintain normal photosynthesis. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms and regulatory factors required for chloroplast biogenesis and development under cold or heat stress conditions and highlights the importance of chloroplast gene transcription, RNA metabolism, ribosome function and protein homeostasis essential for chloroplast development under adverse temperature conditions.
