Nitric oxide (NO) is extensively involved in various growth processes and stress responses in plants; however, the regulatory mechanism of NO-modulated cellular sugar metabolism is still largely unknown. Here, we report that NO significantly inhibited monosaccharide catabolism by modulating sugar metabolic enzymes through S-nitrosylation (mainly by oxidizing dihydrolipoamide, a cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase). These S-nitrosylation modifications led to a decrease in cellular glycolysis enzymes and ATP synthase activities as well as declines in the content of acetyl coenzyme A, ATP, ADP-glucose and UDP-glucose, which eventually caused polysaccharide-biosynthesis inhibition and monosaccharide accumulation. Plant developmental defects that were caused by high levels of NO included delayed flowering time, retarded root growth and reduced starch granule formation. These phenotypic defects could be mediated by sucrose supplementation, suggesting an essential role of NO-sugar cross-talks in plant growth and development. Our findings suggest that molecular manipulations could be used to improve fruit and vegetable sweetness.
