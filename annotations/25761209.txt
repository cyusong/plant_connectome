Potato virus Y (PVY) is an economically important plant virus that infects Solanaceous crops such as tobacco and potato. To date, studies into the localization and movement of PVY in plants have been limited to detection of viral RNA or proteins ex vivo. Here, a PVY N605 isolate was tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), characterized and used for in vivo tracking. In Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi, PVY N605-GFP was biologically comparable to nontagged PVY N605, stable through three plant-to-plant passages and persisted for four months in infected plants. GFP was detected before symptoms and fluorescence intensity correlated with PVY RNA concentrations. PVY N605-GFP provided in vivo tracking of long-distance movement, allowing estimation of the cell-to-cell movement rate of PVY in N. tabacum cv. Xanthi (7.1 ± 1.5 cells per hour). PVY N605-GFP was adequately stable in Solanum tuberosum cvs. Désirée and NahG-Désirée and able to infect S. tuberosum cvs. Bintje and Bea, Nicotiana benthamiana, and wild potato relatives. PVY N605-GFP is therefore a powerful tool for future studies of PVY-host interactions, such as functional analysis of viral and plant genes involved in viral movement.
