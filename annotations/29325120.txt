Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is a mutualistic association between most plant species and the ancient fungal phylum Glomeromycota in roots, and it plays a key role in a plant's nutrient uptake from the soil. Roots synthesize strigolactones (SLs), derivatives of carotenoids, and exude them to induce energy metabolism and hyphal branching of AM fungi. Despite the well-documented roles of SLs in the pre-symbiotic phase, little is known about the role of SLs in the process of root colonization. Here we show that the expansion of root colonization is suppressed in the mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) SL biosynthesis genes, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase D10 and more severely in D17. Interestingly, most of the colonization process is normal, i.e. AM fungal hyphae approach the roots and cling around them, and epidermal penetration, arbuscule size, arbuscule number per hyphopodium and metabolic activity of the intraradical mycelium are not affected in d10 and d17 mutants. In contrast, hyphopodium formation is severely attenuated. Our observations establish the requirement for SL biosynthesis genes for efficient hyphopodium formation, suggesting that SLs are required in this process. Efficient hyphopodium formation is required for the punctual internalization of hyphae into roots and maintaining the expansion of colonization.
