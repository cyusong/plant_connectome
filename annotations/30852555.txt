['30852555', 'Cell-to-cell adhesion is essential for establishment of multicellularity. In  plants, such adhesion is mediated through a middle lamella composed primarily of  pectic polysaccharides. The molecular interactions that influence cell-to-cell  adhesion are not fully understood. We have used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) seed coat mucilage as a model system to investigate interactions  between cell wall carbohydrates. Using a forward-genetic approach, we have  discovered a gene, RUBY PARTICLES IN MUCILAGE (RUBY), encoding a protein that is  annotated as a member of the Auxiliary Activity 5 (AA5) family of  Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (Gal/glyoxal oxidases) and is secreted to the  apoplast late in the differentiation of seed coat epidermal cells. We show that  RUBY is required for the Gal oxidase activity of intact seeds; the oxidation of  Gal in side-chains of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) present in mucilage-modified2  (mum2) mucilage, but not in wild-type mucilage; the retention of branched RG-I in  the seed following extrusion; and the enhancement of cell-to-cell adhesion in the  seed coat epidermis. These data support the hypothesis that RUBY is a Gal oxidase  that strengthens pectin cohesion within the middle lamella, and possibly the  mucilage of wild-type seed coat epidermal cells, through oxidation of RG-I Gal  side-chains.', '2019 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00954', 'ORCID:']
