Improvement of crop production in response to rapidly changing environmental conditions is a serious challenge facing plant breeders and biotechnologists. Iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) are essential micronutrients for plant growth and reproduction. These minerals are critical to several cellular processes including metabolism, photosynthesis, and cellular respiration. Regulating the uptake and distribution of these minerals could significantly improve plant growth and development, ultimately leading to increased crop production. Plant growth is limited by mineral deficiency, but on the other hand, excess Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn can be toxic to plants; therefore, their uptake and distribution must be strictly regulated. Moreover, the distribution of these metals among subcellular organelles is extremely important for maintaining optimal cellular metabolism. Understanding the mechanisms controlling subcellular metal distribution and availability would enable development of crop plants that are better adapted to challenging and rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here, we describe advances in understanding of subcellular metal homeostasis, with a particular emphasis on cellular Fe homeostasis in Arabidopsis and rice, and discuss strategies for regulating cellular metabolism to improve plant production.
