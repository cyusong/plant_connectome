['15851402', 'Dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings develop an apical hook by differential cell  elongation and division, a process driven by cross-talk between multiple  hormones. Auxins, ethylene and gibberellins interact in the formation of the  apical hook. In the light, a similar complexity of hormonal regulation has been  revealed at the level of hypocotyl elongation. Here, we describe the involvement  of brassinosteroids (BRs) in auxin- and ethylene-controlled processes in the  hypocotyls of both light- and dark-grown seedlings. We show that BR biosynthesis  is necessary for the formation of an exaggerated apical hook and that either  application of BRs or disruption of BR synthesis alters auxin response,  presumably by affecting auxin transport, eventually resulting in the  disappearance of the apical hook. Furthermore, we demonstrate that  ethylene-stimulated hypocotyl elongation in the light is largely controlled by  the same mechanisms as those governing formation of the apical hook in darkness.  However, in the light, BRs appear to compensate for the insensitivity to ethylene  in hls mutants, supporting a downstream action of BRs. Hence, our results  indicate that HLS1, SUR1/HLS3/RTY1/ALF1 and AMP1/HPT/COP2/HLS2/PT act on the  auxin-ethylene interaction, rather than at the level of BRs. A model for the  tripartite hormone interactions is presented.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pci111', 'Van']
