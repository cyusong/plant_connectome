Glutathione (GSH) is one of the main antioxidants in plants. Legumes have the specificity to produce a GSH homolog, homoglutathione (hGSH). We have investigated the regulation of GSH and hGSH synthesis by nitric oxide (NO) in Medicago truncatula roots. Analysis of the expression level of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-ECS), glutathione synthetase (GSHS) and homoglutathione synthetase (hGSHS) after treatment with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), two NO-donors, showed that gamma-ecs and gshs genes are up regulated by NO treatment whereas hgshs expression is not. Differential accumulation of GSH was correlated to gene expression in SNP-treated roots. Our results provide the first evidence that GSH synthesis pathway is regulated by NO in plants and that there is a differential regulation between gshs and hgshs in M. truncatula.
