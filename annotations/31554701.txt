['31554701', 'NADP(H) is an essential cofactor of multiple metabolic processes in all living  organisms, and in plants, NADP(H) is required as the substrate of  Ca(2+)-dependent NADPH oxidases, which catalyze a reactive oxygen species burst  in response to various stimuli. While NADP(+) production in plants has long been  known to involve a calmodulin (CaM)/Ca(2+)-dependent NAD(+) kinase, the nature of  the enzyme catalyzing this activity has remained enigmatic, as has its role in  plant physiology. Here, we used proteomic, biochemical, molecular, and in vivo  analyses to identify an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein that catalyzes  NADP(+) production exclusively in the presence of CaM/Ca(2+) This enzyme, which  we named NAD kinase-CaM dependent (NADKc), has a CaM-binding peptide located in  its N-terminal region and displays peculiar biochemical properties as well as  different domain organization compared with known plant NAD(+) kinases. In  response to a pathogen elicitor, the activity of NADKc, which is associated with  the mitochondrial periphery, contributes to an increase in the cellular NADP(+)  concentration and to the amplification of the elicitor-induced oxidative burst.  Based on a phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays, we propose that the  CaM/Ca(2+)-dependent NAD(+) kinase activity found in photosynthetic organisms is  carried out by NADKc-related proteins. Thus, NADKc represents the missing link  between Ca(2+) signaling, metabolism, and the oxidative burst.', '2019 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00912', 'ORCID:']
