Individual plants encounter a vast number of microbes including bacteria, viruses, fungi and oomycetes through their growth cycle, yet few of these pathogens are able to infect them. Plant species have diverged over millions of years, co-evolving with few specific pathogens. The host boundaries of most pathogen species can be clearly defined. In general, the greater the genetic divergence from the preferred host, the less likely that pathogen would be able to infect that plant species. Co-evolution and divergence also occur within pathogen species, leading to highly specialized subspecies with narrow host ranges. For example, cereal rust and mildew pathogens (Puccinia and Blumeria spp.) display high host specificity as a result of ongoing co-evolution with a narrow range of grass species. In rare cases, however, some plant species are in a transition from host to nonhost or are intermediate hosts (near nonhost). Barley was reported as a useful model for genetic and molecular studies of nonhost resistance due to rare susceptibility to numerous heterologous rust and mildew fungi. This review evaluates host specificity in numerous Puccinia/Blumeria-cereal pathosystems and discusses various approaches for transferring nonhost resistance (NHR) genes between crop species to reduce the impact of important diseases in food production.
