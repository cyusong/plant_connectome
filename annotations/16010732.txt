Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) proteins, which mediate vesicular transport, have little or no intrinsic GTPase activity. They rely on the action of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for their function. In the present study the OsAGAP gene in rice, which encoded a protein with predicted structure similar to ArfGAP, was identified. The purified OsAGAP-GST fusion protein was able to stimulate the GTPase activity of rice Arf. Furthermore, OsAGAP can rescue the defect of vesicular transport in the yeast gcs1 delta glo3 delta double-mutant cells. Transgenic Arabidopsis with OsAGAP constitutively expression showed reduced apical dominance, shorter primary roots, increasing number of longer adventitious roots. Many of the phenotypes can be phenocopied by treatment of exogenous indoleacetic acid level (IAA) in wild-type plants. Determination of whole-plant IAA level showed that there is a sharp increase of free IAA in OsAGAP transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings. In addition, removal of the 4-day-old shoot apex could inhibit the adventitious root formation in the transgenic seedlings. These results suggest OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP of rice, maybe involved in the mediation of plant root development by regulating auxin level.
