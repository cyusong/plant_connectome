['10542051', 'In all living organisms, deoxyribonucleotides, the DNA precursors, are produced  by reduction of the corresponding ribonucleotides catalyzed by ribonucleotide  reductase. In mammals as in Escherichia coli, the enzyme consists of two  proteins. Protein R1 is the proper reductase as it contains, in the substrate  binding site, the reducing active cysteine pair. Protein R2 provides a  catalytically essential organic radical. Here we report the cloning, expression,  purification and characterization of protein R1 from Arabidopsis thaliana.  Expression in E. coli was made possible by coexpression of tRNAArg4 which is  required for the utilization of AGA and AGG as codons for arginines. Protein R1  shows extensive similarities with protein R1 from mammals: (a) it shows 69%  amino-acid sequence identity to human and mouse R1 protein; (b) it is active  during CDP reduction by dithiothreitol, in the presence of protein R2  [Sauge-Merle, S., Laulhere, J.-P., Coves, J., Menage, S., Le Pape, L. &  Fontecave, M. (1997) J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2, 586-594]; (c) activity is  stimulated by thioredoxin and ATP and is inhibited by dATP, showing that as in  the mammalian enzyme, the plant ribonucleotide reductase seems to be  allosterically regulated by positive (ATP) and negative (dATP) effectors.', '1999 Nov', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00814.x', 'Fontecave']
