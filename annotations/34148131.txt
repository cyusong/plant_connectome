Both mutant ert-c.1 and ert-d.7 carry T2-T3 translocations in the Ert-c gene. Principal coordinate analyses revealed the translocation types and translocation breakpoints. Mutant ert-d.7 is an Ert-c Ert-d double mutant. Mutations in the Ert-c and Ert-d loci are among the most common barley mutations affecting plant architecture. The mutants have various degrees of erect and compact spikes, often accompanied with short and stiff culms. In the current study, complementation tests, linkage mapping, principal coordinate analyses and fine mapping were conducted. We conclude that the original ert-d.7 mutant does not only carry an ert-d mutation but also an ert-c mutation. Combined, mutations in Ert-c and Ert-d cause a pyramid-dense spike phenotype, whereas mutations in only Ert-c or Ert-d give a pyramid and dense phenotype, respectively. Associations between the Ert-c gene and T2-T3 translocations were detected in both mutant ert-c.1 and ert-d.7. Different genetic association patterns indicate different translocation breakpoints in these two mutants. Principal coordinate analysis based on genetic distance and screening of recombinants from all four ends of polymorphic regions was an efficient way to narrow down the region of interest in translocation-involved populations. The Ert-c gene was mapped to the marker interval of 2_0801to1_0224 on 3HL near the centromere. The results illuminate a complex connection between two single genes having additive effects on barley spike architecture and will facilitate the identification of the Ert-c and Ert-d genes.
