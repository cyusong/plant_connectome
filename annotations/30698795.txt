With few exceptions, terrestrial plants are anchored to substrates by roots that experience bending and twisting forces resulting from gravity- and wind-induced forces. Mechanical failure occurs when these forces exceed the flexural or torsional tolerance limits of stems or roots, or when roots are dislodged from their substrate. The emphasis of this review is on the general principles of anchorage, how the mechanical failure of root anchorage can be averted, and recommendations for future research.
