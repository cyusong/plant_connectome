Various plants possess hydrophilic chlorophyll (Chl) proteins known as water-soluble Chl-binding proteins (WSCPs). WSCPs exist in two forms: Class I and Class II, of which Class I alone exhibits unique photoconvertibility. Although numerous genes encoding Class II WSCPs have been identified and the molecular properties of their recombinant proteins have been well characterized, no Class I WSCP gene has been identified to date. In this study, we cloned the cDNA and a gene encoding the Class I WSCP of Chenopodium album (CaWSCP). Sequence analyses revealed that CaWSCP comprises a single exon corresponding to 585bp of an open reading frame encoding 195 amino acid residues. The CaWSCP protein sequence possesses a signature of DUF538, a protein superfamily of unknown function found almost exclusively in Embryophyta. The recombinant CaWSCP was expressed in Escherichia coli as a hexa-histidine fusion protein (CaWSCP-His) that removes Chls from the thylakoid. Under visible light illumination, the reconstituted CaWSCP-His was successfully photoconverted into a different pigment with an absorption spectrum identical to that of native CaWSCP. Interestingly, while CaWSCP-His could bind both Chl a and Chl b, photoconversion occurred only in CaWSCP-His reconstituted with Chl a.
