Transmission ratio distortion (TRD) refers to a widespread phenomenon in which one allele is transmitted by heterozygotes more frequently to the progeny than the opposite allele. TRD is considered as a mark suggesting the presence of a reproductive barrier. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying TRD in rice remain largely unknown. In the present study, a population of backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from the cross of a <i>japonica</i> cultivar Nipponbare (NIP) and an <i>indica</i> variety 9311 was utilized to study the genetic base of TRD. A total of 18 genomic regions were identified for TRD in the BILs. Among them, 12 and 6 regions showed <i>indica</i> (9311) and <i>japonica</i> (NIP) alleles with preferential transmission, respectively. A series of F<sub>2</sub> populations were used to confirm the TRD effects, including six genomic regions that were confirmed by chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL)-derived F<sub>2</sub> populations from intersubspecific allelic combinations. However, none of the regions was confirmed by the CSSL-derived populations from intrasubspecific allelic combination. Furthermore, significant epistatic interaction was found between <i>TRD1.3</i> and <i>TRD8.1</i> suggesting that TRD could positively contribute to breaking intersubspecific reproductive barriers. Our results have laid the foundation for identifying the TRD genes and provide an effective strategy to breakdown TRD for breeding wide-compatible lines, which will be further utilized in the intersubspecific hybrid breeding programs.
