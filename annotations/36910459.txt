Characterization of germplasm collections for the wheat leaf rust gene Lr34 previously defined five haplotypes in spring wheat. All resistant lines had a 3-bp TTC deletion (null) in exon 11, resulting in the absence of a phenylalanine residue in the ABC transporter, as well as a single nucleotide C (Tyrosine in Lr34+) to T (Histidine in Lr34-) transition in exon 12. A rare haplotype present in Odesskaja 13 and Koktunkulskaja 332, both of intermediate rust resistance, had the 3-bp deletion typical of Lr34+ in exon 11 but the T nucleotide of Lr34- in exon 12. To quantify the role of each mutation in leaf rust resistance, Odesskaja 13 and Koktunkulskaja 332 were crossed to Thatcher and its near-isogenic line Thatcher-Lr34 (RL6058). Single seed descent populations were generated and evaluated for rust resistance in six different rust nurseries. The Odesskaja 13 progeny with the TTC/T haplotype were susceptible with an average severity rating of 62.3%, the null/T haplotype progeny averaged 39.7% and the null/C haplotype was highly resistant, averaging 13.3% severity. The numbers for the Koktunkulskaja 332 crosses were similar with 63.5%, 43.5% and 23.7% severity ratings, respectively. Differences between all classes in all crosses were statistically significant, indicating that both mutations are independently additive for leaf rust resistance. The three-dimensional structural models of LR34 were used to analyze the locations and putative interference of both amino acids with the transport channel. Koktunkulskaja 332 also segregated for marker csLV46 which is linked to Lr46. Rust severity in lines with Lr34+ and csLV46+ had significantly lower rust severity ratings than those without, indicating the additivity of the two loci. This has implications for the deployment of Lr34 in wheat cultivars and for the basic understanding of this important wheat multi-pest durable resistance gene.
