The first transcriptome coupled to metabolite analyses reveals major trends during acerola fruit ripening and shed lights on ascorbate, ethylene signalling, cellular respiration, sugar accumulation, and softening key regulatory genes. Acerola is a fast growing and ripening fruit that exhibits high amounts of ascorbate. During ripening, the fruit experience high respiratory rates leading to ascorbate depletion and a quickly fragile and perishable state. Despite its growing economic importance, understanding of its developmental metabolism remains obscure due to the absence of genomic and transcriptomic data. We performed an acerola transcriptome sequencing that generated over 600 million reads, 40,830 contigs, and provided the annotation of 25,298 unique transcripts. Overall, this study revealed the main metabolic changes that occur in the acerola ripening. This transcriptional profile linked to metabolite measurements, allowed us to focus on ascorbate, ethylene, respiration, sugar, and firmness, the major metabolism indicators for acerola quality. Our results suggest a cooperative role of several genes involved in AsA biosynthesis (PMM, GMP1 and 3, GME1 and 2, GGP1 and 2), translocation (NAT3, 4, 6 and 6-like) and recycling (MDHAR2 and DHAR1) pathways for AsA accumulation in unripe fruits. Moreover, the association of metabolites with transcript profiles provided a comprehensive understanding of ethylene signalling, respiration, sugar accumulation and softening of acerola, shedding light on promising key regulatory genes. Overall, this study provides a foundation for further examination of the functional significance of these genes to improve fruit quality traits.
