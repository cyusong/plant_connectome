*Here, we used barley (Hordeum vulgare) grown in normal and compartmented pots to investigate sensitivity to arsenic (As) in the absence of a positive growth response to arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). *We tested the hypothesis that upon inoculation with AM fungi downregulation of HvPht1;1 and HvPht1;2 genes (encoding high-affinity inorganic orthophosphate (P(i))-uptake systems in a direct pathway via root epidermis and root hairs) and upregulation of the AM-induced HvPht1;8 (encoding the P(i)-uptake system responsible for transfer of P(i) from the symbiotic interface to cortical cells) play a role in decreased As uptake and hence reduced As sensitivity in AM plants. *Barley did not respond, or responded negatively to colonization by Glomus intraradices in terms of growth. In terms of specific phosphorus (P) uptake (P uptake per g of root) barley was nonresponsive. There was a significant interaction between As treatment and colonization, resulting in a lower As concentration and uptake in AM compared with nonmycorrhizal (NM) plants. *The decreased uptake of As and higher P : As molar ratios in the AM barley can be explained by the operation of the AM pathway as indicated by induction of HvPht1;8 and by down-regulation of HvPht1;1 and HvPht1;2.

HvPht1;1: !downregulates! As uptake
HvPht1;2: !downregulates! As uptake
HvPht1;8: !upregulates! As uptake
AM fungi: !induces! HvPht1;8
AM fungi: !decreases! As sensitivity
