['18384502', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana thioredoxin subgroup h III is composed of four members  and includes the two monocysteinic (CXXS) thioredoxins encoded by the genome. We  show that AtCXXS1 is the ortholog of monocysteinic thioredoxins present in all  higher plants. In contrast, unicellular algae and the moss Physcomitrella patens  do not encode monocysteinic thioredoxin. AtCXXS2, the second monocysteinic  thioredoxin of Arabidopsis has no ortholog in any other higher plants. It  probably appeared recently by duplications of a dicysteinic thioredoxin of the  same subgroup h III. Both monocysteinic thioredoxins show a low disulfide  reductase activity in vitro but are very efficient as disulfide isomerases in  RNAse refolding tests. The possible interactions of these proteins with the  glutathione glutaredoxin pathway are discussed on the basis of recent papers.', '2008 Jul', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01093.x', 'Vignols']
