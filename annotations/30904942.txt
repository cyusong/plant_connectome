Comprehensive transcriptome profiling uncovers extensive intraspecific variation of circular RNAs in maize, shedding light on genomic and phenotypic variation among maize inbred lines. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-strand, covalently closed transcripts. A substantial number of circRNAs have been identified and shown to be associated with phenotypic variation in various species. However, little is known about the intraspecific variation of circRNAs in maize (Zea mays L.). Here, we collected a large transcriptomic dataset (by circRNA-seq and mRNA-seq) from seedling leaves of the reference maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17. We identified over 1500 circRNAs in these lines using two circRNA detection methods, CIRCexplorer2 and CIRI. Notably, a substantial proportion of circRNAs varied in terms of sequence or expression level between lines, pointing to extensive intraspecific variation of circRNAs in maize. GO and KEGG analyses showed that genes producing circRNAs with intraspecific variation were more likely to be enriched in multiple functional groups, compared with those that did not produce circRNAs. These findings suggest that circRNAs could be utilized as an indicator of genomic and phenotypic variation among maize inbred lines. Ribosomal profiling revealed that several circRNAs might have translational capacity in maize. These results uncover the extensive intraspecific variation of circRNAs and pave the way for further understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation at the circRNA level in maize.
