Anthocyanins are natural pigments with antioxidant effects that exist in various fruits and vegetables. The accumulation of anthocyanins is induced by environmental signals and regulated by transcription factors in plants. Numerous evidence has indicated that among the environmental factors, light is one of the most signal regulatory factors involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. However, the signal transduction of light and molecular regulation of anthocyanin synthesis remains to be explored. Here, we focus on the research progress of signal transduction factors for positive and negative regulation in light-dependent and light-independent anthocyanin biosynthesis. In particular, we will discuss light-induced regulatory pathways and related specific regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. In addition, an integrated regulatory network of anthocyanin biosynthesis controlled by transcription factors is discussed based on the significant progress.
