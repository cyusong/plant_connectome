Cotton is white gold across the globe and composed of fiber cells derived from the outer integument of cotton ovules. Fiber elongation uses sucrose as a direct carbon source. The molecular mechanism transcriptionally controlling sucrose transport from ovules into the elongating fibers remains elusive. In this study the involvement of GhMYB212 in the regulation of sucrose transportion into expanding fibers was investigated. GhMYB212 RNAi plants (GhMYB212i) accumulated less sucrose and glucose in developing fibers, and had shorter fibers and a lower lint index. RNA-seq and protein-DNA binding assays revealed that GhMYB212 was closely linked to the pathways of sucrose and starch transportation and metabolism, directly controling the expression of a sucrose transporter gene GhSWEET12. GhSWEET12 RNAi plants (GhSWEET12i) possessed similar fiber phenotypes to those of GhMYB212i. Exogenous sucrose supplementation in ovule cultures did not rescue the shorter fiber phenotype of GhMYB212i and GhSWEET12i. This finding supported the idea that the attenuated rate of sucrose transport from the outer seed coat into the fibers is responsible for the retardation of fiber elongation. Current investigations support the idea that GhMYB212 functions as the main regulator of fiber elongation by controlling the expression of GhSWEET12, and therefore it is important to study cell expansion and sugar transportation during seed development.
