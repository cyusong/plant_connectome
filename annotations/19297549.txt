To elucidate the regulation pattern of extracellular invertase LIN6 of tomato, the corresponding promoter has been cloned and the sink-tissue specific expression and its regulation by sugars, stress stimuli, growth regulators, and the diurnal rhythm is shown. The in situ analysis of transgenic tobacco plants expressing a LIN6 promoter::beta-glucuronidase reporter gene fusion demonstrates LIN6 expression in sink tissues, such as pollen grains and vascular tissues of leaves and stems. LIN6 is up-regulated in close proximity to wounded tissue, and by methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid, global signals known to modulate defence/stress response. Salicylic acid on the other hand, as well as acetyl salicylic acid, suppresses LIN6 expression, supporting the fact that LIN6 is an inducible compound of the defence/stress response pathway that is antagonistically regulated by jasmonates and salicylates. Induction of the LIN6 promoter in stable transformed BY2 suspension cultures by sucrose and the growth-promoting phytohormones cytokinin and auxin along histochemical expression data, showing LIN6 expression in germinating seeds and seedlings, indicates a role of LIN6 invertase during growth processes. In addition, LIN6 is regulated by a diurnal rhythm that drives LIN6 expression in subjective dawn. Transactivation assays with circadian oscillator elements of Arabidopsis Circadian Clock Associated 1 and Late Elongated Hypocotyl demonstrate functional interaction with the LIN6 promoter.
