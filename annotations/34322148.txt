Gene editing technology in woody plants has great potential for understanding gene function, and altering traits affecting economically and ecologically important traits. Gene editing applications in woody species require a high genome editing efficiency due to the difficulty during transformation and complexities resulting from gene redundancy. In this study, we used poplar 84K (<i>Populus alba</i> × <i>P. glandulosa</i>), which is a model hybrid for studying wood formation and growth. We developed a new CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit multiple genes simultaneously. Using this system, we successfully knocked out multiple targets of the PHYTOENE DESATURASE 8 in poplar. We found the mutation rate of our CRISPR/Cas9 system is higher (67.5%) than existing reports in woody trees. We further improved the mutation rate up to 75% at editing sites through the usage of the mannopine synthase (MAS) promoter to drive Cas9. The MAS-CRISPR/Cas9 is an improved genome-editing tool for woody plants with a higher efficiency and a higher mutation rate than currently available technologies.
