Filamentation temperature-sensitive H (<i>FtsH</i>) is a proteolytic enzyme that plays an important role in plant photomorphogenesis and stress resistance. However, information regarding the <i>FtsH</i> family genes in pepper is limited. In our research, through genome-wide identification, 18 members of the pepper <i>FtsH</i> family (including five <i>FtsHi</i> members) were identified and renamed based on phylogenetic analysis. <i>CaFtsH1</i> and <i>CaFtsH8</i> were found to be essential for pepper chloroplast development and photosynthesis because <i>FtsH5</i> and <i>FtsH2</i> were lost in Solanaceae diploids. We found that the <i>CaFtsH1</i> and <i>CaFtsH8</i> proteins were located in the chloroplasts and specifically expressed in pepper green tissues. Meanwhile, <i>CaFtsH1</i> and <i>CaFtsH8</i>-silenced plants created by virus-induced gene silencing exhibited albino leaf phenotypes. In addition, <i>CaFtsH1</i>-silenced plants were observed to contain very few dysplastic chloroplasts and lost the capacity for photoautotrophic growth. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of chloroplast-related genes such as those coding the photosynthesis-antenna protein and structural proteins was downregulated in <i>CaFtsH1</i>-silenced plants, resulting in the inability to form normal chloroplasts. This study improves our understanding of pepper chloroplast formation and photosynthesis through the identification and functional study of <i>CaFtsH</i> genes.
