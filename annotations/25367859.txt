['25367859', 'Since the discovery of 20 genes encoding for putative ionotropic glutamate  receptors in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome, there has been  considerable interest in uncovering their physiological functions. For many of  these receptors, neither their channel formation and/or physiological roles nor  their localization within the plant cells is known. Here, we provide, to our  knowledge, new information about in vivo protein localization and give insight  into the biological roles of the so-far uncharacterized Arabidopsis GLUTAMATE  RECEPTOR3.5 (AtGLR3.5), a member of subfamily 3 of plant glutamate receptors.  Using the pGREAT vector designed for the expression of fusion proteins in plants,  we show that a splicing variant of AtGLR3.5 targets the inner mitochondrial  membrane, while the other variant localizes to chloroplasts. Mitochondria of  knockout or silenced plants showed a strikingly altered ultrastructure, lack of  cristae, and swelling. Furthermore, using a genetically encoded  mitochondria-targeted calcium probe, we measured a slightly reduced mitochondrial  calcium uptake capacity in the knockout mutant. These observations indicate a  functional expression of AtGLR3.5 in this organelle. Furthermore, AtGLR3.5-less  mutant plants undergo anticipated senescence. Our data thus represent, to our  knowledge, the first evidence of splicing-regulated organellar targeting of a  plant ion channel and identify the first cation channel in plant mitochondria  from a molecular point of view.', '2015 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.242602', 'Szabo']
