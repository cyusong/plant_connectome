The COP9 signalosome (CSN) was originally identified based on the constitutively photomorphogenic/de-etiolated/fusca (cop/det/fus) mutants from Arabidopsis thaliana. CSN is evolutionary conserved, and its subunit 5 (CSN5) mediates the deconjugation of NEDD8 from the cullin subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligases (deneddylation). Here, we report on Arabidopsis mutants deficient in CSN5 function. We show that these mutants are phenotypically indistinguishable from the previously described cop/det/fus mutants of other CSN subunits. However, we also show that these mutants retain the CSN complex (lacking CSN5), and this finding is in contrast with the previously described CSN subunit mutants, which lack the CSN complex. We therefore conclude that loss of CSN5 as part of CSN is sufficient to cause the cop/det/fus mutant phenotype. Furthermore, we show that mutants defective in CSN5 as well as mutants defective in CSN are unable to deneddylate the Arabidopsis cullins AtCUL1, AtCUL3A, and AtCUL4. Because these are representative cullin subunits of the three cullin-containing E3 families present in Arabidopsis, we postulate that the cop/det/fus mutant phenotype may be the result of the defects caused by impaired CSN5-dependent deneddylation of cullin-containing E3s.
