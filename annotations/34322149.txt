Normal development of plants is inhibited by inadequate light in winter in greenhouses in Northwest China. Growth lamps, using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with red blue light (7R2B), were used to supplement daylight for 1, 2, and 3 h. Seedling growth, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic product; the Calvin cycle key and sugar metabolism-related enzymes and their encoding genes; and the light signal sensing regulation of key gene expression were studied in greenhouse cucumbers under three treatments to determine the best supplemental light durations to enhance cucumber cultivation in greenhouses in winter. Treatment with LED red and blue light for 3 h significantly promoted the growth and development of cucumbers, root growth, and dry matter accumulation. It improved the photosynthetic rate, photosynthetic pigment content, and light energy utilization efficiency in cucumbers. Supplementation with red and blue LED light for 3 h upregulated the expression levels of key genes encoding the Calvin cycle and enzymes related to sugar metabolism in cucumber leaves, which promoted the synthesis and accumulation of photosynthates. The expression levels of phytochrome B, cryptochrome 1, and hypocotyl 5 in the cucumber leaves were also significantly upregulated after 3 h of light supplementation. Combined LED red and blue light for 3 h should be used to supplement natural light to enhance the cucumber cultivation in greenhouses in winter.
