Corn sheath blight, caused by AG1-IA, a fusion group of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, which acts as a kind of necrotrophic fungal pathogen, poses a global threat to the production of <i>Zea mays</i>. Although cellulase plays a crucial role in <i>R. solani</i> infections, how plants respond to it is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified a gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), ZmGABA-T, in <i>Z. mays</i> that interacts with a cell wall-degrading enzyme (CWDE), EG1, in the cell membrane, using yeast two-hybrid assay, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We found that the combination of EG1 and ZmGABA-T suppressed the allergic necrosis induced by EG1. We also found that the substrate of GABA-T-GABA, can inhibit the transcription of EG1. Transient expression of ZmGABA-T inhibited <i>R. solani</i> infection in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. The homolog in <i>Oryza sativa</i>, OsGABA-T, could also interact with EG1 to suppress the allergic necrosis induced by EG1. The OsGABA-T knocked out plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to <i>R. solani</i> and showed larger lesions. In conclusion, our results suggest that ZmGABA-T inhibits allergic necrosis induced by EG1 based on the combination with EG1, producing resistance to <i>R. solani</i> infection.
