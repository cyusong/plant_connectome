Many of these create degradation signals (N-degrons) that mediate protein destruction via the N-end rule pathway of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. In plants, the N-end rule pathway has emerged as a major system for regulated control of protein stability. Nt-arginylation-dependent degradation regulates multiple growth, development and stress responses, and recently identified functions of Nt-acetylation can also be linked to effects on the in vivo half-lives of Nt-acetylated proteins. There is also increasing evidence that N-termini could act as important protein stability determinants in plastids. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of the relationship between the nature of protein N-termini, Nt-processing events and proteolysis in plants.
