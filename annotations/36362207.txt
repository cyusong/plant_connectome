Global climate change and the urgency to transform crops require an exhaustive genetic evaluation. The large polyploid genomes of food crops, such as cereals, make it difficult to identify candidate genes with confirmed hereditary. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been proficient in identifying genetic variants that are associated with complex traits, the resolution of acquired heritability faces several significant bottlenecks such as incomplete detection of structural variants (SV), genetic heterogeneity, and/or locus heterogeneity. Consequently, a biased estimate is generated with respect to agronomically complex traits. The graph pangenomes have resolved this missing heritability and provide significant details in terms of specific loci segregating among individuals and evolving to variations. The graph pangenome approach facilitates crop improvements through genome-linked fast breeding.
