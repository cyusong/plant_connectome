Planting <i>Elymus nutans</i> artificial grassland to replace degraded <i>Artemisia baimaensis</i> grassland on the Qinghai Tibetan plateau (QTP) can effectively alleviate local grass-livestock imbalance. However, it is unknown whether the allelopathy of natural grassland plant <i>A. baimaensis</i> on <i>E. nutans</i> affects grassland establishment. Accordingly, we examined the effects of varying concentrations of aqueous extracts of <i>A. baimaensis</i> litter on the seed germination and early seedling growth of <i>E. nutans</i>, and the effects of <i>A. baimaensis</i> volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the growth parameters and physiological characteristics of <i>E. nutans</i>. The results indicate that the aqueous extract inhibited the force, percentage, and index of germination of <i>E. nutans</i> and affected early seedling growth, particularly at high concentrations. Further, the VOCs significantly reduced the aboveground and root biomass of <i>E. nutans</i> and increased malondialdehyde concentrations. Additionally, these VOCs altered the antioxidant enzyme activities and increased the superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbic acid peroxidase, soluble sugar, and proline content but significantly decreased glutathione reductase levels. Our results indicate that the allelopathy of <i>A. baimaensis</i> significantly inhibited the germination and seedling growth of <i>E. nutans</i> . Thus, the leaching of <i>A. baimaensis</i> may produce allelochemicals in the soil that inhibit the germination of <i>E. nutans</i> seeds. Moreover, the VOCs of <i>A. baimaensis</i> may disrupt the growth process, resulting in a decrease in biomass and a disruption of the physiological metabolism of seedlings under field conditions.
