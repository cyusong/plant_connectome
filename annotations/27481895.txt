['27481895', 'In vascular plants, the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex, a  homolog of respiratory NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), mediates  plastoquinone reduction using ferredoxin as an electron donor in cyclic electron  transport around PSI in the thylakoid membrane. In angiosperms, chloroplast NDH  is composed of five subcomplexes and forms a supercomplex with PSI. The modular  assembly of stroma-protruded subcomplex A, which corresponds to the Q module of  Complex I, was recently reported. However, the factors involved in the specific  assembly steps have not been completely identified. Here, we isolated an  Arabidopsis mutant, chlororespiratory reduction 9 (crr9), defective in NDH  activity. The CRR9 gene encodes a novel stromal protein without any known  functional domains or motifs. CRR9 is highly conserved in cyanobacteria and land  plants but not in green algae, which do not have chloroplast NDH. Blue  native-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of thylakoid proteins indicated that  formation of subcomplex A was impaired in crr9 CRR9 was specifically required for  the accumulation of NdhK, a subcomplex A subunit, in NDH assembly intermediates  in the stroma. Furthermore, two-dimensional clear native/SDS-PAGE analysis of the  stroma fraction indicated that incorporation of NdhM into NDH assembly  intermediate complex 400 was impaired in crr9 These results suggest that CRR9 is  a novel factor required for the formation of NDH subcomplex A.', '2016 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcw130', 'Shikanai']
