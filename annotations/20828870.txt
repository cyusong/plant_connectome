We have previously reported the molecular characterization of a putative sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) of Bromus pictus, a graminean species from Patagonia, tolerant to cold and drought. Here, this enzyme was functionally characterized by heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and Nicotiana tabacum. Recombinant P. pastoris Bp6-SFT showed comparable characteristics to barley 6-SFT and an evident fructosyltransferase activity synthesizing bifurcose from sucrose and 1-kestotriose. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing Bp6-SFT, showed fructosyltransferase activity and fructan accumulation in leaves. Bp6-SFT plants exposed to freezing conditions showed a significantly lower electrolyte leakage in leaves compared to control plants, indicating less membrane damage. Concomitantly these transgenic plants resumed growth more rapidly than control ones. These results indicate that Bp6-SFT transgenic tobacco plants that accumulate fructan showed enhanced freezing tolerance compared to control plants.
