<i>Plasmopara viticola</i> (Berk. et Curt.) Berl. and de Toni, the agent of downy mildew, is one of the most important pathogens of European grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.). Extensive evaluation of cultivated grapevine germplasm has highlighted the existence of resistant phenotypes in the Georgian (Southern Caucasus) germplasm. Resistance is shown as a reduction in disease severity. Unraveling the genetic architecture of grapevine response to <i>P. viticola</i> infection is crucial to develop resistant varieties and reduce the impact of disease management. The aim of this work was to apply a genome-wide association (GWA) approach to a panel of Georgian-derived accessions phenotyped for <i>P. viticola</i> susceptibility and genotyped with Vitis18kSNP chip array. GWA identified three highly significant novel loci on chromosomes 14 (<i>Rpv29</i>), 3 (<i>Rpv30</i>) and 16 (<i>Rpv31</i>) associated with a low level of pathogen sporulation. <i>Rpv29</i>, <i>Rpv30</i>, and <i>Rpv31</i> loci appeared to be associated with plant defense genes against biotic stresses, such as genes involved in pathogen recognition and signal transduction. This study provides the first evidence of resistant loci against <i>P. viticola</i> in <i>V. vinifera</i> germplasm, and identifies potential target genes for breeding <i>P. viticola</i> resistant grapevine cultivars.
