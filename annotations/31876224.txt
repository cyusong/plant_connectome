ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (EDS1) and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4) are sequence-related lipase-like proteins that function as a complex to regulate defense responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i> by both salicylic acid-dependent and independent pathways. Here, we describe a gain-of-function mutation in PAD4 (S135F) that enhances resistance and cell death in response to infection by the powdery mildew pathogen <i>Golovinomyces cichoracearum.</i> The mutant PAD4 protein accumulates to wild-type levels in <i>Arabidopsis</i> cells, thus these phenotypes are unlikely to be due to PAD4 over accumulation. The phenotypes are similar to loss-of-function mutations in the protein kinase EDR1 (Enhanced Disease Resistance1), and previous work has shown that loss of <i>PAD4</i> or <i>EDS1</i> suppresses <i>edr1-</i>mediated phenotypes, placing these proteins downstream of <i>EDR1</i>. Here, we show that EDR1 directly associates with EDS1 and PAD4 and inhibits their interaction in yeast and plant cells. We propose a model whereby EDR1 negatively regulates defense responses by interfering with the heteromeric association of EDS1 and PAD4. Our data indicate that the S135F mutation likely alters an EDS1-independent function of PAD4, potentially shedding light on a yet-unknown PAD4 signaling function.
