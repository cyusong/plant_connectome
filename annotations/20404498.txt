NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC2) is one of the largest families of transcription factors in the plant genome, but the function and regulation of most NAC genes are still largely unknown. We recently isolated a gene encoding a NAC transcription factor designated ANAC078 from Arabidopsis plants and identified 166 genes up-regulated in ANAC078-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type plants under high-light stress. The cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) technique showed that the ANAC078 recognition sequence contains T[A/T/C][A/T/G/C]C[T/G]TG[T/G]G as a DNA-binding site. The recognition sequence identified by this technique was detected in the promoter region of 52 up-regulated genes, including the gene for a transcription factor, proteasome subunits, peroxidase, and a protein kinase. The findings suggest these genes to be directly targeted by the ANAC078 protein.
