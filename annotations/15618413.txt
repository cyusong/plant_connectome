['15618413', 'We isolated three recessive mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) showing  ectopic expression of the xylem-specific marker, pAtxyn3::YFP. Genetic analysis  indicated that the phenotypes were caused by mutations in three different genes,  designated Abnormal Tracheary Element formation-related gene expression (ate1-3).  The ate1 mutants showed a normal DR5::GUS gene expression pattern, and the ate1  mutation did not affect the abnormal vascular pattern formation in the van3 and  pin1 mutants, indicating that the ate1 mutation does not affect the vascular  pattern organization governed by auxin. The ate mutants showed ectopic lignin  deposition, patterned secondary wall thickenings, and cell death, which are  characteristic of mature tracheary elements (TEs) in cells ectopically expressing  the pAtxyn3::YFP gene. Ectopic TE formation was rapidly induced in parenchymal  tissue of the ate mutants in a TE-inducible system with excised hypocotyl.  Furthermore, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments showed  that the expression of TE formation-related genes is up-regulated in the ate  mutants. The ate1 mutation also caused ectopic expression of another  xylem-specific marker gene, pAt3g62160::YFP. Overall, our results suggest that  the ATE genes are responsible for the in situ repression of transdifferentiation  into TEs in Arabidopsis and could be participants in the  transdifferentiation-masking system.', '2005 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.055145', 'Fukuda']
