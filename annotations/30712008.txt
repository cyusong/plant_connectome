Leaf senescence is governed by a complex regulatory network involving the dynamic reprogramming of gene expression. Age-dependent induction of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) is associated with increased levels of trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys4 (H3K4me3), but the regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we found that JMJ16, an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) JmjC-domain containing protein, is a specific H3K4 demethylase that negatively regulates leaf senescence through its enzymatic activity. Genome-wide analysis revealed a widespread coordinated upregulation of gene expression and hypermethylation of H3K4me3 at JMJ16 binding genes associated with leaf senescence in the loss-of-function <i>jmj16</i> mutant as compared with the wild type. Genetic analysis indicated that JMJ16 negatively regulates leaf senescence, at least partly through repressing the expression of positive regulators of leaf senescence, <i>WRKY53</i> and <i>SAG201</i> JMJ16 associates with <i>WRKY53</i> and <i>SAG201</i> and represses their precocious expression in mature leaves by reducing H3K4me3 levels at these loci. The protein abundance of JMJ16 gradually decreases during aging, which is correlated with increased H3K4me3 levels at <i>WRKY53</i> and <i>SAG201</i>, suggesting that the age-dependent downregulation of JMJ16 is required for the precise transcriptional activation of SAGs during leaf senescence. Thus, JMJ16 is an important regulator of leaf senescence that demethylates H3K4 at SAGs in an age-dependent manner.
