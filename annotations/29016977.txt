Sesquiterpenes are one of the most important defensive secondary metabolite components of agarwood. Agarwood, which is a product of the Aquilaria sinensis response to external damage, is a fragrant and resinous wood that is widely used in traditional medicines, incense and perfume. We previously reported that jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in promoting agarwood sesquiterpene biosynthesis and induces expression of the sesquiterpene synthase ASS1, which is a key enzyme that is responsible for the biosynthesis of agarwood sesquiterpenes in A. sinensis. However, little is known about this molecular regulation mechanism. Here, we characterized a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, AsMYC2, from A. sinensis as an activator of ASS1 expression. AsMYC2 is an immediate-early jasmonate-responsive gene and is co-induced with ASS1. Using a combination of yeast one-hybrid assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we showed that AsMYC2 bound the promoter of ASS1 containing a G-box motif. AsMYC2 activated expression of ASS1 in tobacco epidermis cells and up-regulated expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes (TPS21 and TPS11) in Arabidopsis, which was also promoted by methyl jasmonate. Our results suggest that AsMYC2 participates in the regulation of agarwood sesquiterpene biosynthesis in A. sinensis by controlling the expression of ASS1 through the JA signaling pathway.
