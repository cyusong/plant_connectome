['18656261', 'ETHE1 (ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1) is a beta-lactamase fold-containing  protein that is essential for the survival of a range of organisms. In spite of  the apparent importance of this enzyme, very little is known about its function  or biochemical properties. In this study Arabidopsis ETHE1 was over-expressed and  purified and shown to bind tightly to 1.2+/-0.2 equivalents of iron. (1)H NMR and  EPR studies demonstrate that the predominant oxidation state of Fe in ETHE1 is  Fe(II), and NMR studies confirm that two histidines are bound to Fe(II). EPR  studies show that there is no antiferromagnetically coupled Fe(III)Fe(II) center  in ETHE1. Gel filtration studies reveal that ETHE1 is a dimer in solution, which  is consistent with previous crystallographic studies. Although very similar in  terms of amino acid sequence to glyoxalase II, ETHE1 exhibits no thioester  hydrolase activity, and activity screening assays reveal that ETHE1 exhibits low  level esterase activity. Taken together, ETHE1 is a novel, mononuclear  Fe(II)-containing member of the beta-lactamase fold superfamily.', '2008 Sep', 'J Inorg Biochem', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2008.06.003', 'Makaroff']
