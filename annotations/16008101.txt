Tocopherols are presumed to be important antioxidants and scavengers of lipid radicals and reactive oxygen species in plants. Age is known to be a condition under which oxidative stress increases. In leaves of aging Arabidopsis thaliana plants, the content of alpha-tocopherol as well as of gamma-tocopherol increased significantly. The activity of tyrosine aminotransferase, which supplies the biosynthetic pathway with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, was increased as well. On the other hand, coronatine, a phytotoxin mimicking octadecanoids and leading to symptoms of senescence, caused a moderate increase in alpha-tocopherol as well as some enhancement of gamma-tocopherol.

Age: !increases! Oxidative Stress
Tocopherols: !scavenge! Lipid Radicals/Reactive Oxygen Species
Tyrosine Aminotransferase: !supplies! Biosynthetic Pathway
Coronatine: !mimics! Octadecanoids
Alpha-Tocopherol: !increases! with Age/Coronatine
Gamma-Tocopherol: !increases! with Age/Coronatine
