The host-associated microbiome highly determines plant health. Available organic resources, such as food for microbes, are important in shaping microbial community structure and multifunctionality. However, how using organic resources precisely manipulates the soil microbiome and makes it supportive of plant health remains unclear. Here, we experimentally tested the influence of carbon resource diversity on the microbial trophic network and pathogen invasion success in a microcosm study. We further explored how resource diversity affects microbial evenness, community functions, and plant disease outcomes in systems involving tomato plants and the in vivo soil microbiome. Increasing available resource diversity altered trophic network architecture, increased microbial evenness, and thus increased the certainty of successful pathogen control. By contrast, the invasion resistance effects of low resource diversity were less effective and highly varied. Accordingly, increases in the evenness and connection of dominant species induced by high resource diversity significantly contributed to plant disease suppression. Furthermore, high carbohydrate diversity upregulated plant immune system regulation-related microbial functions. Our results deepen the biodiversity-invasion resistance theory and provide practical guidance for the control of plant pathogens and diseases by using organic resource-mediated approaches, such as crop rotation, intercropping, and organic amendments.
