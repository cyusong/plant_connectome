['9012501', 'To identify genes involved in meristem function we have designed a screen for  temperature-sensitive mutations that cause a conditional arrest of early shoot  development in Arabidopsis. We describe the characterization of three mutations,  arrested development (add) 1, 2 and 3. At the restrictive temperature the add1  and add2 mutations disrupt apical meristem function as assayed by leaf  initiation. Furthermore, add1 and add2 plants exhibit defects in leaf  morphogenesis following upshift from permissive to restrictive temperature. This  result suggests that proximity to a functional meristem is required for the  completion of normal leaf morphogenesis. The add3 mutation does not have a  dramatic effect on the production of leaves by the apical meristem; however, add3  prevents the expansion of leaf blades at high temperature. Thus, in this mutant  the temperature-dependent arrest of epicotyl development is due to a failure of  normal leaf development rather than new leaf initiation. While all add mutants  have a reduced rate of root growth in comparison to wild-type plants, the mutants  do not display a temperature-dependent arrest of root development. All add  mutants display some developmental defects at low temperature, suggesting that  these mutations affect genes involved in inherently temperature-sensitive  developmental processes.', '1996 Dec', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.122.12.3799', 'Meeks-Wagner']
