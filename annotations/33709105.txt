['33709105', "Homogalacturonan (HG), a component of pectin, is synthesized in the Golgi  apparatus in its fully methylesterified form. It is then secreted into the  apoplast where it is typically de-methylesterified by pectin methylesterases  (PME). Secretion and de-esterification are critical for normal pectin function,  yet the underlying transcriptional regulation mechanisms remain largely unknown.  Here, we uncovered a mechanism that fine-tunes the degree of HG  de-methylesterification (DM) in the mucilage that surrounds Arabidopsis thaliana  seeds. We demonstrate that the APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF)  transcription factor (TF) ERF4 is a transcriptional repressor that positively  regulates HG DM. ERF4 expression is confined to epidermal cells in the early  stages of seed coat development. The adhesiveness of the erf4 mutant mucilage was  decreased as a result of an increased DM caused by a decrease in PME activity.  Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that ERF4 positively regulates HG DM by  suppressing the expression of three PME INHIBITOR genes (PMEIs) and  SUBTILISIN-LIKE SERINE PROTEASE 1.7 (SBT1.7). ERF4 shares common targets with the  TF MYB52, which also regulates pectin DM. Nevertheless, the erf4-2 myb52 double  mutant seeds have a wild-type mucilage phenotype. We provide evidence that ERF4  and MYB52 regulate downstream gene expression in an opposite manner by  antagonizing each other's DNA-binding ability through a physical interaction.  Together, our findings reveal that pectin DM in the seed coat is fine-tuned by an  ERF4-MYB52 transcriptional complex.", '2021 Apr 17', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koaa031', 'Kong']
