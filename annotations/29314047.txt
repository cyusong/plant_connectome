In many biomes, plants are subject to heatwaves, potentially causing irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Field surveys have documented global, temperature-dependent patterns in photosynthetic heat tolerance (P<sub>HT</sub> ); however, it remains unclear if these patterns reflect acclimation in P<sub>HT</sub> or inherent differences among species adapted to contrasting habitats. To address these unknowns, we quantified seasonal variations in T<sub>crit</sub> (high temperature where minimal chlorophyll-a fluorescence rises rapidly, reflecting disruption to photosystem II) in 62 species native to 6 sites from 5 thermally contrasting biomes across Australia. T<sub>crit</sub> and leaf fatty acid (FA) composition (important for membrane stability) were quantified in three temperature-controlled glasshouses in 20 of those species. T<sub>crit</sub> was greatest at hot field sites and acclimated seasonally (summer > winter, increasing on average 0.34 °C per °C increase in growth temperature). The glasshouse study showed that T<sub>crit</sub> was inherently higher in species from warmer habitats (increasing 0.16 °C per °C increase in origin annual mean maximum temperature) and acclimated to increasing growth temperature (0.24 °C °C<sup>-1</sup> ). Variations in T<sub>crit</sub> were positively correlated with the relative abundance of saturated FAs, with FAs accounting for 40% of T<sub>crit</sub> variation. These results highlight the importance of both plastic adjustments and inherent differences determining contemporary continent-wide patterns in P<sub>HT</sub> .
