Tonoplast aquaporins (intrinsic proteins, TIPs) have been indicated to play important roles in plant tolerance to water deficit and salinity. However, the functions of wheat TIPs in response to the stresses are largely unknown. In this study, we observed that transgenic plants overexpressing wheat <i>TaTIP4;1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice displayed clearly enhanced seed germination and seedling growth under drought, salt and osmotic stress. Compared with wild type plants, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice overexpression lines had heightened water contents, reduced leaf water loss, lowered levels of Na<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and malondialdehyde, and improved activities of catalase and/or superoxide dismutase, and increased accumulation of proline under drought, salinity and/or osmotic stresses. Moreover, the expression levels of multiple drought responsive genes clearly elevated upon water dehydration, and the transcription of some salt responsive genes was markedly induced by NaCl treatment in the overexpression lines. Also, the yeast cells containing <i>TaTIP4;1</i> showed increased tolerance to NaCl and mannitol, and mutation in one of three serines of <i>TaTIP4;1</i> caused decreased tolerance to the two stresses. These results suggest that <i>TaTIP4;1</i> serves as an essential positive regulator of seed germination and seedling growth under drought, salt and/or osmotic stress through impacting water relations, ROS balance, the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and proline, and stimulating the expression of dozens of stress responsive genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice. Phosphorylation may modulate the activity of <i>TaTIP4;1</i>.
