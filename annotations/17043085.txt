The leaf surface of a very large number of plant species are covered by trichomes. Non-glandular trichomes are specialized unicellular or multicellular structures that occur in many different plant species and function in xenobiotic detoxification and protecting the plant against pest attack. By analysing the susceptibility of trichome mutants, evidence is provided that indicates the influence of leaf trichomes on foliar fungal infections in Arabidopsis thaliana, probably by facilitating the adhesion of the fungal spores/hyphae to the leaf surface. A decreased trichome number in the hairless Arabidopsis mutant gl1 enhances tolerance against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. By contrast, the try mutant shows an increased susceptibility to both fungal infection and accumulation. Trichome density does not influence infection by the soil-borne pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. In addition, the influence of trichomes on foliar infection is supported by targeting the high-level expression of the Trichoderma harzianum alpha-1,3-glucanase protein to the specialized cell structures. Trichome expression of this anti-fungal hydrolase shows a significant resistance to infection by the foliar pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Resistance to this fungus is not dependent on the constitutive induction of the salicylic or jasmonic defence signalling pathways, but the presence of the alpha-1,3-glucanase protein in trichomes.
