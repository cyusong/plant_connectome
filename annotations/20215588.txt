['20215588', 'A double homozygous recessive mutant in the Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of  nucleus- and phragmoplast-localized kinase 2 (ANP2) and 3 (ANP3) genes and a  homozygous recessive mutant in the mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MPK4) gene  of Arabidopsis exhibit deficiencies in the overall microtubule (MT) organization,  which result in abnormal cell growth patterns, such as branching of root hairs  and swelling of diffusely growing epidermal cells. Genetic, pharmacological,  molecular, cytological, and biochemical analyses show that the major underlying  mechanism for these phenotypes is excessive MT stabilization manifested in both  mutants as heavy MT bundling, disorientation, and drug stability. The above  defects in MAPK signaling result in the adverse regulation of members of the  microtubule-associated protein (MAP65) protein family, including strongly  diminished phosphorylation of MAP65-1. These data suggest that ANP2/ANP3, MPK4,  and the microtubule-associated protein MAP65-1, a putative target of MPK4  signaling, are all essential for the proper organization of cortical microtubules  in Arabidopsis epidermal cells.', '2010 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.071746', 'Samaj']
