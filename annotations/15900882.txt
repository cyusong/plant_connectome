Changes of activity antioxidant enzymes and of levels of isoflavonoids were studied in the roots and hypocotyls of the etiolated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. var. Essor) seedlings, submitted to cold. Prolonged exposure to 1 degrees C inhibited hypocotyl and root elongation and limited their growth after seedlings were transferred to 25 degrees C. Roots were more sensitive to chilling than hypocotyls. At 1 degrees C a gradual increase in MDA concentration in roots but not in hypocotyls was observed. An increase in catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) activity in hypocotyls was observed both at 1 degrees C and after transfer of plants to 25 degrees C. In roots, CAT activity increased after 4 days of chilling, while SOD activity only after rewarming. L-Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) activity decreased in roots of chilled seedlings, but did not change in hypocotyls until activity increased after transfer to 25 degrees C. The content of genistein and daidzein increased after 24 h of treatment by low temperature and then decreased with prolonged chilling in hypocotyls and remained high in roots. However, it should be noted that genistin level (genistein glucoside) in chilled hypocotyls is 10 times higher than in roots, despite falling tendency. The role of antioxidant enzymes and isoflavonoids in preventing chilling injury in hypocotyls and roots of soybean seedlings is discussed.
