Endophytic fungi are known to enhance plant growth and performance under salt stress. The current study investigated the growth, as well as biochemical and molecular properties of <i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> colonized with the mutualistic fungus <i>Piriformospora indica</i>, under control and salinity stress. Our findings indicated an increase in the plant biomass, lateral root density, and chlorophyll content of <i>P. indica</i>-colonized plants under both normal and salt stress conditions. Furthermore, there was a decline in the inoculated plants leaf and root Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio. The colonization enhanced the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase in plants. Increased ionic content of Zn and P were also found in salt-stressed date palm. The fungus colonization was also associated with altered expression levels of essential Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ion channels in roots like <i>HKT1;5</i> and <i>SOS1</i> genes. This alteration improved plant growth due to their preservation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions balanced homeostasis under salinity stress. Moreover, it was confirmed that <i>RSA1</i> and <i>LEA2</i> genes were highly expressed in salt-stressed and colonized plant roots and leaves, respectively. The current study exploited <i>P. indica</i> as an effective natural salt stress modulator to ameliorate salinity tolerance in plants.
