Cell population growth is gated to occur in particular circadian phases, which has been known for over four decades in various organisms including cyanobacteria and human. However, little is known as to which cell cycle phases from G1 to M are primarily regulated by the circadian rhythm or when in a circadian cycle this primary regulation takes place. We report here that in the flagellate alga Euglena gracilis grown photoautotrophically, the circadian rhythm primarily prevented developmentally matured G2 cells from progressing to mitosis, such that cell population growth occurred only during subjective night. In addition, we found that the circadian rhythm also arrests G1-to-S and S-to-G2 transitions at particular circadian phases.

Circadian rhythm: !arrests! G1-to-S transition
Circadian rhythm: !arrests! S-to-G2 transition
