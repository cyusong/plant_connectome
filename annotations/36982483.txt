Inbreeding is the crossing of closely related individuals in nature or a plantation or self-pollinating plants, which produces plants with high homozygosity. This process can reduce genetic diversity in the offspring and decrease heterozygosity, whereas inbred depression (ID) can often reduce viability. Inbred depression is common in plants and animals and has played a significant role in evolution. In the review, we aim to show that inbreeding can, through the action of epigenetic mechanisms, affect gene expression, resulting in changes in the metabolism and phenotype of organisms. This is particularly important in plant breeding because epigenetic profiles can be linked to the deterioration or improvement of agriculturally important characteristics.
