Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived molecules, which regulate various developmental and adaptation processes in plants. These are engaged in different aspects of growth such as development of root, leaf senescence, shoot branching, etc. Plants grown under nutrient-deficient conditions enhance SL production that facilitates root architecture and symbiosis of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, as a result increases nutrient uptake. The crosstalk of SLs with other phytohormones such as auxin, abscisic acid, cytokinin and gibberellins, in response to abiotic stresses indicates that SLs actively contribute to the regulatory systems of plant stress adaptation. In response to different environmental circumstances such as salinity, drought, heat, cold, heavy metals and nutrient deprivation, these SLs get accumulated in plant tissues. Strigolactones regulate multiple hormonal responsive pathways, which aids plants to surmount stressful environmental constraints as well as reduce negative impact on overall productivity of crops. The external application of SL analog GR24 for its higher bioaccumulation can be one of the possible approaches for establishing various abiotic stress tolerances in plants.
