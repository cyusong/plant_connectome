Chrysanthemum is a popular ornamental plant worldwide. MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) transcription factors play an important role in everything from stress resistance to plant growth and development. However, the MYB family of chrysanthemums has not been the subject of a detailed bioinformatics and expression investigation. In this study, we examined 324 CnMYB transcription factors from Chrysanthemum nankingense genome data, which contained 122 Cn1R-MYB, 183 CnR2R3-MYB, 12 Cn3R-MYB, 2 Cn4R-MYB, and 5 atypical CnMYB. The protein motifs and classification of CnMYB transcription factors were analyzed. Among them, motifs 1, 2, 3, and 4 were found to encode the MYB DNA-binding domain in R2R3-MYB proteins, while in other-MYB proteins, the motifs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 encode the MYB DNA-binding domain. Among all CnMYBs, 44 genes were selected due to the presence of CpG islands, while methylation is detected in three genes, including CnMYB9, CnMYB152, and CnMYB219. We analyzed the expression levels of each CnMYB gene in ray floret, disc floret, flower bud, leaf, stem, and root tissues. Based on phylogenetic analysis and gene expression analysis, three genes appeared likely to control cellulose and lignin synthesis in stem tissue, and 16 genes appeared likely to regulate flowering time, anther, pollen development, and flower color. Fifty-one candidate genes that may be involved in stress response were identified through phylogenetic, stress-responseve motif of promoter, and qRT-PCR analyses. According to genes expression levels under stress conditions, six CnMYB genes (CnMYB9, CnMYB172, CnMYB186, CnMYB199, CnMYB219, and CnMYB152) were identified as key stress-responsive genes. This research provides useful information for further functional analysis of the CnMYB gene family in chrysanthemums, as well as offers candidate genes for further study of cellulose and lignin synthesis, flowering traits, salt and drought stress mechanism.
