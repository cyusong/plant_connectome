Pollen tube growth requires coordination of cytoskeletal dynamics and apical secretion. The regulatory phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) is enriched in the subapical plasma membrane of pollen tubes of Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and can influence both actin dynamics and secretion. How alternative PtdIns(4,5)P2 effects are specified is unclear. In tobacco pollen tubes, spinning disc microscopy (SD) reveals dual distribution of a fluorescent PtdIns(4,5)P2-reporter in dynamic plasma membrane nanodomains vs. apparent diffuse membrane labeling, consistent with spatially distinct coexisting pools of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Several PI4P 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) can generate PtdIns(4,5)P2 in pollen tubes. Despite localizing to one membrane region, the PIP5Ks AtPIP5K2-EYFP and NtPIP5K6-EYFP display distinctive overexpression effects on cell morphologies, respectively related to altered actin dynamics or membrane trafficking. When analyzed by SD, AtPIP5K2-EYFP associated with nanodomains, whereas NtPIP5K6-EYFP localized diffusely. Chimeric AtPIP5K2-EYFP and NtPIP5K6-EYFP variants with reciprocally swapped membrane-associating domains evoked reciprocally shifted effects on cell morphology upon overexpression. Overall, active PI4P 5-kinase variants stabilized actin when targeted to nanodomains, suggesting a role of nanodomain-associated PtdIns(4,5)P2 in actin regulation. This notion is further supported by interaction and proximity of nanodomain-associated AtPIP5K2 with the Rho-GTPase NtRac5, and by its functional interplay with elements of Rho of plants signaling. Plasma membrane nano-organization may thus aid the specification of PtdIns(4,5)P2 functions to coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and secretion.
