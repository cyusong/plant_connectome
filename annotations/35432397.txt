Broccoli cultivars that have enhanced accumulation of methionine-derived glucosinolates have been developed through the introgression of a novel allele of the <i>MYB28</i> transcription factor from the wild species <i>Brassica villosa</i>. Through a novel k-mer approach, we characterised the extent of the introgression of unique <i>B. villosa</i> genome sequences into high glucosinolate broccoli genotypes. RNAseq analyses indicated that the introgression of the <i>B. villosa MYB28</i> C2 allele resulted in the enhanced expression of the <i>MYB28</i> transcription factor, and modified expression of genes associated with sulphate absorption and reduction, and methionine and glucosinolate biosynthesis when compared to standard broccoli. A adenine-thymine (AT) short tandem repeat (STR) was identified within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) <i>B. villosa MYB28</i> allele that was absent from two divergent cultivated forms of <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, which may underpin the enhanced expression of <i>B. villosa MYB28</i>.
