Orientation of cell division is essential for plant development as the direction of growth is determined by the direction of cell expansion and orientation of cell division. We have demonstrated that cell division orientation in vascular tissue is regulated by the interactions between a receptor kinase (PXY) expressed in dividing cells and its peptide ligand (CLE41) that is localized to adjacent phloem cells. Given that other receptor kinases have been identified as orienting the cell division plane in several developmental processes, we suggest that localized signaling from adjacent cells may be a general mechanism for defining the plane of cell division.
