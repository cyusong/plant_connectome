['10954083', 'Screening of transposon-associated mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana for altered  starch metabolism resulted in the isolation of a mutant that did not accumulate  starch in any tissue or at any developmental stage (starch-free mutant, stf1).  Allelism tests with known mutants showed that stf1 represents a new mutant allele  of the plastid isoform of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase (PGMp). The mutation was  mapped to chromosome 5. An Arabidopsis EST that showed significant homology to  the cytosolic isoform of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) from maize was able to  complement the mutant phenotype. The Arabidopsis EST was transcribed and  translated in vitro and the protein product was efficiently imported into  isolated chloroplasts and processed to its mature form. The lack of starch  biosynthesis in stf1 is accompanied by the accumulation of soluble sugars. The  rate of CO2 assimilation measured in individual leaves was substantially  diminished only under conditions of high CO2 and low O2. Remarkably, stf1  exhibits an increase rather than a decrease in total leaf PGM activity,  suggesting an induction of the cytosolic isoform(s) in the mutant. The substrate  for PGM, glucose 6-phosphate, accumulated in stf1 during the day, resulting in  10-fold higher content than in the wild type at the end of the photoperiod.', '2000 Jul', 'Mol Gen Genet', '10.1007/pl00008698', 'Weber']
