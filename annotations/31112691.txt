Plants protect their wounds against pathogen invasion by releasing damage signals that induce immune responses in neighboring cells. A new study shows that a conserved bioactive peptide is released from its cytoplasmic precursor upon wounding by a metacaspase that is activated by calcium influx into the injured cell.

metacaspase: !activated by! calcium influx
metacaspase: !releases! bioactive peptide
