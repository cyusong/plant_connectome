Heading date and panicle architecture are important agronomic traits in rice. Here, we identified a gene MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1) that regulates rice heading and panicle architecture. Overexpressing OsMFT1 delayed heading date by over 7 d and greatly increased spikelets per panicle and the number of branches. In contrast, OsMFT1 knockout mutants had an advanced heading date and reduced spikelets per panicle. Overexpression of OsMFT1 significantly suppressed Ehd1 expression, and Ghd7 up-regulated OsMFT1 expression. Double mutants showed that OsMFT1 acted downstream of Ghd7. In addition, transcription factor OsLFL1 was verified to directly bind to the promoter of OsMFT1 via an RY motif and activate the expression of OsMFT1 in vivo and in vitro. RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsMFT1 repressed expression of FZP and five SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that the transition from branch meristem to spikelet meristem was delayed and thus more panicle branches were produced. Therefore, OsMFT1 is a suppressor of flowering acting downstream of Ghd7 and upstream of Ehd1, and a positive regulator of panicle architecture.
