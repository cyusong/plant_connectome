['21514160', 'Cryptochromes are blue light receptors that mediate light regulation of gene  expression in all major evolution lineages, but the molecular mechanism  underlying cryptochrome signal transduction remains not fully understood. It has  been reported that cryptochromes suppress activity of the multifunctional E3  ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) to regulate gene  expression in response to blue light. But how plant cryptochromes mediate light  suppression of COP1 activity remains unclear. We report here that Arabidopsis  CRY2 (cryptochrome 2) undergoes blue light-dependent interaction with the  COP1-interacting protein SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A 1 (SPA1). We demonstrate  that SPA1 acts genetically downstream from CRY2 to mediate blue light suppression  of the COP1-dependent proteolysis of the flowering-time regulator CONSTANS (CO).  We further show that blue light-dependent CRY2-SPA1 interaction stimulates  CRY2-COP1 interaction. These results reveal for the first time a  wavelength-specific mechanism by which a cryptochrome photoreceptor mediates  light regulation of protein degradation to modulate developmental timing in  Arabidopsis.', '2011 May 24', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2011.03.048', 'Lin']
