Lateral root (LR) proliferation is a major determinant of soil nutrient uptake. How resource allocation controls the extent of LR growth remains unresolved. We used genetic, physiological, transcriptomic, and grafting approaches to define a role for C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1) in controlling sucrose-dependent LR growth. CEPR1 inhibited LR growth in response to applied sucrose, other metabolizable sugars, and elevated light intensity. Pathways through CEPR1 restricted LR growth by reducing LR meristem size and the length of mature LR cells. RNA-sequencing of wild-type (WT) and cepr1-1 roots with or without sucrose treatment revealed an intersection of CEP-CEPR1 signalling with the sucrose transcriptional response. Sucrose up-regulated several CEP genes, supporting a specific role for CEP-CEPR1 in the response to sucrose. Moreover, genes with basally perturbed expression in cepr1-1 overlap with WT sucrose-responsive genes significantly. We found that exogenous CEP inhibited LR growth via CEPR1 by reducing LR meristem size and mature cell length. This result is consistent with CEP-CEPR1 acting to curtail the extent of sucrose-dependent LR growth. Reciprocal grafting indicates that LR growth inhibition requires CEPR1 in both the roots and shoots. Our results reveal a new role for CEP-CEPR1 signalling in controlling LR growth in response to sucrose.
