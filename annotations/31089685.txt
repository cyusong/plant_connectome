The Mediator complex is an essential, multisubunit transcriptional coactivator that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Mediator interacts with gene-specific transcription factors, the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery, as well as several other factors involved in transcription, and acts as an integral hub to regulate various aspects of transcription. Recent studies of the plant Mediator complex have established that it functions in diverse aspects of plant development and fitness. Jasmonate (JA) is an oxylipin-derived plant hormone that regulates plant immunity and development. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2, which is a master regulator of JA signaling, orchestrates genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming of plant cells to coordinate defense- and growth-related processes. Here, we review the function of the plant Mediator complex in regulating JA signaling. We focus on the multifunctional Mediator subunit MED25, which emerges as an integrative hub for the transcriptional regulation of jasmonate signaling.
