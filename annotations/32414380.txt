Phased small interfering RNA (phasiRNA) is primarily derived from the 22-nt miRNA targeting loci. GhMYB2, a gene with potential roles in cotton fiber cell fate determination, is a target gene of miR828 and miR858 in the generation of phasiRNAs. In the presented work, through the evaluation of phasing scores and phasiRNA distribution pattern, we found that phasiRNAs from GhMYB2 were derived from the 3' cleavage fragments of 22-nt miR828 and 21-nt miR858 respectively. These two miRNA targeting sites initiated two phasing frames on transcripts of one locus. By means of RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE), we further demonstrated that phasiRNAs derived from the two phasing frames played a role in cis-regulation of GhMYB2. The phasiRNAs derived from GhMYB2 were expressed in the somatic tissues, especially in anther and hypocotyl. We further employed our previous small RNA sequencing data as well as the degradome data of cotton fiber bearing ovules, anthers, hypocotyls and embryogenic calli tissues published in public databases, to validate the expression, phasing pattern and functions of phasiRNAs. The presenting research provide insights of the molecular mechanism of phasiRNAs in regulation of GhMYB2 loci.
