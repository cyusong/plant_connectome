Anti-sense transcription is increasingly being recognized as an important regulator of gene expression. But the transcriptome complementation of anti-sense RNA in hybrid relative to their inbred parents was largely unknown. In this study, we profiled strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in a maize hybrid and its inbred parents (B73 and Mo17) in two tissues. More anti-sense transcripts were present in the hybrid compared with the parental lines. We detected 293 and 242 single-parent expression of anti-sense (SPEA) transcripts in maize immature ear and leaf tissues, respectively. There was little overlap of the SPEA transcripts between the two maize tissues. These results suggested that SPEA is a general mechanism that drives extensive complementation in maize hybrids. More importantly, extremely high-level expression of anti-sense transcripts was associated with low-level expression of the cognate sense transcript by reducing the level of histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me3). In summary, these SPEA transcripts increased our knowledge about the transcriptomic complementation in hybrid.

Anti-sense: !increases! Complementation
Hybrid: !has more! Anti-sense transcripts
SPEA: !associated with! Low-level expression of cognate sense transcript
H3K36me3: !reduced by! SPEA transcripts
