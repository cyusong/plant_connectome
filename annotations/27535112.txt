Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential micronutrient that is required for plant growth and development, and it affects the formation of root nodules and nitrogen fixation in legumes. In this study, Lotus japonicus was grown on MS solid media containing 0 nmol l<sup>-1</sup> (-Mo), 103 nmol l<sup>-1</sup> (+Mo) and 1030 nmol l<sup>-1</sup> (10 × Mo) of Mo. The phenotypes of plants growing on the three different media showed no obvious differences after 15 days, but the plants growing on -Mo for 45 days presented typical symptoms of Mo depletion, such as a short taproot, few lateral roots and yellowing leaves. A Mo transporter gene, LjMOT1, was isolated from L. japonicus. It encoded 468 amino acids, including two conserved motifs, and was predicted to locate to chromosome 3 of the L. japonicus genome. A homology comparison indicated that LjMOT1 had high similarities to other MOT1 proteins and was closely related to GmMOT1. Subcellular localization indicated that LjMOT1 is localized to the plasma membrane. qRT-PCR analyses showed that increasing Mo concentrations regulated the relative expression level of LjMOT1. Moreover, the Mo concentration in shoots was positively correlated to the expression of LjMOT1, but there was no such evident correlation in the roots. In addition, changes in the nitrate reductase activity were coincident with changes in the Mo concentration. These results suggest that LjMOT1 may be involved in the transport of Mo and provide a theoretical basis for further understanding of the mechanism of Mo transport in higher plants.
