['9741629', 'SKOR, a K+ channel identified in Arabidopsis, displays the typical hydrophobic  core of the Shaker channel superfamily, a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, and  an ankyrin domain. Expression in Xenopus oocytes identified SKOR as the first  member of the Shaker family in plants to be endowed with outwardly rectifying  properties. SKOR expression is localized in root stelar tissues. A knockout  mutant shows both lower shoot K+ content and lower xylem sap K+ concentration,  indicating that SKOR is involved in K+ release into the xylem sap toward the  shoots. SKOR expression is strongly inhibited by the stress phytohormone abscisic  acid, supporting the hypothesis that control of K+ translocation toward the  shoots is part of the plant response to water stress.', '1998 Sep 4', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81606-2', 'Sentenac']
