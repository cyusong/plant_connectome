Organ abscission in plants requires the hydrolysis of cell wall components, mainly including celluloses, pectins, and xyloglucans. However, how the genes that encode those hydrolytic enzymes are regulated and their function in abscission remains unclear. Previously we revealed that two cellulase genes LcCEL2/8 and two polygalacturonase genes LcPG1/2 were responsible for the degradation of celluloses and pectins, respectively, during fruitlet abscission in litchi. Here, we further identified three xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase genes (LcXTH4, LcXTH7, LcXTH19) that are also involved in this process. Nineteen LcXTHs, named LcXTH1-19, were identified in the litchi genome. Transcriptome data and qRT-PCR confirmed that LcXTH4/7/19 were significantly induced at the abscission zone (AZ) during fruitlet abscission in litchi. The GUS reporter driven by each promoter of LcXTH4/7/19 was specifically expressed at the floral abscission zone of Arabidopsis, and importantly ectopic expression of LcXTH19 in Arabidopsis resulted in precocious floral organ abscission. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and dual-luciferase reporter analysis showed that the expression of LcXTH4/7/19 could be directly activated by two ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-like (EIL) transcription factors LcEIL2/3. Collectively, we propose that LcXTH4/7/19 are involved in fruitlet abscission, and LcEIL2/3-mediated transcriptional regulation of diverse cell wall hydrolytic genes is responsible for this process in litchi.
