Mitochondrial respiration depends on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Many respiratory chain-related proteins are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and undergo translation by mitochondrial ribosomes. The newly identified maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>defective kernel44</i> (<i>dek44</i>) mutant produces small kernels showing embryo-lethal phenotypes. We cloned <i>Dek44</i> by isolating the <i>Mutator</i> tag that produced the mutation and identified it as encoding a putative 50S ribosomal protein L9. Subcellular fractionation by ultracentrifugation confirmed that DEK44 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein. DEK44 is highly conserved in monocots and only accumulates in kernels. Transcriptome and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses revealed that loss of DEK44 function affects the expression of genes encoding respiratory chain-related proteins from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Blue native-PAGE revealed significantly reduced assembly of respiratory chain complexes in <i>dek44</i> mutant kernels. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the biogenesis and morphology of mitochondria were strongly affected in <i>dek44</i> mutant kernels. Furthermore, DEK44 might regulate cell growth and kernel development via cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated activities. This study provides insight into the regulation of kernel development based on mitochondrial ribosomal protein function.
