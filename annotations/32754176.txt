Wild <i>Helianthus</i> species are an important genetic resource for sunflower improvement, but sometimes there are adverse interactions between the wild and cultivated sunflowers. This study reports the inheritance of reduced vigor and its restoration resulting from an interaction of perennial <i>Helianthus</i> cytoplasms with nuclear genes of cultivated sunflower lines. The large number of vigor restoration (<i>V</i>) genes identified in cultivated lines are all located at the same locus, designated <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> , suggesting a common origin of these genes. Additional <i>V</i> genes derived from the wild perennial species <i>H. giganteus</i> L. and <i>H. hirsutus</i> Raf. are located at a different locus than <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> , designated <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> . A major difference between the wild annual <i>Helianthus</i> cytoplasms and perennial cytoplasms is the lack of the vigor-reducing cytoplasms, but surprisingly <i>V</i> genes were observed in wild annual <i>H. annuus</i> L. and <i>H. petiolaris</i> Nutt. which were at the same locus as <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> . A common vigor-reducing cytoplasmic effect of the perennial <i>Helianthus</i> species and the existence of a common vigor restoration <i>V</i> gene in most perennial <i>Helianthus</i> species could be explained as a result of vigor selection during <i>Helianthus</i> speciation. <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> was mapped on linkage group (LG) 7 of the sunflower genome, using an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from MOL-RV/HA 821. <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> co-segregated with an InDel marker ZVG31, with three single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, SFW01024, SFW07230, and SFW00604, located above it on the map at a genetic distance of 0.8 cM, and another SNP marker, SFW08671, below it at a distance of 0.4 cM. The physical distance between the two closest flanking SNP markers corresponds to 0.56 and 1.37 Mb on the HA 412-HO and XRQ assemblies, respectively. The tightly linked markers will help select normal vigor progenies when using perennial <i>Helianthus</i> cytoplasms in a breeding program, which will also provide a basis for studying the mechanism of the cytonuclear interaction, and the speciation of annual and perennial <i>Helianthus</i> species.
