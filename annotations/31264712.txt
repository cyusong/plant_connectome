In the recent times, plants are facing certain types of environmental stresses, which give rise to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxides, superoxide anions and so on. These are required by the plants at low concentrations for signal transduction and at high concentrations, they repress plant root growth. Apart from the ROS activities, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S) and nitric oxide (NO) have major contributions in regulating growth and developmental processes in plants, as they also play key roles as signaling molecules and act as chief plant immune defense mechanisms against various biotic as well as abiotic stresses. H<sub>2</sub> S and NO are the two pivotal gaseous messengers involved in growth, germination and improved tolerance in plants under stressed and non-stress conditions. H<sub>2</sub> S and NO mediate cell signaling in plants as a response to several abiotic stresses like temperature, heavy metal exposure, water and salinity. They alter gene expression levels to induce the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes, osmolytes and also trigger their interactions with each other. However, research has been limited to only cross adaptations and signal transductions. Understanding the change and mechanism of H<sub>2</sub> S and NO mediated cell signaling will broaden our knowledge on the various biochemical changes that occur in plant cells related to different stresses. A clear understanding of these molecules in various environmental stresses would help to confer biotechnological applications to protect plants against abiotic stresses and to improve crop productivity.
