['20231441', "The Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family is an evolutionarily conserved,  multifunctional group of cochaperones that perform diverse cellular functions  ranging from proliferation to growth arrest and cell death in yeast, in mammals,  and, as recently observed, in plants. The Arabidopsis genome contains seven  homologs of the BAG family, including four with domain organization similar to  animal BAGs. In the present study we show that an Arabidopsis BAG, AtBAG7, is a  uniquely localized endoplasmic reticulum (ER) BAG that is necessary for the  proper maintenance of the unfolded protein response (UPR). AtBAG7 was shown to  interact directly in vivo with the molecular chaperone, AtBiP2, by bimolecular  fluorescence complementation assays, and the interaction was confirmed by yeast  two-hybrid assay. Treatment with an inducer of UPR, tunicamycin, resulted in  accelerated cell death of AtBAG7-null mutants. Furthermore, AtBAG7 knockouts were  sensitive to known ER stress stimuli, heat and cold. In these knockouts heat  sensitivity was reverted successfully to the wild-type phenotype with the  addition of the chemical chaperone, tauroursodexycholic acid (TUDCA). Real-time  PCR of ER stress proteins indicated that the expression of the heat-shock  protein, AtBiP3, is selectively up-regulated in AtBAG7-null mutants upon heat and  cold stress. Our results reveal an unexpected diversity of the plant's BAG gene  family and suggest that AtBAG7 is an essential component of the UPR during heat  and cold tolerance, thus confirming the cytoprotective role of plant BAGs.", '2010 Mar 30', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0912670107', 'Dickman']
