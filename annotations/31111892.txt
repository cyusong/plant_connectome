Nitric oxide (NO) is an active redox molecule involved in the control of a wide range of functions integral to plant biology. For instance, NO is implicated in seed germination, floral development, senescence, stomatal closure, and plant responses to stress. NO usually mediates signaling events via interactions with different biomolecules, for example the modulation of protein functioning through post-translational modifications (NO-PTMs). S-nitrosation is a reversible redox NO-PTM that consists of the addition of NO to a specific thiol group of a cysteine residue, leading to formation of S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). SNOs are more stable than NO and therefore they can extend and spread the in vivo NO signaling. The development of robust and reliable detection methods has allowed the identification of hundreds of S-nitrosated proteins involved in a wide range of physiological and stress-related processes in plants. For example, SNOs have a physiological function in plant development, hormone metabolism, nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis, among many other processes. The role of S-nitrosation as a regulator of plant responses to salinity and drought stress through the modulation of specific protein targets has also been well established. However, there are many S-nitrosated proteins that have been identified under different abiotic stresses for which the specific roles have not yet been identified. In this review, we examine current knowledge of the specific role of SNOs in the signaling events that lead to plant responses to abiotic stress, with a particular focus on examples where their functions have been well characterized at the molecular level.
