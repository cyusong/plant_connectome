Macroalgae and seagrasses in coastal habitats are exposed to turbulent water currents and waves that deform them and can rip them off the substratum, but that also transport essential water-borne substances to them and disperse their propagules and wastes. Field studies of the physical environment, ecological interactions, and life history strategies of marine macrophytes reveal which aspects of their biomechanical performance are important to their success in different types of natural habitats and enable us to design ecologically relevant laboratory experiments to study biomechanical function. Morphology and tissue mechanical properties determine the hydrodynamic forces on macrophytes and their fate when exposed to those forces, but different mechanical designs can perform well in the same biophysical habitat. There is a trade-off between maximizing photosynthesis and minimizing breakage, and some macrophytes change their morphology in response to environmental cues. Water flow in marine habitats varies on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, so diverse flow microhabitats can occur at the same site. Likewise, the size, shape, and tissue material properties of macrophytes change as they grow and age, so it is important to understand the different physical challenges met by macrophytes throughout their lives.
