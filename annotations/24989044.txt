Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that affect plant growth and regulate gene expression differentially across tissues. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying GA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana, we focused on a GDSL lipase gene (LIP1) induced by GA and repressed by DELLA proteins. LIP1 contains an L1 box promoter sequence, conserved in the promoters of epidermis-specific genes, that is bound by ATML1, an HD-ZIP transcription factor required for epidermis specification. In this study, we demonstrate that LIP1 is specifically expressed in the epidermis and that its L1 box sequence mediates GA-induced transcription. We show that this sequence is overrepresented in the upstream regulatory regions of GA-induced and DELLA-repressed transcriptomes and that blocking GA signaling in the epidermis represses the expression of L1 box-containing genes and negatively affects seed germination. We show that DELLA proteins interact directly with ATML1 and its paralogue PDF2 and that silencing of both HD-ZIP transcription factors inhibits epidermal gene expression and delays germination. Our results indicate that, upon seed imbibition, increased GA levels reduce DELLA protein abundance and release ATML1/PDF2 to activate L1 box gene expression, thus enhancing germination potential.
