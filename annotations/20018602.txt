['20018602', 'Cell division depends on the correct localization of the cyclin-dependent kinases  that are regulated by phosphorylation, cyclin proteolysis, and protein-protein  interactions. Although immunological assays can define cell cycle protein  abundance and localization, they are not suitable for detecting the dynamic  rearrangements of molecular components during cell division. Here, we applied an  in vivo approach to trace the subcellular localization of 60 Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) core cell cycle proteins fused to green fluorescent  proteins during cell division in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Arabidopsis.  Several cell cycle proteins showed a dynamic association with mitotic structures,  such as condensed chromosomes and the preprophase band in both species,  suggesting a strong conservation of targeting mechanisms. Furthermore,  colocalized proteins were shown to bind in vivo, strengthening their  localization-function connection. Thus, we identified unknown spatiotemporal  territories where functional cell cycle protein interactions are most likely to  occur.', '2010 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.148643', 'Russinova']
