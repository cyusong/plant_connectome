A fast, reproducible, and efficient transformation procedure employing Agrobacterium rhizogenes was developed for Phaseolus vulgaris L. wild accessions, landraces, and cultivars and for three other species belonging to the genus Phaseolus: P. coccineus, P. lunatus, and P. acutifolius. Induced hairy roots are robust and grow quickly. The transformation frequency is between 75 and 90% based on the 35-S promoter-driven green fluorescent protein and beta-glucuronidase expression reporter constructs. When inoculated with Rhizobium tropici, transgenic roots induce normal determinate nodules that fix nitrogen as efficiently as inoculated standard roots. The A. rhizogenes-induced hairy root transformation in the genus Phaseolus sets the foundation for functional genomics programs focused on root physiology, root metabolism, and root-microbe interactions.
