miR156 is a highly conserved plant miRNA and has been extensively studied because of its versatile roles in plant development. Here, we report a novel role of miR156 in regulating somatic embryogenesis (SE) in citrus, one of the most widely cultivated fruit crops in the world. SE is an important means of in vitro regeneration, but over the course of long-term sub-culturing there is always a decline in the SE potential of the preserved citrus embryogenic callus, and this represents a key obstacle for citrus biotechnology. In this study, the SE competence of citrus callus of wild kumquat (Fortunella hindsii) was significantly enhanced by either overexpression of csi-miR156a or by individual knock-down of the two target genes, CsSPL3 and CsSPL14, indicating that the effect of miR156-SPL modules was established during the initial phases of SE induction. Biological processes that might promote SE in response to miR156 overexpression were explored using RNA-seq, and mainly included hormone signaling pathways, stress responses, DNA methylation, and the cell cycle. CsAKIN10 was identified as interacting protein of CsSPL14. Our results provide insights into the regulatory pathway through which miR156-SPL modules enhance the SE potential of citrus callus, and provide a theoretical basis for improvement of plant SE competence.
