['27325892', 'GLYCEROL-3-PHOSPHATE ACYLTRANSFERASE (GPAT) genes encode enzymes involved in  glycerolipid biosynthesis in plants. Ten GPAT homologues have been identified in  Arabidopsis. GPATs 4-8 have been shown to be involved in the production of  extracellular lipid barrier polyesters. Recently, GPAT9 was reported to be  essential for triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in developing Arabidopsis seeds.  The enzymatic properties and possible functions of GPAT9 in surface lipid, polar  lipid and TAG biosynthesis in non-seed organs, however, have not been  investigated. Here we show that Arabidopsis GPAT9 exhibits sn-1 acyltransferase  activity with high specificity for acyl-coenzyme A, thus providing further  evidence that this GPAT is involved in storage lipid biosynthesis. We also  confirm a role for GPAT9 in seed oil biosynthesis and further demonstrate that  GPAT9 contributes to the biosynthesis of both polar lipids and TAG in developing  leaves, as well as lipid droplet production in developing pollen grains.  Conversely, alteration of constitutive GPAT9 expression had no obvious effects on  surface lipid biosynthesis. Taken together, these studies expand our  understanding of GPAT9 function to include modulation of several different  intracellular glycerolipid pools in plant cells.', '2016 Aug', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erw242', 'Weselake']
