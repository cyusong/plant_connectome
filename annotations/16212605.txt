['16212605', 'The Arabidopsis RPM1 protein confers resistance to disease caused by Pseudomonas  syringae strains delivering either the AvrRpm1 or AvrB type III effector proteins  into host cells. We characterized two closely related RPM1-interacting proteins,  RIN2 and RIN3. RIN2 and RIN3 encode RING-finger type ubiquitin ligases with six  apparent transmembrane domains and an ubiquitin-binding CUE domain. RIN2 and RIN3  are orthologs of the mammalian autocrine motility factor receptor, a cytokine  receptor localized in both plasma membrane caveolae and the endoplasmic  reticulum. RIN2 is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, as are RPM1  and RPS2. The C-terminal regions of RIN2 and RIN3, including the CUE domain,  interact strongly with an RPM1 N-terminal fragment and weakly with a similar  domain from the Arabidopsis RPS2 protein. RIN2 and RIN3 can dimerize through  their C-terminal regions. The RING-finger domains of RIN2 and RIN3 encode  ubiquitin ligases. Inoculation with P. syringae DC3000(avrRpm1) or P. syringae  DC3000(avrRpt2) induces differential decreases of RIN2 mobility in SDS-PAGE and  disappearance of the majority of RIN2. A rin2 rin3 double mutant expresses  diminished RPM1- and RPS2-dependent hypersensitive response (HR), but no  alteration of pathogen growth. Thus, the RIN2/RIN3 RING E3 ligases apparently act  on a substrate that regulates RPM1- and RPS2-dependent HR.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02525.x', 'Dangl']
