The antagonistic bacterium Pseudomonas protegens secretes the cyclic lipopeptide (CLiP) orfamide A, which triggers a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal causing rapid deflagellation of the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We performed chemical synthesis of orfamide A derivatives and used an aequorin reporter line to measure their Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Immobilization of algae was studied using a modulator and mutants of transient receptor potential (TRP)-type channels. By investigating targeted synthetic orfamide A derivatives, we found that N-terminal amino acids of the linear part and the terminal fatty acid region are important for the specificity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> -signal causing deflagellation. Molecular editing indicates that at least two distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> -signaling pathways are triggered. One is involved in deflagellation (Thr<sup>3</sup> change, fatty acid tail shortened by 4C), whereas the other still causes an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the algal cells, but does not cause substantial deflagellation (Leu<sup>1</sup> change, fatty acid hydroxylation, fatty acid changes by 2C). Using mutants, we define four TRP-type channels that are involved in orfamide A signaling; only one (ADF1) responds additionally to low pH. These results suggest that the linear part of the CLiP plays one major role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and that orfamide A uses a network of algal TRP-type channels for deflagellation.
