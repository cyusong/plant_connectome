The role of microtubules in cellular pathways of UV-B signaling in plants as well as in related structural cell response become into focus of few last publications. As microtubules in plant cell reorient/reorganize (become randomized, fragmented or depolymerized) in a response to direct UV-B exposure, these cytoskeletal components could be involved into UV-B signaling pathways as highly responsive players. In the current addendum, indirect UV-B-induced microtubules reorganization in cells of shielded Arabidopsis thaliana (GFP-MAP4) primary roots and the correspondence of microtubules depolymerization with the typical hallmarks of the programmed cell death in Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 (GFP-MBD) cells are discussed.
