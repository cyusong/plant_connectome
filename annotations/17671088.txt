A plant grown under canopies perceives the reduction in the ratio of red (R) to far-red (FR) light as a warning of competition, and enhances elongation growth in an attempt to overgrow its neighbors. Here, we report that the same low R/FR signal that induces hypocotyl elongation also triggers a rapid arrest of leaf primordium growth, ensuring that plant resources are redirected into extension growth. The growth arrest induced by low R/FR depends on auxin-induced cytokinin breakdown in incipient vein cells of developing primordia, thus demonstrating the existence of a previously unrecognized regulatory circuit underlying plant response to canopy shade.

R/FR signal: !induces! Hypocotyl elongation
R/FR signal: !triggers! Leaf primordium growth arrest
Auxin: !induces! Cytokinin breakdown
Cytokinin breakdown: !underlies! Plant response to canopy shade
