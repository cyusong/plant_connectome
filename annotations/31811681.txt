The biological conversion of light energy into chemical energy is performed by a flexible photosynthetic machinery located in the thylakoid membranes. Photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII) are the two complexes able to harvest light. PSI is the last complex of the electron transport chain and is composed of multiple subunits: the proteins building the catalytic core complex that are well conserved between oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, and, in green organisms, the membrane light-harvesting complexes (Lhc) necessary to increase light absorption. In plants, four Lhca proteins (Lhca1-4) make up the antenna system of PSI, which can be further extended to optimize photosynthesis by reversible binding of LHCII, the main antenna complex of photosystem II. Here, we used biochemistry and electron microscopy in Arabidopsis to reveal a previously unknown supercomplex of PSI with LHCII that contains an additional Lhca1-a4 dimer bound on the PsaB-PsaI-PsaH side of the complex. This finding contradicts recent structural studies suggesting that the presence of an Lhca dimer at this position is an exclusive feature of algal PSI. We discuss the features of the additional Lhca dimer in the large plant PSI-LHCII supercomplex and the differences with the algal PSI. Our work provides further insights into the intricate structural plasticity of photosystems.
