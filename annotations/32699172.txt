['32699172', 'Vesicle exocytosis underpins signaling and development in plants and is vital for  cell expansion. Vesicle tethering and fusion are thought to occur sequentially,  with tethering mediated by the exocyst and fusion driven by assembly of soluble  NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins from the vesicle membrane  (R-SNAREs or vesicle-associated membrane proteins [VAMPs]) and the target  membrane (Q-SNAREs). Interactions between exocyst and SNARE protein complexes are  known, but their functional consequences remain largely unexplored. We now  identify a hierarchy of interactions leading to secretion in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Mating-based split-ubiquitin screens and in vivo Forster  resonance energy transfer analyses showed that exocyst EXO70 subunits bind  preferentially to cognate plasma membrane SNAREs, notably SYP121 and VAMP721. The  exo70A1 mutant affected SNARE distribution and suppressed vesicle traffic  similarly to the dominant-negative truncated protein SYP121(DeltaC), which blocks  secretion at the plasma membrane. These phenotypes are consistent with the  epistasis of exo70A1 in the exo70A1 syp121 double mutant, which shows decreased  growth similar to exo70A1 single mutants. However, the exo70A1 vamp721 mutant  showed a strong, synergy, suppressing growth and cell expansion beyond the  phenotypic sum of the two single mutants. These data are best explained by a  hierarchy of SNARE recruitment to the exocyst at the plasma membrane, dominated  by the R-SNARE and plausibly with the VAMP721 longin domain as a nexus for  binding.', '2020 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.20.00280', 'ORCID:']
