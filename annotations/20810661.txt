['20810661', 'Ubiquitin pathway E3 ligases are an important component conferring specificity  and regulation in ubiquitin attachment to substrate proteins. The Arabidopsis  thaliana RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain-containing proteins BRIZ1 and  BRIZ2 are essential for normal seed germination and post-germination growth. Loss  of either BRIZ1 (At2g42160) or BRIZ2 (At2g26000) results in a severe phenotype.  Heterozygous parents produce progeny that segregate 3:1 for  wild-type:growth-arrested seedlings. Homozygous T-DNA insertion lines are  recovered for BRIZ1 and BRIZ2 after introduction of a transgene containing the  respective coding sequence, demonstrating that disruption of BRIZ1 or BRIZ2 in  the T-DNA insertion lines is responsible for the observed phenotype. Both  proteins have multiple predicted domains in addition to the RING domain as  follows: a BRAP2 (BRCA1-Associated Protein 2), a ZnF UBP (Zinc Finger Ubiquitin  Binding protein), and a coiled-coil domain. In vitro, both BRIZ1 and BRIZ2 are  active as E3 ligases but only BRIZ2 binds ubiquitin. In vitro synthesized and  purified recombinant BRIZ1 and BRIZ2 preferentially form hetero-oligomers rather  than homo-oligomers, and the coiled-coil domain is necessary and sufficient for  this interaction. BRIZ1 and BRIZ2 co-purify after expression in tobacco leaves,  which also requires the coiled-coil domain. BRIZ1 and BRIZ2 coding regions with  substitutions in the RING domain are inactive in vitro and, after introduction,  fail to complement their respective mutant lines. In our current model, BRIZ1 and  BRIZ2 together are required for formation of a functional ubiquitin E3 ligase in  vivo, and this complex is required for germination and early seedling growth.', '2010 Nov 19', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110.168021', 'Callis']
