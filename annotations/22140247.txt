The metabolome is an integral part of a plant's life cycle and determines for a large part its external phenotype. It is the final, internal product of chemical interactions, obtained through developmental, genetic, and environmental inputs, and as such, it defines the state of a plant in terms of development and performance. Understanding its regulation will provide knowledge and new insights into the biochemical pathways and genetic interactions that shape the plant and its surroundings. In this review, we will focus on four dimensions that contribute to the huge diversity of metabolomes and we will illustrate how this diversity shapes the plant in terms of development and performance: (i) temporal regulation: the metabolome is extremely dynamic and temporal changes in the environment can have an immense impact on its composition; (ii) spatial regulation: metabolites can be very specific, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, to specialized organs, tissues, and cell types; (iii) environmental regulation: the metabolic profile of plants is highly dependent on environmental signals, such as light, temperature, and nutrients, and very susceptible to biotic and abiotic stresses; and (iv) genetic regulation: the biosynthesis, structure, and accumulation of metabolites have a genetic origin, and there is quantitative and qualitative variation for metabolomes within a species. We will address the contribution of these dimensions to the wide diversity of metabolomes and highlight how the multi-dimensional regulation of metabolism defines the plant's phenotype.
