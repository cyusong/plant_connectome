S-nitrosylation of protein cysteine thiol groups has recently emerged as a widespread and important reversible post-translational protein modification, involved in redox signalling pathways of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species. S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), member of class III alcohol dehydrogenase family (EC 1.1.1.1), is considered the key enzyme in the catabolism of major low molecular S-nitrosothiol, S-nitrosoglutathione, and hence to control the level of protein S-nitrosylation. Changes of GSNOR activity after exposure to different abiotic stress conditions, including low and high temperature, continuous dark and de-etiolation, and mechanical injury, were investigated in important agricultural plants. Significantly higher GSNOR activity was found under normal conditions in leaves of Cucumis spp. genotype sensitive to biotrophic pathogen Golovinomyces cichoracearum. GSNOR activity was generally increased in all studied plants by all types of stress conditions. Strong down-regulation of GSNOR was observed in hypocotyls of etiolated pea plants, which did not recover to values of green plants even 168 h after the transfer of etiolated plants to normal light regime. These results point to important role of GSNOR during normal plant development and in plant responses to several types of abiotic stress conditions.
