['22694475', 'DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation is the initial event for meiotic  recombination catalyzed by the conserved Spo11 protein. In Arabidopsis, several  proteins have been reported to be involved in DSB formation. Here, we report an  Arabidopsis DSB forming (DFO) gene in Arabidopsis that is involved in DSB  formation. The dfo mutant exhibits reduced fertility, producing polyads with an  abnormal number of microspores, unlike the tetrads in the wild type. The dfo  meiocytes were defective in homologous chromosome synapsis and segregation.  Genetic analysis revealed that the homologous recombination of Atdfo-1 is  severely affected in meiotic prophase I. DFO encodes a protein without any known  conserved domain. There was no homologue identified outside the plant kingdom,  indicating that AtDFO is a plant-specific protein. AtMRE11 has been reported to  be responsible for processing SPO11-generated DSBs. The Atmre11 mutant displays  chromosome fragmentation during meiosis. However, the Atdfo Atmre11 double mutant  had no such chromosome fragmentation, indicating that AtDFO is required for DSB  formation.', '2012 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05075.x', 'Yang']
