Small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) has been extensively studied in plants, resulting in a deep understanding of a major 'canonical RdDM' mechanism. However, current models of canonical RdDM cannot explain how this self-perpetuating mechanism is initiated. Recent investigations into the initiation of epigenetic silencing have determined that there are several alternative 'non-canonical RdDM' pathways that function through distinct mechanisms to modify chromatin. This Review aims to illustrate the diversity of non-canonical RdDM mechanisms described to date, recognize common themes within this dizzying array of interconnected pathways, and identify the key unanswered questions remaining in this field.
