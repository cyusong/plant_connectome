Potato is a major staple crop, and necrotrophic bacterial pathogens such as <i>Pectobacterium</i> spp. are a major threat to global food security. Most lines of cultivated potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) are susceptible to <i>Pectobacterium</i> spp., but some lines of wild potato are resistant, including <i>Solanum chacoense</i> M6. Despite the discovery of resistance in wild potatoes, specific resistance genes are yet to be discovered. Crude protein extract from M6 had a global effect on <i>Pectobacterium brasiliense</i> Pb1692 (Pb1692) virulence phenotypes. Specifically, M6 protein extracts resulted in reduced <i>Pectobacterium</i> exo-protease activity and motility, induced cell elongation, and affected bacterial virulence and metabolic gene expression. These effects were not observed from protein extracts of susceptible potato <i>S. tuberosum</i> DM1. A proteomics approach identified protease inhibitors (PIs) as candidates for <i>S. chacoense</i> resistance, and genomic analysis showed higher abundance and diversity of PIs in M6 than in DM1. We cloned five PIs that are unique or had high abundance in M6 compared with DM1 and purified the proteins (g18987, g28531, g39249, g40384, g6571). Four of the PIs significantly reduced bacterial protease activity, with strongest effects from g28531 and g6571. Three PIs (g18987, g28531, g6571) inhibited disease when co-inoculated with <i>Pectobacterium</i> pathogens into potato tubers. Two PIs (g28531, g6571) also significantly reduced Pb1692 motility and are promising as resistance genes. These results show that <i>S. chacoense</i> PIs contribute to bacterial disease resistance by inhibiting exo-proteases, motility, and tuber maceration and by modulating cell morphology and metabolism.
