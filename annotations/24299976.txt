In plants, 3 different pathways of serine biosynthesis have been described: the Glycolate pathway, which is associated with photorespiration, and 2 non-photorespiratory pathways, the Glycerate and the Phosphorylated pathways. The Phosphorylated Pathway of Serine Biosynthesis (PPSB) has been known since the 1950s, but has been studied relatively little, probably because it was considered of minor significance as compared with the Glycolate pathway. In the associated study (1), we described for the first time in plants the in vivo functional characterization of the PPSB, by targeting the phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP1), the last enzyme of the pathway. Following a gain- and loss-of-function approach in Arabidopsis, we provided genetic and molecular evidence for the essential role of PSP1 for embryo and pollen development, and for proper root growth. A metabolomics study indicated that the PPSB affects glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the biosynthesis of several amino acids, which suggests that this pathway is an important link connecting metabolism and development. The mechanisms underlying the essential functions of PSP1 are discussed.
