['18694747', "We show here that Fhit proteins, in addition to their function as dinucleoside  triphosphate hydrolases, act similarly to adenylylsulfatases and nucleoside  phosphoramidases, liberating nucleoside 5'-monophosphates from such natural  metabolites as adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate and adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate.  Moreover, Fhits recognize synthetic nucleotides, such as adenosine  5'-O-phosphorofluoridate and adenosine 5'-O-(gamma-fluorotriphosphate), and  release AMP from them. With respect to the former, Fhits behave like a  phosphodiesterase I concomitant with cleavage of the P-F bond. Some kinetic  parameters and implications of the novel reactions catalyzed by the human and  plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) Fhit proteins are presented.", '2008 Sep 3', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2008.07.060', 'Stec']
