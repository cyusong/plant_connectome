In order to find out the response mechanism of nitrogen assimilation and glutamine/glutamine family of amino acids metabolism in mulberry (<i>Morus alba</i> L.) leaves under NaCl and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress, and to reveal its role in salt alkali adaptation. The effects of the nitrogen metabolism of mulberry leaves were studied under 100 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> NaCl and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress.The results showed that the activity of NR and the content of TN and SP did not change significantly, the expression of NiR, Fd-NiR, <i>Fd-NiR</i> gene and theactivity of NiR increased significantly under NaCl stress, but nitrogen assimilation was inhibited under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress. NaCl stress had no significant effect on the expression and activity of GS and GOGAT in mulberry leaves. Under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress, the expression of Fd-GOGAT, Fd-GOGAT2, <i>Fd-GOGAT</i> gene, and the activity of GS and GOGAT were significantly decreased. NaCl stress can promote the accumulation of Pro, Put and Spd in mulberry leaves. The accumulation of Pro under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress is greater than that under NaCl stress. NaCl stress also induced the up-regulation of GAD, GAD1 and <i>GAD1</i> gene expression, so promoting the synthesis of GABA may be an adaptive mechanism for mulberry to cope with NaCl stress, but the expression of GAD did not change significantly and <i>GAD</i> gene expression lower than CK under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress. Although both NaCl and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress could promote the synthesis of GSH by up-regulation of GCLM expression, GSH under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress was significantly higher than that under NaCl stress, the content of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was still significantly higher than that of NaCl stress, that means GSH may not play a key role in alleviating the oxidative damage in mulberry leaves caused by salt and alkali.
