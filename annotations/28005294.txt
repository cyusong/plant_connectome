Vein networks that disobey the global scaling of major vein density with leaf size shed light on functional constraints of vein network formation in dicotyledons. Understanding their evolution, distribution and impact on vein-stomata-climate associations is an important contribution to our global view of vein network organization. Based on vein traits of 55 species of pantropical Ochnaceae, stomata and climatic niche data, and a dated molecular phylogeny, we unveil major structural shifts in vein networks through deep time, relationships between leaf size, vein and stomata traits, and their interplay with climate. Dense 2° veins, reduction of minor veins and the associated breakdown of vein-leaf size scaling evolved multiple times independently in Ochnaceae. In spite of the drastic changes in vein architecture in this venation type, vein and stomatal densities remain correlated. Our study demonstrates that shortening the major vein-stomata distance is economically not less advantageous than by increasing minor vein density, as illustrated by the same degree of coordination between vein and stomatal densities and the similar construction costs across networks with dense 2° veins and those with 'normally' spaced 2° veins.
