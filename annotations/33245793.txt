Legume crops contribute a great portion of clean nitrogen (N) to agro-ecosystems through symbiotic N<sub>2</sub> fixation in the nodule; however, the nodulation is always inhibited by high N availability which is known as the N inhibitory effect through largely unknown mechanisms. We functionally investigated miR169c-GmNFYA-C-GmENOD40 under multiple N conditions in soybean (Glycine max) (ENOD, Early Nodulin; NFYA, Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A). We elucidated their regulatory roles in soybean nodulation through analyzing expression patterns, micro-messenger RNA (miRNA-mRNA) interactions, phenotypes of transgenic soybean plants and genetic interactions. We found that miR169c expression was induced by high N, whereas its target GmNFYA-C was preferentially expressed in nodules and induced by rhizobium inoculation. Overexpression of miR169c inhibited nodulation through targeting 3'-UTR of GmNFYA-C, whereas knockout miR169c through CRISPR-cas9 promoted nodulation. However, overexpression of GmNFYA-C promoted soybean nodulation through facilitating rhizobium infection and increasing the expression of symbiotic signaling gene GmENOD40. Besides, GmNFYA-C directly induced the expression of GmENOD40. In addition, overexpression of GmNFYA-C without the target site of miR169c partially attenuated the inhibitory effect of high N on soybean nodulation. We discovered a new regulatory pathway involving the miR169c-NFYA-C-ENOD40 module that regulates soybean nodulation in response to N availability. This pathway provides substantial new insights into the mechanisms underlying the N inhibitory effect on nodulation.
