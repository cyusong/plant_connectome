['15772667', "Cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a ubiquitous signalling component in plant  cells. Numerous stimuli trigger sustained or transient elevations of [Ca2+]cyt  that evoke downstream stimulus-specific responses. Generation of [Ca2+]cyt  signals is effected through stimulus-induced opening of Ca2+-permeable ion  channels that catalyse a flux of Ca2+ into the cytosol from extracellular or  intracellular stores. Many classes of Ca2+ current have been characterized  electrophysiologically in plant membranes. However, the identity of the ion  channels that underlie these currents has until now remained obscure. Here we  show that the TPC1 ('two-pore channel 1') gene of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a  class of Ca2+-dependent Ca2+-release channel that is known from numerous  electrophysiological studies as the slow vacuolar channel. Slow vacuolar channels  are ubiquitous in plant vacuoles, where they form the dominant conductance at  micromolar [Ca2+]cyt. We show that a tpc1 knockout mutant lacks functional slow  vacuolar channel activity and is defective in both abscisic acid-induced  repression of germination and in the response of stomata to extracellular  calcium. These studies unequivocally demonstrate a critical role of intracellular  Ca2+-release channels in the physiological processes of plants.", '2005 Mar 17', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature03381', 'Sanders']
