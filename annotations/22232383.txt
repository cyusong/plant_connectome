['22232383', 'Sucrose-nonfermentation1-related protein kinase1 (SnRK1) is an evolutionarily  conserved energy sensor protein that regulates gene expression in response to  energy depletion in plants. Efforts to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of  this protein kinase are hampered, however, by inherent growth defects of  snrk1-null mutant plants. To overcome these limitations and study SnRK1 functions  in vivo, we applied a method combining transient expression in leaf mesophyll  protoplasts and stable expression in transgenic plants. We found that both rice  (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SnRK1 activities critically  influence stress-inducible gene expression and the induction of stress tolerance.  Genetic, molecular, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses further revealed  that the nuclear SnRK1 modulated target gene transcription in a  submergence-dependent manner. From early seedling development through late  senescence, SnRK1 activities appeared to modulate developmental processes in the  plants. Our findings offer insight into the regulatory functions of plant SnRK1  in stress-responsive gene regulation and in plant growth and development  throughout the life cycle.', '2012 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.189829', 'Yoo']
