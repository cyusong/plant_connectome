Grain yield (GY) and grain protein content (GPC) are important traits for wheat breeding and production; however, they are usually negatively correlated. The <i>Q</i> gene is the most important domestication gene in cultivated wheat because it influences many traits, including GY and GPC. Allelic variations in the <i>Q</i> gene may positively affect both GY and GPC. Accordingly, we characterized two new <i>Q</i> alleles (<i>Q<sup>s1</sup></i> and <i>Q<sup>c1</sup>-N8</i>) obtained through ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutagenesis. Compared with the wild-type <i>Q</i> allele, <i>Q<sup>s1</sup></i> contains a missense mutation in the sequence encoding the first AP<sub>2</sub> domain, whereas <i>Q<sup>c1</sup>-N8</i> has two missense mutations: one in the sequence encoding the second AP<sub>2</sub> domain and the other in the microRNA172-binding site. The <i>Q<sup>s1</sup></i> allele did not significantly affect GPC or other processing quality parameters, but it adversely affected GY by decreasing the thousand kernel weight and grain number per spike. In contrast, <i>Q<sup>c1</sup>-N8</i> positively affected GPC and GY by increasing the thousand kernel weight and grain number per spike. Thus, we generated novel germplasm relevant for wheat breeding. A specific molecular marker was developed to facilitate the use of the <i>Q<sup>c1</sup>-N8</i> allele in breeding. Furthermore, our findings provide useful new information for enhancing cereal crops via non-transgenic approaches.
