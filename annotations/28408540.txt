Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an essential cofactor for a range of biochemical reactions and a potent antioxidant, plays important roles in plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but the specific role of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis in endosperm development has not been fully addressed, especially in monocot crops, where endosperm constitutes the major portion of the grain. Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm development in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis vitamin B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize plant, including developing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). These results indicate that vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm development in maize. The vitamin B<sub>6</sub> required for seed development is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.
