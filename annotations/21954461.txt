['21954461', 'Plants have a chemically heterogeneous lipophilic layer, the cuticle, which  protects them from biotic and abiotic stresses. The mechanisms that regulate  cuticle development are poorly understood. We identified a rice (Oryza sativa)  dominant curly leaf mutant, curly flag leaf1 (cfl1), and cloned CFL1, which  encodes a WW domain protein. We overexpressed both rice and Arabidopsis CFL1 in  Arabidopsis thaliana; these transgenic plants showed severely impaired cuticle  development, similar to that in cfl1 rice. Reduced expression of At CFL1 resulted  in reinforcement of cuticle structure. At CFL1 was predominantly expressed in  specialized epidermal cells and in regions where dehiscence and abscission occur.  Biochemical evidence showed that At CFL1 interacts with HDG1, a class IV  homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor. Suppression of HDG1 function  resulted in similar defective cuticle phenotypes in wild-type Arabidopsis but  much alleviated phenotypes in At cfl1-1 mutants. The expression of two cuticle  development-associated genes, BDG and FDH, was downregulated in At CFL1  overexpressor and HDG1 suppression plants. HDG1 binds to the cis-element L1 box,  which exists in the regulatory regions of BDG and FDH. Our results suggest that  rice and Arabidopsis CFL1 negatively regulate cuticle development by affecting  the function of HDG1, which regulates the downstream genes BDG and FDH.', '2011 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.088625', 'Gu']
