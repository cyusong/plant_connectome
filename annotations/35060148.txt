The phloem enables vascular plants to transport photoassimilates from source tissues to heterotrophic sink tissues. In the phloem, unbroken strings of enucleated sieve elements, which lose the majority of their cellular contents upon maturation, provide a low resistance path for mass flow. The protein machinery in mature sieve elements performs vital functions to maintain the flow, transmit systemic signals and defend the sugar stream against pests. However, our knowledge of this particular protein population is very limited since mature sieve elements are difficult to isolate and not amenable to transcriptomic analysis due to their enucleate nature. Here, we used co-expression analysis and published gene clusters from transcriptomic studies to generate a list of sieve element proteins that potentially survive the enucleation process to reside in mature sieve elements. We selected seven candidates and show that they all localize in sieve elements in Arabidopsis roots and six of them in bolting stems. Our results support the idea that nascent sieve elements prior to enucleation translate part of the protein machinery found in mature sieve elements. Our co-expression list and the publicly available gene clusters expressed in late proto- and meta-phloem sieve elements are valuable resources for uncharacterized genes that may function in mature sieve elements.
