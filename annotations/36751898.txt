Mechanisms of diversification in fungi are relatively poorly known. Many ectomycorrhizal symbionts show preference for particular host genera or families, so host-symbiont selection may be an important driver of fungal diversification in ectomycorrhizal systems. However, whether ectomycorrhizal hosts and symbionts show correlated evolutionary patterns remains untested, and it is unknown whether fungal specialisation also occurs in systems dominated by hosts from the same genus. We use metabarcoding of ectomycorrhizal fungi collected with hyphal ingrowth bags from Nothofagus forests across southern New Zealand to investigate host-symbiont specialisation and correlated evolution. We examine how ectomycorrhizal communities differ between host species and look for patterns of host-symbiont cophylogeny. We found substantial differences in ectomycorrhizal communities associated with different host taxa, particularly between hosts from different subgenera (Lophozonia and Fuscospora), but also between more closely related hosts. Twenty-four per cent of fungal taxa tested showed affiliations to particular hosts, and tests for cophylogeny revealed significant correlations between host relatedness and the fungal phylogeny that extended to substantial evolutionary depth. These results provide new evidence of correlated evolution in ectomycorrhizal systems, indicating that preferences among closely related host species may represent an important evolutionary driver for local lineage diversification in ectomycorrhizal fungi.
