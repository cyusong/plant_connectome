Olive is one of the most important fruit crop trees in the history of Mediterranean because of the high quality oil. Olive oil has a well-balanced fatty acid composition along with biophenols, which make it exceptional in human diet and provide an exceptional value to the olive oil. Leaf non-glandular peltate trichomes are specialized cell types representing a protective barrier against acute environmental conditions. To characterize the proteome of this highly differentiated cell type, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis among isolated trichomes and trichome-less leaves. Proteins were separated and identified using the 2-DE MALDI-TOF/MS method. A number of enzymes involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses are present and may be responsible for the adaptation to prolonged adverse environmental conditions. The results show that this highly differentiated cell type is physiologically active fulfilling the demands of the trichomes in furnishing the leaf with a highly protective mechanism.
