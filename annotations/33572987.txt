['33572987', 'Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the synthesis of glycosidic linkages and are  essential in the biosynthesis of glycans, glycoconjugates (glycolipids and  glycoproteins), and glycosides. Plant genomes generally encode many more GTs than  animal genomes due to the synthesis of a cell wall and a wide variety of  glycosylated secondary metabolites. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome is predicted  to encode over 573 GTs that are currently classified into 42 diverse families.  The biochemical functions of most of these GTs are still unknown. In this study,  we updated the JBEI Arabidopsis GT clone collection by cloning an additional 105  GT cDNAs, 508 in total (89%), into Gateway-compatible vectors for downstream  characterization. We further established a functional analysis pipeline using  transient expression in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) followed by enzymatic  assays, fractionation of enzymatic products by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) and  characterization by mass spectrometry (MS). Using the GT14 family as an exemplar,  we outline a strategy for identifying effective substrates of GT enzymes. By  addition of UDP-GlcA as donor and the synthetic acceptors  galactose-nitrobenzodiazole (Gal-NBD), beta-1,6-galactotetraose (beta-1,6-Gal(4)) and  beta-1,3-galactopentose (beta-1,3-Gal(5)) to microsomes expressing individual GT14  enzymes, we verified the beta-glucuronosyltransferase (GlcAT) activity of three  members of this family (AtGlcAT14A, B, and E). In addition, a new family member  (AT4G27480, 248) was shown to possess significantly higher activity than other  GT14 enzymes. Our data indicate a likely role in arabinogalactan-protein (AGP)  biosynthesis for these GT14 members. Together, the updated Arabidopsis GT clone  collection and the biochemical analysis pipeline present an efficient means to  identify and characterize novel GT catalytic activities.', '2021 Jan 29', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms22031360', 'ORCID:']
