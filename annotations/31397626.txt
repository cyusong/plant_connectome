Enhancing broad-spectrum resistance is a major goal of crop breeding. However, broad-spectrum resistance has not been thoroughly investigated, and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), ACCELERATED CELL DEATH6 (ACD6) is a key component of broad-spectrum resistance that acts in a positive feedback loop with salicylic acid (SA) to regulate multiple pattern recognition receptors. However, the role of ACD6 in disease resistance in crop plants is unclear. Here, we show that the transcript of <i>ANK23</i>, one of the 15 <i>ACD6</i>-like genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), is induced by SA and by infection with the pathogenic fungus <i>Ustilago maydis</i>. Heterologous expression of <i>ANK23</i> restored disease resistance in the Arabidopsis mutant <i>acd6-2</i>. We show that <i>ANK23</i> is a maize ortholog of <i>ACD6</i> and therefore rename <i>ANK23</i> as <i>ZmACD6</i>. Furthermore, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated <i>ZmACD6</i> knockout maize plants, which are more susceptible to <i>U. maydis</i> than wild-type plants. We also identified a maize line (SC-9) with relatively high <i>ZmACD6</i> expression levels from a diverse natural maize population. SC-9 has increased disease resistance to <i>U. maydis</i> and defense activation, suggesting a practical approach to cultivate elite varieties with enhanced disease resistance.
