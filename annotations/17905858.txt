Polyamines are known to increase in plant cells in response to a variety of stress conditions. However, the physiological roles of elevated polyamines are not understood well. Here we investigated the effects of polyamines on ion channel activities by applying patch-clamp techniques to protoplasts derived from barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedling root cells. Extracellular application of polyamines significantly blocked the inward Na(+) and K(+) currents (especially Na(+) currents) in root epidermal and cortical cells. These blocking effects of polyamines were increased with increasing polycation charge. In root xylem parenchyma, the inward K(+) currents were blocked by extracellular spermidine, while the outward K(+) currents were enhanced. At the whole-plant level, the root K(+) content, as well as the root and shoot Na(+) levels, was decreased significantly by exogenous spermidine. Together, by restricting Na(+) influx into roots and by preventing K(+) loss from shoots, polyamines were shown to improve K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis in barley seedlings. It is reasonable to propose that, therefore, elevated polyamines under salt stress should be a self-protecting response for plants to combat detrimental consequences resulted from imbalance of Na(+) and K(+).
