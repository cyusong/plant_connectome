['28922765', 'The transcription factor FUSCA3 (FUS3) acts as a major regulator of seed  maturation in Arabidopsis. FUS3 is phosphorylated by the SnRK1 catalytic subunit  AKIN10/SnRK1alpha1, which belongs to a conserved eukaryotic kinase complex involved  in energy homeostasis. Here we show that AKIN10 and FUS3 share overlapping  expression patterns during embryogenesis, and that FUS3 is phosphorylated by  AKIN10 in embryo cell extracts. To understand the role of FUS3 phosphorylation,  we generated fus3-3 plants carrying FUS3 phosphorylation-null (FUS3S>A) and  phosphorylation-mimic (FUS3S>D) variants. While FUS3S>A and FUS3S>D rescued all  the fus3-3 seed maturation defects, FUS3S>A showed reduced transcriptional  activity and enhanced fus3-3 previously uncharacterized phenotypes. FUS3S>A  embryos displayed increased seed abortion due to maternal FUS3S>A and delayed  embryo development, which correlated with a strong decrease in seed yield (~50%).  Accordingly, the akin10 and akin11 mutants displayed a frequency of seed abortion  similar to fus3-3. When plants were grown at elevated temperature, most  phenotypes were exaggerated in FUS3S>A plants, and progeny seedlings overall grew  poorly, suggesting that phosphorylation of FUS3 plays an important role during  early embryogenesis and under heat stress. Collectively, these results suggest  that FUS3 phosphorylation and SnRK1 are required for embryogenesis and  integration of environmental cues to ensure the survival of the progeny.', '2017 Jul 10', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erx233', 'Gazzarrini']
