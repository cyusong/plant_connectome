Drought is one of the abiotic stresses which affects the growth and development of plants, including cotton. The role of stomatal anion channel SLAC1 has been well established in regulating stomatal closure in response to drought stress in several plant species. However, the gene encoding for the main S-type anion channel SLAC1 in cotton has not been identified hence its role in drought stress response remains uncharacterized. In this study, we identified Gh_A08G1582 as the gene encoding for GhSLAC1 in cotton. The gene exhibited abundant expression in leaves and was localized in cell membrane. Furthermore, the expression of GhSLAC1 in Arabidopsis slac1-3 mutants rescued the defective stomatal movement phenotypes of the mutants, pointing to its role in stomata regulation. GhSLAC1 channel was activated by AtOST1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and showed greater permeability for nitrate than chloride. Further data demonstrated that transgenic cotton lines with silenced GhSLAC1 exhibited obvious leaf wilting phenotype and strong stomatal closure insensitivity under drought stress. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GhSLAC1 is an essential element for stomatal closure in response to drought in cotton.
