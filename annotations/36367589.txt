Since the discovery of somatic embryogenesis (SE), it has been evident that nitrogen (N) metabolism is essential during morphogenesis and cell differentiation. Usually, N is supplied to cultures in vitro in three forms, ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), and amino N from amino acids (AAs). Although most plants prefer NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is the primary form route to be assimilated. The balance of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> determines if the morphological differentiation process will produce embryos. That the N reduction of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is needed for both embryo initiation and maturation is well-established in several models, such as carrot, tobacco, and rose. It is clear that N is indispensable for SE, but the mechanism that triggers the signal for embryo formation remains unknown. Here, we discuss recent studies that suggest an optimal endogenous concentration of auxin and cytokinin is closely related to N supply to plant tissue. From a molecular and biochemical perspective, we explain N's role in embryo formation, hypothesizing possible mechanisms that allow cellular differentiation by changing the nitrogen source.
