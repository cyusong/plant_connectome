['15075400', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) gene encodes an F-box  protein to assemble SCF(COI1) complexes essential for response to jasmonates  (JAs), which are a family of plant signaling molecules required for many  essential functions, including plant defense and reproduction. To better  understand the molecular basis of JA action, we screened for suppressors of coi1  and isolated a coi1 suppressor1 (cos1) mutant. The cos1 mutation restores the  coi1-related phenotypes, including defects in JA sensitivity, senescence, and  plant defense responses. The COS1 gene was cloned through a map-based approach  and found to encode lumazine synthase, a key component in the riboflavin pathway  that is essential for diverse yet critical cellular processes. We demonstrated a  novel function for the riboflavin pathway that acts downstream of COI1 in the JA  signaling pathway and is required for suppression of the COI1-mediated root  growth, senescence, and plant defense.', '2004 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.020370', 'Xie']
