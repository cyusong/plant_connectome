['25268707', 'Proper leaf development is essential for plant growth and development, and leaf  morphogenesis is under the control of intricate networks of genetic and  environmental cues. We are interested in dissecting these regulatory circuits  genetically and report here the isolation of two Arabidopsis dominant mutants,  abnormal shoot5-1D (abs5-1D) and abs7-1D identified through activation tagging  screens. Both abs5-1D and abs7-1D display an intriguing upwardly curly leaf  phenotype. Molecular cloning showed that the elevated expression of a bHLH  transcription factor ABS5/T5L1/bHLH30 or a MYB transcription factor ABS7/MYB101  is the cause for the abnormal leaf phenotypes found in abs5-1D or abs7-1D,  respectively. Protoplast transient expression assays confirmed that both  ABS5/T5L1 and ABS7/MYB101 are targeted to the nucleus. Interestingly, the  expression domains of auxin response reporter DR5::GUS were abnormal in leaves of  abs5-1D and ABS5/T5L1 over-expression lines. Moreover, cotyledon venation  analysis showed that more areoles and free-ending veins are formed in abs5-1D. We  found that the epidermis-specific expressions of ABS5/T5L1 or ABS7/MYB101 driven  by the Arabidopsis Meristem Layer 1 promoter (PAtML1) were sufficient to  recapitulate the curly leaf phenotype of abs5-1D or abs7-1D. In addition,  PAtML1::ABS5 lines exhibited similar changes in DR5::GUS expression patterns as  those found in 35S-driven ABS5/T5L1 over-expression lines. Our work demonstrated  that enhanced expressions of two transcription factors, ABS5/T5L1 and  ABS7/MYB101, are able to alter leaf lamina development and reinforce the notion  that leaf epidermis plays critical roles in regulating plant organ morphogenesis.', '2014', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0107637', 'Yu']
