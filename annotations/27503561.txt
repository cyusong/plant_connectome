['27503561', 'ARID-HMG DNA-binding proteins represent a novel group of HMG-box containing  protein family where the AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is fused with the  HMG-box domain in a single polypeptide chain. ARID-HMG proteins are highly plant  specific with homologs found both in flowering plants as well as in moss such as  Physcomitrella. The expression of these proteins is ubiquitous in plant tissues  and primarily localises in the cell nucleus. HMGB proteins are involved in  several nuclear processes, but the role of ARID-HMG proteins in plants remains  poorly explored. Here, we performed DNA-protein interaction studies with  Arabidopsis ARID-HMG protein HMGB11 (At1g55650) to understand the functionality  of this protein and its individual domains. DNA binding assays revealed that  AtHMGB11 can bind double-stranded DNA with a weaker affinity (Kd = 475 +/- 17.9 nM)  compared to Arabidopsis HMGB1 protein (Kd = 39.8 +/- 2.68 nM). AtHMGB11 also  prefers AT-rich DNA as a substrate and shows structural bias for supercoiled DNA.  Molecular docking of the DNA-AtHMGB11 complex indicated that the protein  interacts with the DNA major groove, mainly through its ARID domain and the  junction region connecting the ARID and the HMG-box domain. Also, predicted by  the docking model, mutation of Lys(85) from the ARID domain and Arg(199) &  Lys(202) from the junction region affects the DNA binding affinity of AtHMGB11.  In addition, AtHMGB11 and its truncated form containing the HMG-box domain can  not only promote DNA mini-circle formation but are also capable of inducing  negative supercoils into relaxed plasmid DNA suggesting the involvement of this  protein in several nuclear events. Overall, the study signifies that both the  ARID and the HMG-box domain contribute to the optimal functioning of ARID-HMG  protein in vivo.', '2016 Oct', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-016-0519-y', 'Chaudhuri']
