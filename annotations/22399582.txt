Flowering time of rice depends strongly on photoperiodic responses. We previously identified a quantitative trait locus, Heading date 17 (Hd17), that is associated with a difference in flowering time between Japanese rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Here, we show that the difference may result from a single nucleotide polymorphism within a putative gene that encodes a homolog of the Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 protein, which plays important roles in maintaining circadian rhythms. Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway.
