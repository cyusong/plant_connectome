Unreplicated field trials and genomic prediction are both used to enhance the efficiency in early selection stages of a hybrid maize breeding program. No results are available on the optimal experimental design when combining both approaches. Our objectives were to investigate the effect of the training set design on the accuracy of genomic prediction in unreplicated maize test crosses. We carried out a cross validation study on basis of an experimental data set consisting of 1436 hybrids evaluated for yield and moisture for which genotyping information of 461 SNP markers were available. Training set designs of different size, implementing within environment prediction, within year prediction, across year prediction, and combinations of data sources across years and environments were compared with respect to their prediction accuracy. Across year prediction did not reach prediction accuracies that are useful for genomic selection. Within year prediction across environments provided useful correlations between observed and predicted breeding values. The prediction accuracies did not improve when adding to the training set data from previous years. We conclude that using all data available from unreplicated tests of the current breeding cycle provides a good accuracy of predicting test crosses, whereas adding data from previous breeding cycles, in which the genotypes are less related to the tested material, has only limited value for increasing the prediction accuracy.
