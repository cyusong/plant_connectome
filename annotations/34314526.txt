DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark. In plants, de novo DNA methylation occurs mainly through the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Researchers have previously inferred that a flowering regulator, MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 4 (MSI4)/FVE, is involved in non-CG methylation at several RdDM targets, suggesting a role of FVE in RdDM. However, whether and how FVE affects RdDM genome-wide is not known. Here, we report that FVE is required for DNA methylation at thousands of RdDM target regions. In addition, dysfunction of FVE significantly reduces 24-nucleotide siRNA accumulation that is dependent on factors downstream in the RdDM pathway. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq), we show that FVE directly binds to FVE-dependent 24-nucleotide siRNA cluster regions. Our results also indicate that FVE may function in RdDM by physically interacting with RDM15, a downstream factor in the RdDM pathway. Our study has therefore revealed that FVE, by associating with RDM15, directly regulates DNA methylation and siRNA accumulation at a subset of RdDM targets.
