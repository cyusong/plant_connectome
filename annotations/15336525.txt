['15336525', 'CDC25 enzymes are dual-specificity phosphatases involved in the regulation of the  cell cycle. No CDC25 enzymes have been described in higher plant organisms. We  report here the characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana CDC25 enzyme,  constituted by a sole catalytic domain and devoid of the N-terminal regulatory  region found in the human CDC25. We describe the recombinant expression in  Escherichia coli of the Arath;CDC25 and its purification for activity assay and  structure determination by NMR. The recombinant enzyme has a tyrosine phosphatase  activity towards an artificial substrate, a NMR characterization equally  concludes to its correct folding. The secondary structure of the protein was  predicted on the basis of the assigned chemical shift of (1)H, (15)N, and (13)C  backbone atoms of the protein. The presence of a metal ion in the C-terminus of  this new protein points to a zinc finger, and sequence homology indicates that  this new structural element might be conserved in related plant homologs.', '2004 Sep 24', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.182', 'Lippens']
