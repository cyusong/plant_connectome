Chinese jujube (<i>Ziziphus jujuba</i>) is a vital economic tree native to China. Jujube fruit with abundant L-Ascorbic Acid (AsA) is an ideal material for studying the mechanism of AsA biosynthesis and metabolism. However, the key transcription factors regulating AsA anabolism in jujube have not been reported. Here, we used jujube variety "Mazao" as the experimental material, conducted an integrative analysis of transcriptome and metabolome to investigate changes in differential genes and metabolites, and find the key genes regulating AsA during jujube fruit growth. The results showed that AsA was mostly synthesized in the young stage and enlargement stage, <i>ZjMDHAR</i> gene takes an important part in the AsA recycling. Three gene networks/modules were highly correlated with AsA, among them, three genes were identified as candidates controlling AsA, including <i>ZjERF17</i> (LOC107404975), <i>ZjbZIP9</i> (LOC107406320), and <i>ZjGBF4</i> (LOC107421670). These results provide new directions and insights for further study on the regulation mechanism of AsA in jujube.

ZjMDHAR: !synthesizes! AsA
ZjERF17: !regulates! AsA
ZjbZIP9: !regulates! AsA
ZjGBF4: !regulates! AsA
AsA: !enlarges! in young stage
