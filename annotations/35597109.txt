Pectin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses are major components of primary cell walls in plants. In addition to cell adhesion and expansion, pectin plays a central role in seed mucilage. Seed mucilage contains abundant pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) and lower amounts of homogalacturonan (HG), cellulose, and hemicelluloses. Previously, accumulated evidence has addressed the role of pectin RG-I in mucilage production and adherence. However, less is known about the function of pectin HG in seed coat mucilage formation. In this study, we analyzed a novel mutant, designated things fall apart2 (tfa2), which contains a mutation in HG methyltransferase QUASIMODO2 (QUA2). Etiolated tfa2 seedlings display short hypocotyls and adhesion defects similar to qua2 and tumorous shoot development2 (tsd2) alleles, and show seed mucilage defects. The diminished uronic acid content and methylesterification degree of HG in mutant seed mucilage indicate the role of HG in the formation of seed mucilage. Cellulosic rays in mutant mucilage are collapsed. The epidermal cells of seed coat in tfa2 and tsd2 display deformed columellae and reduced radial wall thickness. Under polyethylene glycol treatment, seeds from these three mutant alleles exhibit reduced germination rates. Together, these data emphasize the requirement of pectic HG biosynthesis for the synthesis of seed mucilage, and the functions of different pectin domains together with cellulose in regulating its formation, expansion, and release.
