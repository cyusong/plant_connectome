Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are prevalent signal transduction proteins in eukaryotes, and play multiple and important roles by responding to a variety of stimuli. Numerous papers provided evidence for extensive use of these modules in plants, and some recently emerging data might seem difficult to reconcile with previously reported studies. Here, we illustrate the difficulties and current challenges of studying plant MAPKs by discussing published studies on pathways comprising MEKK1, MKK1 and MPK4.

MKK1: !activates! MPK4
MAPKs: !respond to! stimuli
MAPKs: !play multiple roles in! eukaryotes
