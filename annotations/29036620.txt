In the facultative long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), encoding the mobile hormone florigen, plays an essential role in modulating the optimal timing of flowering to ensure reproductive success. Under inductive long-day conditions, the transcription of FT is activated by the CONSTANS (CO)/NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) protein complex in leaf phloem companion cells. FT is transported to the shoot apical meristem through interaction with florigen transporters, such as SODIUM POTASSIUM ROOT DEFECTIVE 1 (NaKR1). Some regulators involved in photoperiod-dependent FT function have been reported previously; however, the molecular mechanism that coordinates FT protein synthesis and transport efficiently needs to be investigated. The present study examined the role of an Myb-related transcription factor, FE, in the activation of FT gene transcription and FT protein transport. Expression analysis using FE-inducible systems and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that FE directly bound to the FT and NaKR1 promoters and activated the transcription of downstream target genes. FE failed to activate FT expression without CO function, whereas FE-mediated NaKR1 induction was not affected by CO function. Taken together, our data indicate that FE regulates the transcription of FT and florigen transporter genes via different mechanisms.
