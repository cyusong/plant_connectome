Seminal roots play an important role in acquisition of water and nutrients by maize seedlings. Compared with its teosinte ancestor, maize underwent a change in seminal root number (SRN). Although several key genes controlling SRN have been cloned, identification and utilization of new genes from teosinte would be useful for improving maize root architecture. In this study, a maize-teosinte BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> population containing 206 individuals genotyped by resequencing was used to conduct high-resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of SRN. A new major QTL on chromosome 7 (<i>qSRN7</i>) was identified. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on RNA-Seq were identified between two inbred lines with no SRN and multiple SRN at two periods of seminal roots primordia formation. A total of 116 DEGs detected in at least one period were identified within the <i>qSRN7</i> interval. Three DEGs (Zm00001d021572, Zm00001d021579 and Zm00001d021861) associated with SRN were identified through regional association mapping. When compared with reported domestication-related selective sweeps, Zm00001d021572 was selected during maize domestication. Our findings provide important insights into the genetic basis of SRN and identify a promising candidate gene for further studies on SRN.
