The basic mechanisms of leaf development have been revealed through a combination of genetics and intense analyses in select model species. The genetic basis for diversity in leaf morphology seen in nature is also being unraveled through recent advances in techniques and technologies related to genomics and transcriptomics, which have had a major impact on these comparative studies. However, this has led to the emergence of new unresolved questions about the mechanisms that generate the diversity of leaf form. Here, we provide a review of the current knowledge of the fundamental molecular genetic mechanisms underlying leaf development with an emphasis on natural variation and conserved gene regulatory networks involved in leaf development. Beyond that, we discuss open questions/enigmas in the area of leaf development, how recent technologies can best be deployed to generate a unified understanding of leaf diversity and its evolution, and what untapped fields lie ahead.
