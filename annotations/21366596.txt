• The sequencing of the Physcomitrella patens genome, combined with the high frequency of gene targeting in this species, makes it ideal for reverse genetic studies. For forward genetic studies, experimental crosses and genetic analysis of progeny are essential. • Since P. patens is monoicous, producing both male and female gametes on the same gametophore, and undergoing self-fertilization at a high frequency, the identification of crossed sporophytes is difficult. Usually spores from many sporophytes from a mixed culture must be tested for the production of recombinant progeny. • Here, we describe the use of transgenic lines that express a fluorescent transgene constitutively, to provide a direct visual screen for hybrid sporophytes. • We show that segregations in crosses obtained with this technique are as expected, and demonstrate its utility for the study of the rate of outcrossing between three isolates of P. patens.
