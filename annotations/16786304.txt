['16786304', 'Ubiquitylation is an important biochemical reaction found in all eukaryotic  organisms and is involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Conventional  ubiquitylation requires the formation of polyubiquitin chains linked through  Lys48 of the ubiquitin, which targets specific proteins for degradation. Recently  polyubiquitylation through a noncanonical Lys63 chain has been reported, and is  required for error-free DNA damage tolerance (or postreplication repair) in  yeast. To date, Ubc13 is the only known ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc)  capable of catalyzing the Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation reaction and this  function requires interaction with the Ubc variant Mms2. No information is  available on either Lys63-linked ubiquitylation or error-free damage tolerance in  plants. We thus cloned and functionally characterized two Arabidopsis thaliana  UBC13 genes, AtUBC13A and AtUBC13B. The two genes are highly conserved with  respect to chromosomal structure and protein sequence, suggesting that they are  derived from a recent gene duplication event. Both AtUbc13 proteins are able to  physically interact with yeast or human Mms2, implying that plants also employ  the Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation reaction. Furthermore, AtUBC13 genes are able  to functionally complement the yeast ubc13 null mutant for spontaneous  mutagenesis and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, suggesting the existence of  an error-free DNA damage tolerance pathway in plants. The AtUBC13 genes appear to  express ubiquitously and are not induced by various conditions tested.', '2006 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-006-0007-x', 'Xiao']
