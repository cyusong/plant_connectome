['31659127', "Plants optimize their growth and survival through highly integrated regulatory  networks that coordinate defensive measures and developmental transitions in  response to environmental cues. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key signaling  component that controls stress reactions and growth at different stages of plant  development, and the PP2A regulatory subunit PP2A-B'gamma is required for negative  regulation of pathogenesis responses and for maintenance of cell homeostasis in  short-day conditions. Here, we report molecular mechanisms by which PP2A-B'gamma  regulates Botrytis cinerea resistance and leaf senescence in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). We extend the molecular functionality of PP2A-B'gamma to a  protein kinase-phosphatase interaction with the defense-associated  calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK1 and present indications this interaction  may function to control CPK1 activity. In presenescent leaf tissues, PP2A-B'gamma is  also required to negatively control the expression of salicylic acid-related  defense genes, which have recently proven vital in plant resistance to  necrotrophic fungal pathogens. In addition, we find the premature leaf yellowing  of pp2a-b'gamma depends on salicylic acid biosynthesis via SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION  DEFICIENT2 and bears the hallmarks of developmental leaf senescence. We propose  PP2A-B'gamma age-dependently controls salicylic acid-related signaling in plant  immunity and developmental leaf senescence.", '2020 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00893', 'ORCID:']
