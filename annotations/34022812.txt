Casein kinase I (CKI) is a kind of serine/threonine protein kinase highly conserved in plants and animals. Although molecular function of individual member of CKI family has been investigated in Arabidopsis, little is known about their evolution and functions in Gossypium. In this study, five cotton species were applied to study CKI gene family in cotton, twenty-two species were applied to trace the origin and divergence of CKI genes. Four important insights were gained: (i) the cotton CKI genes were classified into two types based on their structural characteristics; (ii) two types of CKI genes expanded with tetraploid event in cotton; (iii) two types of CKI genes likely diverged about 1.5 billion years ago when red and green algae diverged; (iv) two types of cotton CKI genes which highly expressed in leaves showed stronger response to photoperiod (circadian clock) and light signal, and most two types of CKI genes highly expressed in anther showed identical heat inducible expression during anther development in tetraploid cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). This study provides genome-wide insights into the evolutionary history of cotton CKI genes and lays a foundation for further investigation of the functional differentiation of two types of CKI genes in specific developmental processes and environmental stress conditions.
