Proliferating cells actively coordinate growth and cell division to ensure cell-size homeostasis; however, the underlying mechanism through which size is controlled is poorly understood. Defect in a SUMO protease protein, suppressor of <i>mat3</i> 7 (SMT7), has been shown to reduce cell division number and increase cell size of the small-size mutant <i>mating type locus 3-4</i> (<i>mat3-4</i>), which contains a defective retinoblastoma tumor suppressor-related protein of Chlamydomonas (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>). Here we describe development of an in vitro SUMOylation system using Chlamydomonas components and use it to provide evidence that SMT7 is a <i>bona fide</i> SUMO protease. We further demonstrate that the SUMO protease activity is required for supernumerous mitotic divisions of the <i>mat3-4</i> cells. In addition, we identified RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L30 (RPL30) as a prime SMT7 target and demonstrated that its SUMOylation is an important modulator of cell division in <i>mat3-4</i> cells. Loss of SMT7 caused elevated SUMOylated RPL30 levels. Importantly, overexpression of the translational fusion version of RPL30-SUMO4, which mimics elevation of the SUMOylated RPL30 protein in <i>mat3-4</i>, caused a decrease in mitotic division and recapitulated the size-increasing phenotype of the <i>smt7-1 mat3-4</i> cells. In summary, our study reveals a novel mechanism through which a SUMO protease regulates cell division in the <i>mat3-4</i> mutant of Chlamydomonas and provides yet another important example of the role that protein SUMOylation can play in regulating key cellular processes, including cell division.
