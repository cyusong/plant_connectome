The analysis of the irradiance responses of photosynthetic processes, such as the quantum efficiencies of electron transport by photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII) or the rate of carbon dioxide fixation, is limited by the lack of mechanistically based analytical model for these processes. Starting with a model of P700 redox state, we develop a series of analytical functions which can be used to fit the irradiance responses of the quantum yields for electron transport by PSI and PSII, the irradiance responses of electron transport by PSI and PSII, and even the irradiance response of the fixation rate of carbon dioxide. These functions depend on two or three parameters so they can be fit to typical irradiance response data. We illustrate by example the use of these functions in various applications and discuss further use and development of the basic model described in detail here.
