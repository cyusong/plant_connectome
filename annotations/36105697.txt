Camelina [<i>Camelina sativa</i> (L.) Crantz] is currently gaining considerable attention as a potential oilseed feedstock for biofuel, oil and feed source, and bioproducts. Studies have shown the potential of using camelina in an intercropping system. However, there are no camelina genotypes evaluated or bred for shade tolerance. The objective of this study was to evaluate and determine the shade tolerance of sixteen spring camelina genotypes (growth stage: BBCH 103; the plants with 4-5 leaves) for intercropping systems. In this study, we simulated three different shade levels, including low (LST), medium (MST), and high shade treatments (HST; 15, 25, and 50% reduction of natural light intensity, respectively), and evaluated the photosynthetic and physiological parameters, seed production, and seed quality. The mean chlorophyll pigments, including the total chlorophyll and chlorophyll <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> across the 16 genotypes increased as shade level increased, while the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>, chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>, leaf area, the number of silicles and branches plant<sup>-1</sup> decreased as shade level increased. The first day of anthesis and days of flowering duration of camelina treated with shade were significantly delayed and shortened, respectively, as shade increased. The shortened lifecycle and altered flowering phenology decreased camelina seed yield. Additionally, the shade under MST and HST reduced the seed oil content and unsaturated fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids. The dendrograms constructed using the comprehensive tolerance membership values revealed that CamK9, CamC4, and 'SO-40' were the relatively shade-tolerant genotypes among the 16 camelina genotypes. These camelina genotypes can grow under the shade level up to a 25% reduction in natural light intensity producing a similar seed yield and seed oil quality, indicating the potential to intercrop with maize or other small grain crops. The present study provided the baseline information on the response of camelina genotypes to different shade levels, which would help in selecting or breeding shade-tolerant genotypes.
