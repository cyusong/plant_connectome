BRUTUS (BTS) is a hemerythrin (HHE) domain containing E3 ligase that facilitates the degradation of POPEYE-like (PYEL) proteins in a proteasomal-dependent manner. Deletion of BTS HHE domains enhances BTS stability in the presence of iron and also complements loss of BTS function, suggesting that the HHE domains are critical for protein stability but not for enzymatic function. The RING E3 domain plays an essential role in BTS' capacity to both interact with PYEL proteins and to act as an E3 ligase. Here we show that removal of the RING domain does not complement loss of BTS function. We conclude that enzymatic activity of BTS via the RING domain is essential for response to iron deficiency in plants. Further, we analyze possible BTS domain structure evolution and predict that the combination of domains found in BTS is specific to photosynthetic organisms, potentially indicative of a role for BTS and its orthologs in mitigating the iron-related challenges presented by photosynthesis.
