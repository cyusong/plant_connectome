['11402167', 'The SOS3 (for SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE3) calcium binding protein and SOS2 protein  kinase are required for sodium and potassium ion homeostasis and salt tolerance  in Arabidopsis. We have shown previously that SOS3 interacts with and activates  the SOS2 protein kinase. We report here the identification of a SOS3 binding  motif in SOS2 that also serves as the kinase autoinhibitory domain. Yeast  two-hybrid assays as well as in vitro binding assays revealed a 21-amino acid  motif in the regulatory domain of SOS2 that is necessary and sufficient for  interaction with SOS3. Database searches revealed a large family of SOS2-like  protein kinases containing such a SOS3 binding motif. Using a yeast two-hybrid  system, we show that these SOS2-like kinases interact with members of the SOS3  family of calcium binding proteins. Two-hybrid assays also revealed interaction  between the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain within  SOS2, suggesting that the regulatory domain may inhibit kinase activity by  blocking substrate access to the catalytic site. Removal of the regulatory domain  of SOS2, including the SOS3 binding motif, resulted in constitutive activation of  the protein kinase, indicating that the SOS3 binding motif can serve as a kinase  autoinhibitory domain. Constitutively active SOS2 that is SOS3 independent also  was produced by changing Thr(168) to Asp in the activation loop of the SOS2  kinase domain. Combining the Thr(168)-to-Asp mutation with the autoinhibitory  domain deletion created a superactive SOS2 kinase. These results provide insights  into regulation of the kinase activities of SOS2 and the SOS2 family of protein  kinases.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.6.1383', 'Zhu']
