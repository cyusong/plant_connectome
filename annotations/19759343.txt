['19759343', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that regulates plant growth as well as  stress responses. In this study, we identified and characterized a new  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein, Nuclear Protein X1 (NPX1), which was  up-regulated by stress and treatment with exogenous ABA. Stomatal closure, seed  germination, and primary root growth are well-known ABA responses that were less  sensitive to ABA in NPX1-overexpressing plants. NPX1-overexpressing plants were  more drought sensitive, and the changes in response to drought were due to the  altered guard cell sensitivity to ABA in transgenic plants and not to a lack of  ABA production. The nuclear localization of NPX1 correlated with changes in the  expression of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and ABA signal transduction. To  understand the function of NPX1, we searched for interacting proteins and found  that an ABA-inducible NAC transcription factor, TIP, interacted with NPX1. Based  on the whole plant phenotypes, we hypothesized that NPX1 acts as a  transcriptional repressor, and this was demonstrated in yeast, where we showed  that TIP was repressed by NPX1. Our results indicate that the previously unknown  protein NPX1 acts as a negative regulator in plant response to changes in  environmental conditions through the control of ABA-regulated gene expression.  The characterization of this factor enhances our understanding of guard cell  function and the mechanisms that plants use to modulate water loss from leaves  under drought conditions.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.144766', 'Schachtman']
