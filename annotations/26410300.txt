['26410300', 'The biogenesis of photosynthetic membranes in the plastids of higher plants  requires an extensive supply of lipid precursors from the endoplasmic reticulum  (ER). Four TRIGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL (TGD) proteins (TGD1,2,3,4) have thus far  been implicated in this lipid transfer process. While TGD1, TGD2, and TGD3  constitute an ATP binding cassette transporter complex residing in the plastid  inner envelope, TGD4 is a transmembrane lipid transfer protein present in the  outer envelope. These observations raise questions regarding how lipids transit  across the aqueous intermembrane space. Here, we describe the isolation and  characterization of a novel Arabidopsis thaliana gene, TGD5. Disruption of TGD5  results in similar phenotypic effects as previously described in tgd1,2,3,4  mutants, including deficiency of ER-derived thylakoid lipids, accumulation of  oligogalactolipids, and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis indicates that TGD4 is  epistatic to TGD5 in ER-to-plastid lipid trafficking, whereas double mutants of a  null tgd5 allele with tgd1-1 or tgd2-1 show a synergistic embryo-lethal  phenotype. TGD5 encodes a small glycine-rich protein that is localized in the  envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Coimmunoprecipitation assays show that TGD5  physically interacts with TGD1, TGD2, TGD3, and TGD4. Collectively, these results  suggest that TGD5 facilitates lipid transfer from the outer to the inner plastid  envelope by bridging TGD4 with the TGD1,2,3 transporter complex.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00394', 'ORCID:']
