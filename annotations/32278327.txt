Receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) play key roles in regulating plant growth, development and stress adaptations. There are at least 610 RLKs (including receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases) in Arabidopsis. The functions of the majority of RLKs have not yet been determined. We previously generated promoter::GUS transgenic plants for all leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RLKs in Arabidopsis and analyzed their expression patterns during various developmental stages. We found the expression of two LRR-RLKs, MUSTACHES (MUS) and MUSTACHES-LIKE (MUL), are overlapped in lateral root primordia. Independent mutants, mus-3 mul-1 and mus-4 mul-2, show a significantly decreased emerged lateral root phenotype. Our analyses indicate that the defects of the double mutant occur mainly at stage I of lateral root development. Exogenous application of auxin can dramatically enhance the transcription of MUS, which is largely dependent on AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19. MUS and MUL are inactive kinases in vitro but are phosphorylated in planta, possibly by an unknown kinase. The kinase activity of MUS is dispensable for its function in lateral root development. Many cell wall related genes are down regulated in mus-3 mul-1. In conclusion, we identified MUS and MUL, two kinase-inactive RLKs, in controlling the early development of lateral root primordia likely via regulating cell wall synthesis and remodeling.
