Comparative morphological, transcriptomic and phytohormone analyses reveal a defence network leading to PCD involved in cabbage hybrid lethality. Hybrid lethality (HL) plays an essential role in the stability of a population by blocking gene exchange between species, but the molecular mechanism remains largely undetermined. In this study, we performed phenotype, transcriptome and plant hormone analyses of HL in cabbage. Phenotype analysis confirmed that HL is characterised by a typical programmed cell death (PCD) process. A time-resolved RNA-Seq identified 2724 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and functional annotations analyses revealed that HL was closely associated with the defence response. A defence regulation network was constructed based on the plant-pathogen interaction pathway and MAPK signalling pathway, which comprised DEGs related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) leading to PCD. Moreover, important DEGs involved in hormone signal transduction pathways including salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) were identified, which were further confirmed by endogenous and exogenous SA and JA measurements. Our results identified key genes and pathways in the regulating network of HL in cabbage, and might open the gate for revealing the molecular mechanism of HL in plants.
