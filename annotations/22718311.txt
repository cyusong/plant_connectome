In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the cytosolic Glutathione Peroxidase 5 gene (GPX5) is known to be transcriptionally up-regulated in response to singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)). As demonstrated by previous studies, fusion of the promoter region of GPX5 to the Arylsulfatase 2 gene (ARS2) creates an effective reporter system that can be used to monitor (1)O(2)-driven GPX5 expression. This system was also used in this study to generate a stably transformed C. reinhardtii strain which expresses ARS2 in a (1)O(2)-dependent manner, resulting in the synthesis of a functional protein with detectable activity. Using the strain of C. reinhardtii harboring a (1)O(2)-sensitive reporter construct, a secondary mutagenic screen was performed. This allowed identification of mutant cell lines that were unable to up-regulate expression of the GPX5-ARS2 fusion in response to (1)O(2). In one of these lines, the mutation was subsequently localized to the first exon of the PSBP-like gene (PSBP2). The PSBP2 gene is part of a small protein family in C. reinhardtii, also present in all angiosperms studied thus far. While each member of the PSBP protein family contains a similar domain to the PSBP1 protein, which is a member of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII), the PSBP2 protein does not appear to be involved in PSII function, but may function as a sensor and/or signal mediating molecule of the (1)O(2) generated in the chloroplast.
