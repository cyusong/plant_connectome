<i>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE 13</i> (<i>SAG13</i>) of <i>Arabidopsis</i> is a widely conserved gene of unknown function that has been extensively used as a marker of plant senescence. <i>SAG13</i> induction occurs during plant cell death processes, including senescence and hypersensitive response, a type of programmed cell death that occurs in response to pathogens. This implies that <i>SAG13</i> expression is regulated through at least two different signaling pathways affecting these two different processes. Our work highlights a contrasting role for SAG13 in regulating resistance against disease-causing biotrophic bacterial and necrotrophic fungal pathogens with contrasting infection strategies. We provide further evidence that <i>SAG13</i> is not only induced during oxidative stress but also plays a role in protecting the plant against other stresses. SAG13 is also required for normal seed germination, seedling growth, and anthocyanin accumulation. The work presented here provides evidence for the role of SAG13 in regulating multiple plant processes including senescence, defense, seed germination, and abiotic stress responses. <i>SAG13</i> is a valuable molecular marker for these processes and is conserved in multiple plant species, and this knowledge has important implications for crop improvement.
