Auxin receptor F-box proteins of the TIR1/AFB family are known to regulate auxin-induced gene expression. We could demonstrate that rapid auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation, the most classical auxin response, is only mildly affected in Arabidopsis plants in which most of the receptor genes have been knocked out, while gene expression is almost completely abolished. Here we test the same receptor mutant plants for their gravitropic and phototropic responsiveness, generally considered to base on auxin gradients across the hypocotyl.

Auxin receptor F-box proteins: !regulate! auxin-induced gene expression
Rapid auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation: !mildly affected! in Arabidopsis plants 
Gene expression: !almost completely abolished! in same receptor mutant plants
Gravitropic and phototropic responsiveness: !generally considered to base on! auxin gradients
