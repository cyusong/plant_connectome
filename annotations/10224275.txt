['10224275', 'Leaf trichomes in Arabidopsis are unicellular epidermal hairs with a branched  morphology. They undergo successive endoreduplication rounds early during cell  morphogenesis. Mutations affecting trichome nuclear DNA content, such as  triptychon or glabra3, alter trichome branching. We isolated new mutants with  supernumerary trichome branches, which fall into three unlinked complementation  groups: KAKTUS and the novel loci, POLYCHOME and RASTAFARI. They map to  chromosomes IV, II, and V, respectively. The trichomes of these mutants presented  an increased DNA content, although to a variable extent. The spindly-5 mutant,  which displays a constitutive gibberellin response, also produces overbranched  trichomes containing more nuclear DNA. We analyzed genetic interactions using  double mutants and propose that two independent pathways, defined by SPINDLY and  TRIPTYCHON, act to limit trichome growth. KAKTUS and POLYCHOME might have  redundant actions mediating gibberellin control via SPINDLY. The overall leaf  polysomaty was not notably affected by these mutations, suggesting that they  affect the control of DNA synthesis in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner.  Wild-type tetraploids also produce overbranched trichomes; they displayed a  shifted polysomaty in trichomes and in the whole leaf, suggesting a developmental  program controlling DNA increases via the counting of endoreduplication rounds.', '1999 May', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/152.1.461', 'Bonneville']
