The leaf spot disease of Mentha arvensis, caused by Alternaria alternata, is a devastating foliar disease worldwide and leads to considerable economic losses. In this investigation, 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to identify the membrane proteins potentially involved in M. arvensis - A. alternata interaction. Membrane proteins, isolated from leaves of control and infected plants, were analyzed by 2-DE and identified using mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF-TOF MS/MS). Our analysis identified 21 differentially expressed membrane proteins including several interesting receptors and channel proteins. Of these identified proteins, 34% were found to be involved in plant defense responses. Leucine-rich repeat family protein/ protein kinase family protein which plays critical role in stress response and nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) which is involved in detecting the advent of pathogen on plant surface were identified to be up-regulated in our study. Interestingly, AKT1-like potassium channel protein which is known to play a crucial role in maintaining ion homeostasis within the cell was also upregulated in the infected sample. In addition, ADP ribolysation factor (ARF)-GTPase activating domain containing protein, a membrane trafficking protein, was also up-regulated in the current study. Protein-protein interaction network analysis followed by functional enrichment revealed that transmembrane ion transport-related proteins represented a major class in this network followed by nucleic acid binding proteins and proteins with kinase activities respectively. Together, our investigation identified several key defense-related proteins which are crucial sensors for detecting pathogen invasion and can serve as a potential resource to understand disease resistance mechanism in mint.
