['22207719', 'Glutaredoxins are small heat-stable oxidoreductases that transfer electrons from  glutathione (GSH) to oxidized cysteine residues, thereby contributing to protein  integrity and regulation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, floral glutaredoxins ROXY1 and  ROXY2 and pathogen-induced ROXY19/GRX480 interact with bZIP transcription factors  of the TGACG (TGA) motif-binding family. ROXY1, ROXY2, and TGA factors  PERIANTHIA, TGA9, and TGA10 play essential roles in floral development. In  contrast, ectopically expressed ROXY19/GRX480 negatively regulates expression of  jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET)-induced defense genes through an unknown  mechanism that requires clade II transcription factors TGA2, TGA5, and/or TGA6.  Here, we report that at least 17 of the 21 land plant-specific glutaredoxins  encoded in the Arabidopsis genome interact with TGA2 in a yeast-two-hybrid  system. To investigate their capacity to interfere with the expression of  JA/ET-induced genes, we developed a transient expression system. Activation of  the ORA59 (OCTADECANOID-RESPONSIVE ARABIDOPSIS AP2/ERF-domain protein 59)  promoter by transcription factor EIN3 (ETHYLENE INSENSITVE 3) was suppressed by  co-expressed ROXY19/GRX480. Suppression depended on the L**LL motif in the  C-terminus of ROXY19/GRX480. This putative protein interaction domain was  recently described as being essential for the TGA/ROXY interaction. Ten of the 17  tested ROXY proteins suppressed ORA59 promoter activity, which correlated with  the presence of the C-terminal ALWL motif, which is essential for ROXY1 function  in flower development. ROXY19/GRX480-mediated repression depended on the GSH  binding site, suggesting that redox modification of either TGA factors or as yet  unknown target proteins is important for the suppression of ORA59 promoter  activity.', '2012 Jul', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssr113', 'Gatz']
