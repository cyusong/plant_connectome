The gaseous plant hormone ethylene is produced by a fairly simple two-step biosynthesis route. Despite this pathway's simplicity, recent molecular and genetic studies have revealed that the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis is far more complex and occurs at different layers. Ethylene production is intimately linked with the homeostasis of its general precursor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), which experiences transcriptional and posttranslational control of its synthesising enzymes (SAM synthetase), as well as the metabolic flux through the adjacent Yang cycle. Ethylene biosynthesis continues from SAM by two dedicated enzymes: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic (ACC) synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO). Although the transcriptional dynamics of ACS and ACO have been well documented, the first transcription factors that control ACS and ACO expression have only recently been discovered. Both ACS and ACO display a type-specific posttranslational regulation that controls protein stability and activity. The nonproteinogenic amino acid ACC also shows a tight level of control through conjugation and translocation. Different players in ACC conjugation and transport have been identified over the years, however their molecular regulation and biological significance is unclear, yet relevant, as ACC can also signal independently of ethylene. In this review, we bring together historical reports and the latest findings on the complex regulation of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway in plants.
