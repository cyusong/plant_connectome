['17828375', 'The phytohormone ABA was known to play a vital role in modulating plant responses  to drought stress. Here, we report that a nuclear-localized basic  helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type protein, AtAIB, positively regulates ABA response in  Arabidopsis. The expression of AtAIB was transitorily induced by ABA and PEG,  although its transcripts were accumulated in various organs. We provided evidence  showing that AtAIB has transcriptional activation activity in yeast. Knockdown of  AtAIB expression caused reduced sensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of  this gene led to elevated sensitivity to ABA in cotyledon greening and seedling  root growth. Furthermore, soil-grown plants overexpressing AtAIB showed increased  drought tolerance. Taken together, these results suggested that AtAIB functions  as a transcription activator involved in the regulation of ABA signaling in  Arabidopsis.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-007-9230-3', 'Li']
