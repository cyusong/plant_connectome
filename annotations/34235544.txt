['34235544', 'The inner-envelope K+ EFFLUX ANTIPORTERS (KEA) 1 and 2 are critical for  chloroplast development, ion homeostasis, and photosynthesis. However, the  mechanisms by which changes in ion flux across the envelope affect organelle  biogenesis remained elusive. Chloroplast development requires intricate  coordination between the nuclear genome and the plastome. Many mutants  compromised in plastid gene expression (PGE) display a virescent phenotype, that  is delayed greening. The phenotypic appearance of Arabidopsis thaliana kea1 kea2  double mutants fulfills this criterion, yet a link to PGE has not been explored.  Here, we show that a simultaneous loss of KEA1 and KEA2 results in maturation  defects of the plastid ribosomal RNAs. This may be caused by secondary structure  changes of rRNA transcripts and concomitant reduced binding of RNA-processing  proteins, which we documented in the presence of skewed ion homeostasis in kea1  kea2. Consequently, protein synthesis and steady-state levels of plastome-encoded  proteins remain low in mutants. Disturbance in PGE and other signs of plastid  malfunction activate GENOMES UNCOUPLED 1-dependent retrograde signaling in kea1  kea2, resulting in a dramatic downregulation of GOLDEN2-LIKE transcription  factors to halt expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear-encoded genes  (PhANGs). PhANG suppression delays the development of fully photosynthesizing  kea1 kea2 chloroplasts, probably to avoid progressing photo-oxidative damage.  Overall, our results reveal that KEA1/KEA2 function impacts plastid development  via effects on RNA-metabolism and PGE.', '2021 Aug 13', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab123', 'ORCID:']
