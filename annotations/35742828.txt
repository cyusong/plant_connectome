Climatic variations influence the morphological, physiological, biological, and biochemical states of plants. Plant responses to abiotic stress include biochemical adjustments, regulation of proteins, molecular mechanisms, and alteration of post-translational modifications, as well as signal transduction. Among the various abiotic stresses, flooding stress adversely affects the growth of plants, including various economically important crops. Biochemical and biological techniques, including proteomic techniques, provide a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms during flooding conditions. In particular, plants can cope with flooding conditions by embracing an orchestrated set of morphological adaptations and physiological adjustments that are regulated by an elaborate hormonal signaling network. With the help of these findings, the main objective is to identify plant responses to flooding and utilize that information for the development of flood-tolerant plants. This review provides an insight into the role of phytohormones in plant response mechanisms to flooding stress, as well as different mitigation strategies that can be successfully administered to improve plant growth during stress exposure. Ultimately, this review will expedite marker-assisted genetic enhancement studies in crops for developing high-yield lines or varieties with flood tolerance.
