['24728648', 'Many heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) and heat shock proteins (Hsps) have  been identified to play important roles in the heat tolerance of plants. However,  many of the key factors mediating the heat response pathways remain unknown.  Here, we report that two genes, which are targets of TAS1 (trans-acting siRNA  precursor 1)-derived small interfering RNAs that we named HEAT-INDUCED TAS1  TARGET1 (HTT1) and HTT2, are involved in thermotolerance. Microarray analysis  revealed that the HTT1 and HTT2 genes were highly upregulated in Arabidopsis  thaliana seedlings in response to heat shock. Overexpression of TAS1a, whose  trans-acting small interfering RNAs target the HTT genes, elevated accumulation  of TAS1-siRNAs and reduced expression levels of the HTT genes, causing weaker  thermotolerance. By contrast, overexpression of HTT1 and HTT2 upregulated several  Hsf genes, leading to stronger thermotolerance. In heat-tolerant plants  overexpressing HsfA1a, the HTT genes were upregulated, especially at high  temperatures. Meanwhile, HsfA1a directly activated HTT1 and HTT2 through binding  to their promoters. HTT1 interacted with the heat shock proteins Hsp70-14 and  Hsp40 and NUCLEAR FACTOR Y, SUBUNIT C2. Taken together, these results suggest  that HTT1 mediates thermotolerance pathways because it is targeted by TAS1a,  mainly activated by HsfA1a, and acts as cofactor of Hsp70-14 complexes.', '2014 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.124883', 'He']
