['17704216', 'The proper number and distribution of stomata are essential for the efficient  exchange of gases between the atmosphere and the aerial parts of plants. We show  that the density and development of stomatal complexes on the epidermis of  Arabidopsis thaliana leaves depend, in part, on the microRNA-mediated regulation  of Agamous-like16 (AGL16), which is a member of the MADS box protein family.  AGL16 mRNA is targeted for sequence-specific degradation by miR824, a recently  evolved microRNA conserved in the Brassicaceae and encoded at a single genetic  locus. Primary stomatal complexes can give rise to higher-order complexes derived  from satellite meristemoids. Expression of a miR824-resistant AGL16 mRNA, but not  the wild-type AGL16 mRNA, in transgenic plants increased the incidence of stomata  in higher-order complexes. By contrast, reduced expression of AGL16 mRNA in the  agl16-1 deficiency mutant and in transgenic lines overexpressing miR824 decreased  the incidence of stomata in higher-order complexes. These findings and the  nonoverlapping patterns of AGL16 mRNA and miR824 localization led us to propose  that the miR824/AGL16 pathway functions in the satellite meristemoid lineage of  stomatal development.', '2007 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.050377', 'Si-Ammour']
