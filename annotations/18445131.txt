['18445131', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana NAC domain transcription factor, vascular-related  NAC-DOMAIN7 (VND7), plays a pivotal role in regulating the differentiation of  root protoxylem vessels. In order to understand the mechanisms underscoring the  function of VND7 in vessel differentiation in more detail, we conducted extensive  molecular analyses in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Arabidopsis, and  Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright Yellow 2 (tobacco BY-2) cells. The  transcriptional activation activity of VND7 was confirmed in yeast and  Arabidopsis, and the C-terminal region was shown to be required for VND7  transcriptional activation. Expression of the C-terminus-truncated VND7 protein  under the control of the native VND7 promoter resulted in inhibition of the  normal development of metaxylem vessels in roots and vessels in aerial organs, as  well as protoxylem vessels in roots. The expression pattern of VND7 overlapped  that of VND2 to VND5 in most of the differentiating vessels. Furthermore, a yeast  two-hybrid assay revealed the ability of VND7 to form homodimers and heterodimers  with other VND proteins via their N-termini, which include the NAC domain. The  heterologous expression of VND7 in tobacco BY-2 cells demonstrated that the  stability of VND7 could be regulated by proteasome-mediated degradation. Together  these data suggest that VND7 regulates the differentiation of all types of  vessels in roots and shoots, possibly in cooperation with VND2 to VND5 and other  regulatory proteins.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03533.x', 'Demura']
