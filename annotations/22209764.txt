['22209764', 'The regulation of hypocotyl elongation is important for plant growth.  Microtubules play a crucial role during hypocotyl cell elongation. However, the  molecular mechanism underlying this process is not well understood. In this  study, we describe a novel Arabidopsis thaliana microtubule-destabilizing protein  25 (MDP25) as a negative regulator of hypocotyl cell elongation. We found that  MDP25 directly bound to and destabilized microtubules to enhance microtubule  depolymerization in vitro. The seedlings of mdp25 mutant Arabidopsis lines had  longer etiolated hypocotyls. In addition, MDP25 overexpression resulted in  significant overall shortening of hypocotyl cells, which exhibited destabilized  cortical microtubules and abnormal cortical microtubule orientation, suggesting  that MDP25 plays a crucial role in the negative regulation of hypocotyl cell  elongation. Although MDP25 localized to the plasma membrane under normal  conditions, increased calcium levels in cells caused MDP25 to partially  dissociate from the plasma membrane and move into the cytosol. Cellular MDP25  bound to and destabilized cortical microtubules, resulting in their  reorientation, and subsequently inhibited hypocotyl cell elongation. Our results  suggest that MDP25 exerts its function on cortical microtubules by responding to  cytoplasmic calcium levels to mediate hypocotyl cell elongation.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.092684', 'Mao']
