The improvement of cold adaptation has contributed to the increased growing area of rice. Standing variation and de novo mutation are distinct natural sources of beneficial alleles in plant adaptation. However, the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary patterns underlying these sources in a single population during crop domestication remain elusive. Here we cloned the CTB2 gene, encoding a UDP-glucose sterol glucosyltransferase, for cold tolerance in rice at the booting stage. A single standing variation (I408V) in the conserved UDPGT domain of CTB2 originated from Chinese Oryza rufipogon and contributed to the cold adaptation of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica. CTB2 is located in a 56.8 kb region, including the previously reported gene CTB4a in which de novo mutation arose c. 3200 yr BP in Yunnan province, China, conferring cold tolerance. Standing variation of CTB2 and de novo mutation of CTB4a underwent stepwise selection to facilitate cold adaptation to expand rice cultivation from high-altitude to high-latitude regions. These results provide an example of stepwise selection on two kinds of variation and describe a new molecular mechanism of cold adaptation in japonica rice.
