['10455113', 'A pathogen-inducible oxygenase in tobacco leaves and a homologous enzyme from  Arabidopsis were recently characterized (Sanz, A., Moreno, J. I., and Castresana,  C. (1998) Plant Cell 10, 1523-1537). Linolenic acid incubated at 23 degrees C  with preparations containing the recombinant enzymes underwent alpha-oxidation  with the formation of a chain-shortened aldehyde, i.e., 8(Z),11(Z),  14(Z)-heptadecatrienal (83%), an alpha-hydroxy acid,  2(R)-hydroxy-9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (15%), and a chain-shortened  fatty acid, 8(Z),11(Z),14(Z)-heptadecatrienoic acid (2%). When incubations were  performed at 0 degrees C, 2(R)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid  was obtained as the main product. An intermediary role of 2(R)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),  12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid in alpha-oxidation was demonstrated by  re-incubation experiments, in which the hydroperoxide was converted into the same  alpha-oxidation products as those formed from linolenic acid.  2(R)-Hydroperoxy-9(Z),12(Z), 15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid was chemically unstable  and had a half-life time in buffer of about 30 min at 23 degrees C. Extracts of  cells expressing the recombinant oxygenases accelerated breakdown of the  hydroperoxide (half-life time, about 3 min at 23 degrees C), however, this was  not attributable to the recombinant enzymes since the same rate of hydroperoxide  degradation was observed in the presence of control cells not expressing the  enzymes. No significant discrimination between enantiomers was observed in the  degradation of 2(R,S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid in the presence of  recombinant oxygenases. A previously studied system for alpha-oxidation in  cucumber was re-examined using the newly developed techniques and was found to  catalyze the same conversions as those observed with the recombinant enzymes,  i.e. enzymatic alpha-dioxygenation of fatty acids into 2(R)-hydroperoxides and a  first order, non-stereoselective degradation of hydroperoxides into  alpha-oxidation products. It was concluded that the recombinant enzymes from  tobacco and Arabidopsis were both alpha-dioxygenases, and that members of this  new class of enzymes catalyze the first step of alpha-oxidation in plant tissue.', '1999 Aug 27', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.274.35.24503', 'Castresana']
