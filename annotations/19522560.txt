Although Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary has been studied extensively, there are still aspects of this important phytopathogen's ability to cause disease in susceptible plants that remain unclear. A recent comprehensive proteome-level investigation of this fungus identified a number of proteins whose functions in disease initiation and progression have not been clearly established. Included among these proteins was an arabinofuranosidase/beta-xylosidase precursor whose role as a potential virulence factor had not been investigated previously. This article describes the generation of gene-disrupted mutant S. sclerotiorum unable to produce this arabinofuranosidase/beta-xylosidase precursor as well as the comparison of the virulence of this mutant with that of wild-type mycelia on susceptible canola leaves and stems. At all time points tested, the degree of necrosis was observed to be significantly greater on the plant tissue inoculated with wild-type mycelia. To our knowledge, this is the first report that clearly demonstrates that this arabinofuranosidase/beta-xylosidase precursor is a virulence factor for S. sclerotiorum.
