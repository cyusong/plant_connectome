<i>Panax notoginseng</i> is an important medicinal plant in China, but there are some limitations in the ecological suitability study, such as incomplete investigation of species distribution, single regionalization modeling, and lack of collaborative evaluation of ecological suitability, and quality suitability. In this study, the maximum entropy model was used to analyze the ecological suitability of <i>P. notoginseng</i> under current and future climates. The multi-source chemical information of samples was collected to evaluate the uniformity between quality and ecology. The results showed that the current suitable habitat was mainly in southwest China. In the future climate scenarios, the high suitable habitat will be severely degraded. Modeling based on different regionalization could predict larger suitable habitat areas. The samples in the high suitable habitat had both quality suitability and ecological suitability, and the accumulation of chemical components had different responses to different environmental factors. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy combined with deep learning could achieve rapid identification of samples from different suitable habitats. In conclusion, global warming is not conducive to the distribution and spread of <i>P. notoginseng</i>. The high suitable habitat was conducive to the cultivation of high-quality medicinal materials. Actual regionalization modeling had more guiding significance for the selection of suitable habitats in a small area. The multi-regionalization modeling theory proposed in this study could provide a new perspective for the ecological suitability study of similar medicinal plants. The results provided a reference for the introduction and cultivation, and lay the foundation for the scientific and standardized production of high-quality <i>P. notoginseng</i>.
