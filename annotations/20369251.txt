"Brittle culm" mutants found in Gramineae crops are suitable materials to study the mechanism of secondary cell wall formation. Through positional cloning, we have identified a gene responsible for the brittle culm phenotype in rice, brittle culm 3 (bc3). BC3 encodes a member of the classical dynamin protein family, a family known to function widely in membrane dynamics. The bc3 mutation resulted in reductions of 28-36% in cellulose contents in culms, leaves, and roots, while other cell wall components remained unaffected. Reductions of cell wall thickness and birefringence were observed in both fiber (sclerenchyma) and parenchymal cells, together with blurring of the wall's layered structures. From promoter-GUS analyses, it was suggested that BC3 expression is directly correlated with active secondary cell wall synthesis. These results suggest that BC3 is tightly involved in the synthesis of cellulose and is essential for proper secondary cell wall construction.
