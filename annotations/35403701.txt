Polycomb dictates developmental programs in higher eukaryotes, including flowering plants. A phytohormone, abscisic acid (ABA), plays a pivotal role in seed and seedling development and mediates responses to multiple environmental stresses, such as salinity and drought. In this study, we show that ABA affects the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated Histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) through VIN3-LIKE1/VERNALIZATION 5 (VIL1/VRN5) to fine-tune the timely repression of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) in Arabidopsis thaliana. vil1 mutants exhibit hypersensitivity to ABA during early seed germination and show enhanced drought tolerance. Our study revealed that the ABA signaling pathway utilizes a facultative component of the chromatin remodeling complex to demarcate the level of expression of ABA-responsive genes.
