Gene activity is controlled at different levels of chromatin organization, which involve genomic sequences, nucleosome structure, chromatin folding and chromosome arrangement. These levels are interconnected and influence each other. At the basic level nucleosomes generally occlude the DNA sequence from interacting with DNA-binding proteins. Evidently, nucleosome positioning is a major factor in gene control and chromatin organization. Understanding the biological rules that govern the deposition and removal of the nucleosomes to and from the chromatin fiber is the key to understanding gene regulation and chromatin organization. In this review we describe and discuss the relationship between the different levels of chromatin organization in plants and animals.

Nucleosomes: !occlude! DNA sequence
DNA-binding proteins: !interact with! DNA sequence
Nucleosomes: !position! Chromatin
Chromatin organization: !influences! Gene control
Nucleosomes: !deposit and remove! Chromatin fiber
