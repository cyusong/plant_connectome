Glycerolipid biosynthesis in plants proceeds through two major pathways compartmentalized in the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The involvement of glycerolipid pathway interactions in modulating membrane desaturation under temperature stress has been suggested but not fully explored. We profiled glycerolipid changes as well as transcript dynamics under suboptimal temperature conditions in three plant species that are distinctively different in the mode of lipid pathway interactions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a 16:3 plant, the chloroplast pathway is upregulated in response to low temperature, whereas high temperature promotes the eukaryotic pathway. Operating under a similar mechanistic framework, Atriplex lentiformis at high temperature drastically increases the contribution of the eukaryotic pathway and correspondingly suppresses the prokaryotic pathway, resulting in the switch of lipid profile from 16:3 to 18:3. In wheat (Triticum aestivum), an 18:3 plant, low temperature also influences the channeling of glycerolipids from the ER to chloroplast. Evidence of differential trafficking of diacylglycerol moieties from the ER to chloroplast was uncovered in three plant species as another layer of metabolic adaptation under temperature stress. We propose a model that highlights the predominance and prevalence of lipid pathway interactions in temperature-induced lipid compositional changes.
