Doubled haploid (DH) technology is used to obtain homozygous lines in a single generation, a technique that significantly accelerates the crop breeding trajectory. Traditionally, in vitro culture is used to generate DHs, but this technique is limited by species and genotype recalcitrance. In vivo haploid induction (HI) through seed is widely and efficiently used in maize and was recently extended to several other crops. Here we show that in vivo HI can be triggered by mutation of DMP maternal haploid inducer genes in allopolyploid (allotetraploid) Brassica napus and Nicotiana tabacum. We developed a pipeline for selection of DMP orthologs for clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats mutagenesis and demonstrated average amphihaploid induction rates of 2.4% and 1.2% in multiple B. napus and N. tabacum genotypes, respectively. These results further confirmed the HI ability of DMP gene in polyploid dicot crops. The DMP-HI system offers a novel DH technology to facilitate breeding in these crops. The success of this approach and the conservation of DMP genes in dicots suggest the broad applicability of this technique in other dicot crops.
