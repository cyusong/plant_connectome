Considering the crude methods used to control phytoplasma diseases, a deeper knowledge on the defence mechanisms recruited by the plant to face phytoplasma invasion is required. Recently, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis mutants lacking AtSEOR1 gene showed a low phytoplasma titre. In wild type plants AtSEOR1 and AtSEOR2 are tied in filamentous proteins. Knockout of the AtSEOR1 gene may pave the way for an involvement of free AtSEOR2 proteins in defence mechanisms. Among the proteins conferring resistance against pathogenic bacteria, AtRPM1-interacting protein has been found to interact with AtSEOR2 in a high-quality, matrix-based yeast-two hybrid assay. For this reason, we investigated the expression levels of Arabidopsis AtRIN4, and the associated AtRPM1 and AtRPS2 genes in healthy and Chrysanthemum yellows-infected wild-type and Atseor1ko lines.
