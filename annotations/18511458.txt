OsXIP (Oryza sativa xylanase inhibitor protein) is a XIP-type xylanase inhibitor which was identified as a protein encoded by a wound stress-responsive gene in rice. Although the OsXIP gene was specifically expressed in mature grains under basal conditions, recombinant OsXIP had no effect on rice endogenous xylanases, and OsXIP-suppressed transgenic rice plants did not exhibit any change in grain development and germination, suggesting that rice development may be independent of OsXIP. Analysis using an OsXIP-specific antibody revealed that OsXIP is markedly accumulated in apoplast in rice root cells by wounding. These results reinforced the possibility that OsXIP is involved in plant defense mechanisms against phytopathogens.
