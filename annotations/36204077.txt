Chenopodium quinoa is a crop with outstanding tolerance to saline soil, but long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) expression profile driven by salt stress in quinoa has rarely been observed yet. Based on the high-quality quinoa reference genome and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), genome-wide identification of LncRNAs was performed, and their dynamic response under salt stress was then investigated. In total, 153,751 high-confidence LncRNAs were discovered and dispersed intensively in chromosomes. Expression profile analysis demonstrated significant differences between LncRNAs and coding RNAs. Under salt stress conditions, 4,460 differentially expressed LncRNAs were discovered, of which only 54 were differentially expressed at all the stress time points. Besides, strongly significantly correlation was observed between salt-responsive LncRNAs and their closest neighboring genes (<i>r</i> = 0.346, <i>p</i>-value < 2.2e-16). Furthermore, a weighted co-expression network was then constructed to infer the potential biological functions of LncRNAs. Seven modules were significantly correlated with salt treatments, resulting in 210 hub genes, including 22 transcription factors and 70 LncRNAs. These results indicated that LncRNAs might interact with transcription factors to respond to salinity stress. Gene ontology enrichment of the coding genes of these modules showed that they were highly related to regulating metabolic processes, biological regulation and response to stress. This study is the genome-wide analysis of the LncRNAs responding to salt stress in quinoa. The findings will provide a solid framework for further functional research of salt responsive LncRNAs, contributing to quinoa genetic improvement.
