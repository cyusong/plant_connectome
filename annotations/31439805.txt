Identifying genetic variation that increases crop yields is a primary objective in plant breeding. We used association analyses of oilseed rape/canola (<i>Brassica napus</i>) accessions to identify genetic variation that influences seed size, lipid content, and final crop yield. Variation in the promoter region of the HECT E3 ligase gene <i>BnaUPL3</i> <i>C03</i> made a major contribution to variation in seed weight per pod, with accessions exhibiting high seed weight per pod having lower levels of <i>BnaUPL3</i> <i>C03</i> expression. We defined a mechanism in which UPL3 mediated the proteasomal degradation of LEC2, a master transcriptional regulator of seed maturation. Accessions with reduced <i>UPL3</i> expression had increased LEC2 protein levels, larger seeds, and prolonged expression of lipid biosynthetic genes during seed maturation. Natural variation in <i>BnaUPL3</i> <i>C03</i> expression appears not to have been exploited in current <i>B</i> <i>napus</i> breeding lines and could therefore be used as a new approach to maximize future yields in this important oil crop.
