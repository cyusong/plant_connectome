Sweetpotato is an emerging food crop that ensures food and nutrition security in the face of climate change. Alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) is one of the key factors affecting plant stress tolerance and is also an essential nutrient in humans. In plants, fatty acid desaturase 8 (FAD8) synthesizes ALA from linoleic acid (LA). Previously, we identified the cold-induced <i>IbFAD8</i> gene from RNA-seq of sweetpotato tuberous roots stored at low-temperature. In this study, we investigated the effect of IbFAD8 on the low-temperature storage ability and ALA content of the tuberous roots of sweetpotato. Transgenic sweetpotato plants overexpressing <i>IbFAD8</i> (TF plants) exhibited increased cold and drought stress tolerance and enhanced heat stress susceptibility compared with non-transgenic (NT) plants. The ALA content of the tuberous roots of TF plants (0.19 g/100 g DW) was ca. 3.8-fold higher than that of NT plants (0.05 g/100 g DW), resulting in 8-9-fold increase in the ALA/LA ratio in TF plants. Furthermore, tuberous roots of TF plants showed better low-temperature storage ability compared with NT plants. These results indicate that <i>IbFAD8</i> is a valuable candidate gene for increasing the ALA content, environmental stress tolerance, and low-temperature storage ability of sweetpotato tuberous roots <i>via</i> molecular breeding.
