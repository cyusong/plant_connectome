['26371322', 'Stem cells are defined by their ability to self-renew and produce daughter cells  that proliferate and mature. These maturing cells transition from a proliferative  state to a terminal state through the process of differentiation. In the  Arabidopsis thaliana root the transcription factors SCARECROW and SHORTROOT  regulate specification of the bipotent stem cell that gives rise to cortical and  endodermal progenitors. Subsequent progenitor proliferation and differentiation  generate mature endodermis, marked by the Casparian strip, a cell-wall  modification that prevents ion diffusion into and out of the vasculature. We  identified a transcription factor, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 36 (MYB36), that regulates  the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the endodermis. We show  that SCARECROW directly activates MYB36 expression, and that MYB36 likely acts in  a feed-forward loop to regulate essential Casparian strip formation genes. We  show that myb36 mutants have delayed and defective barrier formation as well as  extra divisions in the meristem. Our results demonstrate that MYB36 is a critical  positive regulator of differentiation and negative regulator of cell  proliferation.', '2015 Sep 29', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1515576112', 'Benfey']
