It is beneficial for breeding and boosting the flower value of ornamental plants such as orchids, which can take several years of growth before blooming. Over the past few years, <i>in vitro</i> flowering of <i>Cymbidium nanulum</i> Y. S. Wu et S. C. Chen has been successfully induced; nevertheless, the production of many abnormal flowers has considerably limited the efficiency of this technique. We carried out transcriptomic analysis between normal and abnormal <i>in vitro</i> flowers, each with four organs, to investigate key genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to gain a comprehensive perspective on the formation of abnormal flowers. Thirty-six DEGs significantly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, and photosynthesis-antenna proteins pathways were identified as key genes. Their broad upregulation and several altered transcription factors (TFs), including 11 MADS-box genes, may contribute to the deformity of <i>in vitro</i> flowers. By the use of weighted geneco-expression network analysis (WGCNA), three hub genes, including one unknown gene, mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and harpin-induced gene 1/nonrace-specific disease resistance gene 1 (NDR1/HIN1-Like) were identified that might play important roles in floral organ formation. The data presented in our study may serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying flower and floral organ formation of <i>C. nanulum</i> Y. S. Wu et S. C. Chen <i>in vitro</i>.
