['18971429', "Polyadenylation factor CLP1 is essential for mRNA 3'-end processing in yeast and  mammals. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CLP1-SIMILAR PROTEIN3 (CLPS3) is  an ortholog of human hCLP1. CLPS3 was previously found to be a subunit in the  affinity-purified PCFS4-TAP (tandem affinity purification) complex involved in  the alternative polyadenylation of FCA and flowering time control in Arabidopsis.  In this article, we further explored the components in the affinity-purified  CLPS3-TAP complex, from which Arabidopsis cleavage and polyadenylation  specificity factor (CPSF) subunits AtCPSF100 and AtCPSF160 were found. This  result implies that CLPS3 may bridge CPSF to the PCFS4 complex. Characterization  of the CLPS3 mutant revealed that CLPS3 was essential for embryo development and  important for female gametophyte transmission. Overexpression of CLPS3-TAP fusion  caused a range of postembryonic development abnormalities, including early  flowering time, altered phyllotaxy, and abnormal numbers and shapes of flower  organs. These phenotypes are associated with the altered gene expression levels  of FCA, WUS, and CUC1. The decreased ratio of FCA-beta to FCA-gamma in the  overexpression plants suggests that CLPS3 favored the usage of FCA regular  poly(A) site over the alternative site. These observations indicate that  Arabidopsis CLPS3 might be involved in the processing of pre-mRNAs encoded by a  distinct subset of genes that are important in plant development.", '2008 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.129817', 'Li']
