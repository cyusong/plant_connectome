We demonstrated the new target for lodging resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by the analysis of physiological function of a locus for lodging resistance in a typhoon (lrt5) with the near isogenic line under rice "Koshihikari" genetic background (tentatively named S1). The higher lodging resistance of S1 was observed during a typhoon in September 2004 (28 days after heading), when most other plants in "Koshihikari" became lodged. Visual observations showed that bending of the upper stems triggered lodging during the typhoon; the upper stem of "Koshihikari" buckled completely, whereas that of S1 remained straight. In addition to the strong rain and winds during the typhoon, the weight of the buckled upper plant parts increased the pressure on adjacent plants and caused a domino effect in "Koshihikari". Young's modulus, an indicator of the rigidity of the culm, was significantly higher in S1 than in "Koshihikari". In the upper culm, the starch content in S1 was 4.8 times the value in "Koshihikari", and senescence was delayed in the upper leaves of S1. These results suggest that the rigidity of the upper culm by the higher starch content (as a result of delayed senescence in the upper leaves) may be responsible for the higher lodging resistance during a typhoon in rice.
