The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) modification plays an important role in the regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, but the function of the SUMO protease, in ABA signaling, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the SUMO protease, ASP1 positively regulates ABA signaling. Mutations in ASP1 resulted in an ABA-insensitive phenotype, during early seedling development. Wild-type ASP1 successfully rescued, whereas an ASP1 mutant (C577S), defective in SUMO protease activity, failed to rescue, the ABA-insensitive phenotype of asp1-1. Expression of ABI5 and MYB30 target genes was attenuated in asp1-1 and our genetic analyses revealed that ASP1 may function upstream of ABI5 and MYB30. Interestingly, ASP1 accumulated upon ABA treatment, and ABA-induced accumulation of ABI5 (a positive regulator of ABA signaling) was abolished, whereas ABA-induced accumulation of MYB30 (a negative regulator of ABA signaling) was increased in asp1-1. These findings support the hypothesis that increased levels of ASP1, upon ABA treatment, tilt the balance between ABI5 and MYB30 towards ABI5-mediated ABA signaling.
