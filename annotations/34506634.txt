The ability to predict future risks is essential for many organisms, including plants. Plants can gather information about potential future herbivory by detecting volatiles that are emitted by herbivore-attacked neighbors. Several individual volatiles have been identified as active danger cues. Recent work has also shown that plants may integrate multiple volatiles into their defense responses. Here, I discuss how the integration of multiple volatiles can increase the capacity of plants to predict future herbivore attack. I propose that integration of multiple volatile cues does not occur at the perception stage, but may through downstream early defense signaling and then be further consolidated by hormonal crosstalk. Exploring plant volatile cue integration can facilitate our understanding and utilization of chemical information transfer.
