The mobilization of nitrogen (N) compounds and the roles played by glumes and the flag leaf during grain filling were studied in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Florida) grown under field conditions. Glumes lost twice as much of their total N content as that lost by the flag leaf between the milk and early dough stages. In the flag leaf, glumes and grains, Glu, Asp, Ser and Ala accounted for 85% of all the reductions in the free amino acid pool. Principal component analysis of free amino acid pools separated grains from the glumes and the flag leaf, suggesting grain specific regulations in the use of free amino acids in protein synthesis. In all three organs, no decrease in Gln was detected, probably due to steady glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2) activities per soluble protein in both the flag leaf and glumes. Compared with the flag leaf, glumes presented relatively smaller amounts of the chloroplast GS associated isoform. This we show is due to a lower relative number of mesophyll cells in glumes as supported by the different anatomy and the cellular pattern of the GS immunolocalization. We argue that cellular distribution plays a key role in supporting metabolism to enable the various functions undertaken by glume tissue.
