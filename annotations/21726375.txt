['21726375', 'The enhanced disease resistance 1 (edr1) mutant of Arabidopsis confers enhanced  resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens. To better understand how  edr1-mediated resistance occurs, we performed transcriptome analyses on wild-type  and edr1 plants inoculated with the fungal pathogen Golovinomyces cichoracearum  (powdery mildew). The expression of many known and putative defence-associated  genes was more rapidly induced, and to higher levels, in edr1 plants relative to  the wild-type. Many of the genes with elevated expression encoded WRKY  transcription factors and there was enrichment for their binding sites in  promoters of the genes upregulated in edr1. Confocal microscopy of transiently  expressed EDR1 protein showed that a significant fraction of EDR1 was localized  to the nucleus, suggesting that EDR1 could potentially interact with  transcription factors in the nucleus. Analysis of gene ontology annotations  revealed that genes associated with the endomembrane system, defence, reactive  oxygen species (ROS) production and protein kinases were induced early in the  edr1 mutant, and that elevated expression of the endomembrane system, defence and  ROS-related genes was maintained for at least 4 days after infection.', '2011 Oct', 'Mol Plant Pathol', '10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00708.x', 'Innes']
