['28344081', 'In plant cells, changes in fluidity of the plasma membrane may serve as the  primary sensor of cold stress; however, the precise mechanism and how the  cell transduces and fine-tunes cold signals remain elusive. Here we show that the  cold-activated plasma membrane protein cold-responsive protein kinase 1 (CRPK1)  phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins. The phosphorylated 14-3-3 proteins shuttle from  the cytosol to the nucleus, where they interact with and destabilize the key  cold-responsive C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) proteins. Consistent with this, the  crpk1 and 14-3-3kappalambda mutants show enhanced freezing tolerance, and transgenic  plants overexpressing 14-3-3lambda show reduced freezing tolerance. Further study  shows that CRPK1 is essential for the nuclear translocation of 14-3-3 proteins  and for 14-3-3 function in freezing tolerance. Thus, our study reveals that the  CRPK1-14-3-3 module transduces the cold signal from the plasma membrane to the  nucleus to modulate CBF stability, which ensures a faithfully adjusted response  to cold stress of plants.', '2017 Apr 6', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.016', 'Yang']
