The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a piercing-sucking herbivore that reduces the yields of crops both by feeding on plants and transmitting plant viruses. Like most plant feeders, B. tabaci has evolved ways to avoid plant defence responses. For example, B. tabaci is known to secrete salivary effectors to suppress host defences. However, the nature of B. tabaci effectors is not completely understood. In this study, we used B. tabaci genomic and salivary gland transcriptomic data and an overexpression system to identify a previously unknown B. tabaci salivary effector, BtE3. BtE3 is specifically expressed in the head (containing primary salivary glands) and is secreted into hosts during B. tabaci feeding. In planta overexpression of BtE3 blocked Burkholderia glumae-induced hypersensitive response (HR) in both Nicotiana benthamiana and Solanum lycopersicum. Silencing of BtE3 by plant-mediated RNAi prevented B. tabaci from continuously ingesting phloem sap, and reduced B. tabaci survival and fecundity. Moreover, overexpression of BtE3 in planta up-regulated the salicylic acid- (SA-) signalling pathway, but suppressed the downstream jasmonic acid- (JA-) mediated defences. Taken together, these results indicate that BtE3 is a B. tabaci-specific novel effector involved in B. tabaci-plant interactions. These findings increase our understanding of B. tabaci effectors and suggest novel strategies for B. tabaci pest management.
