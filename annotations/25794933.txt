['25794933', 'Iron (Fe) is an indispensable micronutrient for plant growth and development. The  regulation of Fe homeostasis in plants is complex and involves a number of  transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)  transcription factor, bHLH104, belonging to the IVc subgroup of bHLH family, acts  as a key component positively regulating Fe deficiency responses. Knockout of  bHLH104 in Arabidopsis thaliana greatly reduced tolerance to Fe deficiency,  whereas overexpression of bHLH104 had the opposite effect and led to accumulation  of excess Fe in soil-grown conditions. The activation of Fe deficiency-inducible  genes was substantially suppressed by loss of bHLH104. Further investigation  showed that bHLH104 interacted with another IVc subgroup bHLH protein,  IAA-LEUCINE RESISTANT3 (ILR3), which also plays an important role in Fe  homeostasis. Moreover, bHLH104 and ILR3 could bind directly to the promoters of  Ib subgroup bHLH genes and POPEYE (PYE) functioning in the regulation of Fe  deficiency responses. Interestingly, genetic analysis showed that loss of bHLH104  could decrease the tolerance to Fe deficiency conferred by the lesion of BRUTUS,  which encodes an E3 ligase and interacts with bHLH104. Collectively, our data  support that bHLH104 and ILR3 play pivotal roles in the regulation of Fe  deficiency responses via targeting Ib subgroup bHLH genes and PYE expression.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.132704', 'ORCID:']
