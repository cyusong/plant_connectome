Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide thiol compound has multiple functions in plants. Recent works suggested that GSH plays a regulatory role in signaling in plants as part of their adaptation to stress. To better understand the role of GSH as a regulatory molecule, 14 days old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were treated with 5mM of GSH for 4h. Changes in gene expression patterns were studied by cDNA microarray analysis. The expression of 453 genes was significantly changed compared to the untreated control, of which 261 genes were up-regulated and 192 genes were down-regulated. Genes from several groups were affected, including those of sulfur metabolism, degradation and synthesis of macromolecules and transcription factors. Up-regulation of genes involved in responses to biotic stresses, or in jasmonate or salicylic acid synthesis and their signaling, suggests that GSH triggers genes that help protect the plants during stresses. In addition, GSH down regulated genes involved in plant growth and development, like those involved in cell wall synthesis and its extension, and genes associated with auxin and cytokinins response, which are related to growth and development of the plants. The results suggest that GSH might have a role in response to biotic stress by initiating defense responses and modifying plants' growth and development in an effort to tune their sessile lifestyle of plants to environmental constraints.
