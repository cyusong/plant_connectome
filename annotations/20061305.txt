['20061305', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and  nitric oxide (NO), elevation of the cytosolic free calcium ion concentration  ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) and cytosolic pH (pH(cyt)), and activation of S-type anion  channels in guard cells, causing stomatal closure. To investigate whether  Arabidopsis Two pore channel 1 (AtTPC1) that encodes the slow vacuolar (SV)  channel is involved in stomatal closure, we examined stomatal movements and  mobilization of second messengers in the attpc1-2 loss-of-function mutant in  response to ABA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and Ca(2+). Both ABA and MeJA elicited  production of ROS and NO, [Ca(2+)](cyt) oscillations, cytosolic alkalization and  activation of S-type anion channel currents to lead to stomatal closure in the  attpc1-2 mutant as well as the wild type. Unlike the wild type, in the attpc1-2  mutant exogenous Ca(2+) neither induced stomatal closure nor activated plasma  membrane S-type anion channel currents despite [Ca(2+)](cyt) elevation. These  results indicate that AtTPC1 functions in response to external Ca(2+) but not to  ABA and MeJA in Arabidopsis guard cells and suggest that AtTPC1 could be involved  in priming of plasma membrane S-type anion channels by external Ca(2+) in  Arabidopsis guard cells.', '2010 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcq001', 'Murata']
