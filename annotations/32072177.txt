Plant responses to abiotic stresses during vegetative growth have been extensively studied for many years. Daily environmental fluctuations can have dramatic effects on plant vegetative growth at multiple levels, resulting in molecular, cellular, physiological, and morphological changes. Plants are even more sensitive to environmental changes during reproductive stages. However, much less is known about how plants respond to abiotic stresses during reproduction. Fortunately, recent advances in this field have begun to provide clues about these important processes, which promise further understanding and a potential contribution to maximize crop yield under adverse environments. Here we summarize information from several plants, focusing on the possible mechanisms that plants use to cope with different types of abiotic stresses during reproductive development, and present a tentative molecular portrait of plant acclimation during reproductive stages. Additionally, we discuss strategies that plants use to balance between survival and productivity, with some comparison among different plants that have adapted to distinct environments.
