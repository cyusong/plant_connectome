Heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches that relay intracellular signaling in eukaryotes. Recent studies in plant immunity provide a link between heterotrimeric G proteins and an MAPK cascade via the RACK1 scaffolding proteins. Research also points to a potential regulation of G proteins by cell surface receptors.
