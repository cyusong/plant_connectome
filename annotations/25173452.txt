Wheat is one of the most important cereal food crops in the world today. The productivity and quality of this crop is greatly affected by environmental conditions during grain filling. In this study, we have analyzed two genotypes of durum wheat, Blanqueta and Sula (traditional and a modern wheat respectively) in pre-industrial, current and future [CO2]. Plant growth and physiological parameters were analyzed during anthesis and grain filling in order to study the capacity of these plants to create new sinks and their role during the process of the acclimation of photosynthesis. It was observed that plants underwent photosynthetic acclimation at pre-industrial and future [CO2] (up and down-regulation respectively). However, the modern genotype averts the process of down-regulation by creating a new carbon sink (i.e. the spike). Here, we have shown the essential role that the spike plays as a new sink in order to avert the down-regulation of photosynthesis at future [CO2]. Moreover, we have demonstrated that at future [CO2] the growth response will depend on the ability of plants to develop new sinks or expand existing ones.
