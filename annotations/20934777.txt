Cytosolic NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (cyMDH) is an enzyme crucial for malate synthesis in the cytosol. The apple MdcyMDH gene (GenBank Accession No. DQ221207) encoding the cyMDH enzyme in apple was cloned and functionally characterized. The protein was subcellularly localized to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Based on kinetic parameters, it mainly catalyzes the reaction from oxalacetic acid (OAA) to malate in vitro. The expression level of MdcyMDH was positively correlated with malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity throughout fruit development, but not with malate content, especially in the ripening apple fruit. MdcyMDH overexpression contributed to malate accumulation in the apple callus and tomato. Taken together, our results support the involvement of MdcyMDH directly in malate synthesis and indirectly in malate accumulation through the regulation of genes/enzymes associated with malate degradation and transportation, gluconeogenesis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
