['23321419', 'In recent years, peptide hormones have been recognized as important signal  molecules in plants. Genetic characterization of such peptides is challenging  since they are usually encoded by small genes. As a proof of concept, we used the  well-characterized stem cell-restricting CLAVATA3 (CLV3) to develop an  antagonistic peptide technology by transformations of wild-type Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) with constructs carrying the full-length CLV3 with every  residue in the peptide-coding region replaced, one at a time, by alanine.  Analyses of transgenic plants allowed us to identify one line exhibiting a  dominant-negative clv3-like phenotype, with enlarged shoot apical meristems and  increased numbers of floral organs. We then performed second dimensional amino  acid substitutions to replace the glycine residue individually with the other 18  possible proteinaceous amino acids. Examination of transgenic plants showed that  a glycine-to-threonine substitution gave the strongest antagonistic effect in the  wild type, in which over 70% of transgenic lines showed the clv3-like phenotype.  Among these substitutions, a negative correlation was observed between the  antagonistic effects in the wild type and the complementation efficiencies in  clv3. We also demonstrated that such an antagonistic peptide technology is  applicable to other CLV3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) genes, CLE8 and CLE22,  as well as in vitro treatments. We believe this technology provides a powerful  tool for functional dissection of widely occurring CLE genes in plants.', '2013 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.211029', 'Liu']
