However, the influence of transport processes within leaves has recently been gaining prominence. Stable isotope techniques are at the forefront of understanding transport within leaves and the recent development of online, real-time optical isotope analysers has paved the way for new questions to be asked. In this insight, I outline these new techniques and the questions they can potentially address, including assessing possible coordination between mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> and leaf hydraulic conductance.
