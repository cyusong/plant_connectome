"Huangjinya" is a light-sensitive albino variety and is widely cultivated in China. It has been proved that red light could promote the vegetable growth of plants. However, the mechanism of "Huangjinya" in response to a red light is unclear. This study used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the transcriptome of tender shoots of "Huangjinya" under the white and red light supplement conditions. At the same time, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze metabolite changes under different light conditions. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a total of 174 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after the red light supplement. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) classification indicated that amino acid metabolism enriched the most DEGs. In addition, two phenylpropanoid metabolism-related genes and five glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase genes (<i>CsGSTs</i>) were found to be expressed differently. Metabolome analysis revealed that 193 differential metabolites were obtained. Being the same as transcriptome analysis, most differential metabolites were enriched in amino acids, sweet and umami tasting amino acids were increased, and bitter-tasting amino acids were decreased after the red light supplement. In summary, red light supplementary treatment may be propitious to the quality of "Huangjinya" due to its regulatory effect on amino acid metabolism. Also, <i>CsGSTs</i> involved phenylpropanoid metabolism contributed to tea quality changes in "Huangjinya."
