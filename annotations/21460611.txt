Proper control of stem cell populations is key for the development of all multicellular organisms. In Arabidopsis, stem cells are located primarily in the shoot, root and floral meristems where they undergo complex regulation. The Arabidopsis shoot and root meristems are regulated by the related WUS and WOX5 pathways, respectively. Previous studies established that these pathways share the signal transduction components POLTERGEIST (POL) and PLL1. Our latest study in Plant Cell revealed key roles for acyl modifications and lipid binding in the regulation of these two type 2C protein phosphatases. Specifically, POL and PLL1 were shown to localize to the plasma membrane in a myristioylation- and palmitoylation-dependent manner, POL and PLL1 were shown to bind to membrane lipids, and POL activity was found to be stimulated in vitro by the phospholipid PI(4)P. Here, we will discuss what is currently known in Arabidopsis and other organisms about the mechanisms of palmitoylation and provide additional evidence supporting that POL and PLL1 are palmitoylated, including describing the identification of a putative Arabidopsis palmitoyl transferase as a PLL1 interactor.
