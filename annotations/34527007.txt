MicroRNAs (miRNAs), important posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, play a crucial role in plant growth and development. A single miRNA can regulate numerous target genes, making the determination of its function and interaction with targets challenging. We identified PtomiR403b target to <i>PtoGT31B-1</i>, which encodes a galactosyltransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides. We performed an association study and epistasis and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to explore how the genetic interaction between <i>PtoMIR403b</i> and its target <i>PtoGT31B-1</i> underlies wood formation. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association studies identified 25 significant associations (<i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>Q</i> < 0.05), and <i>PtoMIR403b</i> and <i>PtoGT31B-1</i> were associated with five traits, suggesting a role for PtomiR403b and <i>PtoGT31B-1</i> in wood formation. Epistasis analysis identified 93 significant pairwise epistatic associations with 10 wood formation traits, and 37.89% of the SNP-SNP pairs indicated interactions between <i>PtoMIR403b</i> and <i>PtoGT31B-1</i>. We performed an MR analysis to demonstrate the causality of the relationships between SNPs in <i>PtoMIR403b</i> and wood property traits and that <i>PtoMIR403b</i> modulates wood formation by regulating expression of <i>PtoGT31B-1</i>. Therefore, our findings will facilitate dissection of the functions and interactions with miRNA-targets.
