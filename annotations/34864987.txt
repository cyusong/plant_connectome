Oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (ORPs) are a conserved class of lipid transfer proteins that are closely involved in multiple cellular processes in eukaryotes, but their roles in plant-pathogen interactions are mostly unknown. We show that transient expression of ORPs of Magnaporthe oryzae (MoORPs) in Nicotiana benthamina plants triggered oxidative bursts and cell death; treatment of tobacco Bright Yellow-2 suspension cells with recombinant MoORPs elicited the production of reactive oxygen species. Despite ORPs being normally described as intracellular proteins, we detected MoORPs in fungal culture filtrates and intercellular fluids from barley plants infected with the fungus. More importantly, infiltration of Arabidopsis plants with recombinant Arabidopsis or fungal ORPs activated oxidative bursts, callose deposition, and PR1 gene expression, and enhanced plant disease resistance, implying that ORPs may function as endogenous and exogenous danger signals triggering plant innate immunity. Extracellular application of fungal ORPs exerted an opposite impact on salicylic acid and jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling pathways. Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1-associated Kinase 1 was dispensable for the ORP-activated defense. Besides, simultaneous knockout of MoORP1 and MoORP3 abolished fungal colony radial growth and conidiation, whereas double knockout of MoORP1 and MoORP2 compromised fungal virulence on barley and rice plants. These observations collectively highlight the multifaceted role of MoORPs in the modulation of plant innate immunity and promotion of fungal development and virulence in M. oryzae.
