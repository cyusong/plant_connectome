Plant xylem colonization is the hallmark of vascular wilt diseases caused by phytopathogens within the <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> species complex. Recently, xylem colonization has also been reported among endophytic <i>F. oxysporum</i> strains, resulting in some uncertainty. This study compares xylem colonization processes by pathogenic versus endophytic strains in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, using <i>Arabidopsis</i> pathogen Fo5176, tomato pathogen Fol4287, and the endophyte Fo47, which can colonize both plant hosts. We observed that all strains were able to advance from epidermis to endodermis within 3 days postinoculation (dpi) and reached the root xylem at 4 dpi. However, this shared progression was restricted to lateral roots and the elongation zone of the primary root. Only pathogens reached the xylem above the primary-root maturation zone (PMZ). Related to the distinct colonization patterns, we also observed stronger induction of callose at the PMZ and lignin deposition at primary-lateral root junctions by the endophyte in both plants. This observation was further supported by stronger induction of <i>Arabidopsis</i> genes involved in callose and lignin biosynthesis during the endophytic colonization (Fo47) compared with the pathogenic interaction (Fo5176). Moreover, both pathogens encode more plant cell wall-degrading enzymes than the endophyte Fo47. Therefore, observed differences in callose and lignin deposition could be the combination of host production and the subsequent fungal degradation. In summary, this study demonstrates spatial differences between endophytic and pathogenic colonization, strongly suggesting that further investigations of molecular arm-races are needed to understand how plants differentiate friend from foe.
