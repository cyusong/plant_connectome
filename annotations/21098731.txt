['21098731', 'Actin cables in pollen tubes serve as molecular tracks for cytoplasmic streaming  and organelle movement and are formed by actin bundling factors like villins and  fimbrins. However, the precise mechanisms by which actin cables are generated and  maintained remain largely unknown. Fimbrins comprise a family of five members in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we characterized a fimbrin isoform, Arabidopsis  FIMBRIN5 (FIM5). Our results show that FIM5 is required for the organization of  actin cytoskeleton in pollen grains and pollen tubes, and FIM5 loss-of-function  associates with a delay of pollen germination and inhibition of pollen tube  growth. FIM5 decorates actin filaments throughout pollen grains and tubes. Actin  filaments become redistributed in fim5 pollen grains and disorganized in fim5  pollen tubes. Specifically, actin cables protrude into the extreme tips, and  their longitudinal arrangement is disrupted in the shank of fim5 pollen tubes.  Consequently, the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming were altered in  fim5 pollen tubes. Additionally, loss of FIM5 function rendered pollen  germination and tube growth hypersensitive to the actin-depolymerizing drug  latrunculin B. In vitro biochemical analyses indicated that FIM5 exhibits actin  bundling activity and stabilizes actin filaments. Thus, we propose that FIM5  regulates actin dynamics and organization during pollen germination and tube  growth via stabilizing actin filaments and organizing them into higher-order  structures.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.080283', 'Huang']
