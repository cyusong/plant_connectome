['20518745', 'SHMT (serine hydroxymethyltransferase; EC 2.1.2.1) catalyses reversible  hydroxymethyl group transfer from serine to H4PteGlun (tetrahydrofolate),  yielding glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. In plastids, SHMTs are  thought to catalytically direct the hydroxymethyl moiety of serine into the  metabolic network of H4PteGlun-bound one-carbon units. Genes encoding putative  plastid SHMTs were found in the genomes of various plant species. SHMT activity  was detected in chloroplasts in pea (Pisum sativum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare),  suggesting that plastid SHMTs exist in all flowering plants. The Arabidopsis  thaliana genome encodes one putative plastid SHMT (AtSHMT3). Its cDNA was cloned  by reverse transcription-PCR and the encoded recombinant protein was produced in  Escherichia coli. Evidence that AtSHMT3 is targeted to plastids was found by  confocal microscopy of A. thaliana protoplasts transformed with proteins fused to  enhanced green fluorescent protein. Characterization of recombinant AtSHMT3  revealed that substrate affinity for and the catalytic efficiency of H4PteGlu1-8  increase with n, and that H4PteGlu1-8 inhibit AtSHMT3. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate  and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate with one and five glutamate residues inhibited  AtSHMT3-catalysed hydroxymethyl group transfer from serine to H4PteGlu6, with the  pentaglutamylated inhibitors being more effective. Calculations revealed  inhibition with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate resulting in  little reduction in AtSHMT3 activity under folate concentrations estimated for  plastids.', '2010 Aug 15', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20100566', 'Roje']
