['16856987', 'Activation sequence-1 (as-1) cognate promoter elements are widespread in the  promoters of plant defense-related genes as well as in plant pathogen promoters,  and may play important roles in the activation of defense-related genes. The  as-1-type elements are highly responsive to multiple stress stimuli such as  jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), H(2)O(2), xenobiotics and heavy metals,  and therefore provide a unique opportunity for identifying additional signaling  components and cross-talk points in the various signaling networks. A single  as-1-type cis-element-driven GUS reporter Arabidopsis line responsive to JA, SA,  H(2)O(2), xenobiotics and heavy metals was constructed for mutagenesis. A  large-scale T-DNA mutagenesis has been conducted in the reporter background, and  an efficient high-throughput mutant screen was established for isolating mutants  with altered responses to the stress chemicals. A number of mutants with altered  stress responses were obtained, some of which appear to identify new components  in the as-1-based signal transduction pathways. We characterized a mutant  (Delta8L4) with a T-DNA insertion in the coding sequence of the gene At4g24275.  The as-1-regulated gene expression and GUS reporter gene expression were altered  in the Delta8L4 mutant, but there was no change in the expression of genes  lacking as-1 elements in their promoters. The phenotype observed with the  Delta8L4 mutant was further verified using RNAi plants for At4g24275 (8L4-RNAi),  suggesting the feasibility of use of this high-throughput mutant screening in  isolating stress-signaling mutants.', '2006 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02814.x', 'Xiang']
