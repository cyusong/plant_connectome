One of the biggest challenges in clonal propagation of grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is difficulty of rooting. Adventitious root initiation and development are the critical steps in the cutting and layering process of grapevine, but the molecular mechanism of these processes remains unclear. Previous reports have found that microRNA (miRNA)-encoded peptides (miPEPs) can regulate plant root development by increasing the transcription of their corresponding primary miRNA. Here, we report the role of a miPEP in increasing adventitious root formation in grapevine. In this study, we performed a global analysis of miPEPs in grapevine and characterized the function of vvi-miPEP171d1, a functional, small peptide encoded by primary-miR171d. There were three small open reading frames in the 500-bp upstream sequence of pre-miR171d. One of them encoded a small peptide, vvi-miPEP171d1, which could increase the transcription of <i>vvi-MIR171d</i> Exogenous application of vvi-miPEP171d1 to grape tissue culture plantlets promoted adventitious root development by activating the expression of vvi-<i>MIR171d</i> Interestingly, neither exogenous application of the vvi-miPEP171d1 peptide nor overexpression of the vvi-miPEP171d1 coding sequence resulted in phenotypic changes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Similarly, application of synthetic ath-miPEP171c, the small peptide encoded by the Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>vvi-MIR171d</i>, inhibited the growth of primary roots and induced the early initiation of lateral and adventitious roots in Arabidopsis, while it had no effect on grape root development. Our findings reveal that miPEP171d1 regulates root development by promoting <i>vvi-MIR171d</i> expression in a species-specific manner, further enriching the theoretical research into miPEPs.
