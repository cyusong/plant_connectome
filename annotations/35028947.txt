Herbivore population dynamics are strongly influenced by the interactions established through their shared host. Such plant-mediated interactions can occur between different herbivore species and different life developmental stages of the same herbivore. However, whether these interactions occur between leaf-feeding herbivores and their soil-dwelling pupae is unknown. We studied whether tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaf herbivory by the American serpentine leafminer Liriomyza trifolii affects the performance of conspecific pupae exposed to the soil headspace of the plant. To gain mechanistic insights, we performed insect bioassays with the jasmonate-deficient tomato mutant def-1 and its wild-type, along with phytohormones, gene expression and root volatiles analyses. Belowground volatiles accelerated leafminer metamorphosis when wild-type plants were attacked aboveground by conspecifics. The opposite pattern was observed for def-1 plants, in which aboveground herbivory slowed metamorphosis. Leafminer attack induced jasmonate and abscisic acid accumulation and modulated volatile production in tomato roots in a def-1-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that aboveground herbivory triggers changes in root defence signalling and expression, which can directly or indirectly via changes in soil or microbial volatiles, alter pupal development time. This finding expands the repertoire of plant-herbivore interactions to herbivory-induced modulation of metamorphosis, with potential consequences for plant and herbivore community dynamics.
