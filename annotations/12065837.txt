['12065837', 'Transient soil flooding limits cellular oxygen to roots and reduces crop yield.  Plant response to oxygen deprivation involves increased expression of the alcohol  dehydrogenase gene (ADH) and ethanolic fermentation. Disruption of the  Arabidopsis gene that encodes Rop (RHO-like small G protein of plants) guanosine  triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein 4 (ROPGAP4), a Rop deactivator,  elevates ADH expression in response to oxygen deprivation but decreases tolerance  to stress. Rop-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide via a diphenylene  iodonium chloride-sensitive calcium-dependent reduced nicotinamide adenine  dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase is necessary for induction of both ADH and  RopGAP4 expression. Tolerance to oxygen deprivation requires Rop activation and  RopGAP4-dependent negative feedback regulation. This Rop signal transduction  rheostat balances the ability to increase ethanolic fermentation with survival.', '2002 Jun 14', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1071505', 'Bailey-Serres']
