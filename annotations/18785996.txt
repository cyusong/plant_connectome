['18785996', 'Chloroplastic NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) plays a role in cyclic electron flow  around photosystem I to produce ATP, especially in adaptation to environmental  changes. Although the NDH complex contains 11 subunits that are homologous to  NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I; EC 1.6.5.3), recent genetic and  biological studies have indicated that NDH also comprises unique subunits. We  describe here an in silico approach based on co-expression analysis and  phylogenetic profiling that was used to identify 65 genes as potential candidates  for NDH subunits. Characterization of 21 Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants  among these ndh gene candidates indicated that three novel ndf (NDH-dependent  cyclic electron flow) mutants (ndf1, ndf2 and ndf4) had impaired NDH activity as  determined by measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence. The amount of NdhH subunit  was greatly decreased in these mutants, suggesting that the loss of NDH activity  was caused by a defect in accumulation of the NDH complex. In addition, NDF1,  NDF2 and NDF4 proteins co-migrated with the NdhH subunit, as shown by blue native  electrophoresis. These results strongly suggest that NDF proteins are novel  subunits of the NDH complex. Further analysis revealed that the NDF1 and NDF2  proteins were unstable in the mutants lacking hydrophobic subunits of the NDH  complex, but were stable in mutants lacking the hydrophilic subunits, suggesting  that NDF1 and NDF2 interact with a hydrophobic sub-complex. NDF4 protein was  predicted to possess a redox-active iron-sulfur cluster domain that may be  involved in the electron transfer.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03680.x', 'Sato']
