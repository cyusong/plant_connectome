A large number of studies have reported the importance of bacterial communities in ecosystems and their responses to soil degradation, but the response mechanism in arid alpine wetlands is still unclear. Here, the non-degraded (ND), slightly degraded (SD), and heavily degraded (HD) regions of Bayinbuluk alpine wetland were used to analyzed the diversity, structure and function of bacterial communities in three degraded wetlands using 16S rRNA. The results showed that with the increase of degradation degree, the content of soil moisture (SM) and available nitrogen (AN) decreased significantly, plant species richness and total vegetation coverage decreased significantly, Cyperaceae (Cy) coverage decreased significantly, and Gramineae (Gr) coverage increased significantly. Degradation did not significantly affect the diversity of the bacterial community, but changed the relative abundance of the community structure. Degradation significantly increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (ND: 3.95%; SD: 7.27%; HD: 23.97%) and Gemmatimonadetes (ND: 0.39%; SD: 2.17%; HD: 10.78%), while significantly reducing the relative abundance of Chloroflexi (ND: 13.92%; SD: 8.68%; HD: 3.55%) and Nitrospirae (ND: 6.18%; SD: 0.45%; HD: 2.32%). Degradation significantly reduced some of the potential functions in the bacterial community associated with the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) cycles, such as hydrocarbon degradation (ND: 25.00%; SD: 1.74%; HD: 6.59%), such as aerobic ammonia oxidation (ND: 5.96%; SD: 22.82%; HD: 4.55%), and dark sulfide oxidation (ND: 32.68%; SD: 0.37%; HD: 0.28%). Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) results showed that the bacteria community was significantly related to the TC (total carbon) and Gr (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The results of linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis indicate significant enrichments of Alphaproteobacteria and <i>Sphingomonas</i> in the HD area. The vegetation communities and soil nutrients changed significantly with increasing soil degradation levels, and <i>Sphingomonas</i> could be used as potential biomarker of degraded alpine wetlands.
