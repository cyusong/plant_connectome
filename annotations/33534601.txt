Potyviruses move to neighboring cells in the form of virus particles or a coat protein (CP)-containing ribonucleoprotein complex. However, the precise roles of RNA-binding residues in potyviral CP in viral cell-to-cell movement remain to be elucidated. In this study, we predicted the three-dimensional model of tobacco vein banding mosaic virus (TVBMV)-encoded CP and found nine residues presumably located in the CP RNA-binding pocket. Substitutions of the two basic residues at positions 192 and 225 (R<sup>192</sup> and K<sup>225</sup>) with either alanine, cysteine, or glutamic acid abolished TVBMV cell-to-cell and systemic movement in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> plants. These substitutions also reduced the replication of the mutant viruses. Results from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the RNA-binding activity of mutant CPs derived from R<sup>192</sup> or K<sup>225</sup> substitutions was significantly lower than that of wild-type CP. Analysis of purified virus particles showed that mutant viruses with R<sup>192</sup> or K<sup>225</sup> substitutions formed RNA-free virus-like particles. Mutations of R<sup>192</sup> and K<sup>225</sup> did not change the CP plasmodesmata localization. The wild-type TVBMV CP could rescue the deficient cell-to-cell movement of mutant viruses. Moreover, deletion of any of the other seven residues also abolished TVBMV cell-to-cell movement and reduced the CP RNA-binding activity. The corresponding nine residues in watermelon mosaic virus CP were also found to play essential roles in virus cell-to-cell movement. In conclusion, residues R<sup>192</sup> and K<sup>225</sup> in the CP RNA-binding pocket are critical for viral RNA binding and affect both virus replication and cell-to-cell movement.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
