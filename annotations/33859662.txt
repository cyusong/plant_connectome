In this study, four recombinant inbred line (RIL) soybean populations were screened for their response to infection by <i>Pythium sylvaticum</i>, <i>Pythium irregulare</i>, <i>Pythium oopapillum</i>, and <i>Pythium torulosum.</i> The parents, PI 424237A, PI 424237B, PI 408097, and PI 408029, had higher levels of resistance to these species in a preliminary screening and were crossed with "Williams," a susceptible cultivar. A modified seed rot assay was used to evaluate RIL populations for their response to specific <i>Pythium</i> species selected for a particular population based on preliminary screenings. Over 2500 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to construct chromosomal maps to identify regions associated with resistance to <i>Pythium</i> species. Several minor and large effect quantitative disease resistance loci (QDRL) were identified including one large effect QDRL on chromosome 8 in the population of PI 408097 × Williams. It was identified by two different disease reaction traits in <i>P. sylvaticum</i>, <i>P. irregulare</i>, and <i>P. torulosum</i>. Another large effect QDRL was identified on chromosome 6 in the population of PI 408029 × Williams, and conferred resistance to <i>P. sylvaticum</i> and <i>P. irregulare</i>. These large effect QDRL will contribute toward the development of improved soybean cultivars with higher levels of resistance to these common soil-borne pathogens.
