Ovules are essential for sexual plant reproduction and seed formation, and are fundamental for agriculture. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing ovule development is far from complete. In Arabidopsis, ovule identity is determined by homeotic MADS-domain proteins that define the floral C- (AG) and D- (SHP1/SHP2, STK) functions. Pre-mRNA processing of these genes is critical and mediated by HUA-PEP activity, composed of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins. In strong hua-pep mutants, functional transcripts for C- and D-function genes are reduced, resulting in homeotic transformation of ovules. Thus, hua-pep mutants provide an unique sensitized background to study ovule morphogenesis when C- and D-functions are simultaneously compromised. We found that hua-pep ovules are morphologically sepaloid and show ectopic expression of the homeotic class-A gene AP1. Inactivation of AP1 or AP2 (A-function genes) in hua-pep mutants reduced homeotic conversions, rescuing ovule identity while promoting carpelloid traits in transformed ovules. Interestingly, increased AG dosage led to similar results. Our findings strongly suggest that HUA-PEP activity is required for correct C and D floral functions, which in turn prevents ectopic expression of class-A genes in ovules for their proper morphogenesis, evoking the classic A-C antagonism of the ABC model for floral organ development.
