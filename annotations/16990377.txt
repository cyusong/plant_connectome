Plant evolutionary developmental genetics (EDG) has made considerable progress over the last decade. This is in part due to the accumulation of large amounts of sequence data that have provided robust organismal phylogenies and, increasingly, broad assessments of molecular evolution. Attempts to use primary sequence data to identify genes that have changed function in evolutionary time have not been as successful as initially hoped. The coding sequences of most genes, which are more amenable to statistical analysis than are regulatory sequences, are generally under purifying selection, as would be expected if much evolutionary change is the result of changes in cis-regulatory sequences. Sequence-based analysis of the regulatory sequences themselves remains difficult. Comparative studies of gene expression have been useful to identify genes whose developmental role may have changed in evolutionary time and will be critical to the future development of EDG. Such studies can be used to test hypotheses of gene function. Transformation experiments are often illuminating, but can be hard to interpret, particularly if genes from multiple species are all placed into a single heterologous system such as Arabidopsis. The ideal experiment would be a gene swap or promoter swap between two species, but this awaits development of good transformation systems. The immediate need for EDG is studies of gene expression on a massive scale, far broader than any studies undertaken to date.
