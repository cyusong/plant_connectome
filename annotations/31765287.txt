Apple rust disease caused by <i>Gymnosporangium yamadae</i> is one of the major threats to apple orchards. In this study, dual RNA-seq analysis was conducted to simultaneously monitor gene expression profiles of <i>G. yamadae</i> and infected apple leaves during the formation of rust spermogonia and aecia. The molecular mechanisms underlying this compatible interaction at 10 and 30 days postinoculation (dpi) indicate a significant reaction from the host plant and comprise detoxication pathways at the earliest stage and the induction of secondary metabolism pathways at 30 dpi. Such host reactions have been previously reported in other rust pathosystems and may represent a general reaction to rust infection. <i>G. yamadae</i> transcript profiling indicates a conserved genetic program in spermogonia and aecia that is shared with other rust fungi, whereas secretome prediction reveals the presence of specific secreted candidate effector proteins expressed during apple infection. Unexpectedly, the survey of fungal unigenes in the transcriptome assemblies of inoculated and mock-inoculated apple leaves reveals that <i>G. yamadae</i> infection may modify the fungal community composition in the apple phyllosphere at 30 dpi. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into the compatible apple-<i>G. yamadae</i> interaction and advance the knowledge of this heteroecious demicyclic rust fungus.
