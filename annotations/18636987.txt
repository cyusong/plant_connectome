Alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) are key enzymes in ester biosynthesis. Previous studies have found that AAT may be a stress-related gene. To investigate further the function of the apple alcohol acyltransferase gene (MdAAT2), transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing MdAAT2 were generated. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis showed that the volatile blends were altered in these transgenic tobacco leaves. Although no apple-fruity volatile esters were detected in transgenic tobacco leaves, methyl caprylate, methyl caprate, and methyl dodecanoate were newly generated, and the concentrations of methyl benzoate and methyl tetradecanoate were significantly increased, suggesting that MdAAT2 may use medium-chain fatty acyl CoA and benzoyl-CoA as acyl donors together with methanol acceptors as substrates. Surprisingly, the concentrations of linalool were significantly increased in transgenic tobacco leaves, which may mediate the repellent effect on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) aphids. Using methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and wounding treatments, we found that MdAAT2 may substitute for the partial ability of MeJA to induce the production of linalool in transgenic plants. These data suggest that MdAAT2 may be involved in the response to the MeJA signal and may play a role in the response to biotic and abiotic stress.
