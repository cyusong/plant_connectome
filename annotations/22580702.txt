One of the most fundamental questions in the control of gene expression is how epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications are established. Our recent studies demonstrate that histone deacetylase HDA6 integrates DNA methylation and histone modifications in gene silencing by interacting with DNA methyltransferase MET1 and histone demethylase FLD, suggesting that regulatory crosstalk between histone modifications and DNA methylation could be mediated by the interaction of various epigenetic modification proteins.
