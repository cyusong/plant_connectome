Plants have evolved to deal with different stresses during plant growth, relying on complex interactions or crosstalk between multiple signalling pathways in plant cells. In this sophisticated regulatory network, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the cytosol ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> ) act as major physiological signals to initiate appropriate responses. The CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN (CBL)-CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE (CIPK) network relays physiological signals characterised by [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> transients during plant development and in response to environmental changes. Many studies are aimed at elucidating the role of the CBL-CIPK network in plant growth and stress responses. This review discusses the involvement of the CBL-CIPK pathways in two levels of crosstalk between plant development and stress adaptation: direct crosstalk through interaction with regulatory proteins, and indirect crosstalk through adaptation of correlated physiological processes that affect both plant development and stress responses. This review thus provides novel insights into the physiological roles of the CBL-CIPK network in plant growth and stress adaptation.
