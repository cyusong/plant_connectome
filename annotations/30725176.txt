Depending on nitrogen availability, S. stapfianus uses different amino acid metabolism strategies to cope with desiccation stress. The different metabolic strategies support essential processes for the desiccation tolerance phenotype. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the role played by amino acids in the adaptation of Sporobolus stapfianus to a combination of desiccation and nitrogen limitation, we used an absolute quantification of free and protein-bound amino acids (FAAs and PBAAs) as well as their gamma-glutamyl (gg-AA) derivatives in four different tissues grown under high- and low-nitrogen regimes. We demonstrate that although specific FAAs and gg-AAs increased in desiccating immature leaves under both nitrogen regimes, the absolute change in the total amount of either is small or negligible, negating their proposed role in nitrogen storage. FAAs and PBAAs decrease in underground tissues during desiccation, when nitrogen is abundant. In contrast, PBAAs are drastically reduced from the mature leaves, when nitrogen is limiting. Nevertheless, the substantial reduction in PBAA and FAA fractions in both treatments is not manifested in the immature leaves, which strongly suggests that these amino acids are further metabolized to fuel central metabolism or other metabolic adjustments that are essential for the acquisition of desiccation tolerance (DT).
