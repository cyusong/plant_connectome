<i>Physaria fendleri</i> is a burgeoning oilseed crop that accumulates the hydroxy fatty acid (HFA), lesquerolic acid, and can be a non-toxic alternative crop to castor for production of industrially valuable HFA. Recently, <i>P. fendleri</i> was proposed to utilize a unique seed oil biosynthetic pathway coined "triacylglycerol (TAG) remodeling" that utilizes a TAG lipase to remove common fatty acids from TAG allowing the subsequent incorporation of HFA after initial TAG synthesis, yet the lipase involved is unknown. SUGAR DEPENDENT 1 (SDP1) has been characterized as the dominant TAG lipase involved in TAG turnover during oilseed maturation and germination. Here, we characterized the role of a putative PfeSDP1 in both TAG turnover and TAG remodeling. <i>In vitro</i> assays confirmed that PfeSDP1 is a TAG lipase and demonstrated a preference for HFA-containing TAG species. Seed-specific RNAi knockdown of <i>PfeSDP1</i> resulted in a 12%-16% increase in seed weight and 14%-19% increase in total seed oil content with no major effect on seedling establishment. The increase in total oil content was primarily due to ~4.7% to ~14.8% increase in TAG molecular species containing two HFA (2HFA-TAG), and when combined with a smaller decrease in 1HFA-TAG content the proportion of total HFA in seed lipids increased 4%-6%. The results are consistent with PfeSDP1 involved in TAG turnover but not TAG remodeling to produce 2HFA-TAG. Interestingly, the concomitant reduction of 1HFA-TAG in PfeSDP1 knockdown lines suggests PfeSDP1 may have a role in reverse TAG remodeling during seed maturation that produces 1HFA-TAG from 2HFA-TAG. Overall, our results provide a novel strategy to enhance the total amount of industrially valuable lesquerolic acid in <i>P. fendleri</i> seeds.
