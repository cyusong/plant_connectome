['9484444', 'Two Arabidopsis thaliana cDNAs (IPP1 and IPP2) encoding isopentenyl diphosphate  isomerase (IPP isomerase) were isolated by complementation of an IPP isomerase  mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both cDNAs encode enzymes with an  amino terminus that may function as a transit peptide for localization in  plastids. At least 31 amino acids from the amino terminus of the IPP1 protein and  56 amino acids from the amino terminus of the IPP2 protein are not essential for  enzymatic activity. Genomic DNA blot analysis confirmed that IPP1 and IPP2 are  derived from a small gene family in A. thaliana. Based on northern analysis  expression of both cDNAs occurs predominantly in roots of mature A. thaliana  plants grown to the pre-flowering stage.', '1998 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1005935516274', 'Leustek']
