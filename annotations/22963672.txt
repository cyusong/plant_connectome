['22963672', 'Transpiration and gas exchange occur through stomata. Thus, the control of  stomatal aperture is important for the efficiency and regulation of water use,  and for the response to drought. Here, we demonstrate that SIZ1-mediated  endogenous salicylic acid (SA) accumulation plays an important role in stomatal  closure and drought tolerance. siz1 reduced stomatal apertures. The reduced  stomatal apertures of siz1 were inhibited by the application of peroxidase  inhibitors, salicylhydroxamic acid and azide, which inhibits SA-dependent  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, but not by an NADPH oxidase inhibitor,  diphenyl iodonium chloride, which inhibits ABA-dependent ROS production.  Furthermore, the introduction of nahG into siz1, which reduces SA accumulation,  restored stomatal opening. Stomatal closure is generally induced by water  deficit. The siz1 mutation caused drought tolerance, whereas nahG siz1 suppressed  the tolerant phenotype. Drought stresses also induced expression of SA-responsive  genes, such as PR1 and PR2. Furthermore, other SA-accumulating mutants, cpr5 and  acd6, exhibited stomatal closure and drought tolerance, and nahG suppressed the  phenotype of cpr5 and acd6, as did siz1 and nahG siz1. Together, these results  suggest that SIZ1 negatively affects stomatal closure and drought tolerance  through the accumulation of SA.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12014', 'Murata']
