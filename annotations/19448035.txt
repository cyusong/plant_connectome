['19448035', 'Understanding the cellular differentiation of multicellular organisms requires  the characterization of genes whose expression is modulated in a cell  type-specific manner. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root hair cell is  one model for studying cellular differentiation. In this study, root hair  cell-specific genes were screened by a series of in silico and experimental  filtration procedures. This process included genome-wide screening for genes with  a root hair-specific cis-element in their promoters, filtering root-specific  genes from the root hair-specific cis-element-containing genes, further filtering  of genes that were suppressed in root hair-defective plant lines, and  experimental confirmation by promoter assay. These procedures revealed 19 root  hair-specific genes, including many protein kinases and cell wall-related genes,  most of which have not been characterized thus far. Functional analyses of these  root hair-specific genes with loss-of-function mutants and overexpressing  transformants revealed that they play roles in hair growth and morphogenesis.  This study demonstrates that a defined cis-element can serve as a filter to  screen certain cell type-specific genes and implicates many new root  hair-specific genes in root hair development.', '2009 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.140905', 'Cho']
