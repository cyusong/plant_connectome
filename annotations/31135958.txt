Plastids evolved from a cyanobacterium that was engulfed by a heterotrophic eukaryotic host and became a stable organelle. Some of the resulting eukaryotic algae entered into a number of secondary endosymbioses with diverse eukaryotic hosts. These events had major consequences on the evolution and diversification of life on Earth. Although almost all plastid diversity derives from a single endosymbiotic event, the analysis of nuclear genomes of plastid-bearing lineages has revealed a mosaic origin of plastid-related genes. In addition to cyanobacterial genes, plastids recruited for their functioning eukaryotic proteins encoded by the host nucleus and also bacterial proteins of noncyanobacterial origin. Therefore, plastid proteins and plastid-localised metabolic pathways evolved by tinkering and using gene toolkits from different sources. This mixed heritage seems especially complex in secondary algae containing green plastids, the acquisition of which appears to have been facilitated by many previous acquisitions of red algal genes (the 'red carpet hypothesis').
