Proline accumulation is a widespread response of plants to salt stress as well as drought and cold stress. In most plant species, two isoforms of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) catalyze the first step in proline biosynthesis from glutamate. In Arabidopsis, these isoforms differ in their spatial and temporal expression patterns, suggesting sub-functionalization. P5CS1 has been identified as the major contributor to stress-induced proline accumulation, whereas P5CS2 has been considered important for embryo development and growth. In contrast to previous results, our analysis of P5CS1- and P5CS2-GFP fusion proteins indicates that both enzymes were exclusively localized in the cytosol. The comparison of the susceptibility of <i>p5cs1</i> and <i>p5cs2</i> mutants to infection with <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and salt stress provided novel information on the contribution of the two P5CS isoforms to proline accumulation and stress tolerance. In agreement with previous studies, salt-stressed <i>p5cs1</i> mutants accumulated very little proline, indicating that P5CS1 contributed more to stress-induced proline accumulation, whereas its impact on stress tolerance was rather weak. Germination and establishment of <i>p5cs2</i> mutants were impaired under ambient conditions, further supporting that P5CS2 is most important for growth and development, whereas its contribution to stress-induced proline accumulation was smaller than that of P5CS1. In contrast to <i>p5cs1</i> mutants or wildtype plants, <i>p5cs2</i> mutants were only weakly affected by sudden exposure to a high NaCl concentration. These findings show that proline content, which was intermediate in leaves of <i>p5cs2</i> mutants, was not directly correlated with stress tolerance in our experiments. In rosettes of NaCl-exposed <i>p5cs2</i> mutants, nearly no accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> was observed, and the plants showed neither chlorosis nor reduction of photosynthesis. Based on these data, we suggest a function of P5CS2 or P5CS2-mediated proline synthesis in regulating Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in leaves and thereby salt stress tolerance.
