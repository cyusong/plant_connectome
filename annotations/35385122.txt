In oxygenic photosynthesis, NADP+ acts as the final acceptor of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and receives electrons via the thylakoid membrane complex photosystem I (PSI) to synthesize NAPDH by the enzyme ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase. The NADP+/NADPH redox couple is essential for cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis. However, how the homeostasis of these two dinucleotides is integrated into chloroplast biogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the important role of NADP+ supply for the biogenesis of PSI by examining the nad kinase 2 (nadk2) mutant in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which demonstrates disrupted synthesis of NADP+ from NAD+ in chloroplasts. Although the nadk2 mutant is highly sensitive to light, the reaction center of photosystem II (PSII) is only mildly and likely only secondarily affected compared to the wild-type. Our studies revealed that the primary limitation of photosynthetic electron transport, even at low light intensities, occurs at PSI rather than at PSII in the nadk2 mutant. Remarkably, this primarily impairs the de novo synthesis of the two PSI core subunits PsaA and PsaB, leading to the deficiency of the PSI complex in the nadk2 mutant. This study reveals an unexpected molecular link between NADK activity and mRNA translation of psaA/B in chloroplasts that may mediate a feedback mechanism to adjust de novo biosynthesis of the PSI complex in response to a variable NADPH demand. This adjustment may be important to protect PSI from photoinhibition under conditions that favor acceptor side limitation.
