<i>Ascochyta versabilis</i> is the fungal pathogen that causes the severe leaf spot disease of <i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i> (Miq.) Pax, a vital Chinese herbal plant. Here, we deployed PacBio single-molecule real-time long-read sequencing technology to generate a near-complete genome assembly for the <i>A. versabilis</i> KC1 strain and obtained a total of 9.80 Gb raw reads. These reads were processed into a 41.05 Mb genome assembly containing 95 contigs with N50 of 1.70 Mb and a maximum length of 3.93 Mb. A total of 10,457 gene models, of which 1,004 encode putatively secreted proteins, were identified in the genome. This high-quality genome assembly and gene annotation resource will facilitate the institution of functional genetic studies aimed at providing a better insight into the infection mechanisms of <i>A. versabilis</i> to support the development of effective control strategies for leaf spot disease of <i>P. heterophylla.</i>
