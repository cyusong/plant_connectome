Identification of transcription factor binding sites is one of the most important steps in understanding the function of transcription factors and regulatory networks in organisms. The assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a simple protocol for detection of open chromatin that could be a powerful tool to advance studies of protein-DNA interactions. Although ATAC-seq has been used in systematic identification of <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions in animal and plant genomes, this method has been rarely applied in fungi. Here, we describe a valuable ATAC-seq resource in the genome of an economically important phytopathogen, the rice false smut fungus <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>. The ATAC-seq data of <i>U. virens</i> mycelia collected from potato sucrose broth (PSB) and PSB supplied with rice spikelet extract were both generated. This is the first genome-wide profiling of open chromatin and transcription factor binding sites in <i>U. virens</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
