According to the World Health Organization, the contamination of crops with aflatoxins poses a significant economic burden, estimated to affect 25% of global food crops. In the event that the contaminated food is processed, aflatoxins enter the general food supply and can cause serious diseases. Aflatoxins are distributed unevenly in food or feedstock, making eradicating them both a scientific and a technological challenge. Cooking, freezing, or pressurizing have little effect on aflatoxins. While chemical methods degrade toxins on the surface of contaminated food, the destruction inside entails a slow process. Physical techniques, such as irradiation with ultraviolet photons, pulses of extensive white radiation, and gaseous plasma, are promising; yet, the exact mechanisms concerning how these techniques degrade aflatoxins require further study. Correlations between the efficiency of such degradation and the processing parameters used by various authors are presented in this review. The lack of appropriate guidance while interpreting the observed results is a huge scientific challenge.
