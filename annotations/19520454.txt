Relatively little is known about changes in the cytosolic free calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) in monocotyledonous plants. Therefore, we produced transgenic winter wheat lines stably expressing the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin constitutively in the cytosol. [Ca(2+)](c) was detected in vivo by luminometry, and [Ca(2+)](c) elevations were imaged at video rate. Experiments with the transgenic seedlings focused on potential changes in [Ca(2+)](c) during cold exposure. Temperature-induced changes in [Ca(2+)](c) were found to be more dependent on the change in temperature (dT dt(-1)) than on the absolute value of temperature. [Ca(2+)](c) increased only at cooling rates higher than 8 degrees Cmin(-1), indicating that an overall cellular [Ca(2+)](c) increase is of minor relevance as a signal for cold acclimation in wheat under ecological conditions. The results are discussed with regard to the so-called 'calcium signature hypothesis'.
