Celery is a stalky green vegetable that is grown and consumed globally and used in many cuisines for its distinctive taste and flavour. Previous investigations identified the aroma composition of celery and profiled its sensory characteristics using a trained panel; however, evaluation of the sensory characteristics of celery combined with a consumer panel, where consumer preferences and acceptability are determined, is novel. In this study, three parental genotypes (12, 22 and 25) and three new hybrids (12x22, 22x12 and 25x12) were presented to a trained sensory panel (<i>n</i> = 12) for profiling and a consumer panel (<i>n</i> = 118), where liking and preference were assessed. Celery samples were analysed by SPME GC-MS and significant differences in aroma composition between all samples were identified, causing significant differences in the sensory profile. Furthermore, significant differences in attributes assessed for liking (appearance, aroma, texture and overall) were identified. Consumer segmentation identified three groups of consumers exhibiting differences in the hedonic reaction to the samples. Sweet and bitter taste along with overall flavour were identified as drivers of liking. Hybrid 25x12 was found to be the hybrid that exhibited high intensities for most of the attributes assessed.
