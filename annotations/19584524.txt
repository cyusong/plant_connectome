['19584524', 'Symmetric chloroplast division requires a prokaryote-derived division regulator  protein MinD, whose subchloroplastic localization remains to be completely  established. We investigated the localization and functionality of AtMinD1  (Arabidopsis thaliana MinD) fused with a dual hemagglutinin epitope (dHA) or a  yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). AtMinD1-dHA, which successfully complemented  the arc11/atminD1 mutant phenotype, was predominantly located at the envelope  membrane and the mid-chloroplast constriction site. Meanwhile, AtMinD1-YFP was  non-functional and showed suborganellar localization partly similar to that of  AtMinD1-dHA. This prompts us to reevaluate earlier transgenic and transient  expression studies using fluorescent protein-tagged AtMinD1.', '2009 Jul', 'Biosci Biotechnol Biochem', '10.1271/bbb.90309', 'Itoh']
