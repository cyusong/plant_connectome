['10871276', 'Many soluble plant vacuolar proteins are sorted away from secreted proteins into  small vesicles at the trans-Golgi network by transmembrane cargo receptors.  Cleavable vacuolar sorting signals include the NH(2)-terminal propeptide (NTPP)  present in sweet potato sporamin (Spo) and the COOH-terminal propeptide (CTPP)  present in barley lectin (BL). These two proteins have been found to be  transported by different mechanisms to the vacuole. We examined the ability of  the vacuolar cargo receptor AtELP to interact with the sorting signals of  heterologous and endogenous plant vacuolar proteins in mediating vacuolar  transport in Arabidopsis thaliana. AtELP extracted from microsomes was found to  interact with the NTPPs of barley aleurain and Spo, but not with the CTPPs of BL  or tobacco chitinase, in a pH-dependent and sequence-specific manner. In  addition, EM studies revealed the colocalization of AtELP with NTPP-Spo at the  Golgi apparatus, but not with BL-CTPP in roots of transgenic Arabidopsis plants.  Further, we found that AtELP interacts in a similar manner with the NTPP of the  endogenous vacuolar protein AtALEU (Arabidopsis thaliana Aleu), a protein highly  homologous to barley aleurain. We hypothesize that AtELP functions as a vacuolar  sorting receptor involved in the targeting of NTPP-, but not CTPP-containing  proteins in Arabidopsis.', '2000 Jun 26', 'J Cell Biol', '10.1083/jcb.149.7.1335', 'Raikhel']
