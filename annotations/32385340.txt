['32385340', 'Plants respond to herbivory by perceiving herbivore danger signal(s) (HDS(s)),  including "elicitors", that are present in herbivores\' oral secretions (OS) and  act to induce defense responses. However, little is known about HDS-specific  molecules and intracellular signaling. Here we explored soybean receptor-like  kinases (RLKs) as candidates that might mediate HDS-associated RLKs\' (HAKs\')  actions in leaves in response to OS extracted from larvae of a generalist  herbivore, Spodoptera litura. Fractionation of OS yielded Fralpha, which consisted of  polysaccharides. The GmHAKs composed of their respective homomultimers scarcely  interacted with Fralpha. Moreover, Arabidopsis HAK1 homomultimers interacted with  cytoplasmic signaling molecule PBL27, resulting in herbivory resistance, in an  ethylene-dependent manner. Altogether, our findings suggest that HAKs are  herbivore-specific RLKs mediating HDS-transmitting, intracellular signaling  through interaction with PBL27 and the subsequent ethylene signaling for plant  defense responses in host plants.', '2020 May 8', 'Commun Biol', '10.1038/s42003-020-0959-4', 'Arimura']
