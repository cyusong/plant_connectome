Melatonin is an indoleamine small molecular substance that has been shown to play an important role in the growth, development, and stress response of plants. The effects of melatonin on the morphological characteristics, mineral nutrition, nitrogen metabolism, and energy status in alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) under high-nitrate stress were studied. The alfalfa plants were treated with water (CK), 200 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> nitrates (HN), or 200 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> nitrates + 0.1 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> melatonin (HN+MT), and then were sampled for measurements on days 0 and 10, respectively. The results showed that the HN treatment resulted in a decrease in the morphological characteristics (such as shoot height, leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, and biomass), phosphorus, soluble protein (SP), nitrogen-related enzymes activities and gene relative expression, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and energy charge (EC). It also caused an increase in nitrogen, sodium, potassium, calcium, nitrate-nitrogen ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo></mrow> </msubsup> </math> -N), ammonium-nitrogen ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow> <mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow> </msubsup> </math> -N), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). However, these parameters were conversely changed in the HN+MT treatment. Besides, these parameters were closely related to each other, and were divided into two principal components. It reveals that melatonin plays an important role in modulating the morphology, mineral nutrition, nitrogen metabolism and energy status, thereby alleviating the adverse effects of high-nitrate stress and improving the growth of alfalfa.
