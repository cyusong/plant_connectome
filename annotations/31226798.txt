['31226798', 'Plant copper amine oxidases (CuAOs) are involved in wound healing, defense  against pathogens, methyl-jasmonate-induced protoxylem differentiation, and  abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. In the present study, we  investigated the role of the Arabidopsis thaliana CuAOdelta (AtCuAOdelta; At4g12290) in  the ABA-mediated stomatal closure by genetic and pharmacological approaches.  Obtained data show that AtCuAOdelta is up-regulated by ABA and that two Atcuaodelta T-DNA  insertional mutants are less responsive to this hormone, showing reduced  ABA-mediated stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation in guard cells as  compared to the wild-type (WT) plants. Furthermore, CuAO inhibitors, as well as  the hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenger N,N(1)-dimethylthiourea, reversed most  of the ABA-induced stomatal closure in WT plants. Consistently, AtCuAOdelta  over-expressing transgenic plants display a constitutively increased stomatal  closure and increased H(2)O(2) production compared to WT plants. Our data suggest  that AtCuAOdelta is involved in the H(2)O(2) production related to ABA-induced  stomatal closure.', '2019 Jun 20', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants8060183', 'ORCID:']
