['19307045', 'The SMALL ACIDIC PROTEIN 2 (SMAP2) gene is a paralogue of the SMAP1 gene that  mediates the response to the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  (2,4-D) in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana. Their encoded proteins, SMAP1 and  SMAP2, are similar in calculated molecular weight and isoelectric point, and in  having a highly conserved phenylalanine and aspartic acid-rich domain. RNA  expression analysis showed that SMAP1 mRNA is present throughout the plant body  while SMAP2 mRNA is restricted to siliques and anthers. Over-expression of the  SMAP2 gene, as well as SMAP1, by 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter restored  sensitivity to 2,4-D in the 2,4-D-resistant mutant, aar1, which is defective in  SMAP1 function. The results suggest that SMAP2 has an ability to mediate the  2,4-D response and is expressed only in restricted tissues.', '2009 Aug 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2009.02.005', 'Oono']
