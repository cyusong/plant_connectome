Increasing temperature is one of the major threats to maize growth and yield globally. Under heat stress conditions, intracellular protein homeostasis is seriously disturbed, leading to accumulation of abnormally folded proteins, especially in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Molecular chaperones are vital players in the renaturation process and in preventing protein aggregation. However, heat stress tolerance-associated chaperones are not well documented in maize. Here, we characterized the biological roles of HEAT UP-REGULATED GENE 1 (ZmHUG1) in maize. ZmHUG1 encodes a heat-inducible holdase-type molecular chaperone localized in the ER. Knockout mutant of ZmHUG1 exhibited remarkably enhanced sensitivity to heat stress. Accordingly, the zmhug1 mutant showed severe ER stress under high temperature. MAIZE PRENYLATED RAB ACCEPTOR 1.C1 (ZmPRA1.C1) was identified as a client of ZmHUG1, and heat-induced aggregation of ZmPRA1.C1 was accelerated in the zmhug1 mutant. Furthermore, the expression of ZmHUG1 was rapidly transactivated by ER stress sensor BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER DOMAIN 60 (bZIP60) when heat stress occurred. This study reveals a ZmHUG1-based thermo-protective mechanism in maize.
