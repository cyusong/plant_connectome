Phospholipase C (PLC) has been suggested to have a role in signal perception by Nod factors (NFs) in legume root hair cells. For instance, mastoparan, a well-described agonist of heterotrimeric G protein, induces nodulin expression after NFs treatment or Rhizobium inoculation. Furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that mastoparan also mimics calcium oscillations induced by NFs, suggesting that PLC could play a key role during the nodulation process. In this study, we elucidate a biochemical relationship between PLC and heterotrimeric G proteins during NFs signaling in legumes. In particular, the effect of NFs on in vitro PLC activity from nodule membrane fractions in the presence of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTPgammaS) and mastoparan was assayed. Our results indicate that for phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP(2))-PLC, there is a specific activity of 20-27 nmol mg(-1) min(-1) in membrane fractions of nodules 18-20 days after inoculation with Rhizobium tropici. Interestingly, in the presence of 5 microM mastoparan, PIP(2)-PLC activity was almost double the basal level. In contrast, PIP(2)-PLC activity was downregulated by 1-10 microM GTPgammaS. Also, PLC activity was decreased by up to 64% in the presence of increasing concentrations of NFs (10(-8) to 10(-5) M). NFs are critical signaling molecules in rhizobia/legume symbiosis that can activate many of the plant's early responses during nodule development. Calcium spiking, kinases, PLC activity and possibly G proteins appear to be components downstream of the NFs perception pathway. Our results suggest the occurrence of a dual signaling pathway that could involve both G proteins and PLC in Phaseolus vulgaris during the development of root nodules.
