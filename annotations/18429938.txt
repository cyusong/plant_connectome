['18429938', 'Cytoplasmic streaming is a ubiquitous process in plant cells that is thought to  be driven by the active movement of myosin XI motor proteins along actin  filaments. These myosin motors bind to organelles through their C-terminal  globular tail domain, although recent studies have also suggested a role for the  central coiled-coil region during organelle binding. Here we have investigated  the relationship between these two protein domains of MYA1, an Arabidopsis myosin  XI, in a series of in vivo experiments demonstrating that dimerization of the  coiled-coil region stabilizes organelle binding of the globular tail.  Surprisingly, yeast two-hybrid assays, bimolecular fluorescence complementation,  Forster resonance energy transfer and in vitro pull-down experiments all  demonstrated that dimerization of the 174-residue MYA1 coiled coils by themselves  was unstable. Furthermore, only the first of the two major coiled-coil segments  in MYA1 contributed significantly to dimer formation. Interestingly, dimerization  of myosin tail constructs that included the organelle-binding globular tail was  stable, although the globular tails by themselves did not interact. This suggests  an inter-dependent relationship between dimerization and organelle binding in  myosin XI, whereby each process synergistically stimulates the other.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03522.x', 'Nebenfuhr']
