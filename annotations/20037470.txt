In the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata, leaf wounding or herbivory lead to a reduction of root growth via jasmonic acid (JA) signaling. A single wounding treatment is sufficient to induce this response; multiple wounding does not increase the plant growth reaction. In a recent study, in which JA bursts were elicited in leaves of the molecular model species Arabidopsis thaliana in different ways,(1) we tested whether JA induces the same response there. Root growth reduction was neither induced by foliar application of herbivore oral secretions nor by direct application of methyl jasmonate to leaves. Root growth reduction was observed when leaves were infected with the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, which persistently induces the JA signaling pathway. Yet, growth analyses of this effect in wild type and JA-signaling mutants showed that it was elicited by the bacterial toxin coronatine which suggests ethylene-but not JA-induced root growth reduction in A. thaliana. Moreover, the growth effects were somewhat masked by a light-induced diurnal decrease of root growth. Overall, we conclude that the reaction of root growth to herbivore-induced JA signaling differs among species, which is related to different ecological defence strategies that have evolved in different species.

Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato: !induces! JA signaling 
Coronatine: !induces! root growth reduction 
JA-signaling mutants: !mask! growth effects 
Light: !decreases! root growth
