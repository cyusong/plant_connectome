<i>Physalis angulata</i> is a renowned traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various conditions. Physalin is the major type of bioactive constituents conferring medicinal properties of <i>P. angulata</i>. Despite the medicinal importance, the pathways leading to physalin are largely unknown. In this study, we employed a transcriptomic approach to identify a <i>Pa24ISO</i> gene from <i>P. angulata</i>. Through heterologous expression in yeast, Pa24ISO was revealed to catalyze an isomerization reaction in converting 24-methylenecholesterol to 24-methyldesmosterol. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the abundance of <i>Pa24ISO</i> transcripts correlated with the accumulation pattern of physalin B in different tissues of <i>P. angulata</i>. A direct role of Pa24ISO in channeling of 24-methylenecholesterol for physalin B biosynthesis was illustrated by suppressing the gene in <i>P. angulata via</i> the VIGS approach. Down-regulation of <i>Pa24ISO</i> led to reduced levels of 24-methyldesmosterol and physalin B, accompanied with an increase of campesterol content in <i>P. angulata</i>. The results supported that 24ISO is involved in physalin biosynthesis in plants.
