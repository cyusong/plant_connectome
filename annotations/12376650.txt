['12376650', 'The Arabidopsis genome contains 14 genes encoding the serine protease DegP.  Products of four of these genes are located in the chloroplast: three in the  thylakoid lumen and one on the stromal side of the membrane. We expressed the  gene encoding DegP1 as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified  the protein by affinity chromatography, and characterized it biochemically.  Size-exclusion chromatography suggested that DegP1 eluted from the column as a  mixture of monomers and hexamers. Proteolytic activity was characterized using  beta-casein as a model substrate. DegP1 demonstrated concentration-dependent  activity, a pH optimum of 6.0 and increasing activity at elevated temperatures.  DegP1 was capable of degrading two lumenal proteins, plastocyanin and OE33,  suggesting a role as a general-purpose protease in the thylakoid lumen. The  results of this work are discussed in the context of the recent elucidation of  the structure of the E. coli homolog and the possible physiological role of the  protease in the chloroplast lumen.', '2002 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.007922', 'Adam']
