Heat stress severely affects the annual agricultural production. Heat stress transcription factors (HSFs) represent a critical regulatory juncture in the heat stress response (HSR) of plants. The HsfA1-dependent pathway has been explored well, but the regulatory mechanism of the HsfA1-independent pathway is still under-investigated. In the present research, HsfA4, an important gene of the HsfA1-independent pathway, was isolated from lilies (<i>Lilium longiflorum</i>) using the RACE method, which encodes 435 amino acids. LlHsfA4 contains a typical domain of HSFs and belongs to the HSF A4 family, according to homology comparisons and phylogenetic analysis. <i>LlHsfA4</i> was mainly expressed in leaves and was induced by heat stress and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> using qRT-PCR and GUS staining in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. LlHsfA4 had transactivation activity and was located in the nucleus and cytoplasm through a yeast one hybrid system and through transient expression in lily protoplasts. Over expressing <i>LlHsfA4</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> enhanced its basic thermotolerance, but acquired thermotolerance was not achieved. Further research found that heat stress could increase H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in lily leaves and reduced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in transgenic plants, which was consistent with the up-regulation of HSR downstream genes such as <i>Heat stress proteins</i> (<i>HSPs</i>), Galactinol synthase1 (<i>GolS1</i>), <i>WRKY DNA binding protein 30</i> (<i>WRKY30</i>), <i>Zinc finger of <i>Arabidopsis</i> thaliana 6</i> (<i>ZAT6</i>) and the ROS-scavenging enzyme <i>Ascorbate peroxidase 2</i> (<i>APX2</i>). In conclusion, these results indicate that LlHsfA4 plays important roles in heat stress response through regulating the ROS metabolism in lilies.
