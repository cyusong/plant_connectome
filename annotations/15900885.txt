Potato plants (Solanum tuberosum cv. Bintje) were grown in open top chambers under ambient (400 microL L(-1)) and elevated CO2 (720 microL L(-1)). After 50 days one half of each group was transferred to the other CO2 concentration and the effects were studied in relation to leaf age (old, middle-aged and young leaves) in each of the four groups. Under long-term exposure to elevated CO2, photosynthesis increased between 10% and 40% compared to ambient CO2. A subsequent shift of the same plants to ambient CO2 caused a 20-40% decline in photosynthetic rate, which was most pronounced in young leaves. After shifting from long-term ambient to elevated CO2, photosynthesis also increased most strongly in young leaves (90%); these experiments show that photosynthesis was downregulated in the upper young fully expanded leaves of potato growing long-term under elevated CO2. Soluble sugar content in all leaf classes under long-term exposure was stable irrespective of the CO2 treatment, however under elevated CO2 young leaves showed a strongly increased starch accumulation (up to 400%). In all leaf classes starch levels dropped in response to the shift from 720 to 400 microL L(-1) approaching ambient CO2 levels. After the shift to 720 microL L(-1), sucrose and starch levels increased, principally in young Leaves. There is clear evidence that leaves of different age vary in their responses to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration.
