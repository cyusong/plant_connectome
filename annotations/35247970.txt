Alkaline soils cause low productivity in crop plants including lentil. Alkalinity adaptation strategies in lentil were revealed when morpho-anatomical and physio-biochemical observations were correlated with transcriptomics analysis in tolerant (PDL-1) and sensitive (L-4076) cultivars at seedling stage. PDL-1 had lesser salt injury and performed better as compared to L-4076. Latter showed severe wilting symptoms and higher accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and lower K<sup>+</sup> in roots and shoots. PDL-1 performed better under high alkalinity stress which can be attributed to its higher mitotic index, more accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> in roots and shoots and less aberrantly dividing cells. Also, antioxidant enzyme activities, osmolytes' accumulation, relative water content, membrane stability index and abscisic acid were higher in this cultivar. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to these parameters were upregulated in tolerant genotypes compared to the sensitive one. Significantly up-regulated DEGs were found to be involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and secondary metabolites synthesis. ABA responsive genes viz. dehydrin 1, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, ABA-responsive protein 18 and BEL1-like homeodomain protein 1 had log<sub>2</sub>fold change above 4.0. A total of 12,836 simple sequence repeats and 4,438 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified which can be utilized in molecular studies. Phyto-hormones biosynthesis-predominantly through ABA signalling, and secondary metabolism are the most potent pathways for alkalinity stress tolerance in lentil. Cultivar PDL-1 exhibited high tolerance towards alkalinity stress and can be used in breeding programmes for improving lentil production under alkalinity stress conditions.
