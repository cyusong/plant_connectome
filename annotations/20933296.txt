Freshly harvested silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) seeds were soaked in either sodium selenite (10mg/L) or water for 6h. After washing and air drying, seeds were desiccated at 22°C at a RH of 45-50% to comparable water levels from 50 to 12%. Germination capacity was significantly higher in seeds treated with selenium and desiccated [from 50 to 40, 35 and 30% of water content (WC)] than in water-soaked seeds. At 20% WC, the seeds from both treatments had low viability (approximately 20%). The electrolyte leakage and the MDA content were significantly lower in the embryonic axes of seeds soaked in selenite than in seeds soaked in water. We also found that the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) of embryonic axes from selenium-treated seeds that were not desiccated, or from seeds that were desiccated to 40 and 35% WC, was significantly higher than that of non-treated axes. No difference in GPX activity was detected in cotyledons. This was confirmed by activity staining of GPX after native PAGE of proteins extracted from embryonic axes and cotyledons. An increase in glutathione reductase (GR) activity was also observed in embryonic axes of seeds treated with selenium and dried to 35 and 30% WC compared to non-treated samples. Selenium appeared to have no such effect on cotyledons.
