As the nerve-mediated signaling in animals, long-distance signaling in plants is a prerequisite for plants to be able to perceive environmental stimuli and initiate adaptive responses. While intracellular signal transduction has been attracting considerable attentions, studies on long-distance signaling in plants has been relatively overlooked. Stomatal movements are well recognized as a model system for studies on cellular signal transduction. It has been demonstrated that the stomatal movements may be frequently tuned by long-distance signaling under various environmental stimuli. Stomatal movements can not only respond to persistent stress stimuli but also respond to shock stress stimuli. Stomatal responses to drought stress situations may be best characterized in terms of interwoven networks of chemical signaling pathways playing predominant roles in these adaptive processes. In cases of shock stress stimuli, stomatal movements can be more sensitively regulated through the long-distance signaling but with distinctive patterns not observed for drought or other persistent stresses. Here, the fundamental characteristics of stomatal movements and associated long-distance signaling are reviewed and the implications for plant responses to environmental stresses are discussed.
