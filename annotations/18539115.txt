['18539115', 'Axis formation is one of the earliest patterning events in plant and animal  embryogenesis. In Arabidopsis, the main axis of the embryo is evident at the  asymmetric division of the zygote into a small, embryonic apical cell and a large  extraembryonic basal cell. Here we show that the homeobox genes WOX2 and WOX8,  which are initially coexpressed in the zygote, act as complementary cell fate  regulators in the apical and basal lineage, respectively. Furthermore, WOX8  expression in the basal cell lineage is required for WOX2 expression and normal  development of the proembryo, suggesting an inductive mechanism. The identified  WOX cascade is required for normal expression of a reporter gene of the auxin  efflux carrier PIN1 and for the formation of auxin response maxima in the  proembryo. Thus, our results link the spatial separation of WOX transcription  factors to localized auxin response and the formation of the main body axis in  the embryo.', '2008 Jun', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2008.03.008', 'Laux']
