Soil salinity severely threatens plant growth and crop performance. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a plant signal molecule, has been implicated in the regulation of plant responses to salinity stress. However, it is unclear how the transcriptional network regulates H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis during salt stress response. In this study, we identify a rice NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) transcription factor, OsNAC35-like (OsNACL35), from a salt-tolerant cultivar 'Sea Rice 86' (SR86) and further show that it may have improved salt tolerance via enhanced H<sub>2</sub>S production. The expression of <i>OsNACL35</i> was significantly upregulated by high salinity and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The OsNACL35 protein was localized predominantly in the nucleus and was found to have transactivation activity in yeast. The overexpression of <i>OsNACL35</i> (<i>OsNACL35-OE</i>) in japonica cultivar Nipponbare ramatically increased resistance to salinity stress, whereas its dominant-negative constructs (SUPERMAN repression domain, SRDX) conferred hypersensitivity to salt stress in the transgenic lines at the vegetative stage. Moreover, the quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that many stress-associated genes were differentially expressed in the <i>OsNACL35-OE</i> and <i>OsNACL35-SRDX</i> lines. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of <i>OsNACL35</i> triggered a sharp increase in H<sub>2</sub>S content by upregulating the expression of a H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthetic gene, Os<i>DCD1</i>, upon salinity stress. Furthermore, the dual luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that OsNACL35 directly upregulated the expression of <i>OsDCD1</i> by binding to the promoter sequence of <i>OsDCD1</i>. Taken together, our observations illustrate that OsNACL35 acts as a positive regulator that links H<sub>2</sub>S production to salt stress tolerance, which may hold promising utility in breeding salt-tolerant rice cultivar.
