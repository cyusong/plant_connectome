In this study, we investigated the effect of an electric field, with an intensity similar to that of the Earth's field, on plant cells growth. The molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. It was found that the electric field, depending on the applied voltage, its duration and the polarization of the maize seedlings, stimulated or inhibited the growth of the seedling organs (root, mesocotyl and coleoptile). Moreover, it was also noticed that the gravitropic response of maize seedlings was inhibited at all voltages studied. Simultaneous measurements of growth and external medium pH show that auxin(IAA, indole-3-acetic acid)- and fusicoccin(FC)-induced elongation growth and proton extrusion of maize coleoptile segments were significantly inhibited at higher voltages. The ionic current flowing through the single coleoptile segment during voltage application was 1.7-fold lower in segments treated with cation channel blocker tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) and 1.4-fold higher with IAA compared to the control. The electrophysiological experiments show that the electric field caused the depolarization of the membrane potential of parenchymal coleoptile cells, which was not reversible over 120 min. It is suggested that a DC electric field inhibits the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> pump activity and K<sup>+</sup> uptake through voltage-dependent, inwardly rectifying ZMK1 channels (Zea mays K<sup>+</sup> channel 1). The data presented here are discussed, taking into account the "acid growth hypothesis" of the auxin action and the mechanism of gravitropic response induction.
