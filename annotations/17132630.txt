In higher plants, circadian rhythms are highly relevant to a wide range of biological processes. To such circadian rhythms, the clock (oscillator) is central, and recent intensive studies on the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the central clock. Such representative clock-associated genes of A. thaliana are the homologous CCA1 and LHY genes, and five PRR genes that belong to a small family of pseudo-response regulators including TOC1. Others are GI, ZTL, ELF3, ELF4, LUX/PCL1, etc. In this context, a simple question arose as to whether or not the molecular picture of the model Arabidopsis clock is conserved in other higher plants. Here we made an effort to answer the question with special reference to Oryza sativa, providing experimental evidence that this model monocot also has a set of highly conserved clock-associated genes, such as those designated as OsCCA1, OsPRR-series including OsTOC1/OsPRR1, OsZTLs, OsPCL1 as well as OsGI. These results will provide us with insight into the general roles of plant circadian clocks, such as those for the photoperiodic control of flowering time that has a strong impact on the reproduction and yield in many higher plants.
