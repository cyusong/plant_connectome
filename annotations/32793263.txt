The present work describes the effects on iron homeostasis when copper transport was deregulated in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by overexpressing high affinity copper transporters COPT1 and COPT3 (<i>COPT<sup>OE</sup></i> ). A genome-wide analysis conducted on <i>COPT1<sup>OE</sup></i> plants, highlighted that iron homeostasis gene expression was affected under both copper deficiency and excess. Among the altered genes were those encoding the iron uptake machinery and their transcriptional regulators. Subsequently, <i>COPT<sup>OE</sup></i> seedlings contained less iron and were more sensitive than controls to iron deficiency. The deregulation of copper (I) uptake hindered the transcriptional activation of the subgroup Ib of basic helix-loop-helix (<i>bHLH-Ib</i>) factors under copper deficiency. Oppositely, copper excess inhibited the expression of the master regulator <i>FIT</i> but activated <i>bHLH-Ib</i> expression in <i>COPT<sup>OE</sup></i> plants, in both cases leading to the lack of an adequate iron uptake response. As copper increased in the media, iron (III) was accumulated in roots, and the ratio iron (III)/iron (II) was increased in <i>COPT<sup>OE</sup></i> plants. Thus, iron (III) overloading in <i>COPT<sup>OE</sup></i> roots inhibited local iron deficiency responses, aimed to metal uptake from soil, leading to a general lower iron content in the <i>COPT<sup>OE</sup></i> seedlings. These results emphasized the importance of appropriate spatiotemporal copper uptake for iron homeostasis under non-optimal copper supply. The understanding of the role of copper uptake in iron metabolism could be applied for increasing crops resistance to iron deficiency.
