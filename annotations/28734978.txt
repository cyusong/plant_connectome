['28734978', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding CYP71A16 is part of the gene cluster for  the biosynthesis and modification of the triterpenoid marneral. Previous  investigations of A. thaliana have revealed that CYP71A16 catalyzes marneral  oxidation, while it also can accept marnerol as substrate. The aim of the present  study was to investigate functional properties of CYP71A16 in vitro. For this  purpose, heterologous expression of a N-terminally modified version of CYP71A16  was established in Escherichia coli, which yielded up to 50mgL(-1) recombinant  enzyme. The enzyme was purified and activity was reconstituted in vitro with  different redox partners. A heterologous bacterial redox partner system  consisting of the flavodoxin YkuN from Bacillus subtilis and the flavodoxin  reductase Fpr from E. coli clearly outperformed the cytochrome P450 reductase  ATR2 from A. thaliana in supporting the CYP71A16-mediated hydroxylation of  marnerol. Substrate binding experiments with CYP71A16 revealed a dissociation  constant K(D) of 225muM for marnerol. CYP71A16 catalyzed the hydroxylation of  marnerol to 23-hydroxymarnerol with a K(M) of 142muM and a k(cat) of 3.9min(-1).  Furthermore, GC/MS analysis revealed an as of yet unidentified overoxidation  product of this in vitro reaction.
