['16679459', "Glucosinolates are sulfur-rich plant secondary metabolites whose breakdown  products have a wide range of biological activities in plant-herbivore and  plant-pathogen interactions and anticarcinogenic properties. In Arabidopsis  thaliana, hydrolysis by the enzyme, myrosinase, produces bioactive nitriles,  epithionitriles, or isothiocyanates depending upon the plant's genotype and the  glucosinolate's structure. A major determinant of this structural specificity is  the epithiospecifier locus (ESP), whose protein causes the formation of  epithionitriles and nitriles. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3  epistatically affects nitrile formation in combination with ESP; this QTL has  been termed EPITHIOSPECIFIER MODIFIER1 (ESM1). We identified a  myrosinase-associated protein as the ESM1 QTL in Arabidopsis using map-based  cloning with recombinant inbred lines, natural variation transcriptomic analysis,  and metabolic profiling. In planta and in vitro analyses with natural ESM1  alleles, ESM1 knockouts, and overexpression lines show that ESM1 represses  nitrile formation and favors isothiocyanate production. The glucosinolate  hydrolysis profile change influenced by ESM1 is associated with the ability to  deter herbivory by Trichoplusia ni. This gene could provide unique approaches  toward improving human nutrition.", '2006 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039602', 'Kliebenstein']
