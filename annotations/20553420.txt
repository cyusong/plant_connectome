In recent years Arabidopsis thaliana has become a model species for genomic variability and adaptation studies. Although impressive quantities of data have been gathered on the nuclear genomic diversity of this species, little has been published regarding its cytoplasmic diversity. We analyzed the diversity of plastid (pt) and mitochondrial (mt) genomes among 95 accessions, covering most Arabidopsis geographic origins. Four intergenic regions of the pt genome were sequenced, and a total of 68 polymorphisms and 65 pt haplotypes were identified. Several strategies were developed to identify mt polymorphisms among a subset of 14 accessions. Fifteen polymorphisms were further developed as PCR-based markers and used to analyze the whole set of 95 accessions. Using statistical parsimony, we built pt and mt phylogenetic networks of haplotype groups. To root the pt network, the pt intergenic regions of two related Arabidopsis species, Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis arenosa, were also sequenced. The mt and pt phylogenies are highly congruent and could be combined into a single cytoplasmic phylogeny. To estimate whether co-adaptation between nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes exists in A. thaliana, we tested the germination capacity in challenging conditions of 27 pairs of reciprocal F(2) families. We found that the cytoplasm donor had a significant effect on the germination capacity of some F(2) families.
