The key phytohormone auxin is involved in practically every aspect of plant growth and development. Auxin regulates these processes by controlling gene expression through functionally distinct AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs). As a noncanonical ARF, ARF3/ETTIN (ETT) mediates auxin responses to orchestrate multiple developmental processes during the reproductive phase. The <i>arf3</i> mutation has pleiotropic effects on reproductive development, causing abnormalities in meristem homeostasis, floral determinacy, phyllotaxy, floral organ patterning, gynoecium morphogenesis, ovule development, and self-incompatibility. The importance of ARF3 is also reflected in its precise regulation at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational, and epigenetic levels. Recent studies have shown that ARF3 controls dynamic shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance in a non-cell autonomous manner. Here, we summarize the hierarchical regulatory mechanisms by which ARF3 is regulated and the diverse roles of ARF3 regulating developmental processes during the reproductive phase.
