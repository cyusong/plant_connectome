Synchronized communication between gametophytic and sporophytic tissue is crucial for successful reproduction, and hormones seem to have a prominent role in it. Here, we studied the role of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cytochrome P450 CYP78A9 enzyme during reproductive development. First, controlled pollination experiments indicate that CYP78A9 responds to fertilization. Second, while CYP78A9 overexpression can uncouple fruit development from fertilization, the cyp78a8 cyp78a9 loss-of-function mutant has reduced seed set due to outer ovule integument development arrest, leading to female sterility. Moreover, CYP78A9 has a specific expression pattern in inner integuments in early steps of ovule development as well as in the funiculus, embryo, and integuments of developing seeds. CYP78A9 overexpression did not change the response to the known hormones involved in flower development and fruit set, and it did not seem to have much effect on the major known hormonal pathways. Furthermore, according to previous predictions, perturbations in the flavonol biosynthesis pathway were detected in cyp78a9, cyp78a8 cyp78a9, and empty siliques (es1-D) mutants. However, it appeared that they do not cause the observed phenotypes. In summary, these results add new insights into the role of CYP78A9 in plant reproduction and present, to our knowledge, the first characterization of metabolite differences between mutants in this gene family.
