Elucidating the effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on the photosynthetic capacity of plants is critical to understand forest growth and conservation under global change. However, studies on this topic generally consider only understory N addition, which ignores the effect of canopy interception. In this study, we conducted a field experiment in a subtropical forest to compare the effects of canopy vs. understory N addition on the photosynthetic rate of canopy and understory species. We found that canopy N addition enhanced the photosynthetic rate of canopy species by increasing leaf hydraulic conductivity and shortening the distance of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation. In contrast, understory N addition had non-significant effects on the photosynthetic rate of canopy species. Moreover, the photosynthetic rate of understory species was not affected by canopy or understory N addition. Interestingly, changes in hydraulic conductivity contributed more to accelerating the photosynthetic rate than changes in CO<sub>2</sub> transport distance. Our results provide important insights into the dissimilar effects of canopy and understory N addition on the photosynthetic rates of species in subtropical forests. Based on our findings, we highlighted the urgent need to consider canopy processes in future studies on N deposition.
