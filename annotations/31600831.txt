Choline may affect salt tolerance by regulating lipid and glycine betaine (GB) metabolism. This study was conducted to determine whether alteration of lipid profiles and GB metabolism may contribute to choline regulation and genotypic variations in salt tolerance in a halophytic grass, seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum). Plants of Adalayd and Sea Isle 2000 were subjected to salt stress (200-mM NaCl) with or without foliar application of choline chloride (1 mM). Genotypic variations in salt tolerance and promotive effects of choline application on salt tolerance were associated with both the up-regulation of lipid metabolism and GB synthesis. The genotypic variations in salt tolerance associated with lipid metabolism were reflected by the differential accumulation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine between Adalayd and Sea Isle 2000. Choline-induced salt tolerance was associated with of the increase in digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG) content including DGDG (36:4 and 36:6) in both cultivars of seashore paspalum and enhanced synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (34:2, 36:5, and 36:2) and phosphatidic acid (34:2, 34:1, and 36:5), as well as increases in the ratio of digalactosyl diacylglycerol: monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG:MGDG) in salt-tolerant Sea Isle 2000. Choline regulation of salt tolerance may be due to the alteration in lipid metabolism in this halophytic grass species.
