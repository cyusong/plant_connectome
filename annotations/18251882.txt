WRKY genes encode proteins belonging to a large family of transcription factors that are involved in various developmental and physiological processes and in plant responses to pathogen infections. In the present work, a full-length cDNA from a Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon grape berry library was isolated and characterized. The cDNA, designated VvWRKY2, encodes a polypeptide of 536 amino acids that shows the structural features of group I of WRKY protein family. VvWRKY2 is expressed in the different organs of healthy grapevine plants. In leaves, VvWRKY2 is induced by wounding and after infection with Plasmopara viticola. Constitutive expression of VvWRKY2 in tobacco reduced the susceptibility of transgenic tobacco to three types of fungal pathogens infecting different parts of the plant: Botrytis cinerea (leaves), Pythium spp. (roots) and Alternaria tenuis (seeds). The results indicate that VvWRKY2 may be involved in the resistance of grapevine against the pathogens.
