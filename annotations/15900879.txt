This paper reports the detection and identification of phenolic metabolites (C6-C3 and C6-C1 compounds) in Cocos nucifera. An HPLC/UV system was used to analyze the soluble and wall-associated phenolics in mesocarp and leaf tissues of C. nucifera. Alkaline hydrolysis of the cell wall material of the mesocarpic and leaf tissues yielded 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as the major phenolic compound. Other phenolic acids identified were ferulic acid, 4-coumaric acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and vanillic acid. No significant qualitative differences in composition were observed between leaf and mesocarp, but there were quantitative variations in the metabolite levels.
