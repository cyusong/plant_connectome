The growth, survival, and productivity of plants are constantly challenged by diverse abiotic stresses. When plants are exposed to stress for the first time, they can capture molecular information and store it as a form of memory, which enables them to competently and rapidly respond to subsequent stress(es). This process is referred to as a priming-induced or acquired stress response. In this review, we discuss how (i) the storage and retrieval of the information from stress memory modulates plant physiological, cellular, and molecular processes in response to subsequent stress(es), (ii) the intensity, recurrence, and duration of priming stimuli influences the outcomes of the stress response, and (iii) the varying responses at different plant developmental stages. We highlight current understanding of the distinct and common molecular processes manifested at the epigenetic, (post-)transcriptional, and post-translational levels mediated by stress-associated molecules and metabolites, including phytohormones. We conclude by emphasizing how unravelling the molecular circuitry underlying diverse priming-stimuli-induced stress responses could propel the use of priming as a management practice for crop plants. This practice, in combination with precision agriculture, could aid in increasing yield quantity and quality to meet the rapidly rising demand for food.
