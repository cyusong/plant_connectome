The blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (syn. <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i>) is a destructive plant pathogen that can infect about 50 species of both wild and cultivated grasses, including important crops such as rice and wheat. <i>M. oryzae</i> is composed of genetically differentiated lineages that tend to infect specific host genera. To date, most studies of <i>M. oryzae</i> effectors have focused on the rice-infecting lineage. We describe a clone resource of 195 effectors of <i>Magnaporthe</i> species predicted from all the major host-specific lineages. These clones are freely available as Golden Gate-compatible entry plasmids. Our aim is to provide the community with an open source effector clone library to be used in a variety of functional studies. We hope that this resource will encourage studies of <i>M. oryzae</i> effectors on diverse host species.
