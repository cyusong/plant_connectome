Cell-to-cell communication is essential for the development and patterning of multicellular organisms. In plants, plasmodesmata (PD) provide direct routes for intercellular signaling. However, the role that PD-mediated signaling plays in plant development has not been fully investigated. To gain a comprehensive view of the role that symplastic signaling plays in Arabidopsis thaliana, we have taken advantage of a synthetic allele of CALLOSE SYNTHASE3 (icals3m) that inducibly disrupts cell-to-cell communication specifically at PD. Our results show that loss of symplastic signaling to and from the endodermis has very significant effects on the root, including an increase in the number of cell layers in the root and a misspecification of stele cells, as well as ground tissue. Surprisingly, loss of endodermal signaling also results in a loss of anisotropic elongation in all cells within the root, similar to what is seen in radially swollen mutants. Our results suggest that symplastic signals to and from the endodermis are critical in the coordinated growth and development of the root.
