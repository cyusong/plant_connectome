['16028112', 'The Aurora kinase family is a well-characterized serine/threonine protein kinase  family that regulates different processes of mitotic events. Although functions  of animal and yeast Aurora kinases have been analyzed, plant aurora kinases were  not identified and characterized. We identified three Aurora kinase orthologs in  Arabidopsis thaliana and designated these as AtAUR1, AtAUR2, and AtAUR3. These  AtAURs could phosphorylate serine 10 in histone H3, in vitro. Dynamic analyses of  GFP-fused AtAUR proteins revealed that AtAUR1 and AtAUR2 localized at the nuclear  membrane in interphase and located in mitotic spindles during cell division.  AtAUR1 also localized in the cell plates. AtAUR3 showed dot-like distribution on  condensed chromosomes at prophase and then localized at the metaphase plate. At  late anaphase, AtAUR3 is evenly localized on chromosomes. The localization of  AtAUR3 during mitosis is very similar to that of phosphorylated histone H3.  Interestingly, an overexpression of AtAUR3 induces disassembly of spindle  microtubules and alteration of orientation of cell division. Our results indicate  that plant Aurora kinases have different characters from that of Aurora kinases  of other eukaryotes.', '2005 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-3454-x', 'Fukui']
