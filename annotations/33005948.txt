Flowering is an important trait in Chinese cabbage, because premature flowering reduces yield and quality of the harvested products. Water deficit, caused by drought or other environmental conditions, induces early flowering. Drought resistance involves global reprogramming of transcription, hormone signaling, and chromatin modification. We show that a histone H4 protein, BrHIS4.A04, physically interacts with a homeodomain protein BrVIN3.1, which was selected during the domestication of late-bolting Chinese cabbage. Over-expression of BrHIS4.A04 resulted in premature flowering under normal growth conditions, but prevented further premature bolting in response to drought. We show that the expression of key abscisic acid (ABA) signaling genes, and also photoperiodic flowering genes was attenuated in BrHIS4.A04-overexpressing (BrHIS4.A04OE) plants under drought conditions. Furthermore, the relative change in H4-acetylation at these gene loci was reduced in BrHIS4.A04OE plants. We suggest that BrHIS4.A04 prevents premature bolting by attenuating the expression of photoperiodic flowering genes under drought conditions, through the ABA signaling pathway. Since BrHIS4.A04OE plants displayed no phenotype related to vegetative or reproductive development under laboratory-induced drought conditions, our findings contribute to the potential fine-tuning of flowering time in crops through genetic engineering without any growth penalty, although more data are necessary under field drought conditions.
