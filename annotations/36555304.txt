Scientists all over the world conduct research to determine the influence of <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. on various groups of plants, mostly crops. However, there is little information on the influence of these fungi on ornamental plants. Therefore, the authors of this study analyzed the influence of <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. on the growth, flowering, quality, and nutritional status of ornamental plants. The research showed that <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. in this group of plants stimulate the elongation and thickening of shoots and the formation of leaves. These fungi also stimulate or inhibit leaf elongation. They also accelerate the flowering of plants, stimulate the elongation of inflorescence shoots and inflorescences, and the development of flowers. Apart from that, <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. positively influence the content of chlorophyll and carotenoids in leaves, and they stimulate the uptake of micro- and macroelements.
