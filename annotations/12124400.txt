['12124400', 'Agrobacterium is a unique model system as well as a major biotechnological tool  for genetic manipulation of plant cells. It is still unknown, however, whether  host cellular factors exist that are limiting for infection, and whether their  overexpression in plant cells can increase the efficiency of the infection. Here,  we examined the effect of overexpression in tobacco plants of an Arabidopsis  gene, VIP1, which encodes a recently discovered cellular protein required for  Agrobacterium infection. Our results indicate that VIP1 is imported into the  plant cell nucleus via the karyopherin alphadependent pathway and that elevated  intracellular levels of VIP1 render the host plants significantly more  susceptible to transient and stable genetic transformation by Agrobacterium,  probably because of the increased nuclear import of the transferred-DNA.', '2002 Aug 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.162304099', 'Citovsky']
