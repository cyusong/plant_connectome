A cDNA encoding the catalytic site of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) was isolated from Coffea arabica suspension cells. The cDNA (designated CaPLC) encodes a polypeptide of 308 amino acids, containing the catalytic X and Y domains, and has 99% identity to the soybean gene. Recombinant CaPLC protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to produce a polyclonal antibody. The peptide has a molecular mass of 27 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analyses. Immunoblots revealed the presence of PLC-like proteins in the tissues of different plant species.
