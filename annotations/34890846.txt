Drought is one of the major environmental constraints affecting crop productivity. Plants have to adjust their developmental and physiological processes to cope with drought. We previously identified 18 cassava serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins that had a pivotal role in alternative splicing in response to environmental stress. However, functional characterization of SR proteins is rarely explored. Here, we characterized the RSZ subfamily gene MeRSZ21b in cassava. The RSZ21b belongs to the RSZ subfamily, which was widely distributed in major crops and was highly conserved. Quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the expression of MeRSZ21b was significantly induced by drought. Moreover, overexpression of MeRSZ21b in Arabidopsis was hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in the phases of seed germination and post-germination seedling growth. Meantime, MeRSZ21b overexpression lines were resistant to sorbitol treatment, and quickly closed the stomata when compared with Col-0 under drought condition. Importantly, overexpression of MeRSZ21b resulted in improved drought tolerance through modulating ABA-dependent signaling. Therefore, our findings refine our knowledge of the SR protein-coding genes and provide novel insights for enhancing plant resistance to environmental stress.
