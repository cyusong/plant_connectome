MYB transcription factors are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and play key roles in regulatory networks governing plant metabolism and biochemical and physiological processes. Here, we first determined the R2R3-MYB genes in five Euphorbiaceae genomes. The three Trp (W) residues from the first MYB domain (R2) were absolutely conserved, whereas the first W residue from the second MYB domain (R3) was preferentially mutated. The R2R3-MYBs were clustered into 48 functional subfamilies, of which 34 had both R2R3-MYBs of Euphorbiaceae species and AtMYBs, and four contained only Euphorbiaceae R2R3-MYBs. The whole-genome duplication (WGD) and/or segmental duplication (SD) played key roles in the expansion of the R2R3-MYB family. Unlike paralogous R2R3-MYB family members, orthologous R2R3-MYB members contained a higher selective pressure and were subject to a constrained evolutionary rate. VfMYB36 was specifically expressed in fruit, and its trend was consistent with the change in oil content, indicating that it might be involved in oil biosynthesis. Overexpression experiments showed that VfMYB36 could significantly provide linolenic acid (C18:3) content, which eventually led to a significant increase in oil content. Our study first provides insight into understanding the evolution and expression of R2R3-MYBs in Euphorbiaceae species, and also provides a target for the production of biomass diesel and a convenient way for breeding germplasm resources with high linolenic acid content in the future.
