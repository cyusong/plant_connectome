Glucosinolates are secondary defense metabolites produced by plants of the order Brassicales, which includes the model species Arabidopsis and many crop species. In the past 13 years, the regulation of glucosinolate synthesis in plants has been intensively studied, with recent research revealing complex molecular mechanisms that connect glucosinolate production with responses to other central pathways. In this review, we discuss how the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis is ecologically relevant for plants, how it is controlled by transcription factors, and how this transcriptional machinery interacts with hormonal, environmental, and epigenetic mechanisms. We present the central players in glucosinolate regulation, MYB and basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, as well as the plant hormone jasmonate, which together with other hormones and environmental signals allow the coordinated and rapid regulation of glucosinolate genes. Furthermore, we highlight the regulatory connections between glucosinolates, auxin, and sulfur metabolism and discuss emerging insights and open questions on the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis.
