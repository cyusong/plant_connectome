During plant development and in response to fluctuating environmental conditions, large changes in leaf assimilation capacity and in the metabolic consumption of ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic apparatus can occur. To minimize cytotoxic side reactions, such as the production of reactive oxygen species, photosynthetic electron transport needs to be adjusted to the metabolic demand. The cytochrome b6f complex and chloroplast ATP synthase form the predominant sites of photosynthetic flux control. Accordingly, both respond strongly to changing environmental conditions and metabolic states. Usually, their contents are strictly co-regulated. Thereby, the capacity for proton influx into the lumen, which is controlled by electron flux through the cytochrome b6f complex, is balanced with proton efflux through ATP synthase, which drives ATP synthesis. We discuss the environmental, systemic, and metabolic signals triggering the stoichiometry adjustments of ATP synthase and the cytochrome b6f complex. The contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of subunit synthesis, and the importance of auxiliary proteins required for complex assembly in achieving the stoichiometry adjustments is described. Finally, current knowledge on the stability and turnover of both complexes is summarized.
