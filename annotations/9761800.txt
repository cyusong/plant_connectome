['9761800', 'Post-transcriptional gene silencing (cosuppression) results in the degradation of  RNA after transcription. A transgenic Arabidopsis line showing  post-transcriptional silencing of a 35S-uidA transgene and uidA-specific  methylation was mutagenized using ethyl methanesulfonate. Six independent plants  were isolated in which uidA mRNA accumulation and beta-glucuronidase activity  were increased up to 3500-fold, whereas the transcription rate of the 35S-uidA  transgene was increased only up to threefold. These plants each carried a  recessive monogenic mutation that is responsible for the release of silencing.  These mutations defined two genetic loci, called sgs1 and sgs2 (for suppressor of  gene silencing). Transgene methylation was distinctly modified in sgs1 and sgs2  mutants. However, methylation of centromeric repeats was not affected, indicating  that sgs mutants differ from ddm (for decrease in DNA methylation) and som (for  somniferous) mutants. Indeed, unlike ddm and som mutations, sgs mutations were  not able to release transcriptional silencing of a 35S-hpt transgene. Conversely,  both sgs1 and sgs2 mutations were able to release cosuppression of host Nia genes  and 35S-Nia2 transgenes. These results therefore indicate that sgs mutations act  in trans to impede specifically transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene  silencing.', '1998 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.10.1747', 'Vaucheret']
