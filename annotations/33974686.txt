Various strategies evolved in plants to adjust the position of organs relative to the prevailing temperature condition, which allows optimal plant growth and performance. Such responses are classically separated into nastic and tropic responses. During plant thermotropic responses, organs move towards (engage) or away (avoid) from a directional temperature cue. Despite thermotropism being a classic botanical concept, the underlying ecological function and molecular and biophysical mechanisms remain poorly understood to this day. This contrasts to the relatively well-studied thermonastic movements (hyponasty) of e.g., rosette leaves. In this review, we provide an update on the current knowledge on plant thermotropisms and propose directions for future research and application.
