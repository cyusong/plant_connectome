Soil salinity is among the major abiotic stresses that plants must cope with, mainly in arid and semiarid regions. The tolerance to high salinity is an important agronomic trait to sustain food production. Quinoa is a halophytic annual pseudo-cereal species with high nutritional value that can secrete salt out of young leaves in external non-glandular cells called epidermal bladder cells (EBC). Previous work showed high salt tolerance, but low EBC density was associated with an improved response in the early phases of salinity stress, mediated by tissue-tolerance traits mainly in roots. We compared the transcript profiling of two quinoa genotypes with contrasting salt tolerance patterning to identify the candidate genes involved in the differentially early response among genotypes. The transcriptome profiling, supported by in vitro physiological analyses, provided insights into the early-stage molecular mechanisms, both at the shoot and root level, based on the sensitive/tolerance traits. Results showed the presence of numerous differentially expressed genes among genotypes, tissues, and treatments, with genes involved in hormonal and stress response upregulated mainly in the sensitive genotype, suggesting that tolerance may be correlated to restricted changes in gene expression, at least after a short salt stress. These data, showing constitutive differences between the two genotypes, represent a solid basis for further studies to characterize the salt tolerance traits. Additionally, new information provided by this work might be useful for the development of plant breeding or genome engineering programs in quinoa.
