['21861936', 'BACKGROUND: The ACT domain, named after bacterial aspartate kinase, chorismate  mutase and TyrA (prephenate dehydrogenase), is a regulatory domain that serves as  an amino acid-binding site in feedback-regulated amino acid metabolic enzymes. We  have previously identified a novel type of ACT domain-containing protein family,  the ACT domain repeat (ACR) protein family, in Arabidopsis. Members of the ACR  family, ACR1 to ACR8, contain four copies of the ACT domain that extend  throughout the entire polypeptide. Here, we describe the identification of four  novel ACT domain-containing proteins, namely ACR9 to ACR12, in Arabidopsis. The  ACR9 and ACR10 proteins contain three copies of the ACT domain, whereas the ACR11  and ACR12 proteins have a putative transit peptide followed by two copies of the  ACT domain. The functions of these plant ACR proteins are largely unknown.  RESULTS: The ACR11 and ACR12 proteins are predicted to target to chloroplasts. We  used protoplast transient expression assay to demonstrate that the Arabidopsis  ACR11- and ACR12-green fluorescent fusion proteins are localized to the  chloroplast. Analysis of an ACR11 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion in  transgenic Arabidopsis revealed that the GUS activity was mainly detected in  mature leaves and sepals. Interestingly, coexpression analysis revealed that the  GLN2, which encodes a chloroplastic glutamine synthetase, has the highest mutual  rank in the coexpressed gene network connected to ACR11. We used RNA gel blot  analysis to confirm that the expression pattern of ACR11 is similar to that of  GLN2 in various organs from 6-week-old Arabidopsis. Moreover, the expression of  ACR11 and GLN2 is highly co-regulated by sucrose and light/dark treatments in  2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the  identification of four novel ACT domain repeat proteins, ACR9 to ACR12, in  Arabidopsis. The ACR11 and ACR12 proteins are localized to the chloroplast, and  the expression of ACR11 and GLN2 is highly coordinated. These results suggest  that the ACR11 and GLN2 genes may belong to the same functional module. The  Arabidopsis ACR11 protein may function as a regulatory protein that is related to  glutamine metabolism or signaling in the chloroplast.', '2011 Aug 24', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-11-118', 'Hsieh']
