['31009161', 'The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a major site for sorting of cargo to either the  vacuole or apoplast. The TGN-localized coiled-coil protein TNO1 is a putative  tethering factor that interacts with the TGN t-SNARE SYP41 and is required for  correct localization of the SYP61 t-SNARE. An Arabidopsis thaliana tno1 mutant is  hypersensitive to salt stress and partially mislocalizes vacuolar proteins to the  apoplast, indicating a role in vacuolar trafficking. Here, we show that  overexpression of SYP41 or SYP61 significantly increases SYP41-SYP61 complex  formation in a tno1 mutant, and rescues the salt sensitivity and defective  vacuolar trafficking of the tno1 mutant. The TGN is disrupted and vesicle budding  from Golgi cisternae is reduced in the tno1 mutant, and these defects are also  rescued by overexpression of SYP41 or SYP61. Our results suggest that the  trafficking and Golgi morphology defects caused by loss of TNO1 can be rescued by  increasing SYP41-SYP61 t-SNARE complex formation, implicating TNO1 as a tethering  factor mediating efficient vesicle fusion at the TGN.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14353', 'Bassham']
