['22965746', 'Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf life history, and it can be regulated  by multiple internal and external cues. La-related proteins (LARPs), which  contain a well-conserved La motif (LAM) domain and normally a canonical RNA  recognition motif (RRM) or noncanonical RRM-like motif, are widely present in  eukaryotes. Six LARP genes (LARP1a-1c and LARP6a-6c) are present in Arabidopsis,  but their biological functions have not been studied previously. In this study,  we investigated the biological roles of LARP1c from the LARP1 family.  Constitutive or inducible overexpression of LARP1c caused premature leaf  senescence. Expression levels of several senescence-associated genes and  defense-related genes were elevated upon overexpression of LARP1c. The LARP1c  null mutant 1c-1 impaired ABA-, SA-, and MeJA-induced leaf senescence in detached  leaves. Gene expression profiles of LARP1c showed age-dependent expression in  rosette leaves. Taken together, our results suggest LARP1c is involved in  regulation of leaf senescence.', '2012 Oct', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-012-0111-5', 'Han']
