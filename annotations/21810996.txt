['21810996', 'Chloroplasts must divide repeatedly to maintain their population during plant  growth and development. A number of proteins required for chloroplast division  have been identified, and the functional relationships between them are beginning  to be elucidated. In both chloroplasts and bacteria, the future site of division  is specified by placement of the Filamentous temperature sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring,  and the Min system serves to restrict FtsZ ring formation to mid-chloroplast or  mid-cell. How the Min system is regulated in response to environmental and  developmental factors is largely unstudied. Here, we investigated the role in  chloroplast division played by two Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of the bacterial  mechanosensitive (MS) channel MscS: MscS-Like 2 (MSL2) and MSL3.  Immunofluorescence microscopy and live imaging approaches demonstrated that msl2  msl3 double mutants have enlarged chloroplasts containing multiple FtsZ rings.  Genetic analyses indicate that MSL2, MSL3, and components of the Min system  function in the same pathway to regulate chloroplast size and FtsZ ring  formation. In addition, an Escherichia coli strain lacking MS channels also  showed aberrant FtsZ ring assembly. These results establish MS channels as  components of the chloroplast division machinery and suggest that their role is  evolutionarily conserved.', '2011 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.088112', 'Haswell']
