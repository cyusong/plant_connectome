Aphids, the phloem sap feeders, probe into leaf tissues and activate a complex network of plant defense responses. Phytohormonal signaling plays a major role in this network; however, the dynamics of the signal spreading is yet to be clarified. Despite the growing knowledge about transcriptomic changes upon infestation, results often differ due to sampling, varying strongly between the tissues collected at the single feeding site, individual leaves, pooled infested leaves, or whole plant rosettes. This study focuses on activation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves during infestation by cabbage aphid (<i>Brevicoryne brassicae</i>) in high spatio-temporal resolution. We used genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, histochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to precisely map activation of distinct branches of phytohormonal signaling. We found a rapid induction of SA and JA signaling markers in cells surrounding stylet puncture, colocalizing with callose deposition. For both <i>PR1</i> and <i>JAZ10</i>, we detected activation at 24 h postinfestation (hpi), increasing and spreading along the veins until 72 hpi and, to a lesser extent, within the epidermal pavement cells. The SA signaling wave appeared in parallel with JA-associated signaling and continued to increase in time. Our results first show a local activation of SA- and JA-related responses after stylet penetration of <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves and bring a detailed insight into the spatio-temporal complexity of plant defense activation during specialist aphid attack.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
