The architecture of the plant cell wall is highly dynamic, being substantially re-modeled during growth and development. Cell walls determine the size and shape of cells and contribute to the functional specialization of tissues and organs. Beyond the physiological dynamics, the wall structure undergoes changes upon biotic or abiotic stresses. In this review several cell wall traits, mainly related to pectin, one of the major matrix components, will be discussed in relation to plant development, immunity and industrial bioconversion of biomass, especially for energy production. Plant cell walls are a source of oligosaccharide fragments with a signaling function for both development and immunity. Sensing cell wall damage, sometimes through the perception of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), is crucial for some developmental and immunity responses. Methodological advances that are expected to deepen our knowledge of cell wall (CW) biology will also be presented.
