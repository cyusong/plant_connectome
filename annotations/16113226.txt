['16113226', 'In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), light-dependent chloroplast movements are  induced by blue light. When exposed to low fluence rates of light, chloroplasts  accumulate in periclinal layers perpendicular to the direction of light,  presumably to optimize light absorption by exposing more chloroplast area to the  light. Under high light conditions, chloroplasts become positioned parallel to  the incoming light in a response that can reduce exposure to light intensities  that may damage the photosynthetic machinery. To identify components of the  pathway downstream of the photoreceptors that mediate chloroplast movements (i.e.  phototropins), we conducted a mutant screen that has led to the isolation of  several Arabidopsis mutants displaying altered chloroplast movements. The plastid  movement impaired1 (pmi1) mutant exhibits severely attenuated chloroplast  movements under all tested fluence rates of light, suggesting that it is a  necessary component for both the low- and high-light-dependant chloroplast  movement responses. Analysis of pmi1 leaf cross sections revealed that regardless  of the light condition, chloroplasts are more evenly distributed in leaf  mesophyll cells than in the wild type. The pmi1-1 mutant was found to contain a  single nonsense mutation within the open reading frame of At1g42550. This gene  encodes a plant-specific protein of unknown function that appears to be conserved  among angiosperms. Sequence analysis of the protein suggests that it may be  involved in calcium-mediated signal transduction, possibly through  protein-protein interactions.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.061887', 'Hangarter']
