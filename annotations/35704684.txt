Oligogalacturonide (OG)-oxidase 1 (OGOX1) and cellodextrin (CD)-oxidase (CELLOX) are plant berberine bridge enzyme-like oligosaccharide oxidases that oxidize OGs and CDs, cell-wall fragments with the nature of damage-associated molecular patterns. The oxidation of OGs and CDs attenuates their elicitor activity and concomitantly releases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. By using a multiple enzyme-based assay, we demonstrate that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated downstream of the combined action between a fungal polygalacturonase and OGOX1 or an endoglucanase and CELLOX can be directed by plant peroxidases (PODs) either towards a reaction possibly involved in plant defense, such as the oxidation of monolignol or a reaction possibly involved in a developmental event, such as the oxidation of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid), pointing to OGOX1 and CELLOX as enzymatic transducers between microbial glycoside hydrolases and plant PODs.
