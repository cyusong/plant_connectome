Phyllotaxis, the spatio-temporal pattern of organogenesis at the shoot apical meristem, emerges in large part from inhibitory fields consisting in auxin-depleted areas centered on organs. We recently demonstrated the existence of an additional hormone-based inhibitory field generated by Arabidopsis Histidine Phosphotransfer Protein 6 (AHP6), an inhibitor of cytokinin signaling. We have shown that the spatio-temporal distribution of AHP6 in the meristem is essential for optimizing the rhythmicity of organ initiation. Here, we further analyzed AHP6 expression using fluorescent whole mount mRNA in situ hybridization and demonstrate a precise control of AHP6 level and expression domain over time. While we previously showed a regulation of AHP6 directly downstream of auxin, we show here that AHP6 transcription is unlikely influenced by cytokinin distribution in the meristem. Finally, we provide evidence that cytokinins and auxin might act synergistically during organ initiation, providing a plausible explanation for how AHP6 regulates phyllotaxis.
