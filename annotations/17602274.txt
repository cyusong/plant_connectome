['17602274', 'In this work, we analyzed the developmental anatomy of cotyledons and leaves in  the has mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana. It is a recessive T-DNA insertion  mutation that causes changes in the size, shape, and tissue organization of the  cotyledons and leaves of has plants. Analysis of has cotyledons revealed a  prominent decrease in the cell number and an increase in the area of cotyledon  cells and intercellular spaces of has plants. At early stages of development, has  leaves are fingerlike structures, but later they develop small, lobed blades with  rare trichomes. An important characteristic of the mutant leaf anatomy is the  absence of mesophyll tissue differentiation. In addition, both cotyledons and  leaves display a disrupted pattern of vascular bundles. Furthermore, mutant  plants are defective in root and shoot morphology, indicating that the has  mutation affects a number of aspects in plant development.', '2007', 'Protoplasma', '10.1007/s00709-007-0246-y', 'Budimir']
