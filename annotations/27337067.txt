The functional role of an uncharacterized tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) aldo-keto reductase 4B, denoted as SlAKR4B, was investigated. The gene expression of tomato SlAKR4B was detected at a high level in the senescent leaves and the ripening fruits of tomato. Although d-galacturonic acid reductase activities tended to be higher in tomato SlAKR4B-overexpressing transgenic tobacco BY-2 cell lines than those in control cell lines, SlAKR4B gene expression was not well correlated with l-ascorbic acid content among the cell lines. The analysis of the transgenic cell lines showed that tomato SlAKR4B has enzyme activities toward d-galacturonic acid as well as glyceraldehyde and glyoxal, suggesting that the SlAKR4B gene encodes a functional enzyme in tomato. Gene expression of SlAKR4B was induced by NaCl, H2O2, and plant hormones such as salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, suggesting that SlAKR4B is involved in the stress response. The transient expression assay using protoplasts showed the promoter activity of the SlAKR4B gene was as high as that of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Also, the promoter region of the SlAKR4B gene was suggested to contain cis-element(s) for abiotic stress-inducible expression.
