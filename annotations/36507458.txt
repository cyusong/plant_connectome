Histone deacetylase 2 (HD2) is a unique family of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in plants. Despite evidence that certain HD2 family HDACs play an important role in plant growth and stress response, the coordination of HD2s in these processes remains largely unknown. We found that HD2-type, HD2A and HD2C coordinate to play a role in drought stress response in Arabidopsis. We showed that the <i>hd2a</i>.<i>hd2c</i> double mutant (Mac16) exhibit decreased drought survival and increased water loss as compared to the single mutants, <i>hd2a</i> and <i>hd2c</i>. Gene expression analysis showed that the <i>ABI1</i> and <i>ABI2</i> genes were upregulated and <i>SLAC1</i> was downregulated which led to the modified stomatal functioning in the Mac16 as compared to the single mutants. Overexpression of <i>HD2A</i> and <i>HD2C</i> showed enhanced drought survival and decreased water loss. We also showed that the <i>GA2ox1</i> and <i>GA2ox2</i> genes, which are involved in the catabolism of bioactive gibberellic acids, were upregulated in the Mac16 as compared to the single mutants, which led to a decreased root growth in the Mac16. Furthermore, we showed that HD2A and HD2C can physically interact and increased genome-wide H3K9 acetylation was observed in the Mac16, compared to the single mutants. Overall, our investigation revealed that HD2A and HD2C coordinate to play a cumulative role in drought stress response and root growth in Arabidopsis.
