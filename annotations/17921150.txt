Hairy root cultures of a model legume, Lotus japonicus, were established to characterize two heterologous cDNAs encoding enzymes involved in isoflavone biosynthesis, i.e. licorice 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase (IFS) and soybean 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID) catalyzing sequential reactions to yield isoflavones. While the control and the IFS overexpressor did not accumulate detectable isoflavones, the HID overexpressors did accumulate daidzein and genistein, showing that HID is a critical determinant of isoflavone productivity. Production of coumestrol in all the genotypes and isoliquiritigenin/liquiritigenin in IFS + HID-overexpressing lines was also noted. These results provide insight into the regulatory mechanism that controls isoflavonoid biosynthesis.

IFS: !catalyzes! 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase
HID: !catalyzes! 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase
HID: !determines! isoflavone productivity
IFS + HID: !produce! coumestrol
IFS + HID: !produce! isoliquiritigenin/liquiritigenin
