Plants often simultaneously experience combined stresses rather than a single stress, causing more serious damage, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we identified the stress-induced IbNAC3 from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) as a nucleus-localized transcription activator. IbNAC3 contains a unique activation domain whose MKD sequence confers transactivation activities to multiple other TFs and is essential for the activated expression of downstream target genes. Ectopic expression of IbNAC3 conferred tolerance to single and combined salt and drought stresses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and a group of NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC) TFs, including ANAC011, ANAC072, ANAC083, ANAC100, and NAP, interacted with IbNAC3, and the specific domains responsible for each interaction varied. Intriguingly, IbNAC3 repressed the interaction among the five NACs, and knockout or mutation of ANAC011 and ANAC072 dramatically impaired combined stress tolerance. IbNAC3-ANAC072 and IbNAC3-NAP modules synergistically activated the MICROTUBULE-RELATED E3 LIGASE57 (MREL57) gene. Consistently, mutation of MREL57 and overexpression of WAVE-DAM-PENED2-LIKE7, encoding a target protein of MREL57, both remarkably impaired combined stress tolerance. Moreover, transgenic plants displayed abscisic acid (ABA) hyposensitivity by directly promoting the transcription of ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA 1, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling. The data unravel the unique IbNAC3 TF functions as a pivotal component in combined stress tolerance by integrating multiple regulatory events and ubiquitin pathways, which is essential for developing high-tolerant plants in natural environments.
