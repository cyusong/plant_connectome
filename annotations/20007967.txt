['20007967', 'The post-translational conjugation of small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs)  to other proteins is involved in regulation of many processes in eukaryotic  development; although its role in plant development is beginning to be dissected.  Previously, we demonstrated that the siz1 mutant, which is impaired in SUMO E3  ligase, showed a dwarf-like shoot phenotype with accumulation of salicylic acid  (SA), and the expression of nahG, a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase that  catabolizes SA, in siz1 reduced the SA level and suppressed dwarfism. Herein, we  provide evidence that the SIZ1 gene controls cell division and elongation through  regulation of the SA level. Mature siz1-2 and siz1-3 plants exhibited a  dwarf-like shoot phenotype that is attributable to decreased leaf cell volume and  number relative to the wild type. Cell division and expansion defects caused by  siz1 were also suppressed by the expression of nahG. Expression of XTH8 and  XTH31, encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase, which are thought to  facilitate leaf cell expansion, was down-regulated in siz1 leaves. However,  reduced XTH8 and XTH31 expression in siz1 plants was restored in nahG siz1-2  plants. These results indicate that SIZ1 regulates cell growth and plant  development with regulation of SA accumulation. Also, XTH8 and XTH31 genes may be  responsible for reduced leaf cell expansion.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcp171', 'Hasegawa']
