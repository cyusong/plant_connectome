Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) yield is highly sensitive to N fertilization, the excessive use of which is responsible for environmental and human health damage. Lowering N input together with the selection of improved Nitrogen-Use-Efficiency (NUE) genotypes, more able to uptake, utilize, and remobilize N available in soils, can be challenging to maintain high crop yields in a sustainable agriculture. The aim of this study was to explore the natural variation among eggplant accessions from different origins, in response to Low (LN) and High (HN) Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ) supply, to identify NUE-contrasting genotypes and their NUE-related traits, in hydroponic and greenhouse pot experiments. Two eggplants, AM222 and AM22, were identified as N-use efficient and inefficient, respectively, in hydroponic, and these results were confirmed in a pot experiment, when crop yield was also evaluated. Overall, our results indicated the key role of N-utilization component (NUtE) to confer high NUE. The remobilization of N from leaves to fruits may be a strategy to enhance NUtE, suggesting glutamate synthase as a key enzyme. Further, omics technologies will be used for focusing on C-N metabolism interacting networks. The availability of RILs from two other selected NUE-contrasting genotypes will allow us to detect major genes/quantitative trait loci related to NUE.
