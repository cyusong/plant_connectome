Vegetative development constitutes a critical phase in plant development, and it is regulated by an evolutionarily conserved miR156-SPL pathway. Previous studies have shown that miR159 acts to prevent the hyperactivation of miR156 to regulate the timing of vegetative phase change in Arabidopsis. However, whether miR159 integrates into the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway to control vegetative phase change remains unexplored, since miR159 also plays an important regulatory role in ABA response. Here, we show that the expression of ABI5 (ABA INSENSITIVE5), a crucial regulator in the ABA signaling pathway, is significantly elevated in the loss-of-function mutant of miR159 (mir159ab). Loss of function in ABI5 (abi5) promotes juvenile-to-adult transition, whereas overexpression of ABI5 delays this transition under short-day conditions. Genetic analyses indicated that the effect of mir159ab on vegetative phase change is ABI5 dependent. Further analysis confirmed that MYB33, a major target of miR159, promotes the transcription of ABI5 by directly binding to its promoter. ABI5 functions upstream of miR156 to promote juvenile development by affecting the expression of genes in the miR156-SPL pathway. Therefore, our study uncovers a new role of ABI5 in vegetative development in plants, and implies a role of ABA signaling in vegetative development in Arabidopsis.
