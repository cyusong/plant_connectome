['24117441', 'The Abc1 protein kinases are a large family of functionally diverse proteins with  multiple roles in the regulation of respiration and oxidative stress tolerance. A  functional characterization was carried out for AtSIA1, an Arabidopsis thaliana  Abc1-like protein, focusing on its potential redundancy with its homolog AtOSA1.  Both proteins are located within chloroplasts, even if a different subplastidial  localization seems probable. The comparison of atsia1 and atosa1 mutants,  atsia1/atosa1 double mutant and wild-type plants revealed a reduction in  plastidial iron-containing proteins of the Cytb6 f complex in the mutants. Iron  uptake from soil is not hampered in mutant lines, suggesting that AtSIA1 and  AtOSA1 affect iron distribution within the chloroplast. Mutants accumulated more  ferritin and superoxide, and showed reduced tolerance to reactive oxygen species  (ROS), potentially indicating a basal role in oxidative stress. The mutants  produced higher concentrations of plastochromanol and plastoquinones than  wild-type plants, but only atsia1 plants developed larger plastoglobules and  contained higher concentrations of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol and VTE1. Taken together,  these data suggest that AtSIA1 and AtOSA1 probably act in signaling pathways that  influence responses to ROS production and oxidative stress.', '2014 Jan', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.12533', 'Furini']
