Pastures based on perennial monocotyledonous plants are the principal source of nutrition for ruminant livestock in tropical and subtropical areas across the globe. The <i>Urochloa</i> genus comprises important species used in pastures, and these mainly include <i>Urochloa brizantha</i>, <i>Urochloa decumbens</i>, <i>Urochloa humidicola</i>, and <i>Urochloa ruziziensis</i>. Despite their economic relevance, there is an absence of genomic-level information for these species, and this lack is mainly due to genomic complexity, including polyploidy, high heterozygosity, and genomes with a high repeat content, which hinders advances in molecular approaches to genetic improvement. Next-generation sequencing techniques have enabled the recent release of reference genomes, genetic linkage maps, and transcriptome sequences, and this information helps improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms involved in relevant traits, such as the apomictic reproductive mode. However, more concerted research efforts are still needed to characterize germplasm resources and identify molecular markers and genes associated with target traits. In addition, the implementation of genomic selection and gene editing is needed to reduce the breeding time and expenditure. In this review, we highlight the importance and characteristics of the four main species of <i>Urochloa</i> used in pastures and discuss the current findings from genetic and genomic studies and research gaps that should be addressed in future research.
