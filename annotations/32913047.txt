Tiller angle largely determines plant architecture, which in turn substantially influences crop production by affecting planting density. A recent study revealed that <i>HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR2D</i> (<i>HSFA2D</i>) acts upstream of <i>LAZY1</i> (<i>LA1</i>) to regulate tiller angle establishment in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of <i>HSFA2D</i> remain unknown. In this study, two class II homeodomain-Leu zipper genes, <i>OsHOX1</i> and <i>OsHOX28</i>, were identified as positive regulators of tiller angle by affecting shoot gravitropism. <i>OsHOX1</i> and <i>OsHOX28</i> showed strong transcriptional suppressive activity in rice protoplasts and formed intricate self- and mutual-transcriptional negative feedback loops. Moreover, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 bound to the pseudopalindromic sequence CAAT(C/G)ATTG within the promoter of <i>HSFA2D</i>, thus suppressing its expression. In contrast to <i>HSFA2D</i> and <i>LA1</i>, <i>OsHOX1</i> and <i>OsHOX28</i> attenuated lateral auxin transport, thus repressing the expression of <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 6</i> (<i>WOX6</i>) and <i>WOX11</i> in the lower side of the shoot base of plants subjected to gravistimulation. Genetic analysis further confirmed that <i>OsHOX1</i> and <i>OsHOX28</i> act upstream of <i>HSFA2D</i> Additionally, both <i>OsHOX1</i> and <i>OsHOX28</i> inhibit the expression of multiple <i>OsYUCCA</i> genes and decrease auxin biosynthesis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that <i>OsHOX1</i> and <i>OsHOX28</i> regulate the local distribution of auxin, and thus tiller angle establishment, through suppression of the <i>HSFA2D</i>-<i>LA1</i> pathway and reduction of endogenous auxin content. Our finding increases the knowledge concerning fine tuning of tiller angles to optimize plant architecture in rice.
