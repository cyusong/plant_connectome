Overexpression of a constitutively active truncated form of <i>OsCDPK1</i> (<i>OEtr</i>) in rice produced smaller seeds, but a double-stranded RNA gene-silenced form of <i>OsCDPK1</i> (<i>Ri</i>) yielded larger seeds, suggesting that <i>OsCDPK1</i> plays a functional role in rice seed development. In the study presented here, we propose a model in which <i>OsCDPK1</i> plays key roles in negatively controlling the grain size, amylose content, and endosperm appearance, and also affects the physicochemical properties of the starch. The dehulled transgenic <i>OEtr</i> grains were smaller than the dehulled wild-type grains, and the <i>OEtr</i> endosperm was opaque and had a low amylose content and numerous small loosely packed polyhedral starch granules. However, the <i>OEtr</i> grain sizes and endosperm appearances were not affected by temperature, which ranged from low (22 °C) to high (31 °C) during the grain-filling phase. In contrast, the transgenic <i>Ri</i> grains were larger, had higher amylose content, and had more transparent endosperms filled with tightly packed polyhedral starch granules. This demonstrates that <i>OsCDPK1</i> plays a novel functional role in starch biosynthesis during seed development and affects the transparent appearance of the endosperm. These results improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which the grain-filling process occurs in rice.
