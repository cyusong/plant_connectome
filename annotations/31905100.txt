A successful viral infection requires complex, compatible molecular interactions between the invading virus and the host. A better understanding of such interactions may assist in the development of novel approaches to control viral diseases for sustainable crop production. In the past decade, the cell biology of virus-host and virus-vector interactions has been one of the most exciting areas of research in the molecular plant-microbe field. This is partially attributed to the availability of powerful cell biology techniques, including imaging tools like confocal microscopy and electron microscopy and tomography. As a result, there has been an unprecedented increase in knowledge in the areas of the bi- and tripartite interactions of virus, host, and vector. We now have a much clearer picture of viral virulence mechanisms, virus-induced host defenses, viral counteracting strategies, and viral circulations in the insect vectors. This Focus Issue highlights molecular virus-plant and virus-vector interactions in the areas of cell biology and closely related disciplines and explores biotechnology-based antiviral strategies using knowledge generated from these research areas.
