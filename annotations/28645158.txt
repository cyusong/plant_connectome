Diatoms are a diverse group of unicellular algae that contribute significantly to global photosynthetic carbon fixation and export in the modern ocean, and are an important source of microfossils for paleoclimate reconstructions. Because of their importance in the environment, diatoms have been a focus of study on the physiology and ecophysiology of carbon fixation, in particular their CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) and Rubisco characteristics. While carbon fixation in diatoms is not as well understood as in certain model aquatic photoautotrophs, a greater number of species have been examined in diatoms. Recent work has highlighted a large diversity in the function, physiology, and kinetics of both the CCM and Rubisco between different diatom species. This diversity was unexpected since it has generally been assumed that CCMs and Rubiscos were similar within major algal lineages as the result of selective events deep in evolutionary history, and suggests a more recent co-evolution between the CCM and Rubisco within diatoms. This review explores our current understanding of the diatom CCM and highlights the diversity of both the CCM and Rubisco kinetics. We will suggest possible environmental, physiological, and evolutionary drivers for the co-evolution of the CCM and Rubisco in diatoms.
