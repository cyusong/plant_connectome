Histidine is known to be involved in Ni hyperaccumulation. Recently, histidine-dependent xylem loading of Ni and Zn has been demonstrated in the Zn/Ni/Cd hyperaccumulator, Noccaea caerulescens. Here we tested the hypothesis whether Cd xylem loading is histidine-dependent, too. In contrast to that of Ni and Zn, the xylem loading of Cd was not affected by exogenous histidine. Histidine accumulation in root cells appears to facilitate the radial transport of Ni and Zn, but not Cd, across the roots. This may be due to the relatively high preference of Cd for coordination with sulfur over coordination with nitrogen, in comparison with Ni and Zn.

Histidine: !affects! Ni hyperaccumulation
Histidine: !facilitates! radial transport of Ni and Zn
Cd: !prefers! coordination with sulfur over nitrogen
Histidine: !does not affect! xylem loading of Cd
