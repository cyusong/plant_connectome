In recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in studies addressing the three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization of the plant nucleus. Important advances in chromatin conformation capture (3C)-derived and related techniques have allowed the exploration of the nuclear topology of plants with large and complex genomes, including various crops. In addition, the increase in their resolution has permitted the depiction of chromatin compartmentalization and interactions at the gene scale. These studies have revealed the highly complex mechanisms governing plant nuclear architecture and the remarkable knowledge gaps in this field. Here we discuss the state-of-the-art in plant chromosome architecture, including our knowledge of the hierarchical organization of the genome in 3D space and regarding other nuclear components. Furthermore, we highlight the existence in plants of topologically associated domain (TAD)-like structures that display striking differences from their mammalian counterparts, proposing the concept of ICONS-intergenic condensed spacers. Similarly, we explore recent advances in the study of chromatin loops and R-loops, and their implication in the regulation of gene activity. Finally, we address the impact that polyploidization has had on the chromatin topology of modern crops, and how this is related to phenomena such as subgenome dominance and biased gene retention in these organisms.
