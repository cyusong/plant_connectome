['16832689', 'The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (AtCAD) multigene family in Arabidopsis is  composed of nine genes. Our previous studies focused on the two isoforms AtCAD C  and AtCAD D which show a high homology to those related to lignification in other  plants. This study focuses on the seven other Arabidopsis CAD for which functions  are not yet elucidated. Their expression patterns were determined in different  parts of Arabidopsis. Only CAD 1 protein can be detected in elongating stems,  flowers, and siliques using Western-blot analysis. Tissue specific expression of  CAD 1, B1, and G genes was determined using their promoters fused to the GUS  reporter gene. CAD 1 expression was observed in primary xylem in accordance with  a potential role in lignification. Arabidopsis T-DNA mutants knockout for the  different genes CAD genes were characterized. Their stems displayed no  substantial reduction of CAD activities for coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols as  well as no modifications of lignin quantity and structure in mature inflorescence  stems. Only a small reduction of lignin content could be observed in elongating  stems of Atcad 1 mutant. These CAD genes in combination with the CAD D promoter  were used to complement a CAD double mutant severely altered in lignification  (cad c cad d). The expression of AtCAD A, B1, B2, F, and G had no effect on  restoring a normal lignin profile of this mutant. In contrast, CAD 1 complemented  partly this mutant as revealed by the partial restoration of conventional lignin  units and by the decrease in the frequency of beta-O-4 linked p-OH  cinnamaldehydes.', '2006 Dec', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-006-0326-9', 'Jouanin']
