['31123048', 'Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins bind RNA via a mechanism that facilitates  the customization of sequence specificity. However, natural PPR proteins have  irregular features that limit the degree to which their specificity can be  predicted and customized. We demonstrate here that artificial PPR proteins built  from consensus PPR motifs selectively bind the intended RNA in vivo, and we use  this property to develop a new tool for ribonucleoprotein characterization. We  show by RNA coimmunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) that artificial PPR  proteins designed to bind the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) chloroplast psbA  mRNA bind with high specificity to psbA mRNA in vivo. Analysis of  coimmunoprecipitating proteins by mass spectrometry showed the psbA translational  activator HCF173 and two RNA binding proteins of unknown function (CP33C and  SRRP1) to be highly enriched. RIP-seq revealed that these proteins are bound  primarily to psbA RNA in vivo, and precise mapping of the HCF173 and CP33C  binding sites placed them in different locations on psbA mRNA. These results  demonstrate that artificial PPR proteins can be tailored to bind specific  endogenous RNAs in vivo, add to the toolkit for characterizing native  ribonucleoproteins, and open the door to other applications that rely on the  ability to target a protein to a specified RNA sequence.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00177', 'ORCID:']
