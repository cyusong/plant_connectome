S1Fa-like transcription factors (TFs) are small molecular weight proteins that contain both nuclear localization and DNA binding domains. However, the functions of S1Fa-like TFs are poorly understood. In the present study, we identified the S1Fa-like TFs from the <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> genome, which revealed two S1Fa-like TF genes, <i>PtS1Fa1</i> and <i>PtS1Fa2</i>. <i>PtS1Fa1</i> and <i>PtS1Fa2</i> expression was suppressed by drought and salt stress, and was also significantly altered by ABA, MeJA, or SA treatment. Both PtS1Fa1 and PtS1Fa2 are nuclear proteins. Transgenic <i>P. trichocarpa</i> plants overexpressing <i>PtS1Fa1</i> and <i>PtS1Fa2</i>, respectively, were generated. The plants overexpressing <i>PtS1Fa2</i> showed increased fresh weight, chlorophyll content, and root length and weight compared with those in wild-type (WT) <i>P. trichocarpa</i> under drought conditions. Meanwhile, these phenotype traits of plants overexpressing <i>PtS1Fa1</i> were similar to those of WT plants. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>PtS1Fa2</i> reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, electrolyte leakage, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>- contents, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities. The expression of <i>SOD</i> and <i>POD</i> was also induced by <i>PtS1Fa2</i>. However, overexpression of <i>PtS1Fa1</i> failed to affect any of these physiological parameters or <i>SOD</i> and <i>POD</i> gene expression. These results suggested that <i>PtS1Fa2</i> plays a role in drought tolerance, and confers drought tolerance by increase antioxidant activity to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation.
