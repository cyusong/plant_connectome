The expression of the FATTY ACID ELONGATION1 genes was characterised to provide insight into the regulation of very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthesis in Brassica napus embryos. Each of the two rapeseed homoeologous genes (Bn-FAE1.1 and Bn-FAE1.2) encoding isozymes of 3-keto-acylCoA synthase, a subunit of the cytoplasmic acyl-CoA elongase complex that controls the production of elongated fatty acids, are expressed predominantly in developing seeds. The proximal regions of the Bn-FAE1.1 and Bn-FAE1.2 promoters possess strong sequence identity suggesting that transcriptional control of expression is mediated by this region which contains putative cis-elements characteristic of those found in the promoters of genes expressed in embryo and endosperm. Histochemical staining of rapeseed lines expressing Bn-FAE1.1 promoter:reporter gene fusions revealed a strong expression in the embryo cotyledon and axis throughout the maturation phase. Quantitative analyses revealed the region, -331 to -149, exerts a major control on cotyledon specific expression and the level of expression. A second region, -640 to -475, acts positively to enhance expression levels and extends expression of Bn-FAE1.1 into the axis and hypocotyl but also acts negatively to repress expression in the root meristem. The expression of the Bn-FAE1.1 gene was not restricted to the seed but was also detected in the vascular tissues of germinating seedlings and mature plants in the fascicular cambium tissue present in roots, stem and leaf petiole. We propose that Bn-FAE1.1 expression in vascular tissue may contribute VLCFA for barrier lipid synthesis and reflects the ancestral function of FAE1 encoded 3-keto-acylCoA synthase.
