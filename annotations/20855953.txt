Plant responses are coordinately controlled by both external and internal signals. Apt perception of pathogen attack and its appropriate conversion to internal signals ultimately determine the outcome of innate immunity. The present review predicts the involvement of unconventional 'Guard/Decoy Model' in chickpea-Fusarium encounter. Rapid alkalinization factor is predicted to act as initial 'Gatekeeper decoy' counteracting fungal entry. Phospholipases and cystatins probably function as 'Guardees' being shielded by R gene(s). Serine Threonine Kinases decodes external pathogenic signals to in planta defense alarms. 14.3.3 provides clues to the wilt mechanism. The versatile sugars serve as signal generators and transmitters maintaining intra and inter cellular connectivity during stress.
