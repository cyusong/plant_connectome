['17916737', 'The RRM-domain proteins FCA and FPA have previously been characterized as  flowering-time regulators in Arabidopsis. We show that they are required for  RNA-mediated chromatin silencing of a range of loci in the genome. At some target  loci, FCA and FPA promote asymmetric DNA methylation, whereas at others they  function in parallel to DNA methylation. Female gametophytic development and  early embryonic development are particularly susceptible to malfunctions in FCA  and FPA. We propose that FCA and FPA regulate chromatin silencing of single and  low-copy genes and interact in a locus-dependent manner with the canonical small  interfering RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway to regulate common targets.', '2007 Oct 5', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1146565', 'Dean']
