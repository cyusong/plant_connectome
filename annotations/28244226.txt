Regulation of essential macronutrients acquisition by plants in response to their availability is a key process for plant adaptation to changing environments. Here we show in tomato and Arabidopsis plants that when they are subjected to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>-</sup> deprivation, low-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup> translocation to the shoot are reduced. In parallel, these nutritional deficiencies produce reductions in the messenger levels of the genes encoding the main systems for low-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup> translocation, i.e. AKT1 and SKOR in Arabidopsis and LKT1 and the tomato homolog of SKOR, SlSKOR in tomato, respectively. The results suggest that the shortage of one nutrient produces a general downregulation of the acquisition of other nutrients. In the case of K<sup>+</sup> nutrient, one of the mechanisms for such a response resides in the transcriptional repression of the genes encoding the systems for K<sup>+</sup> uptake and translocation.

NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>-</sup> deprivation: !reduces! low-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake
AKT1: !encodes! low-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake
SKOR: !encodes! K<sup>+</sup> translocation
LKT1: !encodes! low-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake
SlSKOR: !encodes! K<sup>+</sup> translocation
nutrient shortage: !represses! genes encoding systems for K<sup>+</sup> uptake and translocation
