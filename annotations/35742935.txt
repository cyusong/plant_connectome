Proteins with conserved SET domain play a critical role in plant immunity. However, the means of organization and functions of these proteins are unclear, particularly in non-model plants such as pepper (<i>Capsicum annum</i> L.). Herein, we functionally characterized <i>CaASHH3</i>, a member of class II (the ASH1 homologs H3K36) proteins in pepper immunity against <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i> DC3000). The <i>CaASHH3</i> was localized in the nucleus, and its transcript levels were significantly enhanced by <i>R. solanacearum</i> inoculation (RSI) and exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethephon (ETH), and abscisic acid (ABA). Knockdown of <i>CaASHH3</i> by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) compromised peppers' resistance to RSI. Furthermore, silencing of <i>CaASHH3</i> impaired hypersensitive-response (HR)-like cell death response due to RSI and downregulated defense-associated marker genes, including <i>CaPR1</i>, <i>CaNPR1</i>, and <i>CaABR1.</i> The <i>CaASHH3</i> protein was revealed to affect the promoters of <i>CaNPR1</i>, <i>CaPR1</i>, and <i>CaHSP24.</i> Transiently over-expression of <i>CaASHH3</i> in pepper leaves elicited HR-like cell death and upregulated immunity-related marker genes. To further study the role of <i>CaASHH3</i> in plant defense in vivo, <i>CaASHH3</i> transgenic plants were generated in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Overexpression of <i>CaASHH3</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> enhanced innate immunity against <i>Pst</i> DC3000. Furthermore, <i>CaASHH3</i> over-expressing transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> plants exhibited upregulated transcriptional levels of immunity-associated marker genes, such as <i>AtNPR1</i>, <i>AtPR1</i>, and <i>AtPR2</i>. These results collectively confirm the role of <i>CaASHH3</i> as a positive regulator of plant cell death and pepper immunity against bacterial pathogens, which is regulated by signaling synergistically mediated by SA, JA, ET, and ABA.
