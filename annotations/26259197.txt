['26259197', 'Plants synthesize carbohydrate binding proteins in response to adverse  environmental conditions such as drought, heat, pathogen attack, etc. The  Arabidopsis EULS3 lectin (referred to as ArathEULS3, encoded by At2g39050) has  recently been linked to the drought stress response. In this study, endogenous  binding partners for this protein have been investigated. Tandem affinity  purifications and mass spectrometry analyses allowed the identification of two  putative interacting proteins, Embryo-specific protein 3A (ATS3A, At2g41475) and  Embryo-specific protein 3B (ATS3B, At5g62200). Bimolecular fluorescence  complementation experiments confirmed the interaction between ArathEULS3 and  ATS3B in closed stomata of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Transgenic lines with  reduced ArathEULS3 expression exhibited an aberrant ABA-induced stomatal closure  compared to plants overexpressing ArathEULS3 and control plants suggesting a role  for ArathEULS3 in ABA-induced stomatal closure. Stomata are known as the major  route for Pseudomonas syringae entry into the plant tissues. Bacterial infection  of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana plants was accompanied by a 6-fold increase of  transcript levels for ArathEULS3. Furthermore, infection experiments with  ArathEULS3 overexpression lines resulted in a clear reduction of P. syringae  disease symptoms whereas plants with reduced ArathEULS3 expression showed the  highest levels of leaf damage at 3 days post infection. These data point towards  the physiological importance of ArathEULS3 for stomatal movement.', '2015 Sep', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.07.005', 'Van']
