Stromules are thin projections from plastids that are generally longer and more abundant on non-green plastids than on chloroplasts. Occasionally stromules can be observed to connect two plastid bodies with one another. However, photobleaching of GFP-labeled plastids and stromules in 2000 demonstrated that plastids do not form a network like the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the proposal that stromules have major functions other than transfer of material from one plastid to another. The absence of a network was confirmed in 2012 with the use of a photoconvertible fluorescent protein, but the prior observations of movement of proteins between plastids were challenged. We review published evidence and provide new experiments that demonstrate trafficking of fluorescent protein between plastids as well as movement of proteins within stromules that emanate from a single plastid and discuss the possible function of stromules.
