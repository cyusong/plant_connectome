Pectins are complex cell wall polysaccharides important for many aspects of plant development. Recent studies have discovered extensive physical interactions between pectins and other cell wall components, implicating pectins in new molecular functions. Pectins are often localized in spatially-restricted patterns, and some of these non-uniform pectin distributions contribute to multiple aspects of plant development, including the morphogenesis of cells and organs. Furthermore, a growing number of mutants affecting cell wall composition have begun to reveal the distinct contributions of different pectins to plant development. This review discusses the interactions of pectins with other cell wall components, the functions of pectins in controlling cellular morphology, and how non-uniform pectin composition can be an important determinant of developmental processes.
