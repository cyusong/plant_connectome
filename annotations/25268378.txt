['25268378', 'Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a key intermediate in the metabolic network of  glycerolipid biosynthesis. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and  phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAH) are two key enzymes of PC homeostasis. We  report that LPCAT activity is markedly induced in the Arabidopsis pah mutant. The  quadruple pah lpcat mutant, with dual defects in PAH and LPCAT, had a level of  lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) that was much higher than that in the lpcat mutants  and a PC content that was higher than that in the pah mutant. Comparative  molecular profile analysis of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and  digalactosyldiacylglycerol revealed that both the pah and pah lpcat mutants had  increased proportions of 34:6 from the prokaryotic pathway despite differing  levels of LPCAT activity. We show that a decreased representation of the C16:0  C18:2 diacylglycerol moiety in PC was a shared feature of pah and pah lpcat, and  that this change in PC metabolic profile correlated with the increased  prokaryotic contribution to chloroplast lipid synthesis. We detected increased PC  deacylation in the pah lpcat mutant that was attributable at least in part to the  induced phospholipases. Increased LPC generation was also evident in the pah  mutant, but the phospholipases were not induced, raising the possibility that PC  deacylation is mediated by the reverse reaction of LPCAT. We discuss possible  roles of LPCAT and PAH in PC turnover that impacts lipid pathway coordination for  chloroplast lipid synthesis.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12683', 'Zou']
