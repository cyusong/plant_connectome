Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plant growth, development and metabolism. Due to its lack of solubility and low bioavailability in soil, Fe levels are usually far below the optimum amount for most plants' growth and development. In apple production, excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer may cause iron chlorosis symptoms in the newly growing leaves, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unclear. In this study, low nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , LN) application alleviated the symptoms of Fe deficiency and promoted lower rhizosphere pH, which was beneficial for root Fe acquisition. At the same time, LN treatment increased citrate and abscisic acid accumulation in roots, which promoted Fe transport from root to shoot and maintained Fe homeostasis. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis showed that nitrate application caused differential expression of genes related to Fe uptake and transport, as well as transcriptional regulators. In summary, our data reveal that low nitrate alleviated Fe deficiency through multiple pathways, demonstrating a new option for minimizing Fe deficiency by regulating the balance between nutrients.
