Extreme events such as drought and heatwaves are among the biggest challenges to agricultural production and food security. However, the effects of cropping systems on drought resistance of arable crops via their hydraulic behaviour remain unclear. We investigated how hydraulic traits of a field-grown pea-barley (Pisum sativum L. and Hordeum vulgare L.) mixture were affected by different cropping systems, that is, organic and conventional farming with intensive or conservation tillage. Xylem vulnerability to cavitation of both species was estimated by measuring the pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P<sub>50</sub> ), while the water stress plants experienced in the field were assessed using native percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (nPLC). Pea and barley showed contrasting hydraulic behaviours: pea was less vulnerable to xylem cavitation and less stressed than barley; cropping systems affected the xylem vulnerability of barley, but not of pea. Barley grown under conventional farming with no tillage was more vulnerable and stressed than under organic farming with intensive tillage. nPLC proved to be a valuable indicator for plant water stress. Our results highlight the impact of cropping systems on crop xylem vulnerability and drought resistance, thus plant hydraulic traits, for protecting food security under future climate.
