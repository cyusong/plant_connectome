The plant parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii invades the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana to induce nematode feeding structures in the central cylinder. During nematode development, the parasites feed exclusively from these structures. Thus, high sugar import and specific sugar processing of the affected plant cells is crucial for nematode development. In the present work, we found starch accumulation in nematode feeding structures and therefore studied the expression genes involved in the starch metabolic pathway. The importance of starch synthesis was further shown using the Atss1 mutant line. As it is rather surprising to find starch accumulation in cells characterised by a high nutrient loss, we speculate that starch serves as long- and short-term carbohydrate storage to compensate the staggering feeding behaviour of the parasites.
