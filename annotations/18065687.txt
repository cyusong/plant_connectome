['18065687', 'The CRM domain is a recently recognized RNA binding domain found in three group  II intron splicing factors in chloroplasts, in a bacterial protein that  associates with ribosome precursors, and in a family of uncharacterized proteins  in plants. To elucidate the functional repertoire of proteins with CRM domains,  we studied CFM2 (for CRM Family Member 2), which harbors four CRM domains. RNA  coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that CFM2 in maize (Zea mays) chloroplasts is  associated with the group I intron in pre-trnL-UAA and group II introns in the  ndhA and ycf3 pre-mRNAs. T-DNA insertions in the Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog  condition a defective-seed phenotype (strong allele) or chlorophyll-deficient  seedlings with impaired splicing of the trnL group I intron and the ndhA,  ycf3-int1, and clpP-int2 group II introns (weak alleles). CFM2 and two previously  described CRM proteins are bound simultaneously to the ndhA and ycf3-int1 introns  and act in a nonredundant fashion to promote their splicing. With these findings,  CRM domain proteins are implicated in the activities of three classes of  catalytic RNA: group I introns, group II introns, and 23S rRNA.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.055160', 'Barkan']
