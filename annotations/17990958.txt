Potato virus Y (PVY) infections often lead to altered numbers of host plant chloroplasts, as well as changes in morphology and inhibited photosynthesis. The multifunctional protein helper component-proteinase, HC-Pro, has been identified in PVY-infected leaf chloroplasts. We used yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to demonstrate that HC-Pro can interact with the chloroplast division-related factor NtMinD in yeast and tobacco cells, respectively. In addition, we confirmed that residues 271 to 314 in NtMinD are necessary for its interaction with PVY HC-Pro in a yeast two-hybrid analysis using four NtMinD deletion mutants. These residues are necessary for the dimerization of NtMinD, which plays a vital role in chloroplast division. Thus, PVY HC-Pro may affect NtMinD activity by inhibiting the formation of NtMinD homodimers, and this may interfere with chloroplast division and contribute to changes in the numbers of chloroplast per cell observed in PVY-infected plants.
