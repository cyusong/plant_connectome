['18378893', 'Plant recognition of pathogens leads to rapid activation of MPK3 and MPK6, two  Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and their orthologs in  other species. Here, we report that synthesis of camalexin, the major phytoalexin  in Arabidopsis, is regulated by the MPK3/MPK6 cascade. Activation of MPK3/MPK6 by  expression of active upstream MAPK kinase (MAPKK) or MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) was  sufficient to induce camalexin synthesis in the absence of pathogen attack.  Induction of camalexin by Botrytis cinerea was preceded by MPK3/MPK6 activation,  and compromised in mpk3 and mpk6 mutants. Genetic analysis placed the MPK3/MPK6  cascade upstream of PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 2 (PAD2) and PAD3, but independent or  downstream of PAD1 and PAD4. Camalexin induction after MPK3/MPK6 activation was  preceded by rapid and coordinated up-regulation of multiple genes encoding  enzymes in the tryptophan (Trp) biosynthetic pathway, in the conversion of Trp to  indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx, a branch point between primary and secondary  metabolism), and in the camalexin biosynthetic pathway downstream of IAOx. These  results indicate that the MPK3/MPK6 cascade regulates camalexin synthesis through  transcriptional regulation of the biosynthetic genes after pathogen infection.', '2008 Apr 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0711301105', 'Zhang']
