N-1-Naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) causes the abnormal growth and development of plants by suppressing polar auxin transport. The mechanisms underlying this inhibition, however, have remained elusive. In Arabidopsis, we show that a defect in the ABC subfamily B auxin transporter AtABCB19 suppresses the inhibitory effects of NPA on hypocotyl phototropism and gravitropism, but not on hypocotyl elongation. Expression analysis using the auxin reporter gene DR5:GUS further suggests that NPA partially inhibits the asymmetric distribution of auxin in an AtABCB19-dependent manner. These data thus suggest that AtABCB19 plays an important role in the inhibitory effects of NPA on hypocotyl tropism induced by auxin.

NPA: !suppresses! polar auxin transport
AtABCB19: !suppresses! inhibitory effects of NPA
AtABCB19: !plays role in! inhibitory effects of NPA
DR5:GUS: !suggests! partial inhibition of asymmetric distribution of auxin by NPA
