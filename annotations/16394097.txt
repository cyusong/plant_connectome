['16394097', "Recent studies of meiotic recombination in the budding yeast and the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana indicate that meiotic crossovers (COs) occur through two  genetic pathways: the interference-sensitive pathway and the  interference-insensitive pathway. However, few genes have been identified in  either pathway. Here, we describe the identification of the PARTING DANCERS (PTD)  gene, as a gene with an elevated expression level in meiocytes. Analysis of two  independently generated transferred DNA insertional lines in PTD showed that the  mutants had reduced fertility. Further cytological analysis of male meiosis in  the ptd mutants revealed defects in meiosis, including reduced formation of  chiasmata, the cytological appearance of COs. The residual chiasmata in the  mutants were distributed randomly, indicating that the ptd mutants are defective  for CO formation in the interference-sensitive pathway. In addition, transmission  electron microscopic analysis of the mutants detected no obvious abnormality of  synaptonemal complexes and apparently normal late recombination nodules at the  pachytene stage, suggesting that the mutant's defects in bivalent formation were  postsynaptic. Comparison to other genes with limited sequence similarity raises  the possibility that PTD may present a previously unknown function conserved in  divergent eukaryotic organisms.", '2006 Mar', 'Mol Biol Cell', '10.1091/mbc.e05-09-0902', 'Ma']
