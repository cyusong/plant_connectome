['21738492', 'Transportin-SR (TRN-SR) is a member of the importin-beta super-family that functions  as the nuclear import receptor for serine-arginine rich (SR) proteins, which play  diverse roles in RNA metabolism. Here we report the identification and cloning of  mos14 (modifier of snc1-1, 14), a mutation that suppresses the immune responses  conditioned by the auto-activated Resistance (R) protein snc1 (suppressor of  npr1-1, constitutive 1). MOS14 encodes a nuclear protein with high similarity to  previously characterized TRN-SR proteins in animals. Yeast two-hybrid assays  showed that MOS14 interacts with AtRAN1 via its N-terminus and SR proteins via  its C-terminus. In mos14-1, localization of several SR proteins to the nucleus  was impaired, confirming that MOS14 functions as a TRN-SR. The mos14-1 mutation  results in altered splicing patterns of SNC1 and another R gene RPS4 and  compromised resistance mediated by snc1 and RPS4, suggesting that nuclear import  of SR proteins by MOS14 is required for proper splicing of these two R genes and  is important for their functions in plant immunity.', '2011 Jun', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1002159', 'Zhang']
