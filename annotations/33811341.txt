Endodormancy and the related chilling requirement synchronize the seasonal development of trees from the boreal and temperate regions under the climatic conditions prevailing at their native growing sites. The phenomenon of endodormancy has been known at the whole-plant level for 100 years, and in the last couple of decades, insights into the physiological and molecular basis of endodormancy and its release have also been obtained. Intriguingly, recent studies have shown experimentally that subtropical trees also show endodormancy and a chilling requirement. Motivated by the climatic differences between the subtropical and more northern zones, here we address the similarities and differences in endodormancy between trees growing in the subtropical zone and those growing in more northern zones.
