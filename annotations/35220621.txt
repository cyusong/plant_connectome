['35220621', 'Mediator 17 (MED17) is a subunit of the Mediator complex that regulates  transcription initiation in eukaryotic organisms. In yeast and humans, MED17 also  participates in DNA repair, physically interacting with proteins of the  nucleotide excision DNA repair system, but this function in plants has not been  investigated. We studied the role of MED17 in Arabidopsis plants exposed to UV-B  radiation. Our results demonstrate that med17 and OE MED17 plants have altered  responses to UV-B, and that MED17 participates in various aspects of the DNA  damage response (DDR). Comparison of the med17 transcriptome with that of  wild-type (WT) plants showed that almost one-third of transcripts with altered  expression in med17 plants were also changed by UV-B exposure in WT plants.  Increased sensitivity to DNA damage after UV-B in med17 plants could result from  the altered regulation of UV-B responsive transcripts but MED17 also physically  interacts with DNA repair proteins, suggesting a direct role of this Mediator  subunit during repair. Finally, we show that MED17 is necessary to regulate the  DDR activated by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), and that  programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) overexpression reverts the deficiencies in DDR  shown in med17 mutants. Our data demonstrate that MED17 is an important regulator  of DDR after UV-B irradiation in Arabidopsis.', '2022 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15722', 'ORCID:']
