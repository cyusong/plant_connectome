Transcription factors (TFs) help plants respond to environmental stresses by regulating gene expression. Up till now, studies on the MYB family of TFs have mainly focused on the highly abundant R2R3-subtype. While the less well-known 1R-subtype has been generally shown to enhance abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity by acting as transcriptional activators, the mechanisms of their functions are unclear. Here we identified an ABA sensitivity-associated gene from soybean, ABA-Sensitive 1 (GmABAS1), of the 1R-subtype of MYB. Using the GFP-GmABAS1 fusion protein, we demonstrated that GmABAS1 is localized in the nucleus, and with yeast reporter systems, we showed that it is a transcriptional repressor. We then identified the target gene of GmABAS1 to be Glyma.01G060300, an annotated ABI five-binding protein 3 and showed that GmABAS1 binds to the promoter of Glyma.01G060300 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Glyma.01G060300 and GmABAS1 exhibited reciprocal expression patterns under osmotic stress, inferring that GmABAS1 is a transcriptional repressor of Glyma.01G060300. As a further confirmation, AtAFP2, an orthologue of Glyma.01G060300, was down-regulated in GmABAS1-transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, enhancing the plant's sensitivity to ABA. This is the first time a 1R-subtype of MYB from soybean has been reported to enhance ABA sensitivity by acting as a transcriptional repressor.
