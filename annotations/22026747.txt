['22026747', 'Paraquat is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. However, no  paraquat transporter has been isolated in plants. Here, we describe  paraquat-tolerant mutant pqt24-1, isolated from an activation-tagging library on  the basis of its tolerance to 2 mum paraquat in the seedling stage. Molecular  analysis revealed that the T-DNA was inserted in the 13th exon of At1g66950,  which encodes AtPDR11, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter  superfamily. As a result, AtPDR11 was knocked out in the mutant. Loss-of-function  mutations of AtPDR11 led to reduced paraquat accumulation in plant cells. In  addition, the AtPDR11 protein was specifically localized in the plasmalemma,  suggesting AtPDR11 as a potential transporter of paraquat. This conclusion was  supported by kinetic analysis of paraquat import. Further studies showed that the  transcript level of AtPDR11 could be strongly induced by paraquat and other  abiotic stresses including H(2) O(2) , indicating possible up-regulation of  AtPDR11 expression by oxidative stress signaling. Thus, our data suggest that  paraquat is an opportunistic substrate of AtPDR11 and the enhanced paraquat  tolerance of pqt24-1 is due to reduced uptake of paraquat into plant cells.', '2012 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04830.x', 'Xiang']
