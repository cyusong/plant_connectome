['29877633', 'Peroxisomes compartmentalize a dynamic suite of biochemical reactions and play a  central role in plant metabolism, such as the degradation of hydrogen peroxide,  metabolism of fatty acids, photorespiration, and the biosynthesis of plant  hormones. Plant peroxisomes have been traditionally classified into three major  subtypes, and in-depth mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has been performed  to explore the proteome of the two major subtypes present in green leaves and  etiolated seedlings. Here, we carried out a comprehensive proteome analysis of  peroxisomes from Arabidopsis leaves given a 48-h dark treatment. Our goal was to  determine the proteome of the third major subtype of plant peroxisomes from  senescent leaves, and further catalog the plant peroxisomal proteome. We  identified a total of 111 peroxisomal proteins and verified the peroxisomal  localization for six new proteins with potential roles in fatty acid metabolism  and stress response by in vivo targeting analysis. Metabolic pathways  compartmentalized in the three major subtypes of peroxisomes were also compared,  which revealed a higher number of proteins involved in the detoxification of  reactive oxygen species in peroxisomes from senescent leaves. Our study takes an  important step towards mapping the full function of plant peroxisomes.', '2018 Nov', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12670', 'Hu']
