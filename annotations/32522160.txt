['32522160', 'BACKGROUND: ABC1K (Activity of BC1 complex Kinase) is an evolutionarily primitive  atypical kinase family widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The  ABC1K protein kinases in Arabidopsis are predicted to localize either to the  mitochondria or chloroplasts, in which plastid-located ABC1K proteins are  involved in the response against photo-oxidative stress and cadmium-induced  oxidative stress. RESULTS: Here, we report that the mitochondria-localized  ABC1K10a functions in plant salt stress tolerance by regulating reactive oxygen  species (ROS). Our results show that the ABC1K10a expression is induced by salt  stress, and the mutations in this gene result in overaccumulation of ROS and  hypersensitivity to salt stress. Exogenous application of the ROS-scavenger GSH  significantly represses ROS accumulation and rescues the salt hypersensitive  phenotype of abc1k10a. ROS overaccumulation in abc1k10a mutants under salt stress  is likely due to the defect in mitochondria electron transport chain.  Furthermore, defects of several other mitochondria-localized ABC1K genes also  result in salt hypersensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results reveal  that the mitochondria-located ABC1K10a regulates mitochondrial ROS production and  is a positive regulator of salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.', '2020 Jun 10', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-020-02467-4', 'Song']
