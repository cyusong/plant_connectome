Plant genetic engineering, a recent technological advancement in the field of plant science, is an important tool used to improve crop quality and yield, to enhance secondary metabolite content in medicinal plants or to develop crops for sustainable agriculture. A new approach based on nanoparticle-mediated gene transformation can overcome the obstacle of the plant cell wall and accurately transfer DNA or RNA into plants to produce transient or stable transformation. In this review, several nanoparticle-based approaches are discussed, taking into account recent advances and challenges to hint at potential applications of these approaches in transgenic plant improvement programs. This review also highlights challenges in implementing the nanoparticle-based approaches used in plant genetic engineering. A new technology that improves gene transformation efficiency and overcomes difficulties in plant regeneration has been established and will be used for the de novo production of transgenic plants, and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has accelerated crop improvement. Therefore, we outline future perspectives based on combinations of genome editing, nanoparticle-mediated gene transformation and de novo regeneration technologies to accelerate crop improvement. The information provided here will assist an effective exploration of the technological advances in plant genetic engineering to support plant breeding and important crop improvement programs.
