['26192339', 'The question of whether red light-induced stomatal opening is mediated by a  photosynthesis-derived reduction in intercellular [CO2 ] (Ci ) remains  controversial and genetic analyses are needed. The Arabidopsis thaliana protein  kinase HIGH TEMPERATURE 1 (HT1) is a negative regulator of [CO2 ]-induced  stomatal closing and ht1-2 mutant plants do not show stomatal opening to low [CO2  ]. The protein kinase mutant ost1-3 exhibits slowed stomatal responses to CO2 .  The functions of HT1 and OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) to changes in red, blue light or  [CO2 ] were analyzed. For comparison we assayed recessive ca1ca4 carbonic  anhydrase double mutant plants, based on their slowed stomatal response to CO2 .  Here, we report a strong impairment in ht1 in red light-induced stomatal opening  whereas blue light was able to induce stomatal opening. The effects on  photosynthetic performance in ht1 were restored when stomatal limitation of CO2  uptake, by control of [Ci ], was eliminated. HT1 was found to interact  genetically with OST1 both during red light- and low [CO2 ]-induced stomatal  opening. Analyses of ca1ca4 plants suggest that more than a low [Ci ]-dependent  pathway may function in red light-induced stomatal opening. These results  demonstrate that HT1 is essential for red light-induced stomatal opening and  interacts genetically with OST1 during stomatal responses to red light and  altered [CO2 ].', '2015 Dec', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13566', 'Israelsson-Nordstrom']
