Conclusions 35 Acknowledgements 35 References 35 SUMMARY: Phenotypic plasticity is common in nature, yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary forces that shape genetic variation for plasticity. This endeavor is especially important because variation for plasticity will result in genotype-by-environment interactions (G × E), a crucial component of variation in quantitative traits. Here, I review our understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping G × E, focusing specifically on: what evolutionary forces maintain variation for plasticity; and what forces maintain different genetic architectures across environments. My specific goal is to show that genomic data can be leveraged to explain the maintenance of G × E by contrasting patterns of genetic variation for plasticity with neutral expectations.
