['16176989', 'The Arabidopsis root has a unique cellular pattern in its single-layered  epidermis. Cells residing over the intercellular spaces between underlying  cortical cells (H position) differentiate into hair cells, whereas those directly  over cortical cells (N position) differentiate into non-hair cells. Recent  studies have revealed that this cellular pattern is determined by interactions of  six patterning genes CPC, ETC, GL2, GL3/EGL3, TTG, and WER, and that the  position-dependent expression of the CPC, GL2, and WER genes is essential for  their appropriate interactions. However, little is known about how the  expressions of the pattern genes are determined. Here we show that trichostatin A  (TSA) treatment of germinating Arabidopsis seedlings alters the cellular pattern  of the root epidermis to induce hair cell development at nonhair positions. The  effects of TSA treatment are rapid, reversible, concentration-dependent, and  position-independent. TSA inhibition of histone deacetylase activity results in  hyperacetylation of the core histones H3 and H4, and alters the expression levels  and cell specific expression of the patterning genes CPC, GL2 and WER. Analysis  of histone deacetylase mutant cellular patterning further verified the  participation of histone acetylation in cellular patterning, and revealed that  HDA18 is a key component in the regulatory machinery of the Arabidopsis root  epidermis. We propose a working model to suggest that histone acetylation may  function in mediating a positional cue to direct expression of the patterning  genes in the root epidermal cells.', '2005 Oct 4', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0503143102', 'Bai']
