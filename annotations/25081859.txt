['25081859', 'The helical-repeat RNA-binding protein HCF107 is required for processing,  stabilization and translation of plastid-encoded psbH mRNA. The psbH gene encodes  a small, hydrophilic subunit of the PSII complex and is part of the plastidic  psbB-psbT-psbH-petB-petD transcription unit. In Arabidopsis hcf107 mutants, only  trace amounts of PSII proteins can be detected. Beside drastically reduced  synthesis of PsbH, the synthesis of CP47 was also reduced in these mutants,  although the corresponding psbB transcripts accumulate to wild type levels. This  situation raises the question, whether the reduction of CP47 is a direct  consequence of the mutation, based on targeting of HCF107 to the psbB mRNA, or a  secondary affect due to the absent PsbH. To clarify this issue we introduced a  chimeric psbH construct comprising a sequence encoding a chloroplast transit  peptide into the hcf107-2 background. We found that the nucleus-localized psbH  was able to complement the mutant defect resulting in photoautotrophic plants.  The PSII proteins CP47 and D1 accumulated to barely half of the wild type level.  Further experiments showed that cytosolically synthesized PsbH was imported into  chloroplasts and assembled into PSII complexes. Using this approach, we showed  that the tetratricopeptide repeat protein HCF107 of Arabidopsis is only  responsible for expression of PsbH and not for synthesis of CP47. In addition the  data suggest the necessity of the small, one-helix membrane spanning protein PsbH  for the accumulation of CP47 in higher plants.', '2014 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12632', 'Meierhoff']
