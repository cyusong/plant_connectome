An Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant that results in complete loss-of-function of the COBRA gene has been identified. The COBRA gene encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that modulates cellulose deposition and oriented cell expansion in roots. The loss-of-function mutant allele (named "cob-5") exhibits abnormal cell growth throughout the entire plant body and accumulates massive amounts of stress response chemicals such as anthocyanins and callose. To gain further insight into the mechanism by which COBRA affects cell growth and physiology, the whole-genome gene expression profile of cob-5 plants was compared with that of wild-type plants. Consistent with the mutant phenotype, many genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were up-regulated in the cob-5 plants, whereas genes involved in cell elongation were down-regulated. The most striking feature of the gene expression profile of cob-5 was the massive and co-ordinate induction of defence- and stress-related genes, many of which are regulated by the plant stress signal jasmonic acid (JA). Indeed, the cob-5 plants over-accumulated JA by nearly 8-fold compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, induction of cell elongation defects in conditional allele cob-3 plants triggers the expression of a defence-responsive gene. These results provide potential clues to the mechanisms by which plant cells initially perceive biotic stress at the cell surface.
