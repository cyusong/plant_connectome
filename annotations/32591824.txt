Plants protect themselves against pest attack utilizing both direct and indirect modes of defense. The direct mode of defense includes morphological, biochemical, and molecular barriers that affect feeding, growth, and survival of herbivores whereas the indirect mode of defense includes release of a blend of volatiles that attract natural enemies of the pests. Both of these strategies adopted by plants are reinforced if the plants are supplied with one of the most abundant metalloids, silicon (Si). Plants absorb Si as silicic acid (Si(OH)4) and accumulate it as phytoliths, which strengthens their physical defense. This deposition of Si in plant tissue is up-regulated upon pest attack. Further, Si deposited in the apoplast, suppresses pest effector molecules. Additionally, Si up-regulates the expression of defense-related genes and proteins and their activity and enhances the accumulation of secondary metabolites, boosting induced molecular and biochemical defenses. Moreover, Si plays a crucial role in phytohormone-mediated direct and indirect defense mechanisms. It is also involved in the reduction of harmful effects of oxidative stress resulting from herbivory by accelerating the scavenging process. Despite increasing evidence of its multiple roles in defense against pests, the practical implications of Si for crop protection have received less attention. Here, we highlight recent developments in Si-mediated improved plant resistance against pests and its significance for future use in crop improvement.
