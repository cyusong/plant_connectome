['28536144', 'The transcription factor MYC2 has emerged as a master regulator of jasmonate  (JA)-mediated responses as well as crosstalk among different signaling pathways.  The instability of MYC2 is in part due to the action of PUB10 E3 ligase, which  can polyubiquitinate this protein. Here, we show that polyubiquitinated MYC2 can  be deubiquitinated by UBP12 and UBP13 in vitro, suggesting that the two  deubiquitinating enzymes can counteract the effect of PUB10 in vivo. Consistent  with this view, UBP12 and UBP13 associate with MYC2 in the nucleus. Transgenic  Arabidopsis thaliana plants deficient in UBP12 and UBP13 show accelerated decay  of MYC2 and are hyposensitive to JA, whereas plants overexpressing UBP12 or UBP13  have prolonged MYC2 half-life and are hypersensitive to JA Our results suggest  that there is a genetic link between UBP12, UBP13, and MYC2. Our results identify  UBP12 and UBP13 as additional positive regulators of JA responses and suggest  that these enzymes likely act by stabilizing MYC2.', '2017 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00216', 'ORCID:']
