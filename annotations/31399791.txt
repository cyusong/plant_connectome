Cassava AGPase and AGPase genes have some unique characteristics. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is a rate-limiting enzyme for starch synthesis. In this study, cassava AGPase genes (MeAGP) were analyzed based on six cultivars and one wild species. A total of seven MeAGPs was identified, including four encoding AGPase large subunits (MeAGPLs 1, 2, 3 and 4) and three encoding AGPase small subunits (MeAGPSs 1, 2 and 3). The copy number of MeAGPs varied in cassava germplasm materials. There were 14 introns for MeAGPLs 1, 2 and 3, 13 introns for MeAGPL4, and 8 introns for other three MeAGPSs. Multiple conservative amino acid sequence motifs were found in the MeAGPs. There were differences in amino acids at binding sites of substrates and regulators among different MeAGP subunits and between MeAGPs and a potato AGPase small subunit (1YP2:B). MeAGPs were all located in chloroplasts. MeAGP expression was not only associated with gene copy number and types/combinations, regions and levels of the DNA methylation but was also affected by environmental factors with the involvement of various transcription factors in multiple regulation networks and in various cis-elements in the gene promoter regions. The MeAGP activity also changed with environmental conditions and had potential differences among the subunits. Taken together, MeAGPs differ in number from those of Arabidopsis, potato, maize, banana, sweet potato, and tomato.
