['16164597', 'Previously, we screened 50 000 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana carrying a  P(GI)::LUC+ bioluminescence reporter gene mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate  for mutants with phenotypes of extensively altered circadian rhythms, and  identified three loci, PHYTOCLOCK 1 (PCL1), PCL2 and PCL3, whose mutations cause  arrhythmia. Here we succeeded to clone the PCL1 gene and show that the PCL1 gene  encodes a novel DNA binding protein belonging to the GARP protein family and is  essential for a functional clock oscillator in A. thaliana. The PCL1 gene  satisfies the requirements for the clock oscillator gene: (i) pcl1 null mutations  caused arrhythmia in multiple circadian outputs, including expression of  potential clock genes TOC1, CCA1 and LHY, and flowering lacked a photoperiodic  response; (ii) PCL1 expression showed circadian rhythm in both constant light and  constant dark; (iii) over-expression of the PCL1 gene gradually caused  arrhythmicity in all the multiple circadian outputs examined; and (iv) the PCL1  gene controlled its own expression via negative feedback. Therefore, the PCL1  gene is the clock oscillator gene essential to the generation of clock  oscillation in the higher plant.', '2005 Oct', 'Genes Cells', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00892.x', 'Ishiura']
