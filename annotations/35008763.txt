<i>Saccharum officinarum</i> (sugarcane) is the fifth major cultivated crop around the world. Sugarcane rind is a promising source for anthocyanin pigments; however, limited information is available on the anthocyanin and its biosynthesis in sugarcane rinds. In this study, we have quantified 49 compounds including 6 flavonoids and 43 anthocyanins in the rind of 6 sugarcane cultivars by using LCMS/MS approach. Thirty of them were quantified for the first time in sugarcane. The 43 anthocyanins included 10 cyanidin (Cya), 11 pelargonidin (Pel), 9 peonidin (Peo), 5 malvidin (Mal), 4 delphinidin (Del), and 4 petunidin (Pet) metabolites. High contents of Cya derivatives were observed in the rind of YT71/210 (dark purple rind), such as cya-3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-glu 1283.3 µg/g and cya-3-O-glu 482.67 µg/g followed by ROC22 (red rind) 821.3 µg/g and 409 µg/g, respectively, whereas the YT93/159 (green rind) showed a minimum level of these compounds. Among six cultivars, ROC22 rind has high levels of Peo derivatives such as peo-3-O-glu (197 µg/g), peo-3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-glu (69 µg/g) and peo-3-O-(6-O-p-coumaryl)-glu (55.17 µg/g). The gene expression analysis revealed that some genes, including a <i>MYB(t)</i> gene, were highly associated with the color phenotype. Thus, we cloned and overexpressed the gene in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and found the pinkish brown color in the hypocotyl of all transgenic lines compared with the wild type. Hence, we have quantified a wide range of anthocyanins in major sugarcane cultivars, reported many new anthocyanins for the first time, and concluded that Cya and Peo derivatives are the major contributing factor of dissimilar colors in sugarcane. The finding and the verification of a novel <i>MYB</i> gene involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis have demonstrated that our study was very valuable for gene discovery and genetic improvement of sugarcane cultivars to harvest high anthocyanin contents.
