ATAF2, a member of the plant-specific NAC-domain transcription factor family, is highly induced in leaves at a wound site and is responsive to the wound-related phytohormones methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid, but not to abscisic acid. Overexpression of ATAF2 leads to an increased biomass and yellowing of the leaves, but there is no obvious phenotype in two independent ATAF2 T-DNA insertion lines. At the transcriptome level, ATAF2 overexpression resulted in repression of a number of pathogenesis-related proteins. Conversely, four of these pathogenesis-related transcripts were increased in both ATAF2 knock-out lines. ATAF2 overexpressing plants showed a higher susceptibility to the soil-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Our results indicate that ATAF2 functions as a repressor of pathogenesis-related proteins in Arabidopsis.
