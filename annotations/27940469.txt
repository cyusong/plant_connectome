C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is a carbon-concentrating mechanism that increases delivery of carbon dioxide to RuBisCO and as a consequence reduces photorespiration. The C<sub>4</sub> pathway is therefore beneficial in environments that promote high photorespiration. This pathway has evolved many times, and involves restricting gene expression to either mesophyll or bundle sheath cells. Here we review the regulatory mechanisms that control cell-preferential expression of genes in the C<sub>4</sub> cycle. From this analysis, it is clear that the C<sub>4</sub> pathway has a complex regulatory framework, with control operating at epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. Some genes of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway are regulated at multiple levels, and we propose that this ensures robust expression in each cell type. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple genes of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway may share the same regulatory mechanism. The control systems for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis gene expression appear to operate in C<sub>3</sub> plants, and so it appears that pre-existing mechanisms form the basis of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis gene expression.
