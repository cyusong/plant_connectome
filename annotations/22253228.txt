Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is a key regulator of root nodule and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses and is believed to be a decoder for Ca(2+) signals induced by microbial symbionts. However, it is unclear how CCaMK is activated by these microbes. Here, we investigated in vivo activation of CCaMK in symbiotic signaling, focusing mainly on the significance of and epistatic relationships among functional domains of CCaMK. Loss-of-function mutations in EF-hand motifs revealed the critical importance of the third EF hand for CCaMK activation to promote infection of endosymbionts. However, a gain-of-function mutation (T265D) in the kinase domain compensated for these loss-of-function mutations in the EF hands. Mutation of the CaM binding domain abolished CaM binding and suppressed CCaMK(T265D) activity in rhizobial infection, but not in mycorrhization, indicating that the requirement for CaM binding to CCaMK differs between root nodule and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that the hydrogen bond network including Thr265 has an important role in the regulation of CCaMK. Based on these genetic, biochemical, and structural studies, we propose an activation mechanism of CCaMK in which root nodule and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses are distinguished by differential regulation of CCaMK by CaM binding.
