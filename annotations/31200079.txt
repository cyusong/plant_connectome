Plants produce a myriad of structurally and functionally diverse metabolites that play many different roles in plant growth and development and in plant response to continually changing environmental conditions as well as abiotic and biotic stresses. This metabolic diversity is, to a large extent, due to chemical modification of the basic skeletons of metabolites. Here, we review the major known plant metabolite modifications and summarize the progress that has been achieved and the challenges we are facing in the field. We focus on discussing both technical and functional aspects in studying the influences that various modifications have on biosynthesis, degradation, transport, and storage of metabolites, as well as their bioactivity and toxicity. Finally, we discuss some emerging insights into the evolution of metabolic pathways and metabolite functionality.
