['24585838', "The biogenesis and activity of chloroplasts in both vascular plants and algae  depends on an intracellular network of nucleus-encoded, trans-acting factors that  control almost all aspects of organellar gene expression. Most of these  regulatory factors belong to the helical repeat protein superfamily, which  includes tetratricopeptide repeat, pentatricopeptide repeat, and the recently  identified octotricopeptide repeat (OPR) proteins. Whereas green algae express  many different OPR proteins, only a single orthologous OPR protein is encoded in  the genomes of most land plants. Here, we report the characterization of the only  OPR protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, RAP, which has previously been implicated in  plant pathogen defense. Loss of RAP led to a severe defect in processing of  chloroplast 16S rRNA resulting in impaired chloroplast translation and  photosynthesis. In vitro RNA binding and RNase protection assays revealed that  RAP has an intrinsic and specific RNA binding capacity, and the RAP binding site  was mapped to the 5' region of the 16S rRNA precursor. Nucleoid localization of  RAP was shown by transient green fluorescent protein import assays, implicating  the nucleoid as the site of chloroplast rRNA processing. Taken together, our data  indicate that the single OPR protein in Arabidopsis is important for a basic  process of chloroplast biogenesis.", '2014 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.122853', 'Bohne']
