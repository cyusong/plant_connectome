Drought stress triggers abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in guard cells and induces stomatal closure to prevent water loss in land plants. Stomatal movement is accompanied by reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Cortical microtubules disassemble in response to ABA, which is required for stomatal closure. However, how ABA signaling regulates microtubule disassembly is unclear, and the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) involved in this process remain to be identified. In this study, we show that OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1), a central component in ABA signaling, mediates microtubule disassembly during ABA-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified the MAP SPIRAL1 (SPR1) as the substrate of OST1. OST1 interacts with and phosphorylates SPR1 at Ser6, which promotes the disassociation of SPR1 from microtubules and facilitates microtubule disassembly. Compared with the wild type, the spr1 mutant exhibited significantly greater water loss and reduced ABA responses, including stomatal closure and microtubule disassembly in guard cells. These phenotypes were restored by introducing the phosphorylated active form of SPR1. Our findings demonstrate that SPR1 positively regulates microtubule disassembly during ABA-induced stomatal closure, which depends on OST1-mediated phosphorylation. These findings reveal a specific connection between a core component of ABA signaling and MAPs.
