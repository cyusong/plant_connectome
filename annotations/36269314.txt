Jatropha curcas is a drought-tolerant plant that maintains its photosynthetic pigments under prolonged drought, and quickly regains its photosynthetic capacity when water is available. It has been reported that drought stress leads to increased thermal dissipation in PSII, but that of PSI has been barely investigated, perhaps due to technical limitations in measuring the PSI absolute quantum yield. In this study, we combined biochemical analysis and spectroscopic measurements using an integrating sphere, and verified that the quantum yields of both photosystems are temporarily down-regulated under drought. We found that the decrease in the quantum yield of PSII was accompanied by a decrease in the core complexes of PSII while light-harvesting complexes are maintained under drought. In addition, in drought-treated plants, we observed a decrease in the absolute quantum yield of PSI as compared with the well-watered control, while the amount of PSI did not change, indicating that non-photochemical quenching occurs in PSI. The down-regulation of both photosystems was quickly lifted in a few days upon re-watering. Our results indicate, that in J. curcas under drought, the down-regulation of both PSII and PSI quantum yield protects the photosynthetic machinery from uncontrolled photodamage.
