Plants greatly rely on their root microbiome for uptake of nutrients and protection against stresses. Recent studies have uncovered the involvement of plant stress responses in the assembly of plant-beneficial microbiomes. To facilitate durable crop production, deciphering the driving forces that shape the microbiome is crucial.
