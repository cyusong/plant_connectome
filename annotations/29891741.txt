We investigated the effect of the heterologous expression of <i>phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase</i> (<i>ZmPepcase</i>), <i>aspartate aminotransferase</i> (<i>GmAspAT</i>), and <i>glutamine synthetase</i> (<i>NtGS</i>) on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). These transgenes were expressed either separately or in different combinations. The highest gains in shoot dry weight were observed in transgenic lines coexpressing all three genes. Tracer experiments using NaH<sup>14</sup>CO<sub>3</sub> suggested that the coexpression of <i>ZmPepcase</i>, <i>GmAspAT</i>, and <i>NtGS</i> resulted in a higher flux of assimilated CO<sub>2</sub> toward sugars and amino acids. Upon feeding the leaf discs with glycine-1-<sup>14</sup>C, transgenic lines evolved significantly lower <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> levels than the wild type, suggesting that a higher reassimilation of CO<sub>2</sub> evolved during photorespiration. Leaves of transgenic plants accumulated significantly lower ammonium without any significant difference in the levels of photorespiratory ammonium relative to the wild type, suggesting a higher reassimilation of photorespired NH<sub>3</sub> Transgenic lines also showed improved photosynthetic rates, higher shoot biomass accumulation, and improved seed yield in comparison with wild-type plants under both optimum and limiting N conditions. This work demonstrates that the heterologous coexpression of <i>ZmPepcase</i>, <i>GmAspAT</i>, and <i>NtGS</i> reduced the photorespiratory loss of C and N with concomitant enhancements in shoot biomass and seed yield.
