['21118984', 'Endocytosis is crucial for various cellular functions and development of  multicellular organisms. In mammals and yeast, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)  GTPases, key components of vesicle formation, and their regulators ARF-guanine  nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and ARF-GTPase-activating protein (GAPs)  mediate endocytosis. A similar role has not been established in plants, mainly  because of the lack of the canonical ARF and ARF-GEF components that are involved  in endocytosis in other eukaryotes. In this study, we revealed a regulatory  mechanism of endocytosis in plants based on ARF GTPase activity. We identified  that ARF-GEF GNOM and ARF-GAP vascular network defective 3 (VAN3), both of which  are involved in polar auxin transport-dependent morphogenesis, localize at the  plasma membranes as well as in intracellular structures. Variable angle  epifluorescence microscopy revealed that GNOM and VAN3 localize to partially  overlapping discrete foci at the plasma membranes that are regularly associated  with the endocytic vesicle coat clathrin. Genetic studies revealed that GNOM and  VAN3 activities are required for endocytosis and internalization of plasma  membrane proteins, including PIN-FORMED auxin transporters. These findings  identified ARF GTPase-based regulatory mechanisms for endocytosis in plants. GNOM  and VAN3 previously were proposed to function solely at the recycling endosomes  and trans-Golgi networks, respectively. Therefore our findings uncovered an  additional cellular function of these prominent developmental regulators.', '2010 Dec 14', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1016260107', 'Friml']
