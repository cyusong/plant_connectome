Peptide hormones play an important role in plant growth and development. Some of them are secreted by stem cells and also regulate plant immunity through cell-cell communication and reprogramming the expression of immune related genes, such as CLAVATA3p (CLV3p) and phytosulfokine (PSK). These peptides play similar roles as cytokines in plant innate immunity. As explosive progress of plant omics, more and more such functional peptides will be discovered. I recommend that they should be named as plant cytokines or phytocytokines. This nomenclature will be convenient for study of plant secretory peptides and plant innate immunity.
