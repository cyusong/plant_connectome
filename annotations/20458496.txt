['20458496', 'The Arabidopsis anther has a bilateral symmetry with four lobes, each consisting  of four distinct layers of somatic cells from the outer to inner side: epidermis,  endothecium, middle layer and tapetum. The tapetum is a layer of cells comprising  the inner surface of the pollen wall. It plays an important role in anther  development by providing enzymes, materials and nutrients required for pollen  maturation. Genes and molecular mechanisms underlying tapetum formation and  pollen wall biosynthesis have been studied in Arabidopsis. However, tapetum  degeneration and anther dehiscence have not been well characterized at the  molecular level. Here, we report that an Arabidopsis gene, designated reduced  male fertility (RMF), regulates degeneration of tapetum and middle layer during  anther development. The Arabidopsis dominant mutant rmf-1D overexpressing the RMF  gene exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes, including dwarfed growth with small,  dark-green leaves and low male fertility. Tapetum development and subsequent  degeneration were impaired in the mutant. Accordingly, pollen maturation was  disturbed, reducing the male fertility. In contrast, tapetum degeneration was  somewhat accelerated in the RMF RNAi plants. The RMF gene was expressed  predominantly in the anther, particularly in the pollen grains. Notably, the RMF  protein contains an F-box motif and is localized to the nucleus. It physically  interacts with the Arabidopsis-Skp1-like1 protein via the F-box motif. These  observations indicate that the RMF gene encodes an F-box protein functioning in  tapetum degeneration during anther development.', '2010 Jul', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1178-x', 'Park']
