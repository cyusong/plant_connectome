The documentation of plant growth and development requires integrative and scalable approaches to investigate and spatiotemporally resolve various dynamic processes at different levels of plant body organization. The present update deals with vigorous developments in mesoscopy, microscopy and nanoscopy methods that have been translated to imaging of plant subcellular compartments, cells, tissues and organs over the past 3 years with the aim to report recent applications and reasonable expectations from current light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and super-resolution microscopy (SRM) modalities. Moreover, the shortcomings and limitations of existing LSFM and SRM are discussed, particularly for their ability to accommodate plant samples and regarding their documentation potential considering spherical aberrations or temporal restrictions prohibiting the dynamic recording of fast cellular processes at the three dimensions. For a more comprehensive description, advances in living or fixed sample preparation methods are also included, supported by an overview of developments in labeling strategies successfully applied in plants. These strategies are practically documented by current applications employing model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., but also robust crop species such as Medicago sativa L. and Hordeum vulgare L. Over the past few years, the trend towards designing of integrative microscopic modalities has become apparent and it is expected that in the near future LSFM and SRM will be bridged to achieve broader multiscale plant imaging with a single platform.
