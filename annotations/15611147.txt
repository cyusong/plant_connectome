Plant reproduction is highly vulnerable to global climate change components such as carbon dioxide concentration ([CO(2)]), temperature (T), and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of season-long exposure to treatments of [CO(2)] at 360 (control) and 720 micromol mol(-1) (+CO(2)), temperature at 30/22 degrees C (control) and 38/30 degrees C (+T) and UV-B radiation 0 (control) and 10 kJ m(-2) d(-1) (+UV-B) on flower and pollen morphology, pollen production, germination, and tube lengths of six soybean genotypes (D 88-5320, D 90-9216, Stalwart III, PI 471938, DG 5630RR, and DP 4933RR) in sunlit, controlled environment chambers. The control treatment had 360 micromol mol(-1) [CO(2)] at 30/22 degrees C and 0 kJ UV-B. Plants grown either at +UV-B or +T, alone or in combination, produced smaller flowers with shorter standard petal and staminal column lengths. Flowers so produced had less pollen with poor pollen germination and shorter tube lengths. Pollen produced by the flowers of these plants appeared shrivelled without apertures and with disturbed exine ornamentation even at +CO(2) conditions. The damaging effects of +T and +UV-B were not ameliorated by +CO(2) conditions. Based on the total stress response index (TSRI), pooled individual component responses over all the treatments, the genotypes were classified as tolerant (DG 5630RR, D 88-5320: TSRI >-790), intermediate (D 90-9216, PI 471938: TSRI <-790 to >-1026), and sensitive (Stalwart III, DP 4933RR: TSRI <-1026). The differences in sensitivity identified among genotypes imply the options for selecting genotypes with tolerance to environmental stresses projected to occur in the future climates.
