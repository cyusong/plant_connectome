Electrical signals (ESs) can be induced by local action of stressors in plants; they influence numerous physiological processes (photosynthesis, transpiration, respiration, genes expression, synthesis of phytohormones, etc.) and, thereby, induce a systemic adaptation response. Development of optical methods of a remote sensing of this response can be important for agricultural and ecological monitoring. Preliminarily, we showed (Sukhova et al., Plant Sign Behav 2019; 14:e1610301) that burning-induced ESs induced changes in leaf reflectance at broad spectral bands (400-500, 500-600, 600-700, and 700-800 nm). The aims of the present work were (i) investigation of ESs influence on difference reflectance indices (RIs) calculated on the basis of these broad spectral bands and (ii) analysis of connection of the indices with water content in plants. Pea seedlings were investigated. ESs were induced by burning of the first mature leaf; ESs had high amplitudes in the second leaf and had low amplitudes in the fourth leaf. It was shown that ESs induced significant changes in RIs, which were calculated on basis of intensities of the reflected light at (i) 400-500 and 600-700 nm, (ii) 500-600 and 700-800 nm, and (iii) 600-700 and 700-800 nm. The effect was strong in the second leaf and weak in the fourth leaf; that is, the response was dependent on the magnitude of ESs. ESs-induced changes in RI were strongly connected with ESs-induced decrease of leaf water content which was estimated on basis of decrease of water index. Thus, broadband RIs can be used for revealing the ESs-induced systemic stress response in plants.
