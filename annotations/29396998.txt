['29396998', "Recognition of endogenous molecules acting as 'damage-associated molecular  patterns' (DAMPs) is a key feature of immunity in both animals and plants.  Oligogalacturonides (OGs), i.e. fragments derived from the hydrolysis of  homogalacturonan, a major component of pectin are a well known class of DAMPs  that activate immunity and protect plants against several microbes. However,  hyper-accumulation of OGs severely affects growth, eventually leading to cell  death and clearly pointing to OGs as players in the growth-defence trade-off.  Here we report a mechanism that may control the homeostasis of OGs avoiding their  deleterious hyper-accumulation. By combining affinity chromatography on  acrylamide-trapped OGs and other procedures, an Arabidopsis thaliana enzyme that  specifically oxidizes OGs was purified and identified. The enzyme was named OG  OXIDASE 1 (OGOX1) and shown to be encoded by the gene At4g20830. As a typical  flavo-protein, OGOX1 is a sulphite-sensitive H(2) O(2) -producing enzyme that  displays maximal activity on OGs with a degree of polymerization >4. OGOX1  belongs to a large gene family of mainly apoplastic putative FAD-binding proteins  [Berberine Bridge Enzyme-like (BBE-like); 27 members], whose biochemical and  biological function is largely unexplored. We have found that at least four  BBE-like enzymes in Arabidopsis are OG oxidases (OGOX1-4). Oxidized OGs display a  reduced capability of activating the immune responses and are less hydrolysable  by fungal polygalacturonases. Plants overexpressing OGOX1 are more resistant to  Botrytis cinerea, pointing to a crucial role of OGOX enzymes in plant immunity.", '2018 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13852', 'Cervone']
