['31701600', 'Plants have evolved powerful immune systems to recognize pathogens and avoid  invasions, but the genetic basis of plant susceptibility is less well-studied,  especially to oomycetes, which cause disastrous diseases in many ornamental  plants and food crops. In this research, we identified a negative regulator of  plant immunity to the oomycete Phytophthora parasitica, AtRTP5 (Arabidopsis  thaliana Resistant to Phytophthora 5), which encodes a WD40 repeat  domain-containing protein. The AtRTP5 protein, which was tagged with  green fluorescent protein (GFP), is localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane.  Both the A. thaliana T-DNA insertion rtp5 mutants and the Nicotiana benthamiana  RTP5 (NbRTP5) silencing plants showed enhanced resistance to P. parasitica, while  overexpression of AtRTP5 rendered plants more susceptible. The transcriptomic  analysis showed that mutation of AtRTP5 suppressed the biosynthesis of endogenous  jasmonic acid (JA) and JA-dependent responses. In contrast, salicylic acid (SA)  biosynthesis and SA-dependent responses were activated in the T-DNA insertion  mutant rtp5-3. These results show that AtRTP5 acts as a conserved negative  regulator of plant immunity to Phytophthora pathogens by interfering with JA and  SA signalling pathways.', '2020 Jan', 'Mol Plant Pathol', '10.1111/mpp.12883', 'ORCID:']
