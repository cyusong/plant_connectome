Jerusalem artichokes are a perennial crop with high drought tolerance and high value as a raw material to produce biofuels, functional feed, and food. However, there are few comprehensive metabolomic studies on Jerusalem artichokes under drought conditions. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry were used to identify differential metabolites in Jerusalem artichoke seedling leaves under polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000-simulated drought stress at 0, 18, 24, and 36 h. A total of 661 metabolites and 236 differential metabolites were identified at 0 vs. 18, 18 vs. 24, and 24 vs. 36 h. 146 differential metabolites and 56 common were identified and at 0 vs. 18, 24, and 36 h. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment identified 236 differential metabolites involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and amino acids. Metabolites involved in glycolysis, phenolic metabolism, tricarboxylic cycle, glutamate-mediated proline biosynthesis, urea cycle, amino acid metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, and the met salvage pathway responded to drought stress. A metabolic network in the leaves of Jerusalem artichokes under drought stress is proposed. These results will improve understanding of the metabolite response to drought stress in Jerusalem artichokes and develop a foundation for breeding drought-resistant varieties.
