According to the classical ABC model, B-function genes are involved in determining petal and stamen development. Most core eudicot species have B class genes belonging to three different lineages: the PI, euAP3, and TM6 lineages, although both Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum appear to have lost their TM6-like gene. Functional studies were performed for three gerbera (Gerbera hybrida) B class MADS-box genes--PI/GLO-like GGLO1, euAP3 class GDEF2, and TM6-like GDEF1--and data are shown for a second euAP3-like gene, GDEF3. In phylogenetic analysis, GDEF3 is a closely related paralogue of GDEF2, and apparently stems from a duplication common to all Asteraceae. Expression analysis and transgenic phenotypes confirm that GGLO1 and GDEF2 mediate the classical B-function since they determine petal and stamen identities. However, based on assays in yeast, three B class heterodimer combinations are possible in gerbera. In addition to the interaction of GGLO1 and GDEF2 proteins, GGLO1 also pairs with GDEF1 and GDEF3. This analysis of GDEF1 represents the first functional characterization of a TM6-like gene in a core eudicot species outside Solanaceae. Similarly to its relatives in petunia and tomato, the expression pattern and transgenic phenotypes indicate that GDEF1 is not involved in determination of petal identity, but has a redundant role in regulating stamen development.
