['33790463', 'Upon gamete fusion, animal egg cells secrete proteases from cortical granules to  establish a fertilization envelope as a block to polyspermy(1-4). Fertilization  in flowering plants is more complex and involves the delivery of two non-motile  sperm cells by pollen tubes(5,6). Simultaneous penetration of ovules by multiple  pollen tubes (polytubey) is usually avoided, thus indirectly preventing  polyspermy(7,8). How plant egg cells regulate the rejection of extra tubes after  successful fertilization is not known. Here we report that the aspartic  endopeptidases ECS1 and ECS2 are secreted to the extracellular space from a  cortical network located at the apical domain of the Arabidopsis egg cell. This  reaction is triggered only after successful fertilization. ECS1 and ECS2 are  exclusively expressed in the egg cell and transcripts are degraded immediately  after gamete fusion. ECS1 and ESC2 specifically cleave the pollen tube attractor  LURE1. As a consequence, polytubey is frequent in ecs1 ecs2 double mutants.  Ectopic secretion of these endopeptidases from synergid cells led to a decrease  in the levels of LURE1 and reduced the rate of pollen tube attraction. Together,  these findings demonstrate that plant egg cells sense successful fertilization  and elucidate a mechanism as to how a relatively fast post-fertilization block to  polytubey is established by fertilization-induced degradation of attraction  factors.', '2021 Apr', 'Nature', '10.1038/s41586-021-03387-5', 'ORCID:']
