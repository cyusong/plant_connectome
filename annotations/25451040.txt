['25451040', "Many photosynthetic organisms globally, including crops, forests and algae, must  grow in environments where the availability of light energy fluctuates  dramatically. How photosynthesis maintains high efficiency despite such  fluctuations in its energy source remains poorly understood. Here we show that  Arabidopsis thaliana K(+) efflux antiporter (KEA3) is critical for high  photosynthetic efficiency under fluctuating light. On a shift from dark to low  light, or high to low light, kea3 mutants show prolonged dissipation of absorbed  light energy as heat. KEA3 localizes to the thylakoid membrane, and allows proton  efflux from the thylakoid lumen by proton/potassium antiport. KEA3's activity  accelerates the downregulation of pH-dependent energy dissipation after  transitions to low light, leading to faster recovery of high photosystem II  quantum efficiency and increased CO2 assimilation. Our results reveal a mechanism  that increases the efficiency of photosynthesis under fluctuating light.", '2014 Nov 13', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms6439', 'Jonikas']
