cyclo-Oxylipin-galactolipids (cGL) are mono- or digalactosyldiglycerides carrying a cyclo-oxylipin in the sn1- and/or sn2-position or esterified to the galactose moiety. These compounds were recently identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. We provide evidence that cGL are mainly, if not exclusively, part of the thylakoid and can be hydrolysed by lipolytic activities associated with photosynthesis-related protein complexes in vitro. Using HPLC/ESI-mass spectrometry, cGL are shown to be restricted in occurrence to the genus Arabidopsis, they do not occur in other plants tested. A. thaliana cGL are rapidly and transiently formed upon wounding with characteristic changes in composition of the cGL-fraction. While the biological role of cGL is not understood, the genus Arabidopsis may present a model-case of chemical evolution of a novel class of regulatory molecules.
