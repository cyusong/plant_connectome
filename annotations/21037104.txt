Apomictic plants reproduce asexually through seeds by avoiding both meiosis and fertilization. Although apomixis is genetically regulated, its core genetic component(s) has not been determined yet. Using profiling experiments comparing sexual development in maize (Zea mays) to apomixis in maize-Tripsacum hybrids, we identified six loci that are specifically downregulated in ovules of apomictic plants. Four of them share strong homology with members of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, which in Arabidopsis thaliana is involved in silencing via DNA methylation. Analyzing loss-of-function alleles for two maize DNA methyltransferase genes belonging to that subset, dmt102 and dmt103, which are downregulated in the ovules of apomictic plants and are homologous to the Arabidopsis CHROMOMETHYLASEs and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE families, revealed phenotypes reminiscent of apomictic development, including the production of unreduced gametes and formation of multiple embryo sacs in the ovule. Loss of DMT102 activity in ovules resulted in the establishment of a transcriptionally competent chromatin state in the archesporial tissue and in the egg cell that mimics the chromatin state found in apomicts. Interestingly, dmt102 and dmt103 expression in the ovule is found in a restricted domain in and around the germ cells, indicating that a DNA methylation pathway active during reproduction is essential for gametophyte development in maize and likely plays a critical role in the differentiation between apomictic and sexual reproduction.
