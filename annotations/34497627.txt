Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) is the causative agent of viral nervous necrosis (VNN), which is one of the most serious fish diseases leading to mass mortality in a wide range of fish species worldwide. Although a few injectable inactivated vaccines are commercially available, there is a need for more labor-saving, cost-effective, and fish-friendly immunization methods. The use of transgenic plants expressing pathogen-derived recombinant antigens as edible vaccines is an ideal way to meet these requirements. In this study, chloroplast genetic engineering was successfully utilized to overexpress the red-spotted grouper NNV capsid protein (RGNNV-CP). The RGNNV-CP accumulated at high levels in all young, mature, and old senescent leaves of transplastomic tobacco plants (averaging approximately 3 mg/g leaf fresh weight). The RGNNV-CP efficiently self-assembled into virus-like particles (RGNNV-VLPs) in the chloroplast stroma of the transgenic lines, which could be readily observed by <i>in situ</i> transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection and oral administration of the crudely purified protein extract containing chloroplast-derived RGNNV-VLPs provided the sevenband grouper fish with sufficient protection against RGNNV challenge, and its immunogenicity was comparable to that of a commercial injectable vaccine. These findings indicate that chloroplast-derived VLP vaccines may play a promising role in the prevention of various diseases, not only in fish but also in other animals, including humans.
