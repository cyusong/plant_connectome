['21444209', 'Although sucrose availability is crucial for commitment to plant cell division  during G1 phase, it has remained uncertain how protein levels of core cell cycle  genes are regulated. We found that Arabidopsis retinoblastoma-related protein1  (AtRBR1) and three E2F proteins were degraded under limited sucrose conditions,  while protein abundance increased in response to treatment with the proteasome  inhibitor MG132. We conclude that Arabidopsis key cell cycle proteins are  degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner during sucrose starvation in  Arabidopsis suspension MM2d cells.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.03.001', 'Sekine']
