In nature, plants constantly have to face pathogen attacks. However, plant disease rarely occurs due to efficient immune systems possessed by the host plants. Pathogens are perceived by two different recognition systems that initiate the so-called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI), both of which are accompanied by a set of induced defenses that usually repel pathogen attacks. Here we discuss the complex network of signaling pathways occurring during PTI, focusing on the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases.

PTI: !initiates! Pattern-triggered immunity
Pathogens: !perceived by! Two recognition systems 
MMPKs: !involved in! Signaling pathways during PTI
Defenses: !induced by! PTI and ETI
Pathogen attacks: !repelled by! Induced defenses
