Many strains from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> are known for their genomic robustness and antimicrobial potentials. As a result, the quest for their biotechnological applications, especially in the agroindustry (e.g., as biopesticides), has increased over the years. This study documents the genome sequencing and probing of a <i>Fusarium</i> antagonist (<i>B. thuringiensis</i> strain MORWBS1.1) with possible biopesticidal metabolite producing capacity from South Africa. Based on in vitro evaluation and in silico antiSMASH investigation, <i>B. thuringiensis</i> strain MORWBS1.1 exhibited distinctive genomic properties that could be further exploited for in planta and food additive production purposes.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
