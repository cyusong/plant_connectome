Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins play important roles in plant defense response to drought stress. However, genome-wide identification of the <i>LEA</i> gene family was not revealed in <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i>. In this study, 61 <i>SmLEA</i> genes were identified from <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> and divided into 7 subfamilies according to their conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships. <i>SmLEA</i> genes contained the LEA conserved motifs and few introns. <i>SmLEA</i> genes of the same subfamilies had similar gene structures and predicted subcellular locations. Our results indicated that the promoters of <i>SmLEA</i> genes contained various <i>cis</i>-acting elements associated with abiotic stress response. In addition, RNA-seq and real-time PCR results suggested that <i>SmLEA</i> genes are specifically expressed in different tissue, and most <i>SmLEA</i> genes can be induced by drought stress. These results provide a valuable foundation for future functional investigations of <i>SmLEA</i> genes and drought stress-resistant breeding of <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i>.
