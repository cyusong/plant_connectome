Biochar is a promising soil additive for use in support of sustainable crop production. However, the high level of heterogeneity in biochar properties and the variations in soil composition present significant challenges to the successful uptake of biochar technologies in diverse agricultural soils. An improved understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to biochar-soil interactions is required to address issues related to climate change and cultivation practices. This review summarizes biochar modification approaches (physical, chemical, and biochar-based organic composites) and discusses the potential role of biochar in sustainable crop production and soil resiliency, including the degradation of soil organic matter, the improvement of soil quality, and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Biochar design is crucial to successful soil remediation, particularly with regard to issues arising from soil structure and composition related to crop production. Given the wide variety of feedstocks for biochar production and the resultant high surface heterogeneity, greater efforts are required to optimize biochar surface functionality and porosity through appropriate modifications. The design and establishment of these approaches and methods are essential for the future utilization of biochar as an effective soil additive to promote sustainable crop production.
