The presence of specialized cellular compartments in higher plants express an extraordinary degree of intracellular organization, which provides efficient mechanisms to avoid misbalancing of the metabolism. This offers the flexibility by which plants can quickly acclimate to fluctuating environmental conditions. For that, a fine temporal and spatial regulation of metabolic pathways is required and involves several players e.g. organic acids. In this review we discuss different facets of the organic acid metabolism within plant cells with special focus to those related to the interactions between organic acids compartmentalization and the partitioning of carbon and nitrogen. The connections between organic acids and CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acids metabolism, and redox status are highlighted. Moreover, the key enzymes and transporters as well as their function on the coordination of interorganellar metabolic exchanges are discussed.
