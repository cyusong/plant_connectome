Sheath blight of rice caused by necrotrophic plant pathogen <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> is one of the most common fungal diseases of rice leading to significant yield loss. Among the defense responses exhibited by the host plants towards fungal infections, those functional within the apoplast contribute significantly. Here, we have studied apoplastic defense response of rice towards <i>R. solani</i> during sheath blight infection. The transcriptome of <i>R. solani</i>-infected rice plants was compared with that of uninfected rice, to identify the set of defense genes that undergo differential expression and code for proteins with a predicted N-terminal signal peptide. Significant changes in the stress-responsive, molecular signal perception, protein modification, and metabolic process pathways represented by a group of differentially expressed genes were observed. Our data also revealed two secreted protease inhibitors from rice that exhibit increased expression during <i>R. solani</i> infection and induce disease resistance when expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>.
