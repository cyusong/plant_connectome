['11042177', 'Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a multisubunit complex that is required  for binding of mRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits, stabilization of ternary complex  binding to 40 S subunits, and dissociation of 40 and 60 S subunits. These  functions and the complex nature of eIF3 suggest multiple interactions with many  components of the translational machinery. Recently, the subunits of mammalian  and Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF3 were identified, and substantial differences in  the subunit composition of mammalian and S. cerevisiae were observed. Mammalian  eIF3 consists of 11 nonidentical subunits, whereas S. cerevisiae eIF3 consists of  up to eight nonidentical subunits. Only five of the subunits of mammalian and S.  cerevisiae are shared in common, and these five subunits comprise a "core"  complex in S. cerevisiae. eIF3 from wheat consists of at least 10 subunits, but  their relationship to either the mammalian or S. cerevisiae eIF3 subunits is  unknown. Peptide sequences derived from purified wheat eIF3 subunits were used to  correlate each subunit with mammalian and/or S. cerevisiae subunits. The peptide  sequences were also used to identify Arabidopsis thaliana cDNAs for each of the  eIF3 subunits. We report seven new cDNAs for A. thaliana eIF3 subunits. A.  thaliana eIF3 was purified and characterized to confirm that the subunit  composition and activity of wheat and A. thaliana eIF3 were similar. We report  that plant eIF3 closely resembles the subunit composition of mammalian eIF3,  having 10 out of 11 subunits in common. Further, we find a novel subunit in the  plant eIF3 complex not present in either mammalian or S. cerevisiae eIF3. These  results suggest that plant and mammalian eIF3 evolved similarly, whereas S.  cerevisiae has diverged.', '2001 Jan 19', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M007236200', 'Browning']
