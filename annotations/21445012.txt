Jasmonates (JAs) induce leaf senescence in many plant species. The Arabidopsis F-box protein coronatine insensitive 1 (COI1) is required for various JA-regulated plant responses including plant fertility, defense responses and leaf senescence. However, the molecular basis for COI1-dependent JA-induced leaf senescence remains unknown. In our Plant Physiology paper, we identified a COI1-dependent JA-repressed protein, Rubisco activase (RCA) in Arabidopsis. Further genetic and physiological analyses showed that the COI1-dependent JA repression of RCA correlated with JA-induced leaf senescence, and that loss of RCA led to typical senescence-associated features. Therefore, we suggested that the COI1-dependent JA repression of RCA played an important role in JA-induced leaf senescence. In this addendum, we made a relatively deep discussion on RCA function in JA-induced leaf senescence and JA-mediated defense responses. We also discussed the possible role of JA in plant natural senescence.
