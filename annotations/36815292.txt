Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs) are valuable genetic resources for unraveling plant defense responses including programmed cell death (PCD). Here, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) LMM, spotted leaf 38 (spl38), and demonstrated that spl38 is essential for the formation of hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions and innate immunity. Map-based cloning revealed that SPL38 encodes MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 16 (OsMED16). The spl38 mutant showed enhanced resistance to rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and exhibited delayed flowering, while OsMED16-overexpressing plants showed increased rice susceptibility to M. oryzae. The OsMED16-edited rice lines were phenotypically similar to the spl38 mutant but were extremely weak, exhibited growth retardation, and eventually died. The C-terminus of OsMED16 showed interaction with the positive immune regulator PATHOGENESIS RELATED 3 (OsPR3), resulting in the competitive repression of its chitinase and chitin-binding activities. Furthermore, the ospr3 osmed16 double mutants did not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the spl38 mutant. Strikingly, OsMED16 exhibited an opposite function in plant defense relative to that of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtMED16, most likely because of two amino acid substitutions between the monocot and dicot MED16s tested. Collectively, our findings suggest that OsMED16 negatively regulates cell death and immunity in rice, probably via the OsPR3-mediated chitin signaling pathway.
