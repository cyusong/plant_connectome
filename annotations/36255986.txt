Rosaceae is an economically important plant family that can be affected by a multitude of pathogenic microbes, some of which can cause dramatic losses in production. As a type of pattern-recognition receptor, receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are considered vital regulators of plant immunity. Based on genome-wide identification, bioinformatic analysis, and functional determination, we investigated the evolutionary characteristics of RLPs, and specifically those that regulate Valsa canker, a devastating fungal disease affecting apple and pear production. A total of 3028 RLPs from the genomes of 19 species, including nine Rosaceae, were divided into 24 subfamilies. Five subfamilies and seven co-expression modules were found to be involved in the responses to Valsa canker signals of the resistant pear rootstock Pyrus betulifolia 'Duli-G03'. Fourteen RLPs were subsequently screened as candidate genes for regulation of resistance. Among these, PbeRP23 (Chr13.g24394) and PbeRP27 (Chr16.g31400) were identified as key resistance genes that rapidly enhance the resistance of 'Duli-G03' and strongly initiate immune responses, and hence they have potential for further functional exploration and breeding applications for resistance to Valsa canker. In addition, as a consequence of this work we have established optimal methods for the classification and screening of disease-resistant RLPs.
