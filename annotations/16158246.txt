The paper reports an 'in silico' approach to gene expression analysis based on a barley gene co-expression network resulting from the study of several publicly available cDNA libraries. The work is an application of Systems Biology to plant science: at the end of the computational step we identified groups of potentially related genes. The communities of co-expressed genes constructed from the network are remarkably characterized from the functional point of view, as shown by the statistical analysis of the Gene Ontology annotations of their members. Experimental, lab-based testing has been carried out to check the relationship between network and biological properties and to identify and suggest effective strategies of information extraction from the network-derived data.
