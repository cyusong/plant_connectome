Guaranteeing successful flowering is very important in economic plant species, especially apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), which is difficult to induce to flower. However, the gene expression and networks involved in flowering have not been totally characterized. Here, we employed mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing to understand the different responses to gibberellin- and its inhibitor paclobutrazol- (PAC) mediated flower induction. Significant opposite cytological and morphological changes were observed in treated terminal buds, which led to a reduced flowering rate under gibberellin and an increased flowering rate under PAC. We also found that the differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs and miRNA target genes participated in different biological networks including hormones, photosynthesis, redox state and other metabolic processes, which provided important clues to understand the complex networks involved in apple flower induction. Additionally, we subsequently focused on one important candidate, MdSPL3, which is one of 31 apple SPL gene family members and whose transcription was inhibited by gibberellin but promoted by PAC. Functional investigation showed that MdSPL3 was located in the nucleus, and ectopic MdSPL3 activated floral meristem identity genes, promoted the formation of floral primordia and led to an earlier flowering phenotype in Arabidopsis. Our research identified critical mRNA and miRNA responsive to gibberellin or PAC, and provided a candidate framework for flower induction. This carefully orchestrated regulatory cross-talk highlighted potential targets for developing regulatory techniques and genetic improvement of flower induction in apple.
