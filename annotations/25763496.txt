Sensing and responding toward gravity vector is a complicated and multistep process. Gravity is a constant factor feeding plants with reliable information for the spatial orientation of their organs. Auxin, cytokinin, ethylene and BRs have been the most explored hormones in relation to gravitropism. We have previously shown that glucose (Glc) could promote brassinosteroid (BR) signaling thereby inducing changes in root directional growth. Auxin signaling and polar transport components are also involved in Glc induced changes in root directional growth. Here, we provide evidence for involvement of cytokinin and ethylene signaling components in regulation of root directional growth downstream to Glc and BR. Altogether, Glc mediated change in root direction is an adaptive feature which is a result of a collaborative effort integrating phytohormonal signaling cues.
