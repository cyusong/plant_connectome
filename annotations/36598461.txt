The regulatory mechanism of the MBW (MYB-bHLH-WD40) complex in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) remains unclear. In the present study, we show that the separate overexpression of the genes CtbHLH41, CtMYB63, and CtWD40-6 in Arabidopsis thaliana increased anthocyanin and procyanidin contents in the transgenic plants and partially rescued the trichome reduction phenotype of the corresponding bhlh41, myb63, and wd40-6 single mutants. Overexpression of CtbHLH41, CtMYB63, or CtWD40-6 in safflower significantly increased the content of the natural pigment hydroxysafflor yellow A (HYSA) and negatively regulated safflower petal size. Yeast-two-hybrid, functional, and genetic assays demonstrated that the safflower E3 ligase CtBB1 (BIG BROTHER 1) can ubiquitinate CtbHLH41, marking it for degradation through the 26S proteasome and negatively regulating flavonoid accumulation. CtMYB63/CtWD40-6 enhanced the transcriptional activity of CtbHLH41 on the CtDFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase) promoter. We propose that the MBW-CtBB1 regulatory module may play an important role in coordinating HYSA accumulation with other response mechanisms.
