['15772288', 'Auxin has been shown to be important for many aspects of root development,  including initiation and emergence of lateral roots, patterning of the root  apical meristem, gravitropism, and root elongation. Auxin biosynthesis occurs in  both aerial portions of the plant and in roots; thus, the auxin required for root  development could come from either source, or both. To monitor putative internal  sites of auxin synthesis in the root, a method for measuring indole-3-acetic acid  (IAA) biosynthesis with tissue resolution was developed. We monitored IAA  synthesis in 0.5- to 2-mm sections of Arabidopsis thaliana roots and were able to  identify an important auxin source in the meristematic region of the primary root  tip as well as in the tips of emerged lateral roots. Lower but significant  synthesis capacity was observed in tissues upward from the tip, showing that the  root contains multiple auxin sources. Root-localized IAA synthesis was diminished  in a cyp79B2 cyp79B3 double knockout, suggesting an important role for  Trp-dependent IAA synthesis pathways in the root. We present a model for how the  primary root is supplied with auxin during early seedling development.', '2005 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.029272', 'Sandberg']
