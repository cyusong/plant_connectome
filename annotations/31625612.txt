Anthocyanin fruit (Aft) and atroviolacea (atv) were characterized in wild tomato and can enhance anthocyanin content in tomato fruit. However, the gene underlying the Aft locus and the mechanism by which Aft and atv act remain largely unknown. In this study, the Aft locus was fine-mapped to an approximately 145-kb interval on chromosome 10, excluding SlAN2 (Solyc10g086250), SlANT1 (Solyc10g086260) and SlANT1-like (Solyc10g086270), which have previously been suggested as candidates. Thus, the R2R3-MYB transcription factor SlAN2-like (Solyc10g086290) was considered the best candidate gene for Aft. The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated SlAN2-like mutants show a much lower accumulation of anthocyanins associated with the downregulation of multiple anthocyanin-related genes compared to the wild-type tomato, indicating that SlAN2-like is responsible for the Aft phenotype. The repressive function of SlMYBATV also was confirmed through the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. A yeast-two-hybrid assay revealed that SlMYBATV interacts with the bHLH protein SlJAF13. Furthermore, yeast-one-hybrid and dual-luciferase transient expression assays showed that Aft directly binds to the SlMYBATV promoter and activates its expression. The results herein provide candidate genes to enhance anthocyanin content in tomato fruit. This research also provides insight into a mechanism involving the Aft-SlMYBATV pathway that fine-tunes anthocyanin accumulation in tomato fruit.
