High-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporters (HKTs) are known as transmembrane cation transporters and are involved in Na<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> transport in plants. In this study, a novel HKT gene <i>SeHKT1;2</i> was isolated and characterized from the halophyte, <i>Salicornia europaea</i>. It belongs to subfamily I of HKT and shows high homology with other halophyte HKT proteins. Functional characterization of <i>SeHKT1;2</i> indicated that it contributes to facilitating Na<sup>+</sup> uptake in Na<sup>+</sup>-sensitive yeast strains G19, however, cannot rescue the K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective phenotype of yeast strain CY162, demonstrating SeHKT1;2 selectively transports Na<sup>+</sup> rather than K<sup>+</sup>. The addition of K<sup>+</sup> along with NaCl relieved the Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity. Furthermore, heterologous expression of <i>SeHKT1;2</i> in <i>sos1</i> mutant of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> increased salt sensitivity and could not rescued the transgenic plants. This study will provide valuable gene resources for improving the salt tolerance in other crops by genetic engineering.
