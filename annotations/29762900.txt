We developed simplified single transcriptional unit (SSTU) CRISPR systems for multiplex gene editing in rice using FnCpf1, LbCpf1 or Cas9, in which the nuclease and its crRNA array are co-expressed from a single Pol II promoter, without any additional processing machinery. Our SSTU systems are easy to construct and effective in mediating multiplex genome editing.

Pol II promoter: !expresses! nuclease and crRNA array 
nuclease: !mediates! multiplex genome editing 
FnCpf1/LbCpf1/Cas9: !used in! SSTU CRISPR systems 
SSTU systems: !simplify! gene editing in rice
