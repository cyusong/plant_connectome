Hybrid production using lines with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has become an important way to utilize heterosis in vegetables. Ogura CMS, with the advantages of complete pollen abortion, ease of transfer and a progeny sterility rate reaching 100%, is widely used in cruciferous crop breeding. The mapping, cloning, mechanism and application of Ogura CMS and fertility restorer genes in <i>Brassica napus</i>, <i>Brassica rapa</i>, <i>Brassica oleracea</i> and other cruciferous crops are reviewed herein, and the existing problems and future research directions in the application of Ogura CMS are discussed.
