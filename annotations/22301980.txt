Cell separation processes, such as abscission, are critical for plant development and play key roles from sculpting the form of the plant to scattering seeds. It is however essential that such processes are under tight temporal and spatial regulation. Floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by a ligand-receptor module consisting of the signaling peptide INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) and the two receptor-like kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2), and it is the restricted expression pattern of IDA that hinders cell separation from occurring in the abscission zones (AZs) of other organs where HAE and HSL2 are present. In the July issue of The Plant Cell we report on the identification of additional components acting downstream in the IDA signaling pathway. Through a screen for mutations that restore floral organ abscission in ida mutants, we identified two new alleles of the KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP)/KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA1 (KNAT1) and show that BP/KNAT1 is important in regulating the timing of floral abscission by controlling AZ cell size and by regulating KNAT2 and KNAT6.

IDA: !regulates! HAE/HSL2
BP/KNAT1: !controls! AZ cell size
BP/KNAT1: !regulates! KNAT2/KNAT6
