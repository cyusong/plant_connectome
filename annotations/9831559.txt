['9831559', 'The NPH1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a 120-kilodalton serine-threonine  protein kinase hypothesized to function as a photoreceptor for phototropism. When  expressed in insect cells, the NPH1 protein is phosphorylated in response to blue  light irradiation. The biochemical and photochemical properties of the  photosensitive protein reflect those of the native protein in microsomal  membranes. Recombinant NPH1 noncovalently binds flavin mononucleotide, a likely  chromophore for light-dependent autophosphorylation. The fluorescence excitation  spectrum of the recombinant protein is similar to the action spectrum for  phototropism, consistent with the conclusion that NPH1 is an autophosphorylating  flavoprotein photoreceptor mediating phototropic responses in higher plants.', '1998 Nov 27', 'Science', '10.1126/science.282.5394.1698', 'Briggs']
