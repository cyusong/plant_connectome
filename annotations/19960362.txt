['19960362', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana the putative mitochondrial RNA helicases PMH1 and PMH2  are members of the large DEAD-box protein family. Our previous characterization  of these proteins revealed that PMH1 and/or PMH2 are part of high molecular  weight complexes. Now T-DNA insertion lines were established and characterized  for each of these genes. Immunodetection analysis of cell suspension cultures  established from pmh1-1 and pmh2-1 mutants revealed that indeed both DEAD-box  proteins are detectable in large protein complexes with PMH2 being much more  abundant than PMH1. In plants the knockout of PMH2 leads to reduced group II  intron splicing efficiency. In addition the steady-state levels of several mature  mitochondrial mRNAs are decreased while transcription is not influenced. This  molecular phenotype suggests that PMH2 acts at the posttranscriptional level with  a potential function as RNA chaperone required for formation or maintenance of  complex RNA secondary structures of introns rather than a direct role in  splicing. In contrast, the investigation of a pmh1-1 knockout line did not reveal  any influence of this protein on processing and abundance of mitochondrial  transcripts.', '2010 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-009-9584-9', 'Binder']
