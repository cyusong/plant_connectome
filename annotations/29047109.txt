Downregulation of lignin in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is associated with increased availability of cell wall polysaccharides in plant cells. We tested transgenic alfalfa plants downregulated for Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) against an economically important fungal disease of alfalfa, Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis, and found it more resistant to this disease. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses indicated that the improved disease resistance against Fusarium wilt is due to increased accumulation and/or spillover of flux towards the (iso)flavonoid pathway. Some (iso)flavonoids and their pathway intermediate compounds showed strong accumulation in CCoAOMT downregulated plants after F. oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis inoculation. The identified (iso)flavonoids, including medicarpin and 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone, inhibited the in vitro growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis. These results suggested that the increased accumulation and/or shift/spillover of flux towards the (iso)flavonoid pathway in CCoAOMT downregulated plants is associated with induced disease resistance.
