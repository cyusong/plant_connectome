Phytophthora blight (PB) caused by <i>Phytophthora nicotianae</i> is a highly destructive disease in sesame (<i>Sesamum indicum</i> L.). In this study, we used linkage mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes associated with PB resistance. The QTL mapping in 90 RILs of the Goenbaek × Osan cross using genotyping-by-sequencing detected significant QTLs for PB resistance on chromosome 10, explaining 12.79%-13.34% of phenotypic variation. Association of this locus to PB resistance was also revealed through bulked segregant analysis in second RIL population (Goenbaek × Milsung cross) comprising 188 RILs. The GWAS of 87 sesame accessions evaluated against three <i>P. nicotianae</i> isolates identified 29 SNPs on chromosome 10 significantly associated with PB resistance. These SNPs were located within a 0.79 Mb region, which co-located with the QTL intervals identified in RIL populations, and hence scanned for identifying candidate genes. This region contained several defense-related candidate <i>R</i> genes, five of which were selected for quantitative expression analysis. One of these genes, <i>SIN_1019016</i> was found to show significantly higher expression in the resistant parent compared to that in the susceptible parents and selected RILs. Paired-end sequencing of the gene <i>SIN_1019016</i> in parental cultivars revealed two synonymous SNPs between Goenbaek and Osan in exon 2 of coding DNA sequence. These results suggested <i>SIN_1019016</i> as one of the candidate gene conferring PB resistance in sesame. The findings from this study will be useful in the marker-assisted selection as well as the functional analysis of PB resistance candidate gene(s) in sesame.
