In both applied and basic research, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is commonly used to introduce genes into plants. We investigated the effect of three Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains and five transferred (T)-DNA origins of replication on transformation frequency, transgene copy number, and the frequency of integration of non-T-DNA portions of the T-DNA-containing vector (backbone) into the genome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and maize (Zea mays). Launching T-DNA from the picA locus of the Agrobacterium chromosome increases the frequency of single transgene integration events and almost eliminates the presence of vector backbone sequences in transgenic plants. Along with novel Agrobacterium strains we have developed, our findings are useful for improving the quality of T-DNA integration events.
