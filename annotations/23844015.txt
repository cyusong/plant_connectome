['23844015', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid ((+)-ABA) plays a key role in many processes. The  biological and biochemical activities of unnatural (-)-ABA have been extensively  investigated since 1960s. However, the recognition mechanism by which only a few  members among PYR/PYL/RCAR (PYLs) family can bind (-)-ABA remains largely  unknown. Here we systematically characterized the affinity of PYLs binding to the  (-)-ABA and reported the crystal structures of apo-PYL5, PYL3-(-)-ABA and  PYL9-(+)-ABA. PYL5 showed the strongest binding affinity with (-)-ABA among all  the PYLs. PYL9 is a stringently exclusive (+)-ABA receptor with interchangeable  disulfide bonds shared by a subclass of PYLs. PYL3 is a dual receptor to both ABA  enantiomers. The binding orientation and pocket of (-)-ABA in PYLs are obviously  different from those of (+)-ABA. Steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction are  the two key factors in determining the stereospecificity of PYLs binding to  (-)-ABA, which is further confirmed by gain-of-function and loss-of-function  mutagenesis. Our results provide novel insights of the bioactivity of ABA  enantiomers onto PYLs, and shed light on designing the selective ABA receptors  agonists.', '2013', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0067477', 'Chen']
