Symbiotic microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) produce both conserved microbial molecules that activate plant defense and lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) that modulate plant defense. Beside a well-established role of LCOs in activation of a signaling pathway required for AMF penetration in roots, LCO perception and defense modulation during arbuscular mycorrhiza is not well understood. Here we show that members of the LYRIIIA phylogenetic group from the multigenic Lysin Motif Receptor-Like Kinase family have a conserved role in dicotyledons as modulators of plant defense and regulate AMF colonization in the Solanaceae species Nicotiana benthamiana. Interestingly, these proteins have high-affinity for LCOs in plant species able to form a symbiosis with AMF but have lost this property in species that have lost this ability. Our data support the hypothesis that LYRIIIA proteins modulate plant defense upon LCO perception to facilitate AMF colonization in mycotrophic plant species and that only their role in plant defense, but not their ability to be regulated by LCOs, has been conserved in non-mycotrophic plants.
