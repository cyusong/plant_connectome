Most organisms have developed various strategies to react rapidly to temperature down-shift and regulate expression of various genes to acclimate to low temperature. In photosynthetic organisms, temperature down-shift in the light results in not only a decrease in growth temperature but also an increase in PSII excitation pressure. Distinguishing the effects of low temperature from the effects of excitation pressure is necessary to understand the mechanism of low-temperature signal transduction. In this report, we analyzed changes in gene expression after three different environmental changes, i.e. temperature down-shift in the light, temperature down-shift in the dark and transfer to the dark, using DNA microarray in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. By comparing the expression patterns under the three experimental conditions, we identified 15 open reading frames (ORFs) that were up-regulated by temperature down-shift both in the light and in the dark. These ORFs are considered to be regulated by low temperature, but not by excitation pressure. Six of them have a consensus sequence within the upstream region of their coding region and were indicated also to be up-regulated by tetracycline. Functional or structural changes in the ribosome could affect transcript levels of the low-temperature-regulated ORFs.
