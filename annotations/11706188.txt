['11706188', 'Arabidopsis and other Brassicaceae produce an enormous diversity of aliphatic  glucosinolates, a group of methionine (Met)-derived plant secondary compounds  containing a beta-thio-glucose moiety, a sulfonated oxime, and a variable side  chain. We fine-scale mapped GSL-ELONG, a locus controlling variation in the  side-chain length of aliphatic glucosinolates. Within this locus, a polymorphic  gene was identified that determines whether Met is extended predominantly by  either one or by two methylene groups to produce aliphatic glucosinolates with  either three- or four-carbon side chains. Two allelic mutants deficient in  four-carbon side-chain glucosinolates were shown to contain independent missense  mutations within this gene. In cell-free enzyme assays, a heterologously  expressed cDNA from this locus was capable of condensing  2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoic acid with acetyl-coenzyme A, the initial reaction in  Met chain elongation. The gene methylthioalkylmalate synthase1 (MAM1) is a member  of a gene family sharing approximately 60% amino acid sequence similarity with  2-isopropylmalate synthase, an enzyme of leucine biosynthesis that condenses  2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate with acetyl-coenzyme A.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '6880', 'Mitchell-Olds']
