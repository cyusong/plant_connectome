The floral quartet model proposes that plant MADS box proteins function as higher order tetrameric complexes. However, in planta evidence for MADS box tetramers remains scarce. Here, we applied a strategy using in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based on the distance change and distance symmetry of stable tetrameric complexes in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaf cells to improve the accuracy of the estimation of heterotetrameric complex formation. This measuring system precisely verified the stable state of Arabidopsis petal (AP3/PI/SEP3/AP1) and stamen (AP3/PI/SEP3/AG) complexes and showed that the lily (Lilium longiflorum) PI co-orthologs LMADS8 and LMADS9 likely formed heterotetrameric petal complexes with Arabidopsis AP3/SEP3/AP1, which rescued petal defects of pi mutants. However, L8/L9 did not form heterotetrameric stamen complexes with Arabidopsis AP3/SEP3/AG to rescue the stamen defects of the pi mutants. Importantly, this system was applied successfully to find complicated tepal and stamen heterotetrameric complexes in lily. We found that heterodimers of B function AP3/PI orthologs (L1/L8) likely coexist with the homodimers of PI orthologs (L8/L8, L9/L9) to form five (two most stable and three stable) tepal- and four (one most stable and three stable) stamen-related heterotetrameric complexes with A/E and C/E function proteins in lily. Among these combinations, L1 preferentially interacted with L8 to form the most stable heterotetrameric complexes, and the importance of the L8/L8 and L9/L9 homodimers in tepal/stamen formation in lily likely decreased to a minor part during evolution. The system provides substantial improvements for successfully estimating the existence of unknown tetrameric complexes in plants.
