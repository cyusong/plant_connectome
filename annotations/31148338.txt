The sophisticated uptake and translocation regulation of the essential element boron (B) in plants is ensured by two transmembrane transporter families: the Nodulin26-like Intrinsic Protein (NIP) and BOR transporter family. Though the agriculturally important crop Brassica napus is highly sensitive to B deficiency, and NIPs and BORs have been suggested to be responsible for B efficiency in this species, functional information of these transporter subfamilies is extremely rare. Here, we molecularly characterized the NIP and BOR1 transporter family in the European winter-type cv. Darmor-PBY018. Our transport assays in the heterologous oocyte and yeast expression systems as well as in growth complementation assays in planta demonstrated B transport activity of NIP5, NIP6, NIP7 and BOR1 isoforms. Moreover, we provided functional and quantitative evidence that also members of the NIP2, NIP3 and NIP4 groups facilitate the transport of B. A detailed B- and tissue-dependent B-transporter expression map was generated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We showed that NIP5 isoforms are highly upregulated under B-deficient conditions in roots, but also in shoot tissues. Moreover, we detected transcripts of several B-permeable NIPs from various groups in floral tissues that contribute to the B distribution within the highly B deficiency-sensitive flowers.
