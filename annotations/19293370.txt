['19293370', 'Nucleoside degradation and salvage are important metabolic pathways but hardly  understood in plants. Recent work on human pathogenic protozoans like Leishmania  and Trypanosoma substantiates an essential function of nucleosidase activity.  Plant nucleosidases are related to those from protozoans and connect the pathways  of nucleoside degradation and salvage. Here, we describe the cloning of such an  enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana, Uridine-Ribohydrolase 1 (URH1) and the  characterization by complementation of a yeast mutant. Furthermore, URH1 was  synthesized as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. The pure recombinant  protein exhibited highest hydrolase activity for uridine, followed by inosine and  adenosine, the corresponding K(m) values were 0.8, 1.4, and 0.7 mM, respectively.  In addition, URH1 was able to cleave the cytokinin derivative  isopentenyladenine-riboside. Promoter beta-glucuronidase fusion studies revealed  that URH1 is mainly transcribed in the vascular cells of roots and in root tips,  guard cells, and pollen. Mutants expressing the Arabidopsis enzyme or the homolog  from rice (Oryza sativa) exhibit resistance toward toxic fluorouridine,  fluorouracil, and fluoroorotic acid, providing clear evidence for a pivotal  function of URH1 as regulative in pyrimidine degradation. Moreover, mutants with  increased and decreased nucleosidase activity are delayed in germination,  indicating that this enzyme activity must be well balanced in the early phase of  plant development.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062612', 'Mohlmann']
