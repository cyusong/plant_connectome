Stigma presentation has received much less attention than pollen presentation. Investigation of the various forms of stigma presentation may reveal previously undescribed reproductive mechanisms in plants. Here we investigated stigma presentation in the spring-flowering herb Aquilegia yabeana, whose linear stigma gradually develops over the lifetime of the flower. The degree of stigma development and recurvature are influenced by the timing of pollen deposition, apparently to favor cross-pollination. In this species, autogamous self-pollination was found to occur in the middle of the receptive period of the stigma if prior cross-pollination did not occur. However, because later-arriving cross-pollen was deposited closer to the ovary, it reached the base of the style before self-pollen which had been deposited earlier. Flexible stigma presentation helps the flower to maximize pollen resources under unreliable pollination conditions, taking advantage of both selfing and outcrossing. This is the first description of stigma development regulated by pollen deposition in a wild plant.

Pollen: !influences! Stigma development 
Pollen: !affects! Recurvature 
Timing of pollen deposition: !favors! Cross-pollination 
Autogamous self-pollination: !occurs! If prior cross-pollination did not occur 
Later-arriving cross-pollen: !reaches! Base of style before self-pollen 
Stigma presentation: !maximizes! Pollen resources
