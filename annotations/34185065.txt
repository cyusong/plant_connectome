BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT (BZR) transcription factors are critical components of the brassinosteroid signalling pathway, but their possible roles in fruit ripening have rarely been reported. In this study, four BZR sequences were isolated from persimmon fruit. Among the four BZR genes, DkBZR1/2 were expressed in persimmon fruit; DkBZR1 protein amount decreased and dephosphorylated DkBZR2 gradually accumulated during the storage period. DkBZR1/2 proteins were localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and accumulated in the nucleus after 24-epibrassinolide treatment. DkBZR1 suppressed the transcription of Diospyros kaki endo-1,4-betaglucanase 1 (DkEGase1) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 1 (DkACS1) by binding to the BR response element (BRRE) in their promoters, and DkBZR2 activated the transcription of pectate lyase 1 (DkPL1) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 2 (DkACO2) by binding to the E-box motif in their promoters. Transient overexpression of DkBZR2 promoted the conversion of acid-soluble pectin to water-soluble pectin and increased ethylene production in persimmon fruit. Our findings indicate that DkBZR1 and DkBZR2 serve as repressors and activators of persimmon fruit ripening, respectively.

DkBZR1: !represses! DkEGase1, DkACS1
DkBZR2: !activates! DkPL1, DkACO2
DkBZR2: !enhances! pectin conversion, ethylene production
