Comparison of the extent of leaf senescence depending on the genetic background of different recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is described. Five RILs of the Bay-0 x Shahdara population showing differential leaf senescence phenotypes (from early senescing to late senescing) were selected to determine metabolic markers to discriminate Arabidopsis lines on the basis of senescence-dependent changes in metabolism. The proportion of gamma-aminobutyric acid, leucine, isoleucine, aspartate, and glutamate correlated with (1) the age and (2) the senescence phenotype of the RILs. Differences were observed in the glycine/serine ratio even before any senescence symptoms could be detected in the rosettes. This could be used as predictive indicator for plant senescence behavior. Surprisingly, late-senescing lines appeared to mobilize glutamine, asparagine, and sulfate more efficiently than early-senescing lines. The physiological basis of the relationship between leaf senescence and flowering time was analyzed.
