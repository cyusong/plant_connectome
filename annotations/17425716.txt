['17425716', 'In plants, prenylated proteins are involved in actin organization,  calcium-mediated signal transduction, and many other biological processes.  Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking functional protein prenyltransferase genes  have also revealed roles for prenylated proteins in phytohormone signaling and  meristem development. However, to date, the turnover of prenylated plant proteins  and the fate of the prenylcysteine (PC) residue have not been described. We have  detected an enzyme activity in Arabidopsis plants that metabolizes  farnesylcysteine (FC) to farnesal, which is subsequently reduced to farnesol.  Unlike its mammalian ortholog, Arabidopsis FC lyase exhibits specificity for FC  over geranylgeranylcysteine (GGC), and recognizes N-acetyl-FC (AFC). FC lyase is  encoded by a gene on chromosome 5 of the Arabidopsis genome (FCLY, At5g63910) and  is ubiquitously expressed in Arabidopsis tissues and organs. Furthermore, T-DNA  insertions into the FCLY gene cause significant decreases in FC lyase activity  and an enhanced response to abscisic acid (ABA) in seed germination assays. The  effects of FCLY mutations on ABA sensitivity are even greater in the presence of  exogenous FC. These data suggest that plants possess a specific FC detoxification  and recycling pathway.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03091.x', 'Sen']
