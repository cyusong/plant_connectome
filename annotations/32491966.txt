The signaling network formed by external environmental signals and endogenous hormone signals is an important basis for the adaptive growth of plants. We recently identified a UDP-glucosyltransferase gene, <i>UGT76F1</i>, which controls the glucosylation of auxin precursor IPyA and mediates light-temperature signaling to regulate auxin-dependent hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis. However, it is unclear whether <i>UGT76F1</i> is involved in the adaptive growth of other tissues and whether it is related to the signaling of other hormones besides auxin. Here we investigated the petiole elongation of <i>UGT76F1</i> overexpression lines and knockout mutant lines, and also studied the effects of <i>UGT76F1</i> on BR signaling. Experimental results indicated that <i>UGT76F1</i> is involved in the PIF4-mediated petiole growth under high temperature and that <i>UGT76F1</i> is also related to the BR signaling in controlling hypocotyl growth. These results suggest that UGT76F1 may have a wider significance in the plant adaptations to surrounding environments.
