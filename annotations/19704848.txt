The Arabidopsis FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) protein is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) that plays important roles in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI). The binding of bacterial flagellin, one of the PAMPs, to the extracellular domain of FLS2 leads to activation of signaling cascades resulting in activation or repression of a specific set of genes involved in plant defense. The mechanisms at the cell membrane that lead to the activation of this signalling pathway are, however, not fully understood. Recently, we have shown that after ligand-treatment the mobility of FLS2 in the cell membrane is reduced and that the activation of FLS2 does not involve its constitutive or ligand-dependent homodimerization. Our data together with recently published reports suggest that FLS2 activation involves its association with other proteins, including BRI1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1), another LRR-RLK, and localization to less mobile areas, probably lipid rafts, in a ligand-dependent manner to initiate PTI.
