TFIIS is a transcript elongation factor that facilitates transcription by RNA polymerase II, as it assists the enzyme to bypass blocks to mRNA synthesis. Previously, we have reported that Arabidopsis plants lacking TFIIS exhibit reduced seed dormancy. Among the genes differentially expressed in tfIIs seeds, the DOG1 gene was identified that is a known QTL for seed dormancy. Here we have analysed plants that overexpress TFIIS in wild type background, or that harbour an additional copy of DOG1 in tfIIs mutant background. These experiments demonstrate that the down-regulation of DOG1 expression causes the seed dormancy phenotype of tfIIs mutants.
