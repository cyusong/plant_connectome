<i>Ginkgo biloba</i> has edible, medicinal, and ornamental value. However, the long juvenile phase prevents the development of the <i>G. biloba</i> industry, and there are few reports on the identification and functional analysis of genes regulating the flowering time of <i>G. biloba</i>. EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2 (EMF), an important protein in flower development, functions to promote vegetative growth and repress flowering. In this study, a novel <i>EMF</i> gene (<i>GbEMF2</i>) was cloned and characterized from <i>G. biloba</i>. <i>GbEMF2</i> contains a 2,193 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 730 amino acids. GbEMF2 harbors conserved VEFS-Box domain by the plant EMF protein. The phylogenic analysis showed that GbEMF2 originated from a polycomb-group (Pc-G) protein ancestor and was a member of the EMF2 protein. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that <i>GbEMF2</i> was expressed in all detected organs, and it showed a significantly higher level in ovulating strobilus and microstrobilus than in other organs. Compared with <i>emf2</i> mutant plants, overexpression of <i>GbEMF2</i> driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in <i>emf2</i> mutant <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants delayed flowering but earlier than wild-type (WT) plants. This result indicated that <i>GbEMF2</i> repressed flowering in <i>G. biloba</i>. Moreover, the RNA-seq analysis of <i>GbEMF2</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants (<i>GbEMF2-OE/emf2</i>), WT plants, and <i>emf2</i> mutants screened out 227 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among these DEGs, <i>FLC</i>, <i>MAF5</i>, and <i>MAF5-1</i> genes were related to flower organ development and regulated by <i>GbEMF2</i>. In addition, some genes participating in sugar metabolism, such as <i>Alpha-amylase 1</i> (<i>AMY1</i>), <i>BAM1</i>, and <i>Sucrose synthase 3</i> (<i>SUS3</i>) genes, were also controlled by <i>GbEMF2</i>. Overall, our results suggested that <i>GbEMF2</i> negatively regulates flowering development in <i>G. biloba</i>. This finding provided a foundation and target gene for shortening the Ginkgo juvenile period by genetic engineering technology.
