Phytomelatonin is a small multifunctional molecule found ubiquitously in plants, which plays an important role in plant growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. The classical biosynthetic and metabolic pathways of phytomelatonin have been elucidated, and uncovering alternative pathways has deepened our understanding of phytomelatonin synthesis. Phytomelatonin functions mainly via two pathways. In the direct pathway, phytomelatonin mediates the stress-induced reactive oxygen species burst through its strong antioxidant capacity. In the indirect pathway, phytomelatonin acts as a signal to activate signaling cascades and crosstalk with other plant hormones. The phytomelatonin receptor PMTR1/CAND2 was discovered in 2018, which enhanced our understanding of phytomelatonin function. This review summarizes the classical and potential pathways involved in phytomelatonin synthesis and metabolism. To elucidate the functions of phytomelatonin, we focus on the crosstalk between phytomelatonin and other phytohormones. We propose two models to explain how PMTR1 transmits the phytomelatonin signal through the G protein and MAPK cascade. This review will facilitate the identification of additional signaling molecules that function downstream of the phytomelatonin signaling pathway, thus improving our understanding of phytomelatonin signal transmission.
