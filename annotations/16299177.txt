['16299177', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates stress-responsive gene expression  during vegetative growth. The ABA regulation of many genes is mediated by a  subfamily of basic leucine zipper class transcription factors referred to as ABFs  (i.e. ABF1-ABF4), whose transcriptional activity is induced by ABA. Here we show  that a calcium-dependent protein kinase is involved in the ABA-dependent  activation process. We carried out yeast two-hybrid screens to identify  regulatory components of ABF4 function and isolated AtCPK32 as an  ABF4-interacting protein. AtCPK32 has autophosphorylation activity and can  phosphorylate ABF4 in vitro. Mutational analysis indicated that serine-110 of  ABF4, which is highly conserved among ABF family members, may be phosphorylated  by AtCPK32. The serine-110 residue is essential for ABF4-AtCPK32 interaction, and  transient expression assay revealed that it is also required for the normal  transcriptional function of ABF4. The expression patterns and subcellular  localization of AtCPK32 are similar to those of ABF4. Furthermore, its  overexpression affects both ABA sensitivity and the expression of a number of  ABF4-regulated genes. Together, our data demonstrate that AtCPK32 is an ABA  signaling component that regulates the ABA-responsive gene expression via ABF4.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.069757', 'Kim']
