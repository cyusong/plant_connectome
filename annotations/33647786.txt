The male gametophyte of angiosperms has long been recognized as an ideal system for the study of the molecular mechanisms regulating cell fate determination. Recent findings on histone variants in two cell lineages, vegetative-cell-derived small interfering RNA and transposable element expression provide new power for relevant investigations.
