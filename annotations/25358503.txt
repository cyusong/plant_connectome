['25358503', 'Cullin4-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) is a family of multi-subunit E3 ligases. To  investigate the possible involvement of CRL4 in heat stress response, we screened  T-DNA insertion mutants of putative CRL4 substrate receptors that exhibited  altered patterns in response to heat stress. One of the mutants exhibited heat  stress tolerance and was named heat stress tolerant DWD1 (htd1). Introduction of  HTD1 gene into htd1-1 led to recovery of heat sensitivity to the wild type level,  confirming that the decrease of HTD1 transcripts resulted in heat tolerance.  Therefore, HTD1 plays a negative role in thermotolerance in Arabidopsis.  Additionally, HTD1 directly interacted with DDB1a in yeast two-hybrid assays and  associated with DDB1b in vivo, supporting that it could be a part of a CRL4  complex. Various heat-inducible genes such as HSP14.7, HSP21, At2g03020 and  WRKY28 were hyper-induced in htd1-1, indicating that HTD1 could function as a  negative regulator for the expression of such genes and that these genes might  contribute to thermotolerance of htd1-1, at least in part. HTD1 was associated  with HSP90-1, a crucial regulator of thermotolerance, in vivo, even though the  decrease of HTD1 did not affect the accumulation pattern of HSP90-1 in  Arabidopsis. These findings indicate that a negative role of HTD1 in  thermotolerance might be achieved through its association with HSP90-1, possibly  by disturbing the action of HSP90-1, not by the degradation of HSP90-1. This  study will serve as an important step toward understanding of the functional  connection between CRL4-mediated processes and plant heat stress signaling.', '2014 Nov', 'Mol Cells', '10.14348/molcells.2014.0224', 'Lee']
