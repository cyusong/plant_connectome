CK2 (Casein Kinase II), a ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase, affects multiple developmental and stress response pathways in Arabidopsis, including flowering time under both long- and short-day conditions through the photoperiod and autonomous pathways. CK2 phosphorylates central clock components, CCA1 and LHY, to modulate circadian clock that regulates flowering time through the photoperiod pathway. However, how CK2 regulates flowering time through the autonomous pathway is still unknown. Analyses of phosphorylation sites using several prediction softwares show that most of the autonomous pathway components have multiple CK2 phosphorylation sites. CK2 might phosphorylate any or all of these components to modulate their activity/stability resulting in altered expression of FLC that drives flowering time through the autonomous pathway.
