Wheat stem (or black) rust is one of the most devastating fungal diseases, threatening global wheat production. Identification, mapping, and deployment of effective resistance genes are critical to addressing this challenge. In this study, we mapped and characterized one stem rust resistance (<i>Sr</i>) gene from the tetraploid durum wheat variety Kronos (temporary designation <i>SrKN</i>). This gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 2B and confers resistance to multiple virulent <i>Pgt</i> races, such as TRTTF and BCCBC. Using a large mapping population (3,366 gametes), we mapped <i>SrKN</i> within a 0.29 cM region flanked by the sequenced-based markers <i>pku4856F2R2</i> and <i>pku4917F3R3</i>, which corresponds to 5.6- and 7.2-Mb regions in the Svevo and Chinese Spring reference genomes, respectively. Both regions include a cluster of nucleotide binding leucine-repeat (NLR) genes that likely includes the candidate gene. An allelism test failed to detect recombination between <i>SrKN</i> and the previously mapped <i>Sr9e</i> gene. This result, together with the similar seedling resistance responses and resistance profiles, suggested that <i>SrKN</i> and <i>Sr9e</i> may represent the same gene. We introgressed <i>SrKN</i> into common wheat and developed completely linked markers to accelerate its deployment in the wheat breeding programs. <i>SrKN</i> can be a valuable component of transgenic cassettes or gene pyramids that includes multiple resistance genes to control this devastating disease.
