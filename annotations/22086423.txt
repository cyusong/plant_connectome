We have investigated the location of the Psb27 protein and its role in photosystem (PS) II biogenesis in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Native gel electrophoresis revealed that Psb27 was present mainly in monomeric PSII core complexes but also in smaller amounts in dimeric PSII core complexes, in large PSII supercomplexes, and in the unassembled protein fraction. We conclude from analysis of assembly mutants and isolated histidine-tagged PSII subcomplexes that Psb27 associates with the "unassembled" CP43 complex, as well as with larger complexes containing CP43, possibly in the vicinity of the large lumenal loop connecting transmembrane helices 5 and 6 of CP43. A functional role for Psb27 in the biogenesis of CP43 is supported by the decreased accumulation and enhanced fragmentation of unassembled CP43 after inactivation of the psb27 gene in a mutant lacking CP47. Unexpectedly, in strains unable to assemble PSII, a small amount of Psb27 comigrated with monomeric and trimeric PSI complexes upon native gel electrophoresis, and Psb27 could be copurified with histidine-tagged PSI isolated from the wild type. Yeast two-hybrid assays suggested an interaction of Psb27 with the PsaB protein of PSI. Pull-down experiments also supported an interaction between CP43 and PSI. Deletion of psb27 did not have drastic effects on PSII assembly and repair but did compromise short-term acclimation to high light. The tentative interaction of Psb27 and CP43 with PSI raises the possibility that PSI might play a previously unrecognized role in the biogenesis/repair of PSII.
