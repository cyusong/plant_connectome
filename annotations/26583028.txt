['26583028', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces accumulation of reactive oxygen  species (ROS), which can disrupt seed dormancy and plant development. Here, we  report the isolation and characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant  called ars1 (aba and ros sensitive 1) that showed hypersensitivity to ABA during  seed germination and to methyl viologen (MV) at the seedling stage. ARS1 encodes  a nuclear protein with one zinc finger domain, two nuclear localization signal  (NLS) domains, and one nuclear export signal (NES). The ars1 mutants showed  reduced expression of a gene for superoxide dismutase (CSD3) and enhanced  accumulation of ROS after ABA treatment. Transient expression of ARS1 in  Arabidopsis protoplasts strongly suppressed ABA-mediated ROS production.  Interestingly, nuclear-localized ARS1 translocated to the cytoplasm in response  to treatment with ABA, H2O2, or MV. Taken together, these results suggest that  ARS1 modulates seed germination and ROS homeostasis in response to ABA and  oxidative stress in plants.', '2015', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2015.00963', 'Yun']
