AtRad52 homologs are involved in DNA recombination and repair, but their precise functions in different homologous recombination (HR) pathways or in gene-targeting have not been analyzed. In order to facilitate our analyses, we generated an AtRad52-1A variant that had a stronger nuclear localization than the native gene thanks to the removal of the transit peptide for mitochondrial localization and to the addition of a nuclear localization signal. Over-expression of this variant increased HR in the nucleus, compared with the native AtRad52-1A: it increased intra-chromosomal recombination and synthesis-dependent strand-annealing HR repair rates; but conversely, it repressed the single-strand annealing pathway. The effect of AtRad52-1A over-expression on gene-targeting was tested with and without the expression of small RNAs generated from an RNAi construct containing homology to the target and donor sequences. True gene-targeting events at the Arabidopsis Cruciferin locus were obtained only when combining AtRad52-1A over-expression and target/donor-specific RNAi. This suggests that sequence-specific small RNAs might be involved in AtRad52-1A-mediated HR.
