['27099260', 'Organ growth is determined by a coordinated combination of cell proliferation and  cell growth and differentiation. Endoreduplication is often coupled with cell  growth and differentiation, but the genetic and molecular mechanisms that link  endoreduplication with cell and organ growth are largely unknown. Here, we  describe UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE14 (UBP14), encoded by the DA3 gene, which  functions as a negative regulator of endoreduplication. The Arabidopsis thaliana  da3-1 mutant shows large cotyledons, leaves, and flowers with higher ploidy  levels. UBP14 acts along with UV-B-INSENSITIVE4 (UVI4), an inhibitor of the  anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase, to repress  endoreduplication. Also, UBP14 functions antagonistically with CELL CYCLE  SWITCH52 A1 (CCS52A1), an activator of APC/C, to regulate endoreduplication.  UBP14 physically associates with UVI4 both in vitro and in vivo but does not  directly interact with CCS52A1. Further results reveal that UBP14 influences the  stability of cyclin A2;3 (CYCA2;3) and cyclin-dependent kinase B1;1 (CDKB1;1),  two downstream components of the APC/C Thus, our findings show how  endoreduplication is linked with cell and organ growth by revealing important  genetic and molecular functions for the ubiquitin-specific protease UBP14 and for  the key cell cycle regulators UVI4, CCS52A1, CYCA2;3, and CDKB1;1.', '2016 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00007', 'ORCID:']
