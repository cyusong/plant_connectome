SoyBase, a USDA genetic and genomics database, holds professionally curated soybean genetic and genomic data, which is integrated and made accessible to researchers and breeders. The site holds several reference genome assemblies, as well as genetic maps, thousands of mapped traits, expression and epigenetic data, pedigree information, and extensive variant and genotyping data sets. SoyBase displays include genetic, genomic, and epigenetic maps of the soybean genome. Gene expression data is presented in the genome viewer as heat maps and pictorial and tabular displays in gene report pages. Millions of sequence variants have been added, representing variations across various collections of cultivars. This variant data is explorable using new interactive tools to visualize the distribution of those variants across the genome, between selected accessions. SoyBase holds several reference-quality soybean genome assemblies, accessible via various query tools and browsers, including a new visualization system for exploring the soybean pan-genome. SoyBase also serves as a nexus of announcements pertinent to the greater soybean research community. The database also includes a soybean-specific anatomic and biochemical trait ontology. The database can be accessed at https://soybase.org.
