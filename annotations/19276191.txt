Although an involvement of metabolic signals in the regulation of plant senescence has been demonstrated in a range of studies, the exact signalling pathways remain largely unresolved. For leaves, evidence supports a role of sugar accumulation in the initiation and/or acceleration of senescence. However, regulation of senescence or ageing may respond to different metabolic signals in heterotrophic plant organs and heterotrophic organisms. In animals and yeast, dietary restriction results in increased lifespan. In this article, the metabolic regulation of leaf senescence is compared with the effects of dietary restriction. Similarities and differences in the signalling pathways are discussed, including the role of autophagy, TOR (target of rapamycin), Sir2 (silent information regulator-2), and SnRK1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1).
