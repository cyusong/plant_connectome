In the past decade, research on resistant starch has evoked interest due to the prevention and inhibition of chronic human diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Increasing the amylose content (AC) and resistant starch (RS) has been pivotal in improving the nutritional benefit of rice. However, the exact mechanism of RS formation is complex due to interconnected genetic factors regulating amylose-amylopectin variation. In this review, we discussed the regulatory factors influencing the RS formation centered on the transcription, post-transcriptional, and post-translational processes. Furthermore, we described the developments in RS and AC levels in rice compared with other high RS cereals. Briefly, we enumerated potential applications of high RS mutants in health, medical, and other industries. We contest that the information captured herein can be deployed for marker-assisted breeding and precision breeding techniques through genome editing to improve rice varieties with enhanced RS content.
