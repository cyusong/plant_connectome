Alternative splicing largely enhanced the diversity of transcriptome and proteome in eukaryas. Along with technological development, more and more genes are reported to be alternatively spliced during mRNA maturation. Here, I report the alternative splicing of <i>SKU5-Similar 3</i> (<i>SKS3</i>) and its special splicing site in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. <i>SKS3</i> was predicted to be alternatively transcribed into two variants, <i>SKS3.1</i> and <i>SKS3.2</i>, which encoded a GPI-anchored protein and a soluble secretory protein, respectively. But, according to experimental data, instead of <i>SKS3.2</i>, a novel variant, <i>SKS3.3</i>, which encodes a protein with a transmembrane region at its C-terminus, was demonstrated. Interestingly, it exhibites a different organ-specific expression pattern with <i>SKS3.1</i>, and an unusual intron splicing site not following 'GT-AG' rule or any reported rule.

SKS3: !alternatively splices into! SKS3.1 
SKS3: !alternatively splices into! SKS3.3 
SKS3.1: !encodes! GPI-anchored protein 
SKS3.3: !encodes! protein with transmembrane region 
SKS3.3: !exhibits! different organ-specific expression pattern 
SKS3.3: !has unusual intron splicing site! not following 'GT-AG' rule
