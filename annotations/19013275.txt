['19013275', 'Nuclear transcription is not restricted to genes but occurs throughout the  intergenic and noncoding space of eukaryotic genomes. The functional significance  of this widespread noncoding transcription is mostly unknown. We show that  Arabidopsis RNA polymerase IVb/Pol V, a multisubunit nuclear enzyme required for  siRNA-mediated gene silencing of transposons and other repeats, transcribes  intergenic and noncoding sequences, thereby facilitating heterochromatin  formation and silencing of overlapping and adjacent genes. Pol IVb/Pol V  transcription requires the chromatin-remodeling protein DRD1 but is independent  of siRNA biogenesis. However, Pol IVb/Pol V transcription and siRNA production  are both required to silence transposons, suggesting that Pol IVb/Pol V generates  RNAs or chromatin structures that serve as scaffolds for siRNA-mediated  heterochromatin-forming complexes. Pol IVb/Pol V function provides a solution to  a paradox of epigenetic control: the need for transcription in order to  transcriptionally silence the same region.', '2008 Nov 14', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.035', 'Pikaard']
