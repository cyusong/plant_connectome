['29467189', "SUPPRESSOR OF PHYB-4#5DOMINANT (sob5-D) was previously identified as a suppressor  of the phyB-4 long-hypocotyl phenotype in Arabidopsis thaliana Overexpression of  SOB5 conferred dwarf phenotypes similar to those observed in plants containing  elevated levels of cytokinin (CK) nucleotides and nucleosides. Two SOB-FIVE- LIKE  (SOFL) proteins, AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2, which are more similar at the protein level  to each other than they are to SOB5, conferred similar phenotypes to the sob5-D  mutant when overexpressed. We used protein sequences of founding SOFL gene family  members to perform database searches and identified a total of 289 SOFL homologs  in genomes of 89 angiosperm species. Phylogenetic analysis results implied that  the SOFL gene family emerged during the expansion of angiosperms and later  evolved into four distinct clades. Among the newly identified gene family members  are four previously unreported Arabidopsis SOFLs Multiple sequence alignment of  the 289 SOFL protein sequences revealed two highly conserved domains; SOFL-A and  SOFL-B. We used overexpression and site-directed mutagenesis studies to  demonstrate that SOFL domains are necessary for SOB5 and AtSOFL1's overexpression  phenotypes. Examination of the subcellular localization patterns of founding  Arabidopsis thaliana SOFLs suggested they may be localized in the cytoplasm  and/or the nucleus. Overall, we report that SOFLs are a plant-specific gene  family characterized by two conserved domains that are important for function.", '2018 Mar 28', 'G3 (Bethesda)', '10.1534/g3.118.200040', 'Neff']
