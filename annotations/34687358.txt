Transcriptional and metabolic regulation of aluminium tolerance of Chinese wild Vitis quinquangularis after Al treatment for 12 h: genes and pathways related to stress resistance are activated to cope with Al stress. The phytotoxicity of aluminium (Al) has become a major issue in inhibiting plant growth in acidic soils. Chinese wild Vitis species have excellent stress resistance. In this study, to explore the mechanism underlying Al tolerance in Chinese wild Vitis quinquangularis, we conducted a transcriptome analysis to understand the changes in gene expression and pathways in V. quinquangularis leaves after Al treatment for 12 h (Al_12 h). Compared with the control (CK) treatment, 2266 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 2943 downregulated DEGs were identified after Al treatment. We analysed the top 60 upregulated DEGs and found that these genes were related mostly to cell wall organization or biogenesis, transition metal ion binding, etc. Another analysis of all the upregulated DEGs showed that genes related to the ABC transport pathway, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) hormone signalling pathway were expressed. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that genes and metabolites (phenylalanine, cinnamate and quercetin) related to the phenylalanine metabolic pathway were expressed. In summary, the results provide a new contribution to a better understanding of the metabolic changes that occur in grapes after Al stress as well as to research on improving the resistance of grape cultivars.
