We isolated a mutant, named coleoptile phototropism1 (cpt1), from gamma-ray-mutagenized japonica-type rice (Oryza sativa). This mutant showed no coleoptile phototropism and severely reduced root phototropism after continuous stimulation. A map-based cloning strategy and transgenic complementation test were applied to demonstrate that a NPH3-like gene deleted in the mutant corresponds to CPT1. Phylogenetic analysis of putative CPT1 homologs of rice and related proteins indicated that CPT1 has an orthologous relationship with Arabidopsis thaliana NPH3. These results, along with those for Arabidopsis, demonstrate that NPH3/CPT1 is a key signal transduction component of higher plant phototropism. In an extended study with the cpt1 mutant, it was found that phototropic differential growth is accompanied by a CPT1-independent inhibition of net growth. Kinetic investigation further indicated that a small phototropism occurs in cpt1 coleoptiles. This response, induced only transiently, was thought to be caused by the CPT1-independent growth inhibition. The 3H-indole-3-acetic acid applied to the coleoptile tip was asymmetrically distributed between the two sides of phototropically responding coleoptiles. However, no asymmetry was induced in cpt1 coleoptiles, indicating that lateral translocation of auxin occurs downstream of CPT1. It is concluded that the CPT1-dependent major phototropism of coleoptiles is achieved by lateral auxin translocation and subsequent growth redistribution.
