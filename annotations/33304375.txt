In the primary root and young hypocotyl of <i>Arabidopsis</i>, ACAULIS5 promotes translation of SUPPRESSOR OF ACAULIS51 (SAC51) and thereby inhibits cytokinin biosynthesis and vascular cell division. In this study, the relationships between ACAULIS5, SAC51 and cytokinin biosynthesis were investigated during secondary growth of <i>Populus</i> stems. Overexpression of <i>ACAULIS5</i> from the constitutive <i>35S</i> promoter in hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>) trees suppressed the expression level of <i>ACAULIS5</i>, which resulted in low levels of the physiologically active cytokinin bases as well as their direct riboside precursors in the transgenic lines. Low <i>ACAULIS5</i> expression and low cytokinin levels of the transgenic trees coincided with low cambial activity of the stem. ACAULIS5 therefore, contrary to its function in young seedlings in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, stimulates cytokinin accumulation and cambial activity during secondary growth of the stem. This function is not derived from maturing secondary xylem tissues as transgenic suppression of <i>ACAULIS5</i> levels in these tissues did not influence secondary growth. Interestingly, evidence was obtained for increased activity of the anticlinal division of the cambial initials under conditions of low <i>ACAULIS5</i> expression and low cytokinin accumulation. We propose that ACAULIS5 integrates auxin and cytokinin signaling to promote extensive secondary growth of tree stems.
