['16617119', 'FZO is a dynamin-related membrane-remodeling protein that mediates fusion between  mitochondrial outer membranes in animals and fungi. We identified a single  FZO-like protein in Arabidopsis, FZL, a new plant-specific member of the dynamin  superfamily. FZL is targeted to chloroplasts and associated with thylakoid and  envelope membranes as punctate structures. fzl knockout mutants have  abnormalities in chloroplast and thylakoid morphology, including disorganized  grana stacks and alterations in the relative proportions of grana and stroma  thylakoids. Overexpression of FZL-GFP also conferred defects in thylakoid  organization. Mutation of a conserved residue in the predicted FZL GTPase domain  abolished both the punctate localization pattern and ability of FZL-GFP to  complement the fzl mutant phenotype. FZL defines a new protein class within the  dynamin superfamily of membrane-remodeling GTPases that regulates organization of  the thylakoid network in plants. Notably, FZL levels do not affect mitochondrial  morphology or ultrastructure, suggesting that mitochondrial morphology in plants  is regulated by an FZO-independent mechanism.', '2006 Apr 25', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0507287103', 'Osteryoung']
