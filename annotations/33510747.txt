The mung bean has a great potential under tropical conditions given its high content of grain protein. Additionally, its ability to benefit from biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) through association with native rhizobia inhabiting nodule microbiome provides most of the nitrogen independence on fertilizers. Soil microbial communities which are influenced by biogeographical factors and soil properties, represent a source of rhizobacteria capable of stimulating plant growth. The objective of this study is to support selection of beneficial bacteria that form positive interactions with mung bean plants cultivated in tropical soils, as part of a seed inoculation program for increasing grain yield based on the BNF and other mechanisms. Two mung bean genotypes (Camaleão and Esmeralda) were cultivated in 10 soil samples. Nodule microbiome was characterized by next-generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA. More than 99% of nodule sequences showed similarity with <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> genus, the only rhizobial present in nodules in our study. Higher bacterial diversity of soil samples collected in agribusiness areas (MW_MT-I, II or III) was associated with Esmeralda genotype, while an organic agroecosystem soil sample (SE_RJ-V) showed the highest bacterial diversity independent of genotype. Furthermore, OTUs close to <i>Bradyrhizobium elkanii</i> have dominated in all soil samples, except in the sample from the organic agroecosystem, where just <i>B. japonicum</i> was present. Bacterial community of mung bean nodules is mainly influenced by soil pH, K, Ca, and P. Besides a difference on nodule colonization by OTU sequences close to the <i>Pseudomonas</i> genus regarding the two genotypes was detected too. Although representing a small rate, around 0.1% of the total, <i>Pseudomonas</i> OTUs were only retrieved from nodules of Esmeralda genotype, suggesting a different trait regarding specificity between macro- and micro-symbionts. The microbiome analysis will guide the next steps in the development of an inoculant for mung bean aiming to promote plant growth and grain yield, composed either by an efficient <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> strain on its own or co-inoculated with a <i>Pseudomonas</i> strain. Considering the results achieved, the assessment of microbial ecology parameters is a potent coadjuvant capable to accelerate the inoculant development process and to improve the benefits to the crop by soil microorganisms.
