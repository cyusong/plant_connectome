['15647349', 'Glucuronoarabinoxylan, xyloglucan, and galactomannan are noncellulosic  polysaccharides found in plant cell walls. All consist of beta-linked glycan  backbones substituted with sugar side chains. Although considerable progress has  been made in characterizing the structure of these polysaccharides, little is  known about the biosynthetic enzymes that produce them. Cellulose synthase-like  (Csl) genes are hypothesized to encode Golgi-localized beta-glycan synthases that  polymerize the backbones of noncellulosic polysaccharides. To investigate this  hypothesis, we used heterologous expression in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells  to systematically analyze the functions of the gene products of a group of Csl  genes from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa L.), including members from five  Csl gene families (CslA, CslC, CslD, CslE, and CslH). Our analyses indicate that  several members of the CslA gene family encode beta-mannan synthases. Recombinant  CslA proteins produce beta-linked mannan polymers when supplied GDP-mannose. The  same proteins can produce beta-linked glucomannan heteropolymers when supplied  both GDP-mannose and GDP-glucose. One CslA protein also produced beta-linked  glucan polymers when supplied GDP-glucose alone. Heterologous expression studies  of additional candidate glycan synthases in insect cells or other systems may  help identify other noncellulosic polysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes.', '2005 Feb 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0409179102', 'Keegstra']
