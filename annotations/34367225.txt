Members of the <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> species complex cause a variety of wilting diseases across a wide range of hosts by colonizing and blocking xylem vessels. Of great concern are race 3 biovar 2 strains of <i>R. solanacearum</i> capable of causing brown rot of potato at cool temperatures, which are select agents in the United States. To gain a better understanding of cool-virulence mechanisms, we generated libraries of transposon mutants in the cool-virulent <i>R. solanacearum</i> strain UW551 and screened 10,000 mutants using our seedling assay for significantly reduced virulence at 20°C. We found several mutants that exhibited reduced virulence at 28 and 20°C and also mutants that were only affected at the cooler temperature. One mutant of the latter chosen for further study had the transposon inserted in an intergenic region between a type III secretion system effector gene <i>ripS1</i> and a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) protein gene. Gene expression analysis showed that expression of <i>ripS1</i> was altered by the transposon insertion, but not the MFS protein gene. An independent mutant with this insertion upstream of <i>ripS1</i> was generated and used to confirm virulence and gene expression phenotypes. The effector, RipS1, has unknown function and is part of a family of effectors belonging to the largest known type III effectors. The functional connection between RipS1 and cool-virulence of <i>R. solanacearum</i> UW551 suggests that RipS1 (and/or its upstream promoter element) may serve as a potential target for development of cool-virulence-specific diagnostic tools to differentiate the highly regulated cool-virulent strains from non-cool-virulent strains of <i>R. solanacearum</i>. Our results provide important information for continued work toward a better understanding of cool-virulence of <i>R. solanacearum</i> and development of proper control strategies to combat this important plant pathogen.
