['18552202', 'The DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) transcription  factor controls water deficit-inducible gene expression and requires  posttranslational modification for its activation. The activation mechanism is  not well understood; however, the stability of this protein in the nucleus was  recently found to be important for its activation. Here, we report the isolation  of Arabidopsis thaliana DREB2A-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2, C3HC4 RING  domain-containing proteins that interact with the DREB2A protein in the nucleus.  An in vitro ubiquitination assay showed that they function as E3 ubiquitin  ligases and are capable of mediating DREB2A ubiquitination. Overexpression of  DRIP1 in Arabidopsis delayed the expression of DREB2A-regulated  drought-responsive genes. Drought-inducible gene expression was slightly enhanced  in the single T-DNA mutants of drip1-1 and drip2-1. By contrast, significantly  enhanced gene expression was revealed in the drip1 drip2 double mutant under  dehydration stress. Collectively, these data imply that DRIP1 and DRIP2 function  negatively in the response of plants to drought stress. Moreover, overexpression  of full-length DREB2A protein was more stable in drip1-1 than in the wild-type  background. These results suggest that DRIP1 and DRIP2 act as novel negative  regulators in drought-responsive gene expression by targeting DREB2A to 26S  proteasome proteolysis.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.057380', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
