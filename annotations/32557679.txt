['32557679', 'In both plants and animals, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune  receptors perceive pathogen-derived molecules to trigger immunity. Global NLR  homeostasis must be tightly controlled to ensure sufficient and timely immune  output while avoiding aberrant activation, the mechanisms of which are largely  unclear. In a previous reverse genetic screen, we identified two novel E3  ligases, SNIPER1 and its homolog SNIPER2, both of which broadly control the  levels of NLR immune receptors in Arabidopsis. Protein levels of sensor NLRs  (sNLRs) are inversely correlated with SNIPER1 amount and the interactions between  SNIPER1 and sNLRs seem to be through the common nucleotide-binding (NB) domains  of sNLRs. In support, SNIPER1 can ubiquitinate the NB domains of multiple sNLRs  in vitro. Our study thus reveals a novel process of global turnover of sNLRs by  two master E3 ligases for immediate attenuation of immune output to effectively  avoid autoimmunity. Such unique mechanism can be utilized in the future for  engineering broad-spectrum resistance in crops to fend off pathogens that damage  our food supply.', '2020 Aug 3', 'EMBO J', '10.15252/embj.2020104915', 'ORCID:']
