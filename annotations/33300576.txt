Selection for crop cultivars has largely focused on reproductive traits, while the impacts of global change on crop productivity are expected to depend strongly on the vegetative physiology traits that drive plant resource use and stress tolerance. We evaluated relationships between physiology traits and growing season climate across wine grape cultivars to characterize trait variation across European growing regions. We compiled values from the literature for seven water use and drought tolerance traits and growing season climate. Cultivars with a lower maximum stomatal conductance were associated with regions with a higher mean temperature and mean and maximum vapor pressure deficit (r2=0.39-0.65, P<0.05, n=14-29). Cultivars with greater stem embolism resistance and more anisohydric stomatal behavior (i.e. a more negative water potential threshold for 50% stomatal closure) were associated with cooler regions (r2=0.48-0.72, P<0.03, n=10-29). Overall, cultivars grown in warmer, drier regions exhibited traits that would reduce transpiration and conserve soil water longer into the growing season, but potentially increase stomatal and temperature limitations on photosynthesis under future, hotter conditions.
