The pine wood nematode (PWN), <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, is one of the most lethal nematode species, which causes pine wilt disease (PWD), a devastating forest disease. To date, no effective methods have been developed to control the disease; hence, rapid precise detection of <i>B. xylophilus</i> is of great significance. Traditional molecular diagnostic methods are time-consuming and require sophisticated instruments or skilled operators, which are unavailable in resource-limited settings. A specific, sensitive, and field-applicable diagnostic method is urgently needed. In this study, we developed a diagnostic method using recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) for the rapid on-site detection of <i>B. xylophilus.</i> The false-positive signals from primer-dependent artifacts were eliminated using a probe, and base substitutions were included in the primer and probe. The entire detection process for the RPA-LFD assay can be completed under 38°C within approximately 30 min, including 15 min for crude nematode genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction and master mix preparation, 15 min for the RPA-LFD assay. This assay displayed high specificity toward <i>B. xylophilus</i> and showed no cross-reactions with closely related species, including <i>Bursaphelenchus mucronatus</i> and <i>Bursaphelenchus doui</i>. The sensitivity of this assay had a detection limit as low as 1 pg of <i>B. xylophilus</i> purified genomic DNA. Furthermore, the application of the RPA-LFD assay in simulated spiked pinewood samples showed accurate detection results. The RPA-LFD assay in this study successfully detected <i>B. xylophilus</i> in less than 30 min, providing a novel alternative for the simple, sensitive, and specific detection of <i>B. xylophilus</i> and showed potential for <i>B. xylophilus</i> point-of-care testing (POCT) in resource-limited areas or in field.
