Drought challenges crop production worldwide. The issue is aggravated by frequent drought episodes and unpredictable rainfall patterns associated with global climate change. While the efforts to breed drought-resistant crop varieties are progressing, the need of the hour is immediate strategies to sustain the yields of existing ones. As per recent studies, stress adaptive traits can be activated using specific elicitors. Endophytes that inhabit host plants asymptomatically are natural elicitors/bio-stimulators capable of activating host gene expression, conferring several benefits to the hosts. This review discusses the scope of using trait-specific endophytes in activating drought adaptive traits in crop varieties.

Endophytes: !activate! Host gene expression
Host gene expression: !confer! Benefits to host plants
Endophytes: !elicit! Stress adaptive traits
