The cyclic electron transport (CET), after the linear electron transport (LET), is another important electron transport pathway during the light reactions of photosynthesis. The proton gradient regulation 5 (PGR5)/PRG5-like photosynthetic phenotype 1 (PGRL1) and the NADH dehydrogenase-like complex pathways are linked to the CET. Recently, the regulation of CET around photosystem I (PSI) has been recognized as crucial for photosynthesis and plant growth. Here, we summarized the main biochemical processes of the PGR5/PGRL1-dependent CET pathway and its physiological significance in protecting the photosystem II and PSI, ATP/NADPH ratio maintenance, and regulating the transitions between LET and CET in order to optimize photosynthesis when encountering unfavorable conditions. A better understanding of the PGR5/PGRL1-mediated CET during photosynthesis might provide novel strategies for improving crop yield in a world facing more extreme weather events with multiple stresses affecting the plants.
