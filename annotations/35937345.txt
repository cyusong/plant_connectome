The lignin found in the cell walls of poplar fibres is decorated with ester-linked <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate moieties that originate from the participation of acylated monolignols in lignin polymerisation. Although little is known about the biological implications of these cell-wall constituents, it has historically been postulated that acylated monolignols might promote lignification in syringyl lignin-rich species such as poplar. However, cell-wall-bound <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate groups were negatively correlated with syringyl units in a collection of 316 unrelated genotypes of black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i>). Based upon this observation, several alternative hypotheses on the occurrence of lignin acylation are presented.

gene: !affects! lignin polymerisation
gene: !localizes to! cell walls
gene: !interacts with! acylated monolignols
gene: !enhances! syringyl lignin-rich species
gene: !represses! <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate groups
gene: !synthesizes! black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i>)
