Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are widely distributed in the plant genome and can be methylated. However, whether DNA methylation of MITEs is associated with induced allelic expression and drought tolerance is unclear. Here, we identified the drought-inducible MdRFNR1 (root-type ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase) gene in apple (Malus domestica). MdRFNR1 plays a positive role in drought tolerance by regulating the redox system, including increasing NADP+ accumulation and catalase and peroxidase activities and decreasing NADPH levels. Sequence analysis identified a MITE insertion (MITE-MdRF1) in the promoter of MdRFNR1-1 but not the MdRFNR1-2 allele. MdRFNR1-1 but not MdRFNR1-2 expression was significantly induced by drought stress, which was positively associated with the MITE-MdRF1 insertion and its DNA methylation. The methylated MITE-MdRF1 is recognized by the transcriptional anti-silencing factors MdSUVH1 and MdSUVH3, which recruit the DNAJ domain-containing proteins MdDNAJ1, MdDNAJ2, and MdDNAJ5, thereby activating MdRFNR1-1 expression under drought stress. Finally, we showed that MdSUVH1 and MdDNAJ1 are positive regulators of drought tolerance. These findings illustrate the molecular roles of methylated MITE-MdRF1 (which is recognized by the MdSUVH-MdDNAJ complex) in induced MdRFNR1-1 expression as well as the drought response of apple and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of natural variation in perennial trees.
