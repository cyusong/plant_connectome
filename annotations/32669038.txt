Stomatal development is tightly connected with the overall plant growth, while changes in environmental conditions, like elevated temperature, affect negatively stomatal formation. Stomatal ontogenesis follows a well-defined series of cell developmental transitions in the cotyledon and leaf epidermis that finally lead to the production of mature stomata. YODA signaling cascade regulates stomatal development mainly through the phosphorylation and inactivation of SPEECHLESS (SPCH) transcription factor, while HSP90 chaperones have a central role in the regulation of YODA cascade. Here, we report that acute heat stress affects negatively stomatal differentiation, leads to high phosphorylation levels of MPK3 and MPK6, and alters the expression of <i>SPCH</i> and <i>MUTE</i> transcription factors. Genetic depletion of HSP90 leads to decreased stomatal differentiation rates. Thus, HSP90 chaperones safeguard the completion of distinct stomatal differentiation steps depending on these two transcription factors under normal and heat stress conditions.
