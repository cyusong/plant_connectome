Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and K polysaccharides (K-antigens, capsular polysaccharides, or KPSs) are important for the recognition of the symbiotic partner and the infection process, whereas lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) may function at a later stage of symbiosis. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the structural investigation of rhizobial K-antigens and LPSs. This structural data, together with the availability of more and more mutant data, allows new insights into the structure-function relationships of surface polysaccharides and the mode of their action on host cells. This review focuses on rhizobial LPSs and K-antigens. It gives a condensed overview of the recent developments in analysis of their structures and roles during symbiosis.
