Symbiotic and parasitic relationships can alter the degree of endoreduplication in plant cells, and a limited number of studies have documented this occurrence in root cells colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, this phenomenon has not been tested in a wide range of plant species, including species that are non-endopolyploid and those that do not associate with AM fungi. We grew 37 species belonging to 16 plant families, with a range of genome sizes and a range in the degree of endopolyploidy. The endoreduplication index (EI) was compared between plants that were inoculated with Glomus irregulare and plants that were not inoculated. Of the species colonized with AM fungi, 22 of the 25 species had a significant increase in endopolyploid root nuclei over non-mycorrhizal plants, including species that do not normally exhibit endopolyploidy. Changes in the EI were strongly correlated (R(2) = 0.619) with the proportion of root length colonized by arbuscules. No change was detected in the EI for the 12 non-mycorrhizal species. This work indicates that colonization by symbiotic fungi involves a mechanism to increase nuclear DNA content in roots across many angiosperm groups and is likely linked to increased metabolism and protein production.
