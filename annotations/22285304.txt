['22285304', 'MIZ1 is encoded by a gene essential for root hydrotropism in Arabidopsis. To  characterize the property of MIZ1, we used transgenic plants expressing  GFP-tagged MIZ1 (MIZ1-GFP) and mutant MIZ1 (MIZ1(G235E)-GFP) in a miz1-1 mutant.  Although both chimeric genes were transcribed, the translational products of  MIZ1(G235E)-GFP did not accumulate in roots. Moreover, MIZ1-GFP complemented the  mutant phenotype but not MIZ1(G235E)-GFP. The signal corresponding to MIZ1-GFP  was detected at high levels in cortical cells and lateral root cap cells and  accumulated in compartments in cortical cells. MIZ1-GFP was fractionated into a  soluble protein fraction and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane fraction,  where it was bound to the surface of the ER membrane at the cytosolic side.', '2012 Feb 17', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2012.01.008', 'Takahashi']
