['21097710', "Key steps in a plant's development and adaptation to the environment are the  initiation and development of lateral roots (LRs). LR development is regulated by  auxin, the major plant hormone promoting LR formation, its counteracting hormones  cytokinin, and abscisic acid (ABA). Here, we show that mutating ABSCISIC ACID  INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which encodes an ABA-regulated AP2 domain transcription  factor, results in an increased number of LRs. We show that ABI4 is expressed in  roots and that its overexpression impairs LR development. Root expression of ABI4  is enhanced by ABA, and cytokinin and is repressed by auxin. Using hormone  response promoters, we show that ABI4 also affects auxin and cytokinin profiles  in the root. Furthermore, LR development in abi4 mutants is not altered or  inhibited by cytokinin or ABA. Expression of the auxin-efflux carrier protein  PIN1 is reduced in ABI4 overexpressors, enhanced in abi4 mutants, and is less  sensitive to inhibition by cytokinin and ABA in abi4 mutants than in wild-type  plants. Transport levels of exogenously applied auxin were elevated in abi4  mutants and reduced in ABI4 overexpressors. We therefore suggest that ABI4  mediates ABA and cytokinin inhibition of LR formation via reduction of polar  auxin transport and that the resulting decrease in root auxin leads to a  reduction in LR development.", '2010 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074641', 'Bar-Zvi']
