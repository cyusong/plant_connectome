['16233119', 'We isolated cDNA corresponding to open reading frame (ORF) 16 of the 81 kb contig  of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome III [Quigley., Nucleic Acids Res., 24,  4313-4318 (1996)] and expressed alpha-mannosidase activity in tobacco  suspension-cultured cells, which revealed that ORF16 encodes alpha-mannosidase.  We also suggested that Arabidopsis harbors three genes encoding alpha-mannosidase  by homology search against the database.', '2001', 'J Biosci Bioeng', '10.1263/jbb.92.401', 'Seki']
