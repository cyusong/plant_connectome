['19773385', 'Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process for vacuolar  degradation of cytoplasmic components. In higher plants, autophagy defects result  in early senescence and excessive immunity-related programmed cell death (PCD)  irrespective of nutrient conditions; however, the mechanisms by which cells die  in the absence of autophagy have been unclear. Here, we demonstrate a conserved  requirement for salicylic acid (SA) signaling for these phenomena in  autophagy-defective mutants (atg mutants). The atg mutant phenotypes of  accelerated PCD in senescence and immunity are SA signaling dependent but do not  require intact jasmonic acid or ethylene signaling pathways. Application of an SA  agonist induces the senescence/cell death phenotype in SA-deficient atg mutants  but not in atg npr1 plants, suggesting that the cell death phenotypes in the atg  mutants are dependent on the SA signal transducer NONEXPRESSOR OF  PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1. We also show that autophagy is induced by the SA  agonist. These findings imply that plant autophagy operates a novel negative  feedback loop modulating SA signaling to negatively regulate senescence and  immunity-related PCD.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.068635', 'Shirasu']
