['16845526', 'The putative alpha-galactosidase gene HvSF11 of barley, previously shown to be  expressed during dark induced senescence, is expressed in the growing/elongating  zone of primary foliage leaves of barley. The amino acid sequence deduced from  the full length HvSF11 cDNA contains a hydrophobic signal sequence at the  N-terminus. Phylogenetic relationship of the HvSF11 encoded barley  alpha-galactosidase to other alpha-galactosidases revealed high homology with the  alpha-galactosidase encoded by the gene At5g08370 from Arabidopsis thaliana. We  have isolated two independent heterozygous At5g08370 T-DNA insertion mutants from  Arabidopsis thaliana, both of which have a higher number of rosette leaves with a  curly surface leaf morphology and delayed flowering time in comparison to  wildtype plants. Localization of the Arabidopsis alpha-galactosidase protein via  GUS-tag revealed that the protein is associated with the cell wall. This result  was confirmed by immunological detection of the orthologous barley protein in a  protein fraction derived from cell walls of barley leaves. It is concluded that  the alpha-galactosidase proteins from barley and Arabidopsis might fulfill an  important role in leaf development by functioning in cell wall loosening and cell  wall expansion.', '2007 Jan', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-006-0350-9', 'Krupinska']
