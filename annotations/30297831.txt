Legume plants can assimilate inorganic nitrogen and have access to fixed nitrogen through symbiotic interaction with diazotrophic bacteria called rhizobia. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an energy-consuming process and is strongly inhibited when sufficient levels of fixed nitrogen are available, but the molecular mechanisms governing this regulation are largely unknown. The transcription factor nodule inception (NIN) is strictly required for nodulation and belongs to a family of NIN-like proteins (NLPs), which have been implicated in the regulation of nitrogen homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that mutation or downregulation of NLP genes prevents nitrate inhibition of infection, nodule formation and nitrogen fixation. We find that NIN and NLPs physically interact through their carboxy-terminal PB1 domains. Furthermore, we find that NLP1 is required for the expression of nitrate-responsive genes and that nitrate triggers NLP1 re-localization from the cytosol to the nucleus. Finally, we show that NLP1 can suppress NIN activation of CRE1 expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and Medicago truncatula. Our findings highlight a central role for NLPs in the suppression of nodulation by nitrate.
