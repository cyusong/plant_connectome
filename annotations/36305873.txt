Lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors. Class-I LBD genes have been widely demonstrated to play pivotal roles in organ development; however, knowledge on class-II genes remains limited. Here, we report that ZmLBD5, a class-II LBD gene, is involved in the regulation of maize (Zea mays) growth and the drought response by affecting gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis. ZmLBD5 is mainly involved in regulation of the TPS-KS-GA2ox gene module, which is comprised of key enzyme-encoding genes involved in GA and ABA biosynthesis. ABA insufficiency increases stomatal density and aperture in overexpression plants and causes a drought-sensitive phenotype by promoting water transpiration. Increased GA<sub>1</sub> levels promotes seedling growth in overexpression plants. Accordingly, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout lbd5 seedlings are dwarf but drought-tolerant. Moreover, lbd5 has a higher grain yield under drought stress conditions and shows no penalty in well-watered conditions compared to the wild type. On the whole, ZmLBD5 is a negative regulator of maize drought tolerance, and it is a potentially useful target for drought resistance breeding.
