The plant nucleus provides a major hub for environmental signal integration at the chromatin level. Multiple light signaling pathways operate and exchange information by regulating a large repertoire of gene targets that shape plant responses to a changing environment. In addition to the established role of transcription factors in triggering photoregulated changes in gene expression, there are eminent reports on the significance of chromatin regulators and nuclear scaffold dynamics in promoting light-induced plant responses. Here, we report and discuss recent advances in chromatin-regulatory mechanisms modulating plant architecture and development in response to light, including the molecular and physiological roles of key modifications such as DNA, RNA and histone methylation, and/or acetylation. The significance of the formation of biomolecular condensates of key light signaling components is discussed and potential applications to agricultural practices overviewed.
