MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing is a master gene regulatory pathway in plant-pathogen interactions. The differential accumulation of miRNAs among plant varieties alters the expression of target genes, affecting plant defense responses and causing resistance differences among varieties. Botryosphaeria dothidea is an important phytopathogenic fungus of apple (Malus domestica). Malus hupehensis (Pamp.) Rehder, a wild apple species, is highly resistant, whereas the apple cultivar "Fuji" is highly susceptible. Here, we identified a 22-nt miRNA candidate named miRcand137 that compromises host resistance to B. dothidea infection and whose processing was affected by precursor sequence variation between M. hupehensis and "Fuji." miRcand137 guides the direct cleavage of and produced target-derived secondary siRNA against Ethylene response factor 14 (ERF14), a transcriptional activator of pathogenesis-related homologs that confers disease resistance to apple. We showed that miRcand137 acts as an inhibitor of apple immunity by compromising ERF14-mediated anti-fungal defense and revealed a negative association between miRcand137 expression and B. dothidea sensitivity in both resistant and susceptible apples. Furthermore, MIRCAND137 was transcriptionally activated by the invading fungi but not by the fungal elicitor, implying B. dothidea induced host miRcand137 as an infection strategy. We propose that the inefficient miRcand137 processing in M. hupehensis decreased pathogen-initiated miRcand137 accumulation, leading to higher resistance against B. dothidea.
