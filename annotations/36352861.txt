Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), known as the most economically devastating disease in citrus industry, is mainly caused by phloem-restricted Gram-negative bacterium "<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus" (<i>C</i>Las). To date, <i>C</i>Las is still unculturable <i>in vitro</i>, which has been dramatically delaying the research on its pathogenesis, and only few Sec-dependent effectors (SDEs) have been identified to elucidate the pathogenesis of <i>C</i>Las. Here, we confirmed that a <i>C</i>Las-secreted Sec-dependent polypeptide, namely SECP8 (CLIBASIA_05330), localized in nucleus, cytoplasm and cytoplasmic membrane, and showed remarkably higher transcript abundance in citrus than in psyllids. <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-mediated transient expression assays indicated that mSECP8 (the mature form of SECP8) suppressed pro-apoptotic mouse protein BAX and <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> elicitin INF1-triggered hypersensitive response (HR) associated phenotypes, including cell death, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and callose deposition. Intriguingly, mSECP8 also inhibited SDE1 (CLIBASIA_05315)-induced water-soaked and dwarfing symptoms in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. In addition, mSECP8 can promote the susceptibility of transgenic Wanjincheng orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>) to <i>C</i>Las invasion and further HLB symptom development, and it contributes to the proliferation of <i>Xanthomonas citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i> (<i>Xcc</i>). Moreover, the expression of ten immunity-related genes were significantly down-regulated in mSECP8 transgenic citrus than those in wide-type (WT) plants. Overall, we propose that mSECP8 may serve as a novel broad-spectrum suppressor of plant immunity, and provide the first evidence counteractive effect among <i>C</i>Las effectors. This study will enrich and provide new evidences for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of <i>C</i>Las in citrus host.
