Phosphorus (P) is a limiting nutrient for plant growth and productivity. Thus, a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plants' response to phosphate starvation is significant when breeding crops with higher phosphorus-use efficiency. Here, we found that GARP-type transcription factor GLK1 acted as a positive regulator for phosphate-starvation response (PSR) via the PHR1-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. GLK1 increased the transcription activity of PHR1 through the direct physical interaction and regulated the multiple responses to inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) starvation. Nitrogen (N) is a key factor in the regulation of PSR. We also found that the N status controlled the function of the GLK1-PHR1 signaling module under Pi-deficient (LP) conditions by regulating the accumulation of GLK1 and PHR1. Ultimately, we showed that the presence of GLK1 effectively promoted the protein accumulation of PHR1 at low N concentrations, and this action was helpful to maintain the activation of PSR. According to these findings, we establish the working model for GLK1 in PSR and propose that GLK1 mediates the interaction between N and P by influencing the effect of N on PHR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.
