Grain weight is a major determinant in rice yield, which is tightly associated with grain size. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that control this trait remain unclear. Here, we report a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant, low grain weight (<i>lgw</i>), which shows that reduced grain length is caused by decreased cell elongation and proliferation. Map-based cloning revealed that all mutant phenotypes resulted from a nine-base pair (bp) deletion in <i>LGW</i>, which encodes the kinesin-like protein BRITTLE CULM12 (BC12). Protein sequence alignment analysis revealed that the mutation site was located at the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of LGW/BC12, resulting in the lgw protein not being located in the nucleus. LGW is preferentially expressed in both culms and roots, as well as in the early developing panicles. Overexpression of <i>LGW</i> increased the grain length, indicating that LGW is a positive regulator for regulating grain length. In addition, LGW/BC12 is directly bound to the promoter of <i>GW7</i> and activates its expression. Elevating the <i>GW7</i> expression levels in <i>lgw</i> plants rescued the small grain size phenotype. We conclude that LGW regulates grain development by directly binding to the <i>GW7</i> promoter and activating its expression. Our findings revealed that LGW plays an important role in regulating grain size, and manipulation of this gene provides a new strategy for regulating grain weight in rice.
