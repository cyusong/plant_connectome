ABI4 is considered an important transcription factor with multiple regulatory functions involved in many biological events. However, its role in abiotic stresses, especially low-temperature-induced stress, is poorly understood. In this study, the <i>MtABI4</i> gene was derived from <i>M. truncatula</i>, a widely used forage grass. Analysis of subcellular localization indicated that ABI4 was localized in the nucleus. Identification of expression characteristics showed that <i>ABI4</i> was involved in the regulatory mechanisms of multiple hormones and could be induced by the low temperature. IP-MS assay revealed that MtABI4 protein could interact with xanthoxin dehydrogenase protein (ABA2). The two-hybrid yeast assay and the biomolecular fluorescence complementarity assay further supported this finding. Expression analysis demonstrated that overexpression of <i>MtABI4</i> induced an increase in <i>ABA2</i> gene expression both in <i>M. truncatula</i> and <i>Arabidopsis</i>, which in turn increased the ABA level in transgenic plants. In addition, the transgenic lines with the overexpression of <i>MtABI4</i> exhibited enhanced tolerance to low temperature, including lower malondialdehyde content, electrical conductivity, and cell membrane permeability, compared with the wide-type lines after being cultivated for 5 days in 4°C. Gene expression and enzyme activities of the antioxidant system assay revealed the increased activities of SOD, CAT, MDHAR, and GR, and higher ASA/DHA ratio and GSH/GSSG ratio in transgenic lines. Additionally, overexpression of <i>ABI4</i> also induced the expression of members of the Inducer of CBF expression genes (ICEs)-C-repeat binding transcription factor genes(CBFs)-Cold regulated genes (CORs) low-temperature response module. In summary, under low-temperature conditions, overexpression of <i>ABI4</i> could enhance the content of endogenous ABA in plants through interactions with ABA2, which in turn reduced low-temperature damage in plants. This provides a new perspective for further understanding the molecular regulatory mechanism of plant response to low temperature and the improvement of plant cold tolerance.
