Our understanding of plastid transcriptomes is limited to a few model plants whose plastid genomes (plastomes) have a highly conserved gene order. Consequently, little is known about how gene expression changes in response to genomic rearrangements in plastids. This is particularly important in the highly rearranged conifer plastomes. We sequenced and reported the plastomes and plastid transcriptomes of six conifer species, representing all six extant families. Strand-specific RNAseq data show a nearly full transcription of both plastomic strands and detect C-to-U RNA-editing sites at both sense and antisense transcripts. We demonstrate that the expression of plastid coding genes is strongly functionally dependent among conifer species. However, the strength of this association declines as the number of plastomic rearrangements increases. This finding indicates that plastomic rearrangement influences gene expression. Our data provide the first line of evidence that plastomic rearrangements not only complicate the plastomic architecture but also drive the dynamics of plastid transcriptomes in conifers.
