For immobile plants, the main means of protection against adverse environmental factors is the biosynthesis of various secondary (specialized) metabolites. The extreme diversity and high biological activity of these metabolites determine the researchers' interest in plants as a source of therapeutic agents. Oxylipins, oxygenated derivatives of fatty acids, are particularly promising in this regard. Plant oxylipins, which are characterized by a diversity of chemical structures, can exert protective and therapeutic properties in animal cells. While the therapeutic potential of some classes of plant oxylipins, such as jasmonates and acetylenic oxylipins, has been analyzed thoroughly, other oxylipins are barely studied in this regard. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic potential of all major classes of plant oxylipins, including derivatives of acetylenic fatty acids, jasmonates, six- and nine-carbon aldehydes, oxy-, epoxy-, and hydroxy-derivatives of fatty acids, as well as spontaneously formed phytoprostanes and phytofurans. The presented analysis will provide an impetus for further research investigating the beneficial properties of these secondary metabolites and bringing them closer to practical applications.
