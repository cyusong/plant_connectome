Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of plant steroid hormones that play important roles in a wide range of developmental and physiological processes in plants. Transcription factors BRASSINOZALE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) and its homologs are key components of BR signaling and integrate a wide range of internal and environmental signals to coordinate plant growth and development. Although several E3 ligases have been reported to regulate the stability of BZR1, the molecular mechanism of BZR1 degradation remains unclear. Here, we reveal how a newly identified molecular mechanism underlying EBF1 directly regulates BZR1 protein stability via the 26S proteasome pathway, repressing BR function on regulating Arabidopsis apical hook development and hypocotyl elongation. BZR1 directly binds to the EBF1 gene promotor to reduce EBF1 expression. Furthermore, the genetic analysis shows that BZR1, EIN3 and PIF4 interdependently regulate plant apical hook development. Taken together, our data demonstrates that EBF1 is a negative regulator of the BR signaling pathway.
