['25039392', 'Fruits are complex plant structures that nurture seeds and facilitate their  dispersal. The Arabidopsis fruit is termed silique. It develops from the  gynoecium, which has a stigma, a style, an ovary containing the ovules, and a  gynophore. Externally, the ovary consists of two valves, and their margins lay  adjacent to the replum, which is connected to the septum that internally divides  the ovary. In this work we describe the role for the zinc-finger transcription  factor NO TRANSMITTING TRACT (NTT) in replum development. NTT loss of function  leads to reduced replum width and cell number, whereas increased expression  promotes replum enlargement. NTT activates the homeobox gene BP, which, together  with RPL, is important for replum development. In addition, the NTT protein is  able to bind the BP promoter in yeast, and when this binding region is not  present, NTT fails to activate BP in the replum. Furthermore, NTT interacts with  itself and different proteins involved in fruit development: RPL, STM, FUL, SHP1  and SHP2 in yeast and in planta. Moreover, its genetic interactions provide  further evidence about its biological relevance in replum development.', '2014 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12617', 'de']
