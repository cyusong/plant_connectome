The discovery of <i>Mariam</i>, a wheat-unique miniature transposable element family, was reported in our previous study. We have also shown the possible impact of <i>Mariam</i> insertions on the expression of wheat genes. However, the evolutionary dynamics of <i>Mariam</i> was not studied in detail. In this study, we have assessed the insertion sites of <i>Mariam</i> family in different wheat species. <i>In-silico</i> analysis of <i>Mariam</i> insertions has allowed the discovery of two different sequence versions of <i>Mariam</i>, and that <i>Mariam</i> might have been recently active in wild emmer wheat genome (<i>T. turgidum</i> ssp <i>diccocoides</i>). In addition, the analysis of <i>Mariam</i> insertional polymorphism has facilitated the discovery of large genomic rearrangement events, such as deletions and introgressions in the wheat genome. The dynamics of <i>Mariam</i> family sheds light on the evolution of wheat.
