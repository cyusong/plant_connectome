['19210750', 'Recently, we have isolated salt-tolerance genes (SATs) on the basis of the  overexpression screening of yeast with a maize cDNA library from kernels. One of  the selected genes [salt-tolerance 32 (SAT32)] appears to be a key determinant  for salt stress tolerance in yeast cells. Maize SAT32 cDNA encodes for a 49-kDa  protein, which is 41% identity with the Arabidopsis salt-tolerance 32 (AtSAT32)  unknown gene. Arabidopsis Transfer-DNA (T-DNA) knockout AtSAT32 (atsat32) altered  root elongation, including reduced silique length and reduced seed number. In an  effort to further assess salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis, we have functionally  characterized the AtSAT32 gene and determined that salinity and the plant hormone  ABA induced the expression of AtSAT32. The atsat32 mutant was more sensitive to  salinity than the wild-type plant. On the contrary, Arabidopsis overexpressing  AtSAT32 (35S::AtSAT32) showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased activity of  vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase, EC 3.6.1.1) under high-salt conditions.  Consistent with these observations, 35S::AtSAT32 plants exhibited increased  expression of salt-responsive and ABA-responsive genes, including the Rd29A,  Erd15, Rd29B, Rd22 and RAB18 genes. Therefore, our results indicate that AtSAT32  is involved in both salinity tolerance and ABA signaling as a positive regulator  in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Apr', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01202.x', 'Kim']
