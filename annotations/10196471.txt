['10196471', 'An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA, called At14a, was isolated by immunoscreening an  expression library with an anti-integrin antibody. The At14a cDNA is 1459  nucleotides and has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 385 amino acids  and a predicted molecular weight of 43kDa. At14a has a small domain that has  sequence similarities to integrins from fungi, insects and humans. Transcripts of  At14a are found in all Arabidopsis tissues examined, and when expressed as an  epitope tagged fusion protein in transgenic plants, At14a localizes partly to the  plasma membrane.', '1999 Apr 1', 'Gene', '10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00068-2', 'Quatrano']
