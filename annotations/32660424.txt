Phosphorus deficiency is a major limiting factors for affecting crop production globally. To understand the genetic variation of phosphorus-deficiency-tolerance, a total of 15 seedling traits were evaluated among 707 Chinese wheat landraces under application of phosphorus (AP) and non-application of phosphorus (NP). A total of 18,594 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 38,678 diversity arrays technology sequencing markers were used to detect marker-trait associations under AP and NP. Top ten genotypes with extremely tolerance and bottommost ten genotypes with extremely sensitivity were selected from 707 Chinese wheat landraces for future breeding and genetic analysis. A total of 55 significant markers (81 marker-trait associations) for 13 traits by both CMLM and SUPER method. These were distributed on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 6D, 7A and 7B. Considering the linkage disequilibrium decay distance, 25 and 12 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected under AP and NP, respectively (9 QTL were specific to NP). The extremely tolerant landraces could be used for breeding phosphorus-deficiency-tolerant cultivars. The QTL could be useful in wheat breeding through marker-assisted selection. Our findings provide new insight into the genetic analysis of P-deficiency-tolerance, and will be helpful for breeding P-deficiency-tolerant cultivars.
