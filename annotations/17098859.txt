An extensive search for maize (Zea mays) genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and assembly has been performed and 735 sequences have been centralized in a database, MAIZEWALL (http://www.polebio.scsv.ups-tlse.fr/MAIZEWALL). MAIZEWALL contains a bioinformatic analysis for each entry and gene expression data that are accessible via a user-friendly interface. A maize cell wall macroarray composed of a gene-specific tag for each entry was also constructed to monitor global cell wall-related gene expression in different organs and during internode development. By using this macroarray, we identified sets of genes that exhibit organ and internode-stage preferential expression profiles. These data provide a comprehensive fingerprint of cell wall-related gene expression throughout the maize plant. Moreover, an in-depth examination of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis coupled to biochemical and cytological data from different organs and stages of internode development has also been undertaken. These results allow us to trace spatially and developmentally regulated, putative preferential routes of monolignol biosynthesis involving specific gene family members and suggest that, although all of the gene families of the currently accepted monolignol biosynthetic pathway are conserved in maize, there are subtle differences in family size and a high degree of complexity in spatial expression patterns. These differences are in keeping with the diversity of lignified cell types throughout the maize plant.
