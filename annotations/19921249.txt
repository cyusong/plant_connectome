The cell cycle is an important process during seed development in plants and its progression is driven by a number of core regulators such as the cyclins. Currently, however, little is known regarding the role of the cyclins in embryo and endosperm development in cereals. In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo. It was further found that a delayed and abnormal cellularization occurred in the endosperm in these knockdown seeds which eventually became abortive. Moreover, the observed development of the enlarged embryo was also morphologically abnormal and found to be caused by an enlarged cell size rather than an increased cell number. Expression analysis showed that Orysa;CycB1;1 transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling further indicated that a large number of genes are responsible for the phenotype of the enlarged embryo. The results of the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 via an endosperm or an embryo-specific promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm. Our results suggest that Orysa;CycB1;1 expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice.
