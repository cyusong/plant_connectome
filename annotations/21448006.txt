NRT1.1 is a dual-affinity nitrate transporter and a nitrate sensor that plays a role in nitrate-dependent signaling pathway. Recently, it has been revealed that NRT1.1 mutants show enhanced tolerance to ammonium and/or low pH conditions in the absence of nitrate, which indicates a nitrate-independent function of NRT1.1. Detailed underlying mechanisms for the ammonium/low pH-tolerance of the NRT1.1 mutants will be revealed by paying attention to auxin behavior, phosphorylated status of NRT1.1 and other components related to the primary nitrate response and nitrate transport.
