['15992545', 'The plant hormone auxin has been implicated in virtually every aspect of plant  growth and development. Auxin acts by promoting the degradation of  transcriptional regulators called Aux/IAA proteins. Aux/IAA degradation requires  TIR1, an F box protein that has been shown to function as an auxin receptor.  However, loss of TIR1 has a modest effect on auxin response and plant  development. Here we show that three additional F box proteins, called AFB1, 2,  and 3, also regulate auxin response. Like TIR1, these proteins interact with the  Aux/IAA proteins in an auxin-dependent manner. Plants that are deficient in all  four proteins are auxin insensitive and exhibit a severe embryonic phenotype  similar to the mp/arf5 and bdl/iaa12 mutants. Correspondingly, all TIR1/AFB  proteins interact with BDL, and BDL is stabilized in triple mutant plants. Our  results indicate that TIR1 and the AFB proteins collectively mediate auxin  responses throughout plant development.', '2005 Jul', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2005.05.014', 'Estelle']
