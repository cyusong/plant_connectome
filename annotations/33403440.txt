4-coumarate-CoA ligase (VIT_02s0109g00250) and copper amine oxidase (VIT_17s0000g09100) played essential roles in contributing to the total soluble solid and total anthocyanin variations induced by bud sport in grape berries. Taste and color, which are important organoleptic qualities of grape berry, undergo rapid and substantial changes during development and ripening. In this study, we used two cultivars 'Summer Black' and its bud sport 'Nantaihutezao' to explore and identify differentially expressed genes associated with total soluble solid and anthocyanin during developmental stages using RNA-Seq. Overall, substantial differences in expression were observed across berry development between the two cultivars. 5388 genes were detected by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) associated with the total soluble solid (TSS) and anthocyanin contents variations. Several of these genes were significantly enriched in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway; two hub genes 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (VIT_02s0109g00250) and copper amine oxidase (VIT_17s0000g09100) played the most essential roles in relating to the total soluble solid and total anthocyanin variations induced by bud sport through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and co-expression network analysis. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism responsible for the bud sport phenotype.
