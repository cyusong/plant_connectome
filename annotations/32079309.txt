Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is considered as a prognostic factor of breast cancer, which is positively associated with recurrence when cancer metastasizes to the lymph nodes. Here, we expressed the single variable domain on a heavy chain (VHH) form of anti-HER2 camelid single domain antibody in tobacco plants and compared its in vitro anticancer activities with the anti-HER2 full size antibody. The gene expression cassette containing anti-HER2 camelid single domain antibody VHH fused to human IgG Fc region with KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (VHH-FcK) was transferred into the tobacco plant via the <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. The transformants were screened with polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the binding of the purified anti-HER2 VHH-FcK to the HER2-positive breast cancer cell line, SK-BR-3. Migration assay results confirmed anticancer activity of the plant-derived anticancer camelid single chain antibody. Taken together, we confirmed the possibility of using anti-HER2 VHH-FcK as a therapeutic anticancer agent, which can be expressed and assembled and purified from a plant expression system as an alternative antibody production system.
