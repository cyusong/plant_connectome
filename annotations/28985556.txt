The genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha is an important step toward development of a new plant model system (Bowman et al., 2017). Liverworts may be the sister taxon to all other land plants, and the genome shows features that illuminate the ancestor of all land plants and give insights into how plant systems function and evolved.
