Ethylene plays important roles in plant growth and development, but the regulation of ethylene signaling is largely unclear, especially in crops such as rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Here, by analysis of the ethylene-insensitive mutant <i>mao huzi 11</i> (<i>mhz11</i>), we identified the GDSL lipase MHZ11, which modulates ethylene signaling in rice roots. MHZ11 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and has acyl-hydrolyzing activity. This activity affects the homeostasis of sterols in rice roots and is required for root ethylene response. <i>MHZ11</i> overexpression caused constitutive ethylene response in roots. Genetically, <i>MHZ11</i> acts with the ethylene receptor <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR2</i> (<i>OsERS2</i>) upstream of <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE2</i> (<i>OsCTR2</i>) and <i>ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2</i> (<i>OsEIN2</i>). The <i>mhz11</i> mutant maintains more OsCTR2 in the phosphorylated form whereas <i>MHZ11</i> overexpression promotes ethylene-mediated inhibition of OsCTR2 phosphorylation. MHZ11 colocalized with the ethylene receptor OsERS2, and its effect on OsCTR2 phosphorylation requires ethylene perception and initiation of ethylene signaling. The <i>mhz11</i> mutant overaccumulated sterols and blocking sterol biosynthesis partially rescued the <i>mhz11</i> ethylene response, likely by reducing receptor-OsCTR2 interaction and OsCTR2 phosphorylation. We propose that MHZ11 reduces sterol levels to impair receptor-OsCTR2 interactions and OsCTR2 phosphorylation for triggering ethylene signaling. Our study reveals a mechanism by which MHZ11 participates in ethylene signaling for regulation of root growth in rice.
