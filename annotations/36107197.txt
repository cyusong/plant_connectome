Lysin-motif receptor-like kinases (LysM-RLKs) are involved in the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns to initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). LysM-RLKs are also required for recognition of microbe-derived symbiotic signal molecules upon establishing mutualistic interactions between plants and microsymbionts. A LysM-RLK CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE1 (CERK1) plays central roles both in chitin-mediated PTI and in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, suggesting the overlap between immunity and symbiosis, at least in the signal perception and the activation of downstream signal cascades. In this study, we screened for the interacting proteins of Nod factor Receptor1 (NFR1), a CERK1 homolog in the model legume <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and obtained a protein orthologous to NONRACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1/HARPIN-INDUCED1-LIKE13 (NHL13), a protein involved in the activation of innate immunity in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, which we named LjNHL13a. LjNHL13a interacted with NFR1 and with the symbiosis receptor kinase SymRK. LjNHL13a also displayed positive effects in nodulation. Our results suggest that NHL13 plays a role both in plant immunity and symbiosis, possibly where they overlap. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
