Nitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as an important signaling molecule and there has been an increasing bulk of studies regarding the various functions of NO in plants exposed to environmental stimulus. There is also emerging evidence, although not extensive, that NO plays systemic signaling roles during the establishment of salt tolerance in many plant species. In this mini-review, we highlight several candidate mechanisms as being functional in this NO systemic signaling action. In addition, we outline data supporting that plants possess prime-like mechanisms that allow them to memorize previous NO exposure events and generate defense responses following salt stress.
