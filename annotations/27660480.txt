Climate change has brought severe challenges to agriculture. It is anticipated that there will be a drop in crop yield - including that of soybean - due to climatic stress factors that include drastic fluctuations in temperature, drought, flooding and high salinity. Genomic information on soybean has been accumulating rapidly since initial publication of its reference genome, providing a valuable tool for the improvement of cultivated soybean. Not only are many molecular markers that are associated with important quantitative trait loci now identified, but we also have a more detailed picture of the genomic variations among soybean germplasms, enabling us to utilize these as tools to assist crop breeding. In this review, we will summarize and discuss the currently available soybean genomic approaches, including whole-genome sequencing, sequencing-based genotyping, functional genomics, proteomics, and epigenomics. The information uncovered through these techniques will help further pinpoint important gene candidates and genomic loci associated with adaptive traits, as well as achieving a better understanding of how soybeans cope with the changing climate.
