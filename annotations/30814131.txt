Repressive epigenetic marks, such as DNA and histone methylation, are sometimes located within introns. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION2 (IBM2), an RNA-binding protein containing a bromo-adjacent homology domain, is required to process functional transcript isoforms of genes carrying intronic heterochromatin. In a genetic screen for suppressors of the <i>ibm2</i> mutation, we identified FPA, an RNA-binding protein that promotes use of proximal polyadenylation sites in genes targeted by IBM2, including <i>IBM1</i> encoding an essential H3K9 histone demethylase and the disease resistance gene <i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA7</i> Both IBM2 and FPA are involved in the processing of their common mRNA targets: Transcription of IBM2 target genes is restored when <i>FPA</i> is mutated in <i>ibm2</i> and impaired in transgenic plants overexpressing <i>FPA</i> By contrast, transposons targeted by IBM2 and localized outside introns are not under this antagonistic control. The DNA methylation patterns of some genes and transposons are modified in <i>fpa</i> plants, including the large intron of <i>IBM1</i>, but these changes are rather limited and reversed when the mutant is complemented, indicating that FPA has a restricted role in mediating silencing. These data reveal a complex regulation by IBM2 and FPA pathways in processing mRNAs of genes bearing heterochromatic marks.
