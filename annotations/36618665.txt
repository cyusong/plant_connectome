In contrast to the relatively static image of the plants, the world inside each cell is surprisingly dynamic. Membrane-bounded organelles move actively on the cytoskeletons and exchange materials by vesicles, tubules, or direct contact between each other. In order to understand what is happening during those events, it is essential to visualize the working components <i>in vivo</i>. After the breakthrough made by the application of fluorescent proteins, the development of light microscopy enabled many discoveries in cell biology, including those about the membrane traffic in plant cells. Especially, super-resolution microscopy, which is becoming more and more accessible, is now one of the most powerful techniques. However, although the spatial resolution has improved a lot, there are still some difficulties in terms of the temporal resolution, which is also a crucial parameter for the visualization of the living nature of the intracellular structures. In this review, we will introduce the super resolution microscopy developed especially for live-cell imaging with high temporal resolution, and show some examples that were made by this tool in plant membrane research.
