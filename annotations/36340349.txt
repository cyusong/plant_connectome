As the unique source of carbon in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) exerts a strong impact on crop yield and quality. However, CO<sub>2</sub> deficiency in greenhouses during the daytime often limits crop productivity. Crucially, climate warming, caused by increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, urges global efforts to implement carbon reduction and neutrality, which also bring challenges to current CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment systems applied in greenhouses. Thus, there is a timely need to develop cost-effective and environmentally friendly CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment technologies as a sustainable approach to promoting agricultural production and alleviating environmental burdens simultaneously. Here we review several common technologies of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in greenhouse production, and their characteristics and limitations. Some control strategies of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in distribution, period, and concentration are also discussed. We further introduce promising directions for future CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment including 1) agro-industrial symbiosis system (AIS); 2) interdisciplinary application of carbon capture and utilization (CCU); and 3) optimization of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in C<sub>3</sub> crops <i>via</i> biotechnologies. This review aims to provide perspectives on efficient CO<sub>2</sub> utilization in greenhouse production.
