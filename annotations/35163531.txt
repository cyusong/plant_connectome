Flowering is a key agronomic trait that influences adaptation and productivity. Previous studies have indicated the genetic complexity associated with the flowering response in a photoinsensitive weedy rice accession PSRR-1 despite the presence of a photosensitive allele of a key flowering gene <i>Hd1</i>. In this study, we used whole-genome and RNA sequencing data from both cultivated and weedy rice to add further insights. The <i>de novo</i> assembly of unaligned sequences predicted 225 genes, in which 45 were specific to PSRR-1, including two genes associated with flowering. Comparison of the variants in PSRR-1 with the 3K rice genome (RG) dataset identified unique variants within the heading date QTLs. Analyses of the RNA-Seq result under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions revealed that many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) colocalized with the flowering QTLs, and some DEGs such as <i>Hd1</i>, <i>OsMADS56</i>, <i>Hd3a</i>, and <i>RFT1</i> had unique variants in PSRR-1. <i>Ehd1</i>, <i>Hd1</i>, <i>OsMADS15</i>, and <i>OsMADS56</i> showed different alternate splicing (AS) events between genotypes and day length conditions. <i>OsMADS56</i> was expressed in PSRR-1 but not in Cypress under both LD and SD conditions. Based on variations in both sequence and expression, the unique flowering response in PSRR-1 may be due to the high-impact variants of flowering genes, and <i>OsMADS56</i> is proposed as a key regulator for its day-neutral flowering response.
