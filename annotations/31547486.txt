CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing is a powerful technology that has been used for the genetic modification of a number of crop species. In order to evaluate the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the root crop, sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>), two starch biosynthetic pathway genes, <i>IbGBSSI</i> (encoding granule-bound starch synthase I), and <i>IbSBEII</i> (encoding starch branching enzyme II), were targeted in the starch-type cultivar Xushu22 and carotenoid-rich cultivar Taizhong6. <i>I. batatas</i> was transformed using a binary vector, in which the <i>Cas9</i> gene is driven by the <i>Arabidopsis</i> AtUBQ promoter and the guide RNA is controlled by the <i>Arabidopsis</i> AtU6 promoter. A total of 72 Xushu22 and 35 Taizhong6 transgenic lines were generated and analyzed for mutations. The mutation efficiency was 62-92% with multi-allelic mutations in both cultivars. Most of the mutations were nucleotide substitutions that lead to amino acid changes and, less frequently, stop codons. In addition, short nucleotide insertions or deletions were also found in both <i>IbGBSSI</i> and <i>IbSBEII</i>. Furthermore, a 2658 bp deletion was found in one <i>IbSBEII</i> transgenic line. The total starch contents were not significantly changed in <i>IbGBSSI</i>- and <i>IbSBEII</i>-knockout transgenic lines compared to the wild-type control. However, in the allopolyploid sweet potato, the <i>IbGBSSI</i>-knockout reduced, while the <i>IbSBEII</i>-knockout increased, the amylose percentage. Our results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 technology is an effective tool for the improvement of starch qualities in sweet potato and breeding of polyploid root crops.
