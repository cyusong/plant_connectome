['21189293', 'Using the tip-growing pollen tube of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum  as a model to investigate endocytosis mechanisms, we show that  phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 6 (PIP5K6) regulates clathrin-dependent  endocytosis in pollen tubes. Green fluorescent protein-tagged PIP5K6 was  preferentially localized to the subapical plasma membrane (PM) in pollen tubes  where it apparently converts phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) to  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)]. RNA interference-induced  suppression of PIP5K6 expression impaired tip growth and inhibited  clathrin-dependent endocytosis in pollen tubes. By contrast, PIP5K6  overexpression induced massive aggregation of the PM in pollen tube tips. This PM  abnormality was apparently due to excessive clathrin-dependent membrane  invagination because this defect was suppressed by the expression of a  dominant-negative mutant of clathrin heavy chain. These results support a role  for PI(4,5)P(2) in promoting early stages of clathrin-dependent endocytosis  (i.e., membrane invagination). Interestingly, the PIP5K6 overexpression-induced  PM abnormality was partially suppressed not only by the overexpression of PLC2,  which breaks down PI(4,5)P(2), but also by that of PI4Kbeta1, which increases the  pool of PI4P. Based on these observations, we propose that a proper balance  between PI4P and PI(4,5)P(2) is required for clathrin-dependent endocytosis in  the tip of pollen tubes.', '2010 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.076760', 'Yang']
