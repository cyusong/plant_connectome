Using the serial analysis of gene expression technique, we surveyed transcriptomes of three major tissues (panicles, leaves, and roots) of a super-hybrid rice (Oryza sativa) strain, LYP9, in comparison to its parental cultivars, 93-11 (indica) and PA64s (japonica). We acquired 465,679 tags from the serial analysis of gene expression libraries, which were consolidated into 68,483 unique tags. Focusing our initial functional analyses on a subset of the data that are supported by full-length cDNAs and the tags (genes) differentially expressed in the hybrid at a significant level (P<0.01), we identified 595 up-regulated (22 tags in panicles, 228 in leaves, and 345 in roots) and 25 down-regulated (seven tags in panicles, 15 in leaves, and three in roots) in LYP9. Most of the tag-identified and up-regulated genes were found related to enhancing carbon- and nitrogen-assimilation, including photosynthesis in leaves, nitrogen uptake in roots, and rapid growth in both roots and panicles. Among the down-regulated genes in LYP9, there is an essential enzyme in photorespiration, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1. Our study adds a new set of data crucial for the understanding of molecular mechanisms of heterosis and gene regulation networks of the cultivated rice.
