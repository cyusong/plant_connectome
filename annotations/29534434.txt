The development and growth of plant organs is regulated by phytohormones, which constitute an important area of plant science. The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the unravelling of the pathways by which phytohormones exert their influence. Phytohormones function as signalling molecules that interact through a complex network to control development traits. They integrate metabolic and developmental events and regulate plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress factors. As such, they influence the yield and quality of crops. Recent studies on barley have emphasised the importance of phytohormones in promoting agronomically important traits such as tillering, plant height, leaf blade area and spike/spikelet development. Understanding the mechanisms of how phytohormones interact may help to modify barley architecture and thereby improve its adaptation and yield. To achieve this goal, extensive functional validation analyses are necessary to better understand the complex dynamics of phytohormone interactions and phytohormone networks that underlie the biological processes. The present review summarises the current knowledge on the crosstalk between phytohormones and their roles in barley development. Furthermore, an overview of how phytohormone modulation may help to improve barley plant architecture is also provided.
