Unicellular eukaryotes primarily employ self/nonself discrimination to avoid self-mating, whereas multicellular organisms also use self/nonself discrimination in immune defense. Recent advances in understanding self/nonself discrimination in eukaryotes shed new light on the emergence of the most sophisticated self/nonself discrimination system known, the antigen receptors employed in the adaptive immune system.
