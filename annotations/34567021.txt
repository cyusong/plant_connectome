Objectively evaluating different lines of evidence within a formalized framework is the most efficient and theoretically grounded approach for defining robust species hypotheses. Asteropyrum Drumm. et Hutch. is a small genus of perennial herb containing two species, A. cavaleriei and A. peltatum. The distinction of these two species mainly lies in the shape and size of leaf blades. However, these characters have been considered labile and could not differentiate the two species reliably. In this study, we investigated the variation of the leaf blades of 28 populations across the whole range of Asteropyrum using the landmark-based geometric morphometrics (GMM), sought genetic gaps within this genus using DNA barcoding, phylogenetic reconstruction and population genetic methods, and compared the predicted ecological niches of the two species. The results showed that the leaf form (shape and size) was overlapped between the two species; barcode gap was not detected within the genus Asteropyrum; and little ecological and geographical differentiation was found between the two taxa. Two genetic clusters detected by population genetic analysis did not match the two morphospecies. The results suggest that there are no distinct boundaries between the two species of Asteropyrum in terms of morphology, genetics and ecology and this present classification should be abandoned. We anticipate that range-wide population genomic studies would properly delineate the species boundaries and help to understand the evolution and speciation within Asteropyrum.
