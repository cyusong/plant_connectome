['26304848', 'Reversible protein phosphorylation mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases  plays an important role in the regulation of leaf senescence. We previously  reported that the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED  RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (AtSARK) positively regulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we report the involvement of a protein  serine/threonine phosphatase 2C-type protein phosphatase, SENESCENCE-SUPPRESSED  PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE (SSPP), in the negative regulation of Arabidopsis leaf  senescence. SSPP transcript levels decreased greatly during both natural  senescence and SARK-induced precocious senescence. Overexpression of SSPP  significantly delayed leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. Protein pull-down and  bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that the  cytosol-localized SSPP could interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the plasma  membrane-localized AtSARK. In vitro assays showed that SSPP has protein  phosphatase function and can dephosphorylate the cytosolic domain of AtSARK.  Consistent with these observations, overexpression of SSPP effectively rescued  AtSARK-induced precocious leaf senescence and changes in hormonal responses. All  our results suggested that SSPP functions in sustaining proper leaf longevity and  preventing early senescence by suppressing or perturbing SARK-mediated senescence  signal transduction.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01112', 'ORCID:']
