['18757555', 'Apical meristems play a central role in plant development. Self-renewing cells in  the central region of the shoot meristem replenish the cell population in the  peripheral region, where organ primordia emerge in a predictable pattern, and in  the underlying rib meristem, where new stem tissue is formed. While much is known  about how organ primordia are initiated and their lateral boundaries established,  development at the interface between the stem and the meristem or the lateral  organs is poorly understood. Here, we show that the BELL-type ARABIDOPSIS  THALIANA HOMEOBOX GENE1 (ATH1) is required for proper development of the boundary  between the stem and both vegetative and reproductive organs and that this role  partially overlaps with that of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON genes. During the vegetative  phase, ATH1 also functions redundantly with light-activated genes to inhibit  growth of the region below the shoot meristem. Consistent with a role in  inhibiting stem growth, ATH1 is downregulated at the start of inflorescence  development and ectopic ATH1 expression prevents growth of the inflorescence stem  by reducing cell proliferation. Thus, ATH1 modulates growth at the interface  between the stem, meristem, and organ primordia and contributes to the compressed  vegetative habit of Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.059188', 'Sablowski']
