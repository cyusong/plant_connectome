The steroid hormone brassinosteroid (BR) plays a broad role in plant growth and development. As the retarded growth in BR-insensitive and BR-deficient mutants causes a strong delay in days to flowering, BR signaling has been thought to promote the floral transition in Arabidopsis. In this study, using a developmental measure of flowering time, we show that BR signaling inhibits the floral transition and promotes vegetative growth in the Arabidopsis accessions Columbia and Enkheim-2. We found that BR signaling promotes the expression of the potent floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and three FLC homologs to inhibit flowering. In the presence of BR, the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1), together with BES1-INTERACTING MYC-like proteins (BIMs), specifically binds a BR- responsive element in the first intron of FLC and further recruits a histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase to downregulate levels of the repressive H3K27 trimethylation mark and thus antagonize Polycomb silencing at FLC, leading to its activation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BR signaling inhibits the floral transition in Arabidopsis by a novel molecular mechanism in which BR signals are transduced into FLC activation and consequent floral repression.
