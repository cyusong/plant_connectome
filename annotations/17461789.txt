['17461789', 'The cancer-preventive activity of cruciferous vegetables is commonly attributed  to isothiocyanates resulting from the breakdown of the natural products  glucosinolates (GSLs). Sulforaphane, the isothiocyanate derived from  4-methylsulfinylbutyl GSL, is thought to be the major agent conferring  cancer-preventive properties, whereas the isothiocyanate of 4-methylthiobutyl GSL  does not have the same activity. We report the identification of an Arabidopsis  flavin-monooxygenase (FMO) enzyme, FMO(GS-OX1), which catalyzes the conversion of  methylthioalkyl GSLs into methylsulfinylalkyl GSLs. This is evidenced by  biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein, and analyses of the GSL  content in FMO(GS-OX1) overexpression lines and an FMO(GS-OX1) knock-out mutant  of Arabidopsis. The FMO(GS-OX1) overexpression lines show almost complete  conversion of methylthioalkyl into methylsulfinylalkyl GSLs, with an  approximately fivefold increase in 4-methylsulfinylbutyl GSL in seeds.  Identification of FMO(GS-OX1) provides a molecular tool for breeding of Brassica  vegetable crops with increased levels of this important GSL, which has  implications for production of functional foods enriched with the  cancer-preventive sulforaphane.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03101.x', 'Halkier']
