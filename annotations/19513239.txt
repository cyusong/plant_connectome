Polyamines have long been implicated in plant growth and development, as well as adaptation to abiotic and biotic stress. As a general rule of thumb the higher the polyamine titers the better. However, their molecular roles in plant stress responses still remain obscure. It has been postulated that they could act through their catabolism, which generates molecules which may act as secondary messengers signalling networks of numerous developmental and stress adaptation processes. Recently it was shown that plant and mammalian polyamine catabolism share critical features, giving new insight in plant polyamine catabolism. In this review, the advances in genes and proteins of polyamine catabolism in plants is presented and compared to other models.
