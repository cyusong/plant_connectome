Brassinosteroids (BRs) are known to improve salt tolerance of plants, but not in all situations. Here, we show that a certain concentration of 24-epibrassinolide (EBL), an active BR, can promote the tolerance of canola under high-salt stress, but the same concentration is disadvantageous under low-salt stress. We define this phenomenon as hormonal stress-level-dependent biphasic (SLDB) effects. The SLDB effects of EBL on salt tolerance in canola are closely related to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, which is regulated by polyamine metabolism, especially putrescine (Put) oxidation. The inhibition of EBL on canola under low-salt stress can be ameliorated by repressing Put biosynthesis or diamine oxidase activity to reduce H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production. Genetic and phenotypic results of bri1-9, bak1, bes1-D, and bzr1-1D mutants and overexpression lines of BRI1 and BAK1 in Arabidopsis indicate that a proper enhancement of BR signaling benefits plants in countering salt stress, whereas excessive enhancement is just as harmful as a deficiency. These results highlight the involvement of crosstalk between BR signaling and Put metabolism in H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, which underlies the dual role of BR in plant salt tolerance.
