PEROXIN11 (PEX11) is a peroxisomal membrane protein in fungi and mammals and was proposed to play a major role in peroxisome proliferation. To begin understanding how peroxisomes proliferate in plants and how changes in peroxisome abundance affect plant development, we characterized the extended Arabidopsis thaliana PEX11 protein family, consisting of the three phylogenetically distinct subfamilies PEX11a, PEX11b, and PEX11c to PEX11e. All five Arabidopsis PEX11 proteins target to peroxisomes, as demonstrated for endogenous and cyan fluorescent protein fusion proteins by fluorescence microscopy and immunobiochemical analysis using highly purified leaf peroxisomes. PEX11a and PEX11c to PEX11e behave as integral proteins of the peroxisome membrane. Overexpression of At PEX11 genes in Arabidopsis induced peroxisome proliferation, whereas reduction in gene expression decreased peroxisome abundance. PEX11c and PEX11e, but not PEX11a, PEX11b, and PEX11d, complemented to significant degrees the growth phenotype of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex11 null mutant on oleic acid. Heterologous expression of PEX11e in the yeast mutant increased the number and reduced the size of the peroxisomes. We conclude that all five Arabidopsis PEX11 proteins promote peroxisome proliferation and that individual family members play specific roles in distinct peroxisomal subtypes and environmental conditions and possibly in different steps of peroxisome proliferation.
