PHOSPHORUS-STARVATION TOLERANCE 1 (OsPSTOL1) is a variably present gene that benefits crown root growth and phosphorus (P) sufficiency in rice (Oryza sativa). To explore the ecophysiological importance of this gene, we performed a biogeographic survey of landraces and cultivars, confirming that functional OsPSTOL1 alleles prevail in low nutrient and drought-prone rainfed ecosystems, whereas loss-of-function and absence haplotypes predominate in control-irrigated paddy varieties of east Asia. An evolutionary history analysis of OsPSTOL1 and related genes in cereal, determined it and other genes are kinase-only domain derivatives of membrane-associated receptor like kinases. Finally, to evaluate the potential value of this kinase of unknown function in another Gramineae, wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines overexpressing OsPSTOL1 were evaluated under field and controlled low P conditions. OsPSTOL1 enhances growth, crown root number, and overall root plasticity under low P in wheat. Survey of root and shoot crown transcriptomes at two developmental stages identifies transcription factors that are differentially regulated in OsPSTOL1 wheat that are similarly controlled by the gene in rice. In wheat, OsPSTOL1 alters the timing and amplitude of regulators of root development in dry soils and hastens induction of the core P-starvation response. OsPSTOL1 and related genes may aid more sustainable cultivation of cereal crops.
