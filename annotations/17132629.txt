We found 19 putative genes for plant-specific Dof transcription factors in the moss Physcomitrella patens and one Dof gene in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but no identifiable Dof gene in the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae and the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, suggesting that the origin of the Dof transcription factors pre-dates the divergence of the green algae and the ancestors of terrestrial plants. The phylogenetic analyses contended that the Dof family in angiosperms formed through a series of evolutionary processes, including intensive duplications of a specific ancestral gene after the divergence of the moss and the angiosperm lineages.
