Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) is pandemic in tomato crops, causing important economic losses world-wide. No PepMV-resistant varieties have been developed yet. Identification of host factors interacting with PepMV proteins is a promising source of genetic targets to develop PepMV-resistant varieties. The interaction between the PepMV coat protein (CP) and the tomato glutathione S-transferase (GST) SlGSTU38 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening and validated by directed Y2H and co-immunoprecipitation assays. SlGSTU38-knocked-out Micro-Tom plants (gstu38) generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology together with live-cell imaging were used to understand the role of SlGSTU38 during infection. The transcriptomes of healthy and PepMV-infected wild-type (WT) and gstu38 plants were profiled by RNA-seq analysis. SlGSTU38 functions as a PepMV-specific susceptibility factor in a cell-autonomous manner and relocalizes to the virus replication complexes during infection. Besides, knocking out SlGSTU38 triggers reactive oxygen species accumulation in leaves and the deregulation of stress-responsive genes. SlGSTU38 may play a dual role: On the one hand, SlGSTU38 may exert a proviral function depending on its specific interaction with the PepMV CP; and on the other hand, SlGSTU38 may delay PepMV-infection sensing by participating in the redox intracellular homeostasis in a nonspecific manner.
