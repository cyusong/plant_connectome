Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a nutritious legume with seeds rich in protein, minerals and an array of diverse specialized metabolites. The formation of a seed requires regulation and tight coordination of developmental programs to form the embryo, endosperm and seed coat compartments, which determines the structure and composition of mature seed and thus its end-use quality. Understanding the molecular and cellular events and metabolic processes of seed development is essential for improving lentil yield and seed nutritional value. However, such information remains largely unknown, especially at the seed compartment level. In this study, we generated high-resolution spatiotemporal gene expression profiles in lentil embryo, seed coat and whole seeds from fertilization through maturation. Apart from anatomic differences between the embryo and seed coat, comparative transcriptomics and weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed embryo- and seed coat-specific genes and gene modules predominant in specific tissues and stages, which highlights distinct genetic programming. Furthermore, we investigated the dynamic profiles of flavonoid, isoflavone, phytic acid and saponin in seed compartments across seed development. Coupled with transcriptome data, we identified sets of candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites. The global view of the transcriptional and metabolic changes of lentil seed tissues throughout development provides a valuable resource for dissecting the genetic control of secondary metabolism and development of molecular tools for improving seed nutritional quality.
