Elevated temperatures enhance alternative RNA splicing in maize (Zea mays) with the potential to expand the repertoire of plant responses to heat stress. Alternative RNA splicing generates multiple RNA isoforms for many maize genes, and here we observed changes in the pattern of RNA isoforms with temperature changes. Increases in maximum daily temperature elevated the frequency of the major modes of alternative splices (AS), in particular retained introns and skipped exons. The genes most frequently targeted by increased AS with temperature encode factors involved in RNA processing and plant development. Genes encoding regulators of alternative RNA splicing were themselves among the principal AS targets in maize. Under controlled environmental conditions, daily changes in temperature comparable to field conditions altered the abundance of different RNA isoforms, including the RNAs encoding the splicing regulator SR45a, a member of the SR45 gene family. We established an "in protoplast" RNA splicing assay to show that during the afternoon on simulated hot summer days, SR45a RNA isoforms were produced with the potential to encode proteins efficient in splicing model substrates. With the RNA splicing assay, we also defined the exonic splicing enhancers that the splicing-efficient SR45a forms utilize to aid in the splicing of model substrates. Hence, with rising temperatures on hot summer days, SR45a RNA isoforms in maize are produced with the capability to encode proteins with greater RNA splicing potential.
