['21847091', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key hormone regulating plant growth, development and the  response to biotic and abiotic stress. ABA binding to pyrabactin resistance  (PYR)/PYR1-like (PYL)/Regulatory Component of Abscisic acid Receptor (RCAR)  intracellular receptors promotes the formation of stable complexes with certain  protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs), leading to the activation of ABA  signalling. The PYR/PYL/RCAR family contains 14 genes in Arabidopsis and is  currently the largest plant hormone receptor family known; however, it is unclear  what functional differentiation exists among receptors. Here, we identify two  distinct classes of receptors, dimeric and monomeric, with different intrinsic  affinities for ABA and whose differential properties are determined by the  oligomeric state of their apo forms. Moreover, we find a residue in PYR1, H60,  that is variable between family members and plays a key role in determining  oligomeric state. In silico modelling of the ABA activation pathway reveals that  monomeric receptors have a competitive advantage for binding to ABA and PP2Cs.  This work illustrates how receptor oligomerization can modulate hormonal  responses and more generally, the sensitivity of a ligand-dependent signalling  system.', '2011 Aug 16', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2011.294', 'Marquez']
