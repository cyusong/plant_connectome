['21502189', 'Flavonoids represent a class of secondary metabolites with diverse functions in  plants including ultraviolet protection, pathogen defense, and interspecies  communication. They are also known as modulators of signaling processes in plant  and animal systems and therefore are considered to have beneficial effects as  nutraceuticals. The rol1-2 (for repressor of lrx1) mutation of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) induces aberrant accumulation of flavonols and a  cell-growth phenotype in the shoot. The hyponastic cotyledons, aberrant shape of  pavement cells, and deformed trichomes in rol1-2 mutants are suppressed by  blocking flavonoid biosynthesis, suggesting that the altered flavonol  accumulation in these plants induces the shoot phenotype. Indeed, the  identification of several transparent testa, myb, and fls1 (for flavonol  synthase1) alleles in a rol1-2 suppressor screen provides genetic evidence that  flavonols interfere with shoot development in rol1-2 seedlings. The increased  accumulation of auxin in rol1-2 seedlings appears to be caused by a  flavonol-induced modification of auxin transport. Quantification of auxin export  from mesophyll protoplasts revealed that naphthalene-1-acetic acid but not  indole-3-acetic acid transport is affected by the rol1-2 mutation. Inhibition of  flavonol biosynthesis in rol1-2 fls1-3 restores naphthalene-1-acetic acid  transport to wild-type levels, indicating a very specific mode of action of  flavonols on the auxin transport machinery.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.175976', 'Ringli']
