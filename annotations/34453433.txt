The complex gene regulatory network underlying tiller development in maize remains largely unknown. Here we identified two major quantitative trait loci for tiller number, Tin8 on chromosome 8 and the previously known Tb1 on chromosome 1, in a population derived from a teosinte-maize cross. Map-based cloning and association mapping revealed that Tin8, corresponding to Zcn8 encoding a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding-related kinase, is down-regulated in transcription, which results in decreased tiller number. A strong interaction between Tin8 and the key gen Tb1 was detected for tiller number. Further RNA-seq analysis showed that the expression of 13 genes related to tiller development was controlled by Tin8. Our results support the existence of a complex gene regulatory network for the outgrowth of the tiller bud in maize, in which Zcn8 controls 13 tiller-related genes, including four genes for hormonal responses. In particular, Zcn8 represses Gt1, D14, and Tru1 through the interaction with Tb1.
