In recent years, host-microbiome interactions in both animals and plants has emerged as a novel research area for studying the relationship between host organisms and their commensal microbial communities. The fitness advantages of this mutualistic interaction can be found in both plant hosts and their associated microbiome, however, the driving forces mediating this beneficial interaction are poorly understood. Alternative splicing (AS), a pivotal post-transcriptional mechanism, has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in plant development and stress responses among diverse plant ecotypes. This natural variation of plants also has an impact on their commensal microbiome. In this article, we review the current progress of plant natural variation on their microbiome community, and discuss knowledge gaps between AS regulation of plants in response to their intimately related microbiota. Through the impact of this article, an avenue could be established to study the biological mechanism of naturally varied splicing isoforms on plant-associated microbiome assembly.
