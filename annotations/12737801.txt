['12737801', 'P58(IPK) is a cellular inhibitor of the mammalian double-stranded RNA-activated  protein kinase (PKR). Here we provide evidence for the existence of its homolog  in plants and its role in viral infection at the organism level. Viral infection  of P58(IPK)-silenced Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis knockouts leads to  host death. This host cell death is associated with phosphorylation of the alpha  subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF-2alpha). Loss of  P58(IPK) leads to reduced virus titer, suggesting that wild-type P58(IPK) protein  plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. Although our complementation  results using mammalian P58(IPK) suggest conservation of the P58(IPK) pathway in  plants and animals, its biological significance seems to be different in these  two systems. In animals, P58(IPK) is recruited by the influenza virus to limit  PKR-mediated innate antiviral response. In plants, P58(IPK) is required by  viruses for virulence and therefore functions as a susceptibility factor.', '2003 May', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/s1534-5807(03)00125-4', 'Dinesh-Kumar']
