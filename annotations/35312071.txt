['35312071', 'Domain of Unknown Function 506 proteins are ubiquitous in plants. The phosphorus  (P) stress-inducible REPRESSOR OF EXCESSIVE ROOT HAIR GROWTH1 (AtRXR1) gene  encodes the first characterized DUF506. AtRXR1 inhibits root hair elongation by  interacting with RabD2c GTPase. However, functions of other P-responsive DUF506  genes are still missing. Here, we selected two additional P-inducible DUF506  genes for further investigation. The expression of both genes was induced by  auxin. Under P-stress, At3g07350 gene expressed ubiquitously in seedlings,  whereas At1g62420 (AtRXR3) expression was strongest in roots. AtRXR3  overexpressors and knockouts had shorter and longer root hairs, respectively. A  functional AtRXR3-green fluorescent protein fusion localized to root epidermal  cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative  reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that AtRXR3 was  transcriptionally activated by RSL4. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and  calmodulin (CaM)-binding assays showed that AtRXR3 interacted with CaM in the  presence of Ca(2+) . Moreover, cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+) ](cyt) ) oscillations in  root hairs of rxr3 mutants exhibited elevated frequencies and dampened amplitudes  compared to those of wild type. Thus, AtRXR3 is another DUF506 protein that  attenuates P-limitation-induced root hair growth through mechanisms that involve  RSL4 and interaction with CaM to modulate tip-focused [Ca(2+) ](cyt)  oscillations.', '2022 Jun', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.14316', 'Scheible']
