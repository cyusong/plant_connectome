Mediator 12 (MED12) and MED13 are components of the Mediator multi-protein complex, that facilitates the initial steps of gene transcription. Here, in an Arabidopsis mutant screen, we identify MED12 and MED13 as positive gene regulators, both of which contribute broadly to morc1 de-repressed gene expression. Both MED12 and MED13 are preferentially required for the expression of genes depleted in active chromatin marks, a chromatin signature shared with morc1 re-activated loci. We further discover that MED12 tends to interact with genes that are responsive to environmental stimuli, including light and radiation. We demonstrate that light-induced transient gene expression depends on MED12, and is accompanied by a concomitant increase in MED12 enrichment during induction. In contrast, the steady-state expression level of these genes show little dependence on MED12, suggesting that MED12 is primarily required to aid the expression of genes in transition from less-active to more active states.
