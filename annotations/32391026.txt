Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key plant stress-signaling hormone that accumulates upon osmotic stresses such as drought and high salinity. Several proteins have been identified that constitute the ABA-signaling pathway. Among them ABA receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR), co-receptor PP2Cs (protein phosphatases), SnRK2 kinases (SNF1-related protein kinases) and ABI5/ABFs (transcription factors) are the major components. Upon ABA signal, PYR/PYL receptors interact with and recruit PP2Cs, releasing SnRK2s kinases from sequestration with PP2Cs. This allows SnKR2s to promote the activation of downstream transcription factors of ABA pathway. However, apart from activation, ubiquitination and degradation of core proteins in the ABA pathway by the ubiquitin proteasome system is less explored. In this review we will focus on the recent findings about feedback regulation of ABA signaling core proteins through degradation, which is emerging as a critical step that modulates and eventually ceases the signal relay. Additionally, we also discuss the importance of the recently identified effector protein HOS15, which negatively regulate ABA-signaling through degradation of OST1.
