['18599510', 'Cell size and secondary cell wall patterning are crucial for the proper  functioning of xylem vessel elements in the vascular tissues of plants. Through  detailed anatomical characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls, we  observed that mutations in the putative spermine biosynthetic gene ACL5 severely  affected xylem specification: the xylem vessel elements of the acl5 mutant were  small and mainly of the spiral type, and the normally predominant pitted vessels  as well as the xylem fibers were completely missing. The cell-specific expression  of ACL5 in the early developing vessel elements, as detected by in situ  hybridization and reporter gene analyses, suggested that the observed xylem  vessel defects were caused directly by the acl5 mutation. Exogenous spermine  prolonged xylem element differentiation and stimulated cell expansion and cell  wall elaboration in xylogenic cell cultures of Zinnia elegans, suggesting that  ACL5 prevents premature death of the developing vessel elements to allow complete  expansion and secondary cell wall patterning. This was further supported by our  observations that the vessel elements of acl5 seemed to initiate the cell death  program too early and that the xylem defects associated with acl5 could be  largely phenocopied by induction of premature, diphtheria toxin-mediated cell  death in the ACL5-expressing vessel elements. We therefore provide, for the first  time, mechanistic evidence for the function of ACL5 in xylem specification  through its action on the duration of xylem element differentiation.', '2008 Aug', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.019349', 'Tuominen']
