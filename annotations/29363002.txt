['29363002', 'Global Transcription Factor Group E proteins GTE9 and GTE11 interact with BT2 to  mediate ABA and sugar responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. BT2 is a BTB-domain  protein that regulates responses to various hormone, stress and metabolic  conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. Loss of BT2 results in plants that are  hypersensitive to inhibition of germination by abscisic acid (ABA) and sugars.  Conversely, overexpression of BT2 results in resistance to ABA and sugars. Here,  we report the roles of BT2-interacting partners GTE9 and GTE11, bromodomain and  extraterminal-domain proteins of Global Transcription Factor Group E, in  BT2-mediated responses to sugars and hormones. Loss-of-function mutants, gte9-1  and gte11-1, mimicked the bt2-1-null mutant responses; germination of all three  mutants was hypersensitive to inhibition by glucose and ABA. Loss of either GTE9  or GTE11 in a BT2 over-expressing line blocked resistance to sugars and ABA,  indicating that both GTE9 and GTE11 were required for BT2 function.  Co-immunoprecipitation of BT2 and GTE9 suggested that these proteins physically  interact in vivo, and presumably function together to mediate responses to ABA  and sugar signals.', '2018 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-018-0704-2', 'ORCID:']
