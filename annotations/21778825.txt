Recent studies suggest that abscisic acid (ABA) at its basal level plays an important role during seed set and grain filling events. Under drought stress ABA levels were found to be significantly enhanced in the developing seed. Until now we lack an understanding of (A) ABA homeostasis in developing seeds under terminal drought and (B) the interactive role of ABA in regulating the starch biosynthesis pathway in developing grains under terminal drought. We have recently reported the possible regulation of ABA homeostasis in source (flag leaf) and sink (developing grains) tissues under post-anthesis drought stress in barley and concluded that significantly enhanced ABA levels in developing grains are due to strong activation of the ABA deconjugation pathway and fine regulation of the ABA biosynthesis-degradation pathway.1 Additionally, we provided evidence for the role of ABA in differential regulation of starch biosynthesis genes and a significant upregulation of starch degradation beta amylase genes under drought, i.e. ABA not only influences the rate of starch accumulation but also starch quality.
