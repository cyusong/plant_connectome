It is of great significance to study the nutritional characteristics of plants. Further understanding of plant mineral nutrient dynamics can provide theoretical basis for scientific fertilization to improve fruit quality and yield. In this study, eight mineral elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, B) were measured at regular intervals in leaves and kernels of the pecan "Mahan" planted in southern China. The study discussed the characteristics of mineral nutrient dynamics of pecan through the indicators of concentration, accumulation and cumulative relative rate, a new first proposed indicator, and focused on critical time, intensity, amount of mineral nutrients required in pecan during the fruit developing period, as well as the transfer information of the elements in leaves and kernels. The results show that the mineral nutrient requirements of the leaves and kernels are not identical, with an upward trend in nutrient accumulation within the kernel. The most abundant mineral nutrients in the leaves and kernels were N, K and Ca with Ca being greater than N in leaves. In particular, the concentration of Mn in pecan 'Mahan' is higher than that of other plants, and its Mg content is also higher than that of P in kernels. The dynamic changes of mineral nutrients in walnut showed obvious stages, with a trend of "slow (before mid-July) - fast (mid-July to late August) - slow (late August to late September) - fast (late September to harvest)". The "critical period" of kernels was before mid-July, during which the cumulative relative rates increased rapidly, indicating that the kernels had a great potential to absorb mineral nutrients. Significant accumulation of mineral nutrients occurred from mid-July to late August and late September to the end.
