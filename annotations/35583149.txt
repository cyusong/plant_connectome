The changes in plant life behaviors and water status are accompanied by electrophysiological activities. In this study, the theoretical relationship between clamping force (C<sub>F</sub>) and leaf resistance (R), capacitive reactance (X<sub>C</sub>), inductive reactance (XL), impedance (Z), and capacitance (C) were exposed as 3-parameter exponential decay and linear models based on bioenergetics, respectively, for mangrove species. The intracellular water metabolism parameters and salt transport characteristics were also determined based on mechanical equations with influences of Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and rewatering (R<sub>W</sub>). The results show that the inherent capacitance and effective thickness could better represent <i>Aegiceras corniculatum</i> (<i>A. corniculatum</i>) species, and inherent resistance and impedance show obvious effects on <i>Kandelia obovate</i> (<i>K. obovate</i>) species at different salt levels. SNP application shows positive effect on different salt-resistance capacities of <i>A. corniculatum</i>, while <i>K. obovate</i> perform better in R<sub>W</sub> phase at high salt level. These outcomes indicates that <i>K. obovate</i> is more salt-resistant because R<sub>W</sub> process is consistent with actual situation, and response of <i>A. corniculatum</i> at high salt stress is irreversible, even in R<sub>W</sub>. It is concluded that the electrophysiological parameters could be used for the determination of salt-resistant capacities, which gave more enhanced and reliable information of mangroves' life activities.
