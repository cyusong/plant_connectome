The receptor-like kinase Suppressor of BIR1 (SOBIR1) binds various receptor-like proteins (RLPs) that perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) at the plasma membrane, which is thought to activate plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) against pathogen invasion. Despite its potentially crucial role, how SOBIR1 transmits immune signaling to ultimately elicit PTI remains largely unresolved. Herein, we report that a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> gene <i>Nb</i>RLP1, like <i>Nb</i>SOBIR1, was highly induced upon <i>Phytophthora parasitica</i> infection. Intriguingly, <i>Nb</i>RLP1 is characterized as a receptor-like protein localizing to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane rather than the plasma membrane. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation and affinity purification assays, we established that <i>Nb</i>RLP1 is likely to associate with <i>Nb</i>SOBIR1 through the contact between the ER and plasma membrane. We further found that <i>Nb</i>SOBIR1 at the plasma membrane partitions into mobile microdomains that undergo frequent lateral movement and internalization. Remarkably, the dynamics of <i>Nb</i>SOBIR1 microdomain is coupled to the remodeling of the cortical ER network. When <i>Nb</i>SOBIR1 microdomains were induced by the <i>P. parasitica</i> MAMP ParA1, tobacco cells overexpressing <i>Nb</i>RLP1 accelerated <i>Nb</i>SOBIR1 internalization. Overexpressing <i>Nb</i>RLP1 in tobacco further exaggerated the ParA1-induced necrosis. Together, these findings have prompted us to propose that ER and the ER-localized <i>Nb</i>RLP1 may play a role in transmitting plant immune signals by regulating <i>Nb</i>SOBIR1 internalization.
