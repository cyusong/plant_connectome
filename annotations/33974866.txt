Galls are abnormal plant growths induced by animals, especially insects, to foster their own developing offspring. Which molecular malware gall-inducers use to hack into the plant's genetic programs is unclear. In an aphid, a gene affecting gall color has been discovered, part of a large family of putative effectors.
