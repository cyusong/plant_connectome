CAM plants are superior to C<sub>3</sub> plants in drought resistance because of their peculiar photosynthesis pathway and morphological features. While those aspects have been studied for decades, little is known about the photosynthetic machinery of CAM plants. Here, we used a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods to study the photosynthetic apparatus of Tillandsia flabellate, an obligatory CAM plant. Most of the Photosystems super- and sub-complexes have properties very similar to those of Arabidopsis, with the main difference that in Tillandsia PSI-LHCI complexes bind extra LHCI. Functional measurements show that the PSI/PSII ratio is rather low compared to other plants and that the antenna size of both PSI and PSII is small. Upon 30-day water deficiency, the composition of the photosystems does not change significantly, PSII efficiency remains high and no Photosystem II photoinhibition was detected despite a reduction of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ).
