The sub-cellular events that occur during the ethylene-modulated cell elongation were characterized by examining the ultra-structure of etiolated Arabidopsis seedling hypocotyl cells. Preventing the basal level ethylene response facilitated cell elongation, and the cells exhibited wall loosening and separation phenotype. Nearby the wall separation sites were frequently associated with an increase in the cortical rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) membranes, the presence of paramural bodies, and the circular Golgi formation. The cortical rER proliferation and circular Golgi phenotype were reverted by the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The cortical rER membranes were longer when the ethylene response was prevented and shortened with elevated ethylene responses. Proteomic changes between wild type and the ethylene-insensitive mutant ethylene insensitive2 (ein2) seedling hypocotyls indicated that distinct subsets of proteins involving endomembrane trafficking, remodeling, and wall modifications were differentially expressed. FM4-64 staining supported the proteomic changes, which indicated reduced endocytosis activity with alleviation of the ethylene response. The basal level ethylene response has an important role in endomembrane trafficking, biological materials transport and maintenance of the endomembrane organization. It is possible that endomembrane alterations may partly associate with the wall modifications, though the biological significance of the alterations should be addressed in future studies.
