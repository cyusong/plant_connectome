['27501519', 'Cell shape is defined by the surrounding cell walls in plants. Thus, spatial  control over cell division planes and cell expansion polarity are essential to  maintain cell morphology. In eukaryotes, cell polarity and expansion are  controlled by Rho GTPase signalling, regulating cytoskeletal reorganization and  vesicle trafficking(1). However, until now, Rho signalling was not implicated in  mitotic events in plants. Here, we report a pair of putative Rho GTPase  activating proteins (RhoGAPs) that interact with the mitosis-specific kinesin-12  POK1, a core component of the cortical division zone/site (CDZ/CDS) that is  required for division plane maintenance in Arabidopsis(2-4). The designated  pleckstrin homology GAPs (PHGAPs) are cytoplasmic and plasma membrane associated  in interphase, but during mitosis they additionally localize to the CDZ/CDS in a  POK-dependent manner. In contrast to pok1 pok2 mutants, phgap1 phgap2 double  mutants show moderate cell wall positioning defects as a consequence of  inaccurate positioning of the cortical division zone marker POK1. We conclude  that loss of PHGAP function interferes with division plane selection in  proliferative cell divisions.', '2016 Aug 8', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/nplants.2016.120', 'ORCID:']
