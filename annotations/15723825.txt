The effect of low growth temperature on morpho-physiological traits of maize was investigated by the means of a QTL analysis in a segregating F(2:3) population grown under field conditions in Switzerland. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, leaf greenness, leaf area, shoot dry weight, and shoot nitrogen content were investigated at the seedling stage for two years. Maize was sown on two dates in each year; thus, plants sown early were exposed to low temperature, whereas those sown later developed under more favourable conditions. The main QTLs involved in the functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus at low temperature were stable across the cold environments and were also identified under controlled conditions with suboptimal temperature in a previous study. Based on the QTL analysis, relationships between chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and leaf greenness were moderate. This indicates that the extent and functioning of the photosynthetic machinery may be under different genetic control. The functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus in plants developed at low temperature in the field did not noticeably affect biomass accumulation; since there were no co-locations between QTLs for leaf area and shoot dry weight, biomass accumulation did not seem to be carbon-limited at the seedling stage under cool conditions in the field.
