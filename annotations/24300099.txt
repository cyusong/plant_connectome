The vesicle inducing protein in plastids (VIPP1) is an essential protein for the biogenesis of thylakoids in modern cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. Although its exact function is still not clear, recent work has provided important hints to its mode of action. We believe that these data are consistent with a structural role of VIPP1 within thylakoid centers, which are considered as sites from which thylakoid membranes emerge and at which the biogenesis at least of photosystem II is thought to occur. Here we present a model that may serve as starting point for future research.
