['10373488', 'Toc34 is a member of the outer membrane translocon complex that mediates the  initial stage of protein import into chloroplasts. Toc34, like most outer  membrane proteins, is synthesized in the cytosol at its mature size without a  cleavable transit peptide. The majority of outer membrane proteins do not require  thermolysin-sensitive components on the chloroplastic surface or ATP for their  insertion into the outer membrane. However, different results have been obtained  concerning the factors required for Toc34 insertion into the outer membrane.  Using an Arabidopsis homologue of pea Toc34, atToc34, we show that the insertion  of atToc34 was greatly reduced by thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts as  assayed either by protease digestion or by alkaline extraction. The insertion was  also dependent on the presence of ATP or GTP. A mutant of atToc34 with the  GTP-binding domain deleted still required ATP for optimal insertion, indicating  that ATP was used by other protein components in the import system. The  ATP-supported insertion was observed even in thermolysin-pretreated chloroplasts,  suggesting that the protein component responsible for ATP-stimulated insertion is  a different protein from the thermolysin-sensitive component that assists atToc34  insertion.', '1999 Jun 25', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.274.26.18735', 'Li']
