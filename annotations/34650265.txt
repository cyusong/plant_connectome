It is increasingly evident that various RNAs can bind chromatin to regulate gene expression and genome organization. Here we adapted a sequencing-based technique to profile RNA-chromatin interactions at a genome-wide scale in Arabidopsis seedlings. We identified more than 10,000 RNA-chromatin interactions mediated by protein-coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs. Cis and intra-chromosomal interactions are mainly mediated by protein-coding RNAs, whereas inter-chromosomal interactions are primarily mediated by non-coding RNAs. Many RNA-chromatin interactions tend to positively correlate with DNA-DNA interactions, suggesting their mutual influence and reinforcement. We further show that some RNA-chromatin interactions undergo alterations in response to biotic and abiotic stresses and that altered RNA-chromatin interactions form co-regulatory networks. Our study provides a global view on RNA-chromatin interactions in Arabidopsis and a rich resource for future investigations of regulatory roles of RNAs in gene expression and genome organization.
