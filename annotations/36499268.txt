Polyamines (PA) play an important role in the growth, development and stress resistance of plants, and arginine decarboxylase (ADC) is one of the key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of polyamines. Previously, the transcriptional regulation of the 'Manaohong' cherry under the shelter covering was carried out, and the PA synthase-related genes, particularly the ADC gene, were differentially expressed as exposure to drought stress. However, the mechanisms of how ADC is involved in the response of cherry to abiotic stress (especially drought stress) are still unknown. In the present work, the full-length coding sequence of this gene was isolated and named <i>CpADC</i>. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the coding sequence of <i>CpADC</i> was 2529 bp in length. Cluster analysis showed that <i>CpADC</i> had the highest homologies with those of sweet cherry (<i>Prunus avium</i>, XP_021806331) and peach (<i>Prunus persica</i>, XP_007200307). Subcellular localization detected that the <i>CpADC</i> was localized in the plant nucleus. The qPCR quantification showed that <i>CpADC</i> was differentially expressed in roots, stems, leaves, flower buds, flowers, and fruits at different periods. Drought stress treatments were applied to both wild-type (WT) and transgenic <i>Arabidopsi</i>s lines, and relevant physiological indicators were measured, and the results showed that the putrescine content of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> was higher than that of WT under high-temperature treatment. The results showed that the MDA content of WT was consistently higher than that of transgenic plants and that the degree of stress in WT was more severe than in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>, indicating that transgenic <i>CpADC</i> was able to enhance the stress resistance of the plants. Both the transgenic and WT plants had significantly higher levels of proline in their leaves after the stress treatment than before, but the WT plant had lower levels of proline than that of transgenic <i>Arabidopsi</i>s in both cases. This shows that the accumulation of proline in the transgenic plants was higher than that in the wild type under drought and high and low-temperature stress, suggesting that the transgenic plants are more stress tolerant than the WT. Taken together, our results reveal that, under drought stress, the increase in both expressions of <i>CpADC</i> gene and Put (putrescine) accumulation regulates the activity of ADC, the content of MDA and Pro to enhance the drought resistance of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana.</i>
