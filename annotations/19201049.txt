Anthocyanins, which are O-glycosylated derivatives of anthocyanidins, are responsible for the red, blue and purple coloration of many organs of angiosperms where they have previously been reported to occur in vacuoles and cytoplasm. However, bright-field microscopy of sections of the storage roots of the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) clone 99N1/222, which contains high concentrations of anthocyanins, showed that the walls of the periderm cork cells (skin), but not those of the adjacent parenchyma cells, were coloured bright red/purple. In situ absorption spectra of the periderm cell walls were similar to those of methanolic solutions of anthocyanins. Dry cell-wall preparations obtained from the periderm and parenchyma tissues were coloured deep reddish-brown and white, respectively. Pigment was extracted from the periderm cell-wall preparation by treating with 1 M NaOH. Acid hydrolysis of this extract followed by HPLC indicated the presence of the anthocyanidins cyanidin and peonidin. It is concluded that the periderm cell walls contain covalently bound anthocyanidin-containing compounds, possibly anthocyanins.
