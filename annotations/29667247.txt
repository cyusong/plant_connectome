Many plants sense the seasonal cues, day length or photoperiod changes, to align the timing of the developmental transition to flowering with changing seasons for reproductive success. Inductive day lengths through the photoperiod pathway induce the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) or FT relatives that encode a major mobile florigen to promote flowering. In Arabidopsis thaliana, under inductive long days the photoperiod pathway output CONSTANS (CO) accumulates toward the end of the day, and associates with the B and C subunits of Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) to form the NF-CO complex that acts to promote FT expression near dusk, whereas Polycomb group (PcG) proteins function to silence FT expression. How NF-CO acts to antagonize the function of PcG proteins to regulate FT expression remains unclear. Here, we show that the NF-CO complex bound to the proximal FT promoter, through chromatin looping, acts in concert with an NF-Y complex bound to a distal enhancer to reduce the levels of PcG proteins, including both Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 at the FT promoter, leading to a relieving of Polycomb silencing and thus FT de-repression near dusk. Thus, our study provides molecular insights on how the 'active' photoperiod pathway and the 'repressive' Polycomb silencing system interact to control temporal FT expression, conferring the long-day induction of flowering in Arabidopsis.
