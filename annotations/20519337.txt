Proteins of the 14-3-3 family regulate a divergent set of signalling pathways in all eukaryotic organisms. In this study, several cDNAs encoding 14-3-3 proteins were isolated from a cotton fibre cDNA library. The Gh14-3-3 genes share high sequence homology at the nucleotide level in the coding region and at the amino acid level. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of these Gh14-3-3 genes is developmentally regulated in fibres, and reached their peak at the stage of rapid cell elongation of fibre development. Furthermore, overexpression of Gh14-3-3a, Gh14-3-3e, and Gh14-3-3L in fission yeast promoted atypical longitudinal growth of the host cells. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the interaction between cotton 14-3-3 proteins is isoform selective. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, 38 novel interaction partners of the six 14-3-3 proteins (Gh14-3-3a, Gh14-3-3e, Gh14-3-3f, Gh14-3-3g, Gh14-3-3h, and Gh14-3-3L), which are involved in plant development, metabolism, signalling transduction, and other cellular processes, were identified in cotton fibres. Taking these data together, it is proposed that the Gh14-3-3 proteins may participate in regulation of fibre cell elongation. Thus, the results of this study provide novel insights into the 14-3-3 signalling related to fibre development of cotton.
