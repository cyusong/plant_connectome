Current strategies used to quantitatively describe the biological diversity of lipids by mass spectrometry are often limited in assessing the exact structural variability of individual molecular species in detail. A major challenge is represented by the extensive isobaric overlap present among lipids, hampering their accurate identification. This is especially true for cardiolipins, a mitochondria-specific class of phospholipids, which are functionally involved in many cellular functions, including energy metabolism, cristae structure, and apoptosis. Substituted with four fatty acyl side chains, cardiolipins offer a particularly high potential to achieve complex mixtures of molecular species. Here, we demonstrate how systematically generated high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectral data can be utilized in a mathematical structural modeling approach, to comprehensively analyze and characterize the molecular diversity of mitochondrial cardiolipin compositions in cell culture and disease models, cardiolipin modulation experiments, and a broad variety of frequently studied model organisms.
