Following the identification of the male (S-locus Cysteine Rich/S-locus Protein 11) and female (S Receptor kinase [SRK]) factors controlling self-incompatibility in the Brassicaceae, research in this field has focused on understanding the nature of the cellular responses activated by these regulators. We previously identified the ARM Repeat Containing1 (ARC1) E3 ligase as a component of the SRK signaling pathway and demonstrated ARC1's requirement in the stigma for self-incompatible pollen rejection in Brassica napus, Arabidopsis lyrata, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we discuss our findings on the role of ARC1 in reconstructing a strong and stable A. thaliana self-incompatibility phenotype, in the context of the putative issues outlined in a commentary by Nasrallah and Nasrallah. Additionally, with their proposed standardized strategy for studying self-incompatibility in A. thaliana, we offer our perspective on what constitutes a strong and stable self-incompatibility phenotype in A. thaliana and how this should be investigated and reported to the greater community.

SRK: !activates! ARC1
ARC1: !regulates! self-incompatibility phenotype
