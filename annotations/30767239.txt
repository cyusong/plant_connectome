Lipid droplets (LDs) control lipid metabolism in eukaryotic cells in general. However, the biogenesis regulation and biological functions of LDs are largely unknown in pathogenic fungi. Rapamycin treatment results in a significant increase of LD biogenesis in Fusarium graminearum. Molecular mechanisms of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway in regulating LD biogenesis and the functions of LD in virulence of F. graminearum were investigated in depth by combining genetic, cytological and phenotypic strategies. TOR in Fusarium graminearum (FgTOR) inhibition by rapamycin induces LD biogenesis through the FgPpg1/Sit4 signaling branch. FgPpg1 promotes phosphorylation of protein phosphatase FgNem1 by the protein kinase FgCak1. The phosphorylated FgNem1 dephosphorylates the phosphatidate phosphatase FgPah1. Dephosphorylated FgPah1 is active and stimulates LD biogenesis. Moreover, deletion of FgNem1/Spo7 or FgPah1 leads to serious defects in vegetative growth, sexual development and virulence. The results of this study provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism and biological functions of the LDs in the devastating pathogenic fungus F. graminearum.
