['12826617', 'The UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) gene is required for multiple processes in the  developing Arabidopsis flower, including the proper patterning and identity of  both petals and stamens. The gene encodes an F-box-containing protein, UFO, which  interacts physically and genetically with the Skp1 homolog, ASK1. In this report,  we describe four ufo alleles characterized by the absence of petals, which  uncover another role for UFO in promoting second whorl development. This  UFO-dependent pathway is required regardless of the second whorl organ to be  formed, arguing that it affects a basic process acting in parallel with those  establishing organ identity. However, the pathway is dispensable in the absence  of AGAMOUS (AG), a known inhibitor of petal development. In situ hybridization  results argue that AG is not transcribed in the petal region, suggesting that it  acts non-cell-autonomously to inhibit second whorl development in ufo mutants.  These results are combined into a genetic model explaining early second whorl  initiation/proliferation, in which UFO functions to inhibit an AG-dependent  activity.', '2003 Jul 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1033043100', 'Zambryski']
