Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) and plant-plant competition influence performance and abundance of plants. To what extent the two biotic interactions are interrelated and thus affect plant performance in combination rather than in isolation remains poorly explored. It is also unclear how the abiotic context, such as resource availability, modifies individual and joint effects of PSFs and of plant-plant competition. Using a garden experiment, we assessed the strengths of PSFs, competition, and their combined effects explored under low and high nutrient levels, and related them to abundance of 46 plant species and their ecological optima with respect to soil nutrients. We found that PSFs reduced but did not eliminate differences in competitive ability of plant species. Isolated and combined effects of the biotic interactions poorly predicted local or regional abundance of species. They were rather related to species' ecological optima, as nutrient-demanding plants experienced less negative biotic effects but only in a nutrient-rich environment. Our study demonstrates that soil biota can mitigate differences in competitive ability among species. It remains to be tested whether such an equalizing effect can maintain coexistence under high nutrient availability, in which nutrient-demanding species may disproportionately benefit from less negative competition and PSF effects.
