['17557805', 'Two Arabidopsis thaliana ABC transporter genes linked to auxin transport by  various previous results were studied in a reverse-genetic fashion. Mutations in  Multidrug Resistance-Like1 (MDR1) reduced acropetal auxin transport in roots by  80% without affecting basipetal transport. Conversely, mutations in MDR4 blocked  50% of basipetal transport without affecting acropetal transport. Developmental  and auxin distribution phenotypes associated with these altered auxin flows were  studied with a high-resolution morphometric system and confocal microscopy,  respectively. Vertically grown mdr1 roots produced positive and negative  curvatures threefold greater than the wild type, possibly due to abnormal auxin  distribution observed in the elongation zone. However, upon 90 degrees  reorientation, mdr1 gravitropism was inseparable from the wild type. Thus,  acropetal auxin transport maintains straight growth but contributes surprisingly  little to gravitropism. Conversely, vertically maintained mdr4 roots grew as  straight as the wild type, but their gravitropism was enhanced. Upon  reorientation, curvature in this mutant developed faster, was distributed more  basally, and produced a greater total angle than the wild type. An amplified  auxin asymmetry may explain the mdr4 hypertropism. Double mutant analysis  indicated that the two auxin transport streams are more independent than  interdependent. The hypothesis that flavanols regulate MDR-dependent auxin  transport was supported by the epistatic relationship of mdr4 to the tt4  phenylpropanoid pathway mutation.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.051599', 'Spalding']
