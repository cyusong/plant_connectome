['17041026', 'The NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex in chloroplasts mediates photosystem I  cyclic and chlororespiratory electron transport. Eleven chloroplast genes and  three nuclear genes have been identified as encoding Ndh subunits, but the entire  subunit composition is still unknown. An Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  chlororespiratory reduction (crr3) mutant was isolated based on its lack of  transient increase in chlorophyll fluorescence after actinic light illumination;  this was due to a specific defect in accumulation of the NDH complex. The CRR3  gene (At2g01590) encodes a novel protein containing a putative plastid-targeting  signal and a transmembrane domain. Consistent with the gene structure, CRR3  localized to the membrane fraction of chloroplasts. In addition to the essential  function of CRR3 in stabilizing the NDH complex, the NDH complex is also required  for the accumulation of CRR3. These results suggest that CRR3 interacts with the  NDH complex in the thylakoid membrane. In contrast to other subunits in the  chloroplast NDH complex, CRR3 is not conserved in cyanobacteria from which the  chloroplast NDH complex is believed to have originated. We propose that CRR3 is a  subunit of the NDH complex, which is specific to the chloroplast.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.088682', 'Shikanai']
