The Tiller Angle Control 1 (<i>TAC1</i>) gene belongs to the <i>IGT</i> family, which mainly controls plant branch angle, thereby affecting plant form. Two members of <i>MdTAC1</i> are identified in apple; the regulation of apple branch angle by <i>MdTAC1</i> is still unclear. In this study, a subcellular localization analysis detected <i>MdTAC1a</i> in the nucleus and cell membrane, but <i>MdTAC1b</i> was detected in the cell membrane. Transgenic tobacco by overexpression of <i>MdTAC1a</i> or <i>MdTAC1b</i> showed enlarged leaf angles, the upregulation of several genes, such as GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox), and a sensitive response to light and gravity. According to a qRT-PCR analysis, <i>MdTAC1a</i> and <i>MdTAC1b</i> were strongly expressed in shoot tips and vegetative buds of weeping cultivars but were weakly expressed in columnar cultivars. In the <i>MdTAC1a</i> promoter, there were losses of 2 bp in spur cultivars and 6 bp in weeping cultivar compared with standard and columnar cultivars. An InDel marker specific to the <i>MdTAC1a</i> promoter was developed to distinguish apple cultivars and F<sub>1</sub> progeny. We identified a protein, MdSRC2, that interacts with MdTAC1a, whose encoding gene which was highly expressed in trees with large branch angles. Our results indicate that differences in the <i>MdTAC1a</i> promoter are major contributors to branch-angle variation in apple, and the <i>MdTAC1a</i> interacts with <i>MdSRC2</i> to affect this trait.
