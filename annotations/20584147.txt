Plants sense light and gravity to orient their direction of growth. One common component in the early events of both phototropic and gravitropic signal transduction is activation of phospholipase C (PLC), which leads to an increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP(3)) levels. The InsP(3) signal is terminated by hydrolysis of InsP(3) through inositolpolyphosphate-5-phosphatases (InsP 5-ptases). Arabidopsis plants expressing a heterologous InsP 5-ptase have low basal InsP(3) levels and exhibit reduced gravitropic and phototropic bending. Downstream effects of InsP(3)-mediated signalling are not understood. We used comparative transcript profiling to characterize gene expression changes in gravity- or light-stimulated Arabidopsis root apices that were manipulated in their InsP(3) metabolism either through inhibition of PLC activity or expression of InsP 5-ptase. We identified InsP(3)-dependent and InsP(3)-independent co-regulated gene sets in response to gravity or light stimulation. Inhibition of PLC activity in wild-type plants caused similar changes in transcript abundance in response to gravitropic and phototropic stimulation as in the transgenic lines. Therefore, we conclude that changes in gene expression in response to gravitropic and phototropic stimulation are mediated by two signal transduction pathways that vary in their dependence on changes in InsP(3).
