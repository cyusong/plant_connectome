['24179128', 'The assembly of respiratory complexes is a multistep process, requiring  coordinate expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes and cofactor  biosynthesis. We functionally characterized the iron-sulfur protein required for  NADH dehydrogenase (INDH) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. An indh  knockout mutant lacked complex I but had low levels of a 650-kD assembly  intermediate, similar to mutations in the homologous NUBPL (nucleotide binding  protein-like) in Homo sapiens. However, heterozygous indh/+ mutants displayed  unusual phenotypes during gametogenesis and resembled mutants in mitochondrial  translation more than mutants in complex I. Gradually increased expression of  INDH in indh knockout plants revealed a significant delay in reassembly of  complex I, suggesting an indirect role for INDH in the assembly process.  Depletion of INDH protein was associated with decreased (35)S-Met labeling of  translation products in isolated mitochondria, whereas the steady state levels of  several mitochondrial transcripts were increased. Mitochondrially encoded  proteins were differentially affected, with near normal levels of cytochrome c  oxidase subunit2 and Nad7 but little Nad6 protein in the indh mutant. These data  suggest that INDH has a primary role in mitochondrial translation that underlies  its role in complex I assembly.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.117283', 'Balk']
