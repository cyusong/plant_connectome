['20713617', 'At the end of the cell cycle, the nascent cross wall is laid down within a  transient membrane compartment referred to as the cell plate. Tethering factors,  which act by capturing vesicles and holding them in the vicinity of their target  membranes, are likely to play an important role in the first stages of cell plate  assembly. Factors required for cell plate biogenesis, however, remain to be  identified. In this study, we used a reverse genetic screen to isolate tethering  factors required for cytokinesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We  focused on the TRAPPI and TRAPPII (for transport protein particle) tethering  complexes, which are thought to be required for the flow of traffic through the  Golgi and for trans-Golgi network function, as well as on the GARP complex,  thought to be required for the tethering of endocytotic vesicles to the  trans-Golgi network. We found weak cytokinesis defects in some TRAPPI mutants and  strong cytokinesis defects in all the TRAPPII lines we surveyed. Indeed, four  insertion lines at the TRAPPII locus AtTRS120 had canonical cytokinesis-defective  seedling-lethal phenotypes, including cell wall stubs and incomplete cross walls.  Confocal and electron microscopy showed that in trs120 mutants, vesicles  accumulated at the equator of dividing cells yet failed to assemble into a cell  plate. This shows that AtTRS120 is required for cell plate biogenesis. In  contrast to the TRAPP complexes, we found no conclusive evidence for cytokinesis  defects in seven GARP insertion lines. We discuss the implications of these  findings for the origin and identity of cell plate membranes.', '2010 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.154286', 'Assaad']
