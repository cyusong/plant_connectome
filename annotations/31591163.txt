Intracellular processes can be localized for efficiency or regulation. For example, localized mRNA translation by chloroplastic ribosomes occurs in the biogenesis of PSII, one of the two photosystems of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in the chloroplasts of plants and algae. The biogenesis of PSI and PSII requires the synthesis and assembly of their constituent polypeptide subunits, pigments, and cofactors. Although these biosynthetic pathways are well characterized, less is known about when and where they occur in developing chloroplasts. Here, we used fluorescence microscopy in the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> to reveal spatiotemporal organization in photosystem biogenesis. We focused on translation by chloroplastic ribosomes and chlorophyll biosynthesis in two developmental contexts of active photosystem biogenesis: (1) growth of the mature chloroplast and (2) greening of a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast. The results reveal that a translation zone is the primary location of the biogenesis of PSI and PSII. This discretely localized region within the chloroplast contrasts with the distributions of photosystems throughout this organelle and, therefore, is likely a hub where anabolic pathways converge for photosystem biogenesis.plantcell;31/12/3057/FX1F1fx1.
