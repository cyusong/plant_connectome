Root hairs and pollen tubes extend by rapid elongation that occurs exclusively at the tip. Fundamental for such local, tip-focused growth (so-called 'tip growth') is the polarization of the cytoplasm that directs secretory events to the tip, and the presence of internal gradients and transmembrane flux of ions, notably Ca2+, H+, K+, and Cl-. Electrophysiological and imaging studies using fluorescent markers have sought to link ion gradients with growth and membrane trafficking. Current models recognize membrane trafficking as fundamental to tip growth, notably its role in supplying lipid and protein to the new plasma membrane and cell wall that extend the apex of the cell, and a complementary role for endocytosis in retrieving excess membrane and in recycling various protein fractions. The current state of knowledge is reviewed here in order to highlight the major gaps in the present understanding of trafficking as it contributes to polar growth in these cells and recent results, that suggest a role for membrane trafficking in the active regulation of ion channel turnover and activity during polar tip growth, are discussed.
