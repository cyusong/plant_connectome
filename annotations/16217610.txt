Rice provides a staple source of energy, protein and other nutrients to half of the world population. Over 90 of the rice seeds consists of starch and protein by dry weight. The quantity and property of starch and protein thus play a dominant role in the yield and quality of rice. The amylase content of starch is a determining factor in the eating and cooking quality while the amount and essential amino acids balance of storage proteins affect the nutritional quality of rice. In China, the super-hybrid rice currently under the last phase of development has a 35 yield advantage over the best inbred rice varieties. However, its grain quality needs further improvement. This study reported the expression patterns of 44 genes participating in starch, storage protein, and lysine synthesis in the developing rice grain. Field grown rice cultivar 9311, the paternal line of an elite super-hybrid rice LYP9 with its draft genomic sequence released, was used as plant material. Results revealed diverse yet coordinated expression profiles of the genes involved in the three pathways which lead to the final composition and property of starch, protein and lysine that determine the quality of rice, providing useful information for rice quality improvement.
