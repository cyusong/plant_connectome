Overexpression of abscisic acid (ABA) receptors has been reported to enhance drought tolerance, but also to cause stunted growth and decreased crop yield. Here, we constructed transgenic rice for all monomeric ABA receptors and observed that only transgenic rice over-expressing <i>OsPYL/RCAR7</i> showed similar phenotype with wild type, without total yield loss when grown under normal growth condition in a paddy field. Even though transgenic rice over-expressing <i>OsPYL</i>/<i>RCAR7</i> showed neither an ABA-sensitivity nor an osmotic stress tolerance in plate assay, it showed drought tolerance. We investigated the ABA-dependent interaction with OsPP2CAs and ABA signaling induction by OsPYL/RCAR7. In yeast two hybrid assay, OsPYL/RCAR7 required critically higher ABA concentrations to interact with OsPP2CAs than other ABA receptors, and co-immunoprecipitation assay showed strong interaction under ABA treatment. When ABA-responsive signaling activity was monitored using a transient expression system in rice protoplasts, OsPYL/RCAR7 had the lowest ABA-responsive signaling activity as compared with other ABA receptors. OsPYL/RCAR7 also showed weak suppression of phosphatase activity as compared with other ABA receptors in vitro. Transcriptome analysis of transgenic rice over-expressing <i>OsPYL/RCAR7</i> suggested that only a few genes were induced similar to control under without exogenous ABA, but a large number of genes was induced under ABA treatment compared with control. We conclude that OsPYL/RCAR7 is a novel functional ABA receptor that has low ABA signaling activity and exhibits high ABA dependence. These results lay the foundation for a new strategy to improve drought stress tolerance without compromising crop growth.
