['28756655', "Phytocystatins (PhyCYSs) are plant-specific proteinaceous inhibitors that are  implicated in protein turnover and stress responses. Here, we characterized a  PhyCYS from Arabidopsis thaliana, which was designated AtCYS5. RT-qPCR analysis  showed that the expression of AtCYS5 in germinating seeds was induced by heat  stress (HS) and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Analysis of the  expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene under the control of the AtCYS5  promoter showed that AtCYS5 expression during seed germination was induced by HS  and ABA. Constitutive overexpression of AtCYS5 driven by the cauliflower mosaic  virus 35S promoter led to enhanced HS tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis, which  was characterized by higher fresh weight and root length compared to wild-type  (WT) and knockout (cys5) plants grown under HS conditions. The HS tolerance of  At-CYS5-overexpressing transgenic plants was associated with increased  insensitivity to exogenous ABA during both seed germination and post-germination  compared to WT and cys5. Although no HS elements were identified in the  5'-flanking region of AtCYS5, canonical ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) were  detected. AtCYS5 was upregulated in ABA-treated protoplasts transiently  co-expressing this gene and genes encoding bZIP ABRE-binding factors (ABFs and  AREB3). In the absence of ABA, ABF1 and ABF3 directly bound to the ABREs in the  AtCYS5 promoter, which activated the transcription of this gene in the presence  of ABA. These results suggest that an ABA-dependent pathway plays a positive role  in the HS-responsive expression of AtCYS5 during seed germination and  post-germination growth.", '2017 Aug', 'Mol Cells', '10.14348/molcells.2017.0075', 'Lim']
