['25387999', 'In response to environmental light signals, gene expression adjustments play an  important role in regulation of photomorphogenesis. LHCB2.4 is among the genes  responsive to light signals, and its expression is regulated by redox-regulated  members of G-group bZIP transcription factors. The biochemical interrelations of  GBF1-interacting protein 1 (GIP1) and the G-group bZIP transcription factors have  been investigated. GIP1, previously shown to enhance DNA-binding activities of  maize GBF1 and Arabidopsis GBF3, is a plant specific protein that reduces  DNA-binding activity of AtbZIP16, AtbZIP68, and AtGBF1 under non-reducing  conditions through direct physical interaction shown by the yeast two-hybrid and  pull-down assays. Fluorescence microscopy studies using cyan fluorescent protein  (CFP)-fusion protein indicate that GIP1 is exclusively localized in the nucleus.  Under non- reducing conditions, GIP1 exhibits predominantly high molecular weight  forms, whereas it predominates in low molecular weight monomers under reducing  conditions. While reduced GIP1 induced formation of DNA-protein complexes of  G-group bZIPs, oxidized GIP1 decreased the amount of those complexes and instead  induced its chaperone function suggesting functional switching from redox to  chaperone activity. Finally analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing GIP1  revealed that GIP1 is a negative co-regulator in red and blue light mediated  hypocotyl elongation. By regulating the repression effect by bZIP16 and the  activation effect by bZIP68 and GBF1 on LHCB2.4 expression, GIP1 functions to  promote hypocotyl elongation during the early stages of Arabidopsis seedling  development.', '2015 May', 'Protoplasma', '10.1007/s00709-014-0726-9', 'Shaikhali']
