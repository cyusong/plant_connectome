• Developmental transitions associated with the life cycle of plant-symbiotic fungi, such as the ascomycete Tuber melanosporum, are likely to require an extensive reprogramming of gene expression brought about by transcription factors (TFs). To date, little is known about the transcriptome alterations that accompany developmental shifts associated with symbiosis or fruiting body formation. • Taking advantage of the black truffle genome sequence, we used a bioinformatic approach, coupled with functional analysis in yeast and transcriptome profiling, to identify and catalogue T. melanosporum TFs, the so-called 'regulome'. • The T. melanosporum regulome contains 102 homologs of previously characterized TFs, 57 homologs of hypothetical TFs, and 42 putative TFs apparently unique to Tuber. The yeast screen allowed the functional discovery of four TFs and the validation of about one-fifth of the in silico predicted TFs. Truffle proteins apparently unrelated to transcription were also identified as potential transcriptional regulators, together with a number of plant TFs. • Twenty-nine TFs, some of which associated with particular developmental stages, were found to be up-regulated in ECMs or fruiting bodies. About one-quarter of these up-regulated TFs are expressed at surprisingly high levels, thus pointing to a striking functional specialization of the different stages of the Tuber life cycle.
