Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV), as a typical seed-borne virus, causes costly and devastating diseases in the vegetable trade worldwide. Genetic sources for resistance to CGMMV in cucurbits are limited, and environmentally safe approaches for curbing the accumulation and spread of seed-transmitted viruses and cultivating completely resistant plants are needed. Here, we describe the design and application of RNA interference-based technologies, containing artificial microRNA (amiRNA) and synthetic <i>trans</i>-acting small interfering RNA (syn-tasiRNA), against conserved regions of different strains of the CGMMV genome. We used a rapid transient sensor system to identify effective anti-CGMMV amiRNAs. A virus seed transmission assay was developed, showing that the externally added polycistronic amiRNA and syn-tasiRNA can successfully block the accumulation of CGMMV in cucumber, but different virulent strains exhibited distinct influences on the expression of amiRNA due to the activity of the RNA-silencing suppressor. We also established stable transgenic cucumber plants expressing polycistronic amiRNA, which conferred disease resistance against CGMMV, and no sequence mutation was observed in CGMMV. This study demonstrates that RNA interference-based technologies can effectively prevent the occurrence and accumulation of CGMMV. The results provide a basis to establish and fine-tune approaches to prevent and treat seed-based transmission viral infections.
