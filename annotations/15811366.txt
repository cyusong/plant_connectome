['15811366', 'Ethylene-insensitive3 (EIN3) and EIN3-like (EIL) proteins are essential  transcription factors in the ethylene signaling of higher plants. The EIN3/EIL  proteins bind to the promoter regions of the downstream genes and regulate their  expression. The location of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) in the primary structure  was unclear, since the proteins show no sequence similarity to other known DBDs.  Here, we identify the major DBD of an EIN3/EIL protein, Arabidopsis thaliana  EIL3, containing a key mutational site for DNA binding and signaling (ein3-3  site), and determine its solution structure by NMR spectroscopy. The structure  consists of five alpha-helices, possessing a novel fold dissimilar to known DBD  structures. By a chemical-shift perturbation analysis, a region including the  ein3-3 site is suggested to be involved in DNA binding.', '2005 Apr 29', 'J Mol Biol', '10.1016/j.jmb.2005.02.065', 'Yokoyama']
