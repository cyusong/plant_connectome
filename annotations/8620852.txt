['8620852', 'The role of the Arabidopsis homeobox gene, GLABRA 2 (GL2), in the development of  the root epidermis has been investigated. The wild-type epidermis is composed of  two cell types, root-hair cells and hairless cells, which are located at distinct  positions within the root, implying that positional cues control cell-type  differentiation. During the development of the root epidermis, the  differentiating root-hair cells (trichoblasts) and the differentiating hairless  cells (atrichoblasts) can be distinguished by their cytoplasmic density, vacuole  formation, and extent of elongation. We have determined that mutations in the GL2  gene specifically alter the differentiation of the hairless epidermal cells,  causing them to produce root hairs, which indicates that GL2 affects epidermal  cell identity. Detailed analyses of these differentiating cells showed that,  despite forming root hairs, they are similar to atrichoblasts of the wild type in  their cytoplasmic characteristics, timing of vacuolation, and extent of cell  elongation. The results of in situ nucleic acid hybridization and GUS reporter  gene fusion studies show that the GL2 gene is preferentially expressed in the  differentiating hairless cells of the wild type, during a period in which  epidermal cell identity is believed to be established. These results indicate  that the GL2 homeodomain protein normally regulates a subset of the processes  that occur during the differentiation of hairless epidermal cells of the  Arabidopsis root. Specifically, GL2 appears to act in a cell-position-dependent  manner to suppress hair formation in differentiating hairless cells.', '1996 Apr', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.122.4.1253', 'Schiefelbein']
