Maintenance of genome stability is an essential requirement for all living organisms. Formaldehyde and UV-B irradiation cause DNA damage and affect genome stability, growth and development, but the interplay between these two genotoxic factors is poorly understood in plants. We show that Arabidopsis adh2/gsnor1 mutant, which lacks alcohol dehydrogenase 2/S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 1 (ADH2/GSNOR1), are hypersensitive to low fluence UV-B irradiation or UV-B irradiation-mimetic chemicals. Although the ADH2/GSNOR1 enzyme can act on different substrates, notably on S-hydroxymethylglutathione (HMG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), our study provides several lines of evidence that the sensitivity of gsnor1 to UV-B is caused mainly by UV-B-induced formaldehyde accumulation rather than other factors such as alteration of the GSNO concentration. Our results demonstrate an interplay between formaldehyde and UV-B that exacerbates genome instability, leading to severe DNA damage and impaired growth and development in Arabidopsis, and show that ADH2/GSNOR1 is a key player in combating these effects.
