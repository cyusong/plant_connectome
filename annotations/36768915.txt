Stomata are microscopic pores on the plant epidermis that serve as a major passage for the gas and water exchange between a plant and the atmosphere. The formation of stomata requires a series of cell division and cell-fate transitions and some key regulators including transcription factors and peptides. Monocots have different stomatal patterning and a specific subsidiary cell formation process compared with dicots. Cell-to-cell symplastic trafficking mediated by plasmodesmata (PD) allows molecules including proteins, RNAs and hormones to function in neighboring cells by moving through the channels. During stomatal developmental process, the intercellular communication between stomata complex and adjacent epidermal cells are finely controlled at different stages. Thus, the stomata cells are isolated or connected with others to facilitate their formation or movement. In the review, we summarize the main regulation mechanism underlying stomata development in both dicots and monocots and especially the specific regulation of subsidiary cell formation in monocots. We aim to highlight the important role of symplastic connection modulation during stomata development, including the status of PD presence at different cell-cell interfaces and the function of relevant mobile factors in both dicots and monocots.
