Gene duplications have long been recognized as a contributor to the evolution of genes with new functions. Multiple copies of genes can result from tandem duplication, from transposition to new chromosomes, or from whole-genome duplication (polyploidy). The most common fate is that one member of the pair is deleted to return the gene to the singleton state. Other paths involve the reduced expression of both copies (hypofunctionalization) that are held in duplicate to maintain sufficient quantity of function. The two copies can split functions (subfunctionalization) or can diverge to generate a new function (neofunctionalization). Retention of duplicates resulting from doubling of the whole genome occurs for genes involved with multicomponent interactions such as transcription factors and signal transduction components. In contrast, these classes of genes are underrepresented in small segmental duplications. This complementary pattern suggests that the balance of interactors affects the fate of the duplicate pair. We discuss the different mechanisms that maintain duplicated genes, which may change over time and intersect.
