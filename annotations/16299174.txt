['16299174', 'Biochemical and molecular characterization of the biotin biosynthetic pathway in  plants has dealt primarily with biotin synthase. This enzyme catalyzing the last  step of the pathway is localized in mitochondria. Other enzymes of the pathway  are however largely unknown. In this study, a genomic-based approach allowed us  to clone an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cDNA coding  7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA) synthase, the first committed enzyme of the  biotin synthesis pathway, which we named AtbioF. The function of the enzyme was  demonstrated by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant  deficient in KAPA synthase reaction, and by measuring in vitro activity.  Overproduction and purification of recombinant AtbioF protein enabled a thorough  characterization of the kinetic properties of the enzyme and a spectroscopic  study of the enzyme interaction with its substrates and product. This is the  first characterization of a KAPA synthase reaction in eukaryotes. Finally, both  green fluorescent protein-targeting experiments and western-blot analyses showed  that the Arabidopsis KAPA synthase is present in cytosol, thus revealing a unique  compartmentation of the plant biotin synthesis, split between cytosol and  mitochondria. The significance of the complex compartmentation of biotin  synthesis and utilization in the plant cell and its potential importance in the  regulation of biotin metabolism are also discussed.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.070144', 'Alban']
