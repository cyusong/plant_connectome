<i>Xanthomonas fragariae</i> is a global quarantine pathogen, which typically inflicts angular leaf spots. In the present study, we report a new 4.11-Mb high-quality genome sequence of <i>X. fragariae</i> YL19. YL19 can cause the typical angular leaf spot symptoms on strawberry plants in China as well as crown infection pocket symptoms. This new symptom has not been reported in other <i>X. fragariae</i>. Compared with typical <i>X. fragariae</i> strains, including PD885, NBC2815, PD5205, Fap21, and Fap29, the genome and plasmid in YL19 were smaller in size, lacking 109 coding genes, and have more carbohydrate-active enzyme and secondary metabolism genes. The YL19 genome ought to clarify the molecular mechanisms of genome evolution, host adaptation, and pathological process of <i>X</i>. <i>fragariae</i> and help improve strawberry management strategies.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
