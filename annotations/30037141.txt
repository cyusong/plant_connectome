['30037141', 'The seed is the most important plant reproductive unit responsible for the  evolutionary success of flowering plants. Aside from its essential function in  the sexual reproduction of plants, the seed also represents the most economically  important agricultural product worldwide, providing energy, nutrients, and raw  materials for human nutrition, livestock feed, and countless manufactured goods.  Hence, improvements in seed quality or size are highly valuable, due to their  economic potential in agriculture. Recently, the importance of indolic compounds  in regulating these traits has been reported for Arabidopsis thaliana. The  transcriptional and physiological mechanisms involved, however, remain largely  undisclosed. Potassium transporters have been suggested as possible mediators of  embryo cell size, controlling turgor pressure during seed maturation. In  addition, it has been demonstrated that the expression of K(+) transporters is  effectively regulated by auxin. Here, we provide evidence for the identification  of two Arabidopsis K(+) transporters, HAK/KT12 (At1g60160) and KUP4 (At4g23640),  that are likely to be implicated in determining seed size during seed maturation  and, at the same time, show a differential regulation by indole-3-acetic acid and  indole-3-acetamide.', '2018 Jul 22', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms19072132', 'ORCID:']
