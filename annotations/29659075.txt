Cyanogenic glucosides are nitrogen-containing specialized metabolites that provide chemical defense against herbivores and pathogens via the release of toxic hydrogen cyanide. It has been suggested that cyanogenic glucosides are also a store of nitrogen that can be remobilized for general metabolism via a previously unknown pathway. Here we reveal a recycling pathway for the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) that avoids hydrogen cyanide formation. As demonstrated in vitro, the pathway proceeds via spontaneous formation of a dhurrin-derived glutathione conjugate, which undergoes reductive cleavage by glutathione transferases of the plant-specific lambda class (GSTLs) to produce p-hydroxyphenyl acetonitrile. This is further metabolized to p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and free ammonia by nitrilases, and then glucosylated to form p-glucosyloxyphenylacetic acid. Two of the four GSTLs in sorghum exhibited high stereospecific catalytic activity towards the glutathione conjugate, and form a subclade in a phylogenetic tree of GSTLs in higher plants. The expression of the corresponding two GSTLs co-localized with expression of the genes encoding the p-hydroxyphenyl acetonitrile-metabolizing nitrilases at the cellular level. The elucidation of this pathway places GSTs as key players in a remarkable scheme for metabolic plasticity allowing plants to reverse the resource flow between general and specialized metabolism in actively growing tissue.
