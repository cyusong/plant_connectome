We identified the molecular structures of all carotenoids in Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 (= IAM M-204). The major carotenoids were beta-carotene, echinenone and canthaxanthin. Myxol glycosides were absent, while free forms of myxol and 4-hydroxymyxol were present. The 4-hydroxyl group of the latter was a mixture of (4R) and (4S) configurations, which is a rare mixture in carotenoids. Thus, this strain was the first cyanobacterium found to have free myxol and not myxol glycosides, and seemed to lack the gene for or activity of glycosyl transferase. In another strain of A. variabilis IAM M-3 (= PCC 7118), we recently identified (3R,2'S)-myxol 2'-fucoside and (3S,2'S)-4-ketomyxol 2'-fucoside, and hence the strain ATCC 29413 might be useful for investigating the characteristics of myxol glycosides in cyanobacteria. Based on the identification of the carotenoids and the completion of the entire nucleotide sequence of the genome in A. variabilis ATCC 29413, we proposed a biosynthetic pathway of the carotenoids and the corresponding genes and enzymes. The homologous genes were searched by sequence homology only from the functionally confirmed genes.
