['21478367', 'We have previously shown that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RING-H2 E3  ligase RHA2a positively regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during seed  germination and postgerminative growth. Here, we report that RHA2b, the closest  homolog of RHA2a, is also an active E3 ligase and plays an important role in ABA  signaling. We show that RHA2b expression is induced by ABA and that  overexpression of RHA2b leads to ABA-associated phenotypes such as ABA  hypersensitivity in seed germination and seedling growth, enhanced stomatal  closure, reduced water loss, and, therefore, increased drought tolerance. On the  contrary, the rha2b-1 mutant shows ABA-insensitive phenotypes and reduced drought  tolerance. We provide evidence showing that a rha2a rha2b-1 double mutant  generally enhances ABA insensitivity of rha2b-1 in seed germination, seedling  growth, and stomatal closure, suggesting that RHA2b and RHA2a act redundantly in  regulating ABA responses. Genetic analyses support that, like RHA2a, the RHA2b  action in ABA signaling is downstream of a protein phosphatase 2C,  ABA-INSENSITIVE2 (ABI2), and in parallel with that of the ABI transcription  factors ABI3/4/5. We speculate that RHA2b and RHA2a may have redundant yet  distinguishable functions in the regulation of ABA responses.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.176214', 'Li']
