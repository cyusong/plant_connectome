The root of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a dynamic structure in which cells continuously divide and differentiate to sustain its postembryonic undetermined growth. Cells at different developmental stages are organized in distinguished zones whose position and activities are maintained constant during root growth. In this review, we will discuss the latest discoveries on the regulatory networks involved in root zonation and, in particular, in the mechanisms involved in maintaining the position of the transition zone, a root developmental boundary. Developmental boundaries physically divide cells with different functions and identities. The transition zone separates dividing cells from differentiating cells in two functional domains, preserving their identity during root growth and thus controlling root development.
