Analysis of an expressed sequence tag library with more than 5,000 sequences from spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii reveals that more than 3,900 of them represent distinct genes, and almost 70% of these have significant similarity to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes. Eight genes are common between three very different dormant plant systems, Ceratopteris spores, Arabidopsis seeds, and Arabidopsis pollen. We evaluated the pattern of mRNA abundance over the first 48 h of spore development using a microarray of cDNAs representing 3,207 distinct genes of C. richardii and determined the relative levels of RNA abundance for 3,143 of these genes using a Bayesian method of statistical analysis. More than 900 of them (29%) show a significant change between any of the five time points analyzed, and these have been annotated based on their sequence similarity with the Arabidopsis proteome. Novel data arising from these analyses identify genes likely to be critical for the germination and subsequent early development of diverse cells and tissues emerging from dormancy.
