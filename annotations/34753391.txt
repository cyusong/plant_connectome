Iron (Fe) and Zinc (Zn) are essential nutrient elements for plant growth and development. Here, we observed the effects of Fe and Zn deficiency in seedlings of <i>Areca catechu</i> L. (areca palm), one of the most cultured palm trees in tropic regions. Results revealed that Fe deficiency causes strong chlorosis with the significantly decreased chlorophyll biosynthesis level and photosynthetic activities in the top third young leaf (L3) of seedlings. Zn deficiency caused light chlorosis in all three young leaves which slightly decreased chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthetic activities. Analysis of the Fe and Zn concentration in leaves and roots indicated that absorption and distribution of these two ions share cooperative pathways, since Zn deficiency caused Fe increasing, and vice versa. Therefore, we focused on the <i>ZINC-IRON PERMEASE (ZIP)</i> genes in areca trees. From the whole-genome data set we obtained, 6 <i>ZIP</i> genes were classified, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with other 38 <i>ZIP</i> genes from model plants to find their potential functions. We also analyzed the expression pattern of <i>AcZIP1-6</i> genes under Zn and Fe deficiency by transcriptomic approaches. With these results, we constructed an expression atlas of <i>AcZIP1-6</i> genes in leaves and roots of areca seedlings with the dynamic expression levels under Fe and Zn deficient conditions. In conclusion, we provide evidence to understand the absorption and transport of nutrient elements, Fe and Zn, in the tropic agricultural plant <i>A. catechu.</i>
