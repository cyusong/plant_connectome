In the course of our studies on the putative role of pectins in the control of cell growth, we have investigated the effect of cadmium on their composition, remodelling and distribution within the epidermis and fibre tissues of flax hypocotyl (Linum usitatissimum L.). Cadmium-stressed seedlings showed a significant inhibition of growth whereas the hypocotyl volume did not significantly change, due to the swelling of most tissues. The structural alterations consisted of significant increase of the thickness of all cell walls and the marked collapse of the sub-epidermal layer. The pectic epitopes recognized by the anti-PGA/RGI and JIM5 antibodies increased in the outer parts of the epidermis (external tangential wall and junctions) and fibres (primary wall and junctions). Concomitantly, there was a remarkable decrease of JIM7 antibody labelling and consequently an increase of the ratio JIM5/JIM7. Conversely, the ratio JIM7/JIM5 increased in the wall domains closest to the plasmalemma, which would expel the cadmium ions from the cytoplasm. The hydrolysis of cell walls revealed a cadmium-induced increase of uronic acid in the pectic matrix. Sequential extractions showed a remodelling of both homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan I. In fractions enriched in primary walls, the main part of the pectins became cross-linked and could be extracted only with alkali. In fractions enriched in secondary walls, the homogalacturonan moieties were found more abundantly in the calcium-chelator extract while the rhamnogacturonan level increased in the boiling water extract.
