Plants deploy numerous plasma membrane receptors to sense and rapidly react to environmental changes. Correct localization and adequate protein levels of the cell-surface receptors are critical for signaling activation and modulation of plant development and defense against pathogens. After ligand binding, receptors are internalized for degradation and signaling attenuation. However, one emerging notion is that the ligand-induced endocytosis of receptor complexes is important for the signal duration, amplitude, and specificity. Recently, mutants of major endocytosis players, including clathrin and dynamin, have been shown to display defects in activation of a subset of signal transduction pathways, implying that signaling in plants might not be solely restricted to the plasma membrane. Here, we summarize the up-to-date knowledge of receptor complex endocytosis and its effect on the signaling outcome, in the context of plant development and immunity.
