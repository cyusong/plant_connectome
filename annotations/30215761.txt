Human activities generate environmental stresses that can lead plant populations to become extinct. Population survival would require the evolution of adaptive responses that increase tolerance to these stresses. Thus, in pseudometallophyte species that have colonized anthropogenic metalliferous habitats, the evolution of increased metal tolerance is expected in metallicolous populations. However, the mechanisms by which metal tolerance evolves remain unclear. In this study, parent populations were created from non-metallicolous families of Noccaea caerulescens. They were cultivated for one generation in mesocosms and under various levels of zinc (Zn) contamination to assess whether Zn in soil represents a selective pressure. Individual plant fitness estimates were used to create descendant populations, which were cultivated in controlled conditions with moderate Zn contamination to test for adaptive evolution in functional traits. The number of families showing high fitness estimates in mesocosms was progressively reduced with increasing Zn levels in soil, suggesting increasing selection for metal tolerance. In the next generation, adaptive evolution was suggested for some physiological and ecological traits in descendants of the most exposed populations, together with a significant decrease of Zn hyperaccumulation. Our results confirm experimentally that Zn alone can be a significant evolutionary pressure promoting adaptive divergence among populations.
