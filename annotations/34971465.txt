During the course of evolution, different ecotypes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) have evolved distinct strategies to cope with submergence stress. Such contrasting responses are mediated by plant hormones that are principle regulators of growth, development and responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. These hormones act cooperatively and show extensive crosstalk which is mediated by key regulatory genes that serve as nodes of molecular communication. The presence or absence of such genes leads to significant changes in hormone signalling pathways and hence, governs the type of response that the plant will exhibit. As flooding is one of the leading causes of crop loss across all the major rice-producing countries, it is crucial to deeply understand the molecular nexus governing the response to submergence to produce flood resilient varieties. This review focuses on the hormonal signalling pathways that mediate two contrasting responses of the rice plant to submergence stress namely, rapid internode elongation to escape flood waters and quiescence response that enables the plant to survive under complete submergence. The significance of several key genes such as Sub1A-1, SLR1, SD1 and SK1/SK2, in defining the ultimate response to submergence has also been discussed.
