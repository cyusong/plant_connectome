The potential of whole genome duplication to increase plant biomass yield is well-known. In Arabidopsis tetraploids, an increase in biomass yield was accompanied by a reduction in lignin content and, as a result, a higher saccharification efficiency was achieved compared with diploid controls. Here, we evaluated whether the results obtained in Arabidopsis could be translated into poplar and whether the enhanced saccharification yield upon alkaline pretreatment of hairpin-downregulated <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>hpCAD</i>) transgenic poplar could be further improved upon a whole genome duplication. Using a colchicine treatment, wild-type (WT) <i>Populus tremula</i> x <i>P. alba</i> cv. INRA 717-1B4, a commonly used model clone in tree biotechnology research, and <i>hpCAD</i> tetraploids were generated and grown in the greenhouse. In parallel, WT tetraploid poplars were grown in the field. In contrast to Arabidopsis, a whole genome duplication of poplar had a negative impact on the biomass yield of both greenhouse- and field-grown trees. Strikingly, field-grown WT tetraploids developed a brittle apex phenotype, i.e., their tip broke off just below the apex. In addition, the chromosome doubling altered the biomass composition of field-grown, but not of greenhouse-grown tetraploid poplars. More specifically, the lignin content of field-grown tetraploid poplars was increased at the expense of matrix polysaccharides. This increase in lignin deposition in biomass is likely the cause of the observed brittle apex phenotype, though no major differences in stem anatomy or in mechanical properties could be found between di- and tetraploid WT poplars grown in the field. Finally, without biomass pretreatment, the saccharification efficiency of greenhouse- and field-grown WT diploids was not different from that of tetraploids, whereas that of greenhouse-grown <i>hpCAD</i> tetraploids was higher than that of greenhouse-grown diploids. Upon alkaline pretreatment, the saccharification yield of diploids was similar to that of tetraploids for all genotypes and growth conditions tested. This study showed that a whole genome duplication in hybrid WT and <i>hpCAD</i> poplar did neither result in further improvements in biomass yield, nor in improved biomass composition and, hence, saccharification performance.
