Seed plants have evolved mechanisms that maintain the dormancy of mature seeds until the time is appropriate for germination. Seed germination is a critical step in the plant life cycle, and it is an important trait in relation to agricultural production. The process is precisely regulated by various internal and external factors, and in particular by diverse endogenous hormones. Jasmonates (JAs) are one of the main plant hormones that mediate stress responses, and recent studies have provided evidence of their inhibitory effects on seed germination. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory roles of JAs during the seed germination stage. We describe the crosstalk between JA and other phytohormones that influence seed germination, such as abscisic acid and gibberellic acid.

JAs: !inhibit! Seed Germination
JA: !crosstalks with! Abscisic Acid
JA: !crosstalks with! Gibberellic Acid
