['14593187', 'The Arabidopsis autonomous floral-promotion pathway promotes flowering  independently of the photoperiod and vernalization pathways by repressing  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a MADS-box transcription factor that blocks the  transition from vegetative to reproductive development. Here, we report that  FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD), one of six genes in the autonomous pathway, encodes a  plant homolog of a protein found in histone deacetylase complexes in mammals.  Lesions in FLD result in hyperacetylation of histones in FLC chromatin,  up-regulation of FLC expression, and extremely delayed flowering. Thus, the  autonomous pathway regulates flowering in part by histone deacetylation. However,  not all autonomous-pathway mutants exhibit FLC hyperacetylation, indicating that  multiple means exist by which this pathway represses FLC expression.', '2003 Dec 5', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1091109', 'Amasino']
