FKBP12 encodes a prolyl isomerase and highly conserved in eukaryotic species. In yeasts and animals, FKBP12 can interact with rapamycin and FK506 to form rapamycin-FKBP12 and FK506-FKBP12 complex, respectively. In higher plants, FKBP12 protein lost its function to bind rapamycin and FK506. Early studies showed that yeast and human FKBP12 protein can restore the rapamycin sensitivity in Arabidopsis, but the used concentration is 100-1000 folds higher than that in yeast and animals. High concentration of drugs would increase the cost and cause the potential secondary effects on plant growth and development. Here we further discovered that BP12 plants generated in our previous study are hypersensitive to rapamycin at the concentration as low as that is effective in yeast and animals. It is surprising to observe that WT and BP12 plants are not sensitive to FK506 in normal growth condition. These findings advance the current understanding of rapamycin-TOR signaling in plants.
