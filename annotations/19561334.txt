Interaction and cross-talk between microtubules and actin microfilaments are important for the cell axis and polarity during plant cell growth and development, but little is known about the molecular components of this interaction. Plant kinesins with a calponin-homology domain (KCHs) were recently identified and associated with a putative role in microtubule-microfilament cross-linking. KCHs belong to a distinct branch of the minus end-directed kinesin subfamily and so far have only been identified in land plants including the mosses. Here we report the identification of a new KCH from rice (Oryza sativa), OsKCH1, and show that OsKCH1 is associated with cortical microtubules and actin microfilaments in vivo. Furthermore, OsKCH1 is shown to bind to micro-tubules and actin microfilaments in vitro in a domain-dependent way. Additionally, this unique type of kinesin is shown to oligomerize both in vivo and in vitro. These findings are discussed with respect to a general role for KCHs as linkers between actin filaments and microtubules in both cell elongation and division.
