Cell wall biogenesis is required for the production of seeds of higher plants. However, little is known about regulatory mechanisms underlying cell wall biogenesis during seed formation. Here we show a role for the phosphorylation of Arabidopsis cellulose synthase 1 (AtCESA1) in modulating pectin synthesis and methylesterification in seed coat mucilage. A phosphor-null mutant of AtCESA1 on T166 (AtCESA1<sup>T166A</sup>) was constructed and introduced into a null mutant of AtCESA1 (Atcesa1-1). The resulting transgenic lines showed a slight but significant decrease in cellulose contents in mature seeds. Defects in cellulosic ray architecture along with reduced levels of non-adherent and adherent mucilage were observed on the seeds of the AtCESA1<sup>T166A</sup> mutant. Reduced mucilage pectin synthesis was also reflected by a decrease in the level of uronic acid. Meanwhile, an increase in the degree of pectin methylesterification was also observed in the seed coat mucilage of AtCESA1<sup>T166A</sup> mutant. Change in seed development was further reflected by a delayed germination and about 50% increase in the accumulation of proanthocyanidins, which is known to bind pectin and inhibit seed germination as revealed by previous studies. Taken together, the results suggest a role of AtCESA1 phosphorylation on T166 in modulating mucilage pectin synthesis and methylesterification as well as cellulose synthesis with a role in seed development.
