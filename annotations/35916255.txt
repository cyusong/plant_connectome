Early Responsive to Dehydration (ERD) genes are rapidly induced in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses, such as bacteria, drought, light, temperature and high salt in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Sixteen ERD of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<i>AtERD</i>) genes have been previously identified. The lengths of the coding region of the genes are 504-2838 bp. They encode 137-745 amino acids. In this study, the <i>AtERD</i> genes structure and promoter are analyzed through bioinformatics, and a overall function is summarized and a systematic signal pathway involving <i>AtERD</i> genes is mapped. AtERD9, AtERD11 and AtERD13 have the GST domain. AtERD10 and AtERD14 have the Dehyd domain. The promoters regions contain 32 light responsive elements, 23 ABA responsive elements, 5 drought responsive elements, 5 meristem expression related elements and 132 core promoter elements. The study provides a theoretical guidance for subsequent studies of <i>AtERD</i> genes.
