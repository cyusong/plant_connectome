['22051886', 'Cytokinins are a class of phytohormones that play a crucial role in plant growth  and development. The gene UGT76C2 encoding cytokinin N-glucosyltransferase of  Arabidopsis thaliana has been previously identified. To determine the in planta  role of UGT76C2 in cytokinin metabolism and response, we analyzed the phenotypes  of its loss-of-function mutant (ugt76c2) and its overexpressors. The accumulation  level of the cytokinin N-glucosides was significantly decreased in ugt76c2, but  substantially increased in UGT76C2 overexpressors compared with the wild type.  When treated with exogenously applied cytokinin, ugt76c2 showed more sensitivity  and UGT76C2 overexpressors showed less sensitivity to cytokinin in primary root  elongation, lateral root formation, Chl retention and anthocyanin accumulation.  Under normal growth conditions ugt76c2 had smaller seeds than the wild type, with  accompanying lowered levels of active and N-glucosylated cytokinin forms. The  expression levels of cytokinin-related genes such as AHK2, AHK3, ARR1, IPT5 and  CKX3 were changed in ugt76c2, suggesting homeostatic control of cytokinin  activity. Studies of spatiotemporal expression patterns showed that UGT76C2 was  expressed at a relatively higher level in the seedling and developing seed. In  their entirety, our data, based mainly on this comparison and opposite phenotypes  of knockout and overexpressors, strongly suggest that UGT76C2 is involved in  cytokinin homeostasis and cytokinin response in planta through cytokinin  N-glucosylation.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcr152', 'Hou']
