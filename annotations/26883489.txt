Pseudomonas syringae is a diverse species-complex that includes many important crop pathogens. Here, we report the draft genomes of 62 type and pathotype strains, which provide a genomic reference for the diversity of this species complex and will contribute to the elucidation of the genomic basis of pathogenicity and host specificity.

Pseudomonas syringae: !includes! many crop pathogens
