['20516081', 'Selective proteolysis in plants is largely mediated by the ubiquitin  (Ub)/proteasome system in which substrates, marked by the covalent attachment of  Ub, are degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The 26 S proteasome is composed of two  subparticles, the 20 S core protease (CP) that compartmentalizes the protease  active sites and the 19 S regulatory particle that recognizes and translocates  appropriate substrates into the CP lumen for breakdown. Here, we describe an  affinity method to rapidly purify epitope-tagged 26 S proteasomes intact from  Arabidopsis thaliana. In-depth mass spectrometric analyses of preparations  generated from young seedlings confirmed that the 2.5-MDa CP-regulatory particle  complex is actually a heterogeneous set of particles assembled with paralogous  pairs for most subunits. A number of these subunits are modified  post-translationally by proteolytic processing, acetylation, and/or  ubiquitylation. Several proteasome-associated proteins were also identified that  likely assist in complex assembly and regulation. In addition, we detected a  particle consisting of the CP capped by the single subunit PA200 activator that  may be involved in Ub-independent protein breakdown. Taken together, it appears  that a diverse and highly dynamic population of proteasomes is assembled in  plants, which may expand the target specificity and functions of intracellular  proteolysis.', '2010 Aug 13', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110.136622', 'Vierstra']
