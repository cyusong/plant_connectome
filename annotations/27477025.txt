['27477025', 'Plant seeds accumulate large amounts of protein and carbohydrate as storage  reserves during maturation. Thus, understanding the genetic control of embryo and  seed development may provide bioengineering tools for yield improvement. In this  study, we report the identification of Retarded Embryo Development 1 (RED1) gene  in Arabidopsis, whose two independent T-DNA insertion mutant lines, SALK_085642  (red1-1) and SALK_022583 (red1-2), show a retarded embryo development phenotype.  The embryogenesis process ceases at the late heart stage in red1-1 and at the  bent-cotyledon stage in red1-2, respectively, resulting in seed abortion in both  lines. The retarded embryo development and seed abortion phenotypes reverted to  normal when RED1 complementation constructs were introduced into mutant plants.  Small red1-2 homozygous plants can be successfully rescued by culturing immature  seeds, indicating that seed abortion likely results from compromised tolerance to  the desiccation process associated with seed maturation. Consistent with this  observation, red1-2 seeds accumulate less protein, and the expression of two late  embryo development reporter transgenes, LEA::GUS and beta-conglycinin::GUS, was  significantly weak and started relatively late in the red1-2 mutant lines  compared to the wild type. The RED1 gene encodes a plant specific novel protein  that is localized in the nucleus. These results indicate that RED1 plays  important roles in embryo development, seed maturation and plant growth.', '2016 Jul 20', 'J Genet Genomics', '10.1016/j.jgg.2016.04.009', 'Wang']
