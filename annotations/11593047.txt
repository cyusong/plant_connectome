['11593047', 'We recently isolated the AtBI-1 (Arabidopsis Bax Inhibitor-1) gene, the  expression of which suppressed Bax-induced cell death in yeast. To determine  whether the same is true in the plant system, transgenic Arabidopsis plants  overexpressing Bax protein under a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible promoter were  generated. On DEX treatment, such transgenic plants exhibited marked cell death  at the whole-plant level, cell shrinkage, membranous destruction, and other  apoptotic phenotypes. Transgenic Bax plants were retransformed with a vector  containing the AtBI-1 gene (tagged with green fluorescent protein) under the  control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Plants expressing both Bax  and AtBI-1 were able to maintain growth on DEX-treatment by sustaining  intracellular integrity. Thus, we present here direct genetic evidence that the  plant antiapoptotic protein AtBI-1 is biologically active in suppressing the  mammalian Bax action in planta.', '2001 Oct 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.211423998', 'Uchimiya']
