['23551275', 'The final step of lignin biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by a plant peroxidase,  is the oxidative coupling of the monolignols to growing lignin polymers. Cationic  cell-wall-bound peroxidase (CWPO-C) from poplar callus is a unique enzyme that  has oxidative activity for both monolignols and synthetic lignin polymers. This  study shows that putative CWPO-C homologues in Arabidopsis , AtPrx2, AtPrx25, and  AtPrx71, are involved in lignin biosynthesis. Analysis of stem tissue using the  acetyl bromide method and derivatization followed by the reductive cleavage  method revealed a significant decrease in the total lignin content of ATPRX2 and  ATPRX25 deficient mutants and altered lignin structures in ATPRX2, ATPRX25, and  ATPRX71 deficient mutants. Among Arabidopsis peroxidases, AtPrx2 and AtPrx25  conserve a tyrosine residue on the protein surface, and this tyrosine may act as  a substrate oxidation site as in the case of CWPO-C. AtPrx71 has the highest  amino acid identity with CWPO-C. The results suggest a role for CWPO-C and  CWPO-C-like peroxidases in the lignification of vascular plant cell walls.', '2013 Apr 24', 'J Agric Food Chem', '10.1021/jf400426g', 'Tsutsumi']
