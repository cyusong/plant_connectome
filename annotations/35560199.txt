Plants are sessile organisms that have developed hydrophobic cuticles that cover their aerial epidermal cells to protect them from terrestrial stresses. The cuticle layer is mainly composed of cutin, a polyester of hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids, and cuticular wax, a mixture of very-long-chain fatty acids (>20 carbon atoms) and their derivatives, aldehydes, alkanes, ketones, alcohols, and wax esters. During the last 30 years, forward and reverse genetic, transcriptomic, and biochemical approaches have enabled the identification of key enzymes, transporters, and regulators involved in the biosynthesis of cutin and cuticular waxes. In particular, cuticular wax biosynthesis is significantly influenced in an organ-specific manner or by environmental conditions, and is controlled using a variety of regulators. Recent studies on the regulatory mechanisms underlying cuticular wax biosynthesis have enabled us to understand how plants finely control carbon metabolic pathways to balance between optimal growth and development and defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. In this review, we summarize the regulatory mechanisms underlying cuticular wax biosynthesis at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic levels.
