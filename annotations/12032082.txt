['12032082', 'The Arabidopsis mutation, los2, impairs cold-responsive gene transcription,  acquired freezing tolerance and plant resistance to chilling under certain  conditions. LOS2 was isolated through positional cloning and shown to encode an  enolase in the glycolytic pathway. In animal cells, enolase has also been known  to function as a transcription factor that represses the expression of c-myc by  binding to the c-myc gene promoter. LOS2 fused to green fluorescent protein is  targeted to the nucleus as well as to the cytoplasm. LOS2/enolase protein can  bind to the cis-element of the human c-myc gene promoter and to the gene promoter  of STZ/ZAT10, a zinc finger transcriptional repressor from Arabidopsis. STZ/ZAT10  expression is induced rapidly and transiently by cold in the wild type, and this  induction is stronger and more sustained in the los2 mutant. Furthermore, the  expression of a RD29A-LUC reporter gene is repressed significantly by STZ/ZAT10  in transient expression assays in Arabidopsis leaves. Our results demonstrate  that cold-responsive gene transcription in plants is controlled by a  bi-functional enolase.', '2002 Jun 3', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/21.11.2692', 'Zhu']
