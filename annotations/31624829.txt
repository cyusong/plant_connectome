Potassium (K+) is an essential cation in all organisms that influences crop production and ecosystem stability. Although most soils are rich in K minerals, relatively little K+ is present in forms that are available to plants. Moreover, leaching and run-off from the upper soil layers contribute to K+ deficiencies in agricultural soils. Hence, the demand for K fertilizer is increasing worldwide. K+ regulates multiple processes in cells and organs, with K+ deficiency resulting in decreased plant growth and productivity. Here, we discuss the complexity of the reactive oxygen species-calcium-hormone signalling network that is responsible for the sensing of K+ deficiency in plants, together with genetic approaches using K+ transporters that have been used to increase K+ use efficiency (KUE) in plants, particularly under environmental stress conditions such as salinity and heavy metal contamination. Publicly available rice transcriptome data are used to demonstrate the two-way relationship between K+ and nitrogen nutrition, highlighting how each nutrient can regulate the uptake and root to shoot translocation of the other. Future research directions are discussed in terms of this relationship, as well as prospects for molecular approaches for the generation of improved varieties and the implementation of new agronomic practices. An increased knowledge of the systems that sense and take up K+, and their regulation, will not only improve current understanding of plant K+ homeostasis but also facilitate new research and the implementation of measures to improve plant KUE for sustainable food production.
