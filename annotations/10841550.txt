['10841550', 'A hypothetical gene with similarity to the ispD gene of Escherichia coli was  cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA. The ORF of 909 bp specifies a protein of  302 amino acid residues. The cognate chromosomal gene consists of 2,071 bp and  comprises 11 introns with a size range of 78-202 bp. A fragment comprising amino  acid residues 76-302 was expressed in a recombinant E. coli strain. The protein  was purified to homogeneity and was shown to catalyze the formation of  4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol from 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  with a specific activity of 67 micromol small middle dotmin(-1) mg(-1). The  Michaelis constants for 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol and CTP were  500 microM and 114 microM, respectively.', '2000 Jun 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.97.12.6451', 'Bacher']
