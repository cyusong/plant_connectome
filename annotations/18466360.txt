Two mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana deficient in lutein have been investigated with respect to their responses to growth under a range of suboptimal conditions. The first mutant, lut1, was enriched in violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin and zeinoxanthin compared with the wild-type (WT). In the second mutant, lut2, the lack of lutein was compensated for only by an increase in xanthophyll cycle (XC) carotenoids. Upon transfer of plants grown under optimal conditions to high light (HL), drought or HL + drought, both mutants acclimated during several days to the new conditions to the same extent as the WT. In contrast, transfer to chilling conditions (6 degrees C) for 6 days induced responses that were different between WT and mutants and between the mutants themselves. In contrast to the WT, the lut2 mutant in particular exhibited a large increase in the Chl a/b ratio and the XC pool size, extensive de-epoxidation and an enhanced extent of non-photochemical quenching. It is suggested that although the role of lutein in the structure and organisation of the light-harvesting complexes can be fulfilled by other xanthophylls under excess light conditions at optimal temperatures, this is not the case at low temperature.
