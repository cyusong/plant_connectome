Drought is a major environmental stress that threatens crop production. Therefore, identification of genes involved in drought stress response is of vital importance to decipher the molecular mechanism of stress signal transduction and breed drought tolerance crops, especially for maize. Clade A PP2C phosphatases are core abscisic acid (ABA) signaling components, regulating ABA signal transduction and drought response. However, the roles of other clade PP2Cs in drought resistance remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered a clade F PP2C, ZmPP84, that negatively regulates drought tolerance by screening a transgenic overexpression maize library. Quantitative RT-PCR indicates that the transcription of ZmPP84 is suppressed by drought stress. We identified that ZmMEK1, a member of the MAPKK family, interacts with ZmPP84 by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Additionally, we found that ZmPP84 can dephosphorylate ZmMEK1 and repress its kinase activity on the downstream substrate kinase ZmSIMK1, while ZmSIMK1 is able to phosphorylate S-type anion channel ZmSLAC1 at S146 and T520 in vitro. Mutations of S146 and T520 to phosphomimetic aspartate could activate ZmSLAC1 currents in Xenopus oocytes. Taken together, our study suggests that ZmPP84 is a negative regulator of drought stress response that inhibits stomatal closure through dephosphorylating ZmMEK1, thereby repressing ZmMEK1-ZmSIMK1 signaling pathway.
