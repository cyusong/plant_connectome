Phytohormones act as key regulators of plant growth that coordinate developmental and physiological processes across cells, tissues and organs. As such, their levels and distribution are highly dynamic owing to changes in their biosynthesis, transport, modification and degradation that occur over space and time. Fluorescent biosensors represent ideal tools to track these dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution in a minimally invasive manner. Substantial progress has been made in generating a diverse set of hormone sensors with recent FRET biosensors for visualising hormone concentrations complementing information provided by transcriptional, translational and degron-based reporters. In this review, we provide an update on fluorescent biosensor designs, examine the key properties that constitute an ideal hormone biosensor, discuss the use of these sensors in conjunction with in vivo hormone perturbations and highlight the latest discoveries made using these tools.
