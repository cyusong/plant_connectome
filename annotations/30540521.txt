Sheath blight caused by the soil borne fungus <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> AG1-IA is one of the major diseases of rice in the world. Genetic resistance in rice against this disease has not been very successful. <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> is considered as a model species for several cereal crops and it has been studied in the past to identify novel sources of disease resistance against cereal crop diseases. Therefore, the current study was designed to explore nonhost disease resistance in <i>Brachypodium</i> accessions against sheath blight pathogen of rice, <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>. A total of 19 <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> accessions were screened for resistance against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> AG1-IA. Different levels of resistance reactions were observed among accessions. Quantification of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) concentration in selected resistant (Bd3-1), moderately susceptible (Bd21), and susceptible (Bd30-1) inbred accessions revealed that Bd3-1 accumulated more JA upon pathogen infection compared to Bd21 or Bd30-1. In contrary, no differences were observed for SA accumulation in tested accessions suggesting that the resistance to <i>R. solani</i> in <i>Brachypodium</i> is due to an SA-independent defense pathway. Our study provides a new foundation to explore this area for more durable resistance against this disease.

Brachypodium: !resists! Rhizoctonia solani
Bd3-1: !accumulates more! Jasmonic acid
Bd21/Bd30-1: !accumulate same amount of! Salicylic acid
