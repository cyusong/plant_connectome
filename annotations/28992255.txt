To establish a successful infection, a virus needs to replicate and move cell-to-cell efficiently. We investigated whether one of the genes upregulated in Nicotiana benthamiana after Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) inoculation was involved in regulating virus movement. We revealed the gene to be a plasma membrane-associated cation-binding protein 1-like protein, designated NbPCaP1L. The expression of NbPCaP1L in N. benthamiana was knocked down using Tobacco rattle virus-based gene silencing and consequently the accumulation of BaMV increased significantly to that of control plants. Further analysis indicated no significant difference in the accumulation of BaMV in NbPCaP1L knockdown and control protoplasts, suggesting NbPCaP1L may affect cell-to-cell movement of BaMV. Using a viral vector expressing green fluorescent protein in the knockdown plants, the mean area of viral focus, as determined by fluorescence, was found to be larger in NbPCaP1L knockdown plants. Orange fluorescence protein (OFP)-fused NbPCaP1L, NbPCaP1L-OFP, was expressed in N. benthamiana and reduced the accumulation of BaMV to 46%. To reveal the possible interaction of viral protein with NbPCaP1L, we performed yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated that NbPCaP1L interacted with BaMV replicase. The results also suggested that NbPCaP1L could trap the BaMV movement RNP complex via interaction with the viral replicase in the complex and so restricted viral cell-to-cell movement.
