['9342391', 'We cloned two hemoglobin genes from Arabidopsis thaliana. One gene, AHB1, is  related in sequence to the family of nonsymbiotic hemoglobin genes previously  identified in a number of plant species (class 1). The second hemoglobin gene,  AHB2, represents a class of nonsymbiotic hemoglobin (class 2) related in sequence  to the symbiotic hemoglobin genes of legumes and Casuarina. The properties of  these two hemoglobins suggest that the two families of nonsymbiotic hemoglobins  may differ in function from each other and from the symbiotic hemoglobins. AHB1  is induced, in both roots and rosette leaves, by low oxygen levels. Recombinant  AHB1 has an oxygen affinity so high as to make it unlikely to function as an  oxygen transporter. AHB2 is expressed at a low level in rosette leaves and is low  temperature-inducible. AHB2 protein has a lower affinity for oxygen than AHB1 but  is similar to AHB1 in having an unusually low, pH-sensitive oxygen off-rate.', '1997 Oct 28', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.94.22.12230', 'Peacock']
