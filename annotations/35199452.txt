['35199452', 'In plant chloroplasts, photosystem II (PSII) complexes, together with  light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), form various PSII-LHCII supercomplexes  (SCs). This process likely involves immunophilins, but the underlying regulatory  mechanisms are unclear. Here, by comparing Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking  the chloroplast lumen-localized immunophilin CYCLOPHILIN28 (CYP28) to wild-type  and transgenic complemented lines, we determined that CYP28 regulates the  assembly and accumulation of PSII-LHCII SCs. Compared to the wild type, cyp28  plants showed accelerated leaf growth, earlier flowering time, and enhanced  accumulation of high molecular weight PSII-LHCII SCs under normal light  conditions. The lack of CYP28 also significantly affected the electron transport  rate. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed more Lhcb6  and less Lhcb4 in M-LHCII-Lhcb4-Lhcb6 complexes in cyp28 versus wild-type plants.  Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity assays revealed that CYP28  exhibits weak PPIase activity and that its K113 and E187 residues are critical  for this activity. Mutant analysis suggested that CYP28 may regulate PSII-LHCII  SC accumulation by altering the configuration of Lhcb6 via its PPIase activity.  Furthermore, the Lhcb6-P139 residue is critical for PSII-LHCII SC assembly and  accumulation. Therefore, our findings suggest that CYP28 likely regulates  PSII-LHCII SC assembly and accumulation by altering the configuration of P139 of  Lhcb6 via its PPIase activity.', '2022 Apr', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13235', 'Zhong']
