Three species of <i>Phasmarhabditis</i> were recovered from 75 nurseries and garden centers in 28 counties in California during fall and winter 2012-2021. A total of 18 mollusk species were recovered, most of them invasive. Nematodes were identified by sequencing the D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit (LSU or 28S) rRNA. Based on these surveys, <i>P. californica</i> was the most widespread species (37 isolates, 53.6% recovery); followed by <i>P. hermaphrodita</i> (26 isolates; 37.7% recovery); <i>P. papillosa</i> and a closely related <i>P. papillosa</i> isolate (6 isolates; 8.7% recovery). Nematode isolates were mainly collected from four invasive slugs (<i>Deroceras reticulatum</i>, <i>D. laeve</i>, <i>Arion hortensis</i> agg, <i>Ambigolimax valentianus</i>) and snails (<i>Oxychilus</i> spp. and <i>Discus</i> spp.). Results suggest that <i>P. californica</i> and <i>P. hermaphrodita</i> share an ecological niche in Northern, Central, Coastal, and Southern California, north of Los Angeles County.
