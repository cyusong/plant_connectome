Promoting crop growth and regulating denitrification process are two main ways to reduce soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in agricultural systems. However, how biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can regulate crop growth and denitrification in soils with different phosphorus (P) supplies to influence N<sub>2</sub>O emission remains largely unknown. Here, an eight-week greenhouse and one-year field experiments biochar and/or AMF (only in greenhouse experiment) additions under low and high P environments were conducted to characterize the effects on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth and N<sub>2</sub>O emission. With low P supply, AMF addition decreased leaf Mn concentration (indicates carboxylate-releasing P-acquisition strategies), whereas biochar addition increased leaf Mn concentration, suggesting biochar and AMF addition regulated root morphological and physiological traits to capture P. Compared with low P supply, the high P significantly promoted wheat growth (by 16-34%), nutrient content (by 33-218%) and yield (by 33-41%), but suppressed soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (by 32-95%). Biochar and/or AMF addition exhibited either no or negative effects on wheat biomass and nutrient content in greenhouse, and biochar addition promoted wheat yield only under high P environment in field. However, biochar and/or AMF addition decreased soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by 24-93% and 32% in greenhouse and field experiments, respectively. This decrease was associated mainly with the diminished abundance of N<sub>2</sub>O-producing denitrifiers (nirK and nirS types, by 17-59%, respectively) and the increased abundance of N<sub>2</sub>O-consuming denitrifiers (nosZ type, by 35-65%), and also with the increased wheat nutrient content, yield and leaf Mn concentration. These findings suggest that strengthening the plant-soil-microbe interactions can mitigate soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions via manipulating plant nutrient acquisition and soil denitrification.
