Latitudinal clines in circadian rhythms have consistently been described in various plant species, with the most recent examples appearing in soybean cultivars and in monkey flower natural populations. These latitudinal clines provide evidence that natural variation in circadian rhythms is adaptive, but it is still unclear what adaptive benefits this variation confers, particularly because circadian rhythms are not usually measured in day/night conditions that reflect those experienced by organisms in nature. Here, we report that daily rhythms of GIGANTEA expression respond to day length in a way that depends on the latitude of origin of Arabidopsis accessions. We additionally extend previous findings by confirming that natural variation in GI expression affects growth related traits, and alters the expression of different target genes. The results support the idea that natural variation in daily rhythms of expression have broad effects on plant development and are of potential adaptive value.
