In plants, the key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis is 1-aminocyclopropane-1 carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS), which catalyzes <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to ACC, the precursor of ethylene. Ethylene binds to its receptors, such as ethylene response 1 (ETR1), to switch on ethylene signal transduction. To understand the function of <i>ACS</i> and <i>ETR1</i> in orchids, <i>Oncidium ACC synthase 12</i> (<i>OnACS12</i>) and <i>Oncidium ETR1</i> (<i>OnETR1</i>) from <i>Oncidium</i> Gower Ramsey were functionally analyzed in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. 35S::<i>OnACS12</i> caused late flowering and anther indehiscence phenotypes due to its effect on GA-DELLA signaling pathways. 35S::<i>OnACS12</i> repressed GA biosynthesis genes (<i>CPS</i>, <i>KS</i>, and <i>GA3ox1</i>), which caused the upregulation of DELLA [<i>GA-INSENSITIVE</i> (<i>GAI</i>), <i>RGA-LIKE1</i> (<i>RGL1</i>), and <i>RGL2</i>] expression. The increase in DELLAs not only suppressed <i>LEAFY</i> (<i>LFY</i>) expression and caused late flowering but also repressed the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis gene <i>DAD1</i> and caused anther indehiscence by downregulating the endothecium-thickening-related genes <i>MYB26</i>, <i>NST1</i>, and <i>NST2</i>. The ectopic expression of an <i>OnETR1</i> dominant-negative mutation (<i>OnETR1-C65Y</i>) caused both ethylene and JA insensitivity in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. 35S::<i>OnETR1-C65Y</i> delayed flower/leaf senescence by suppressing downstream genes in ethylene signaling, including <i>EDF1-4</i> and <i>ERF1</i>, and in JA signaling, including <i>MYC2</i> and <i>WRKY33</i>. JA signaling repression also resulted in indehiscent anthers <i>via</i> the downregulation of <i>MYB26</i>, <i>NST1</i>, <i>NST2</i>, and <i>MYB85</i>. These results not only provide new insight into the functions of <i>ACS</i> and <i>ETR1</i> orthologs but also uncover their functional interactions with other hormone signaling pathways, such as GA-DELLA and JA, in plants.
