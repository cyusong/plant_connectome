<i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are an important plant-growth-promoting fungi. <i>Trichoderma citrinoviride</i> HT-1 was isolated from <i>Rheum palmatum</i> root, which has beneficial effects on growth and metabolite accumulation. However, the improvement mechanisms for growth and metabolite accumulation of <i>T. citrinoviride</i> HT-1 are unclear. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to measure the effect of different concentrations of conidial suspension of the HT-1 strain on the growth promotion and metabolite accumulation of <i>R. palmatum</i> seedlings. The results showed that the highest biomass and metabolites of <i>R. palmatum</i> seedlings were obtained through treatment with the HT-1 strain at a final spore concentration of 10<sup>7</sup> spores/mL. RNA sequencing indicated that 1662 genes were upregulated and 2155 genes were downregulated after inoculation with 10<sup>7</sup> spores/mL of the HT-1 strain. This strain induced significant upregulation of related genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, plant hormone signal transduction pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathway, and plant-pathogen interaction pathway in <i>R. palmatum</i>. The gene expression trends were revealed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and were consistent with those determined by RNA-seq. Our results will help us to understand the growth-promoting mechanisms of the HT-1 strain on <i>R. palmatum</i> and provide a theoretical basis for the application of <i>T. citrinoviride</i> HT-1 as a biological fertilizer.
