['12969423', "d-Apiose is a plant-specific branched-chain monosaccharide found in  rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), apiogalacturonan, and several apioglycosides.  Within RG-II, d-apiose serves as the binding site for borate, which leads to the  formation of cross-links within the wall. Biochemical studies in duckweed and  parsley have established that uridine 5'-diphospho-d-apiose (UDP-d-apiose) is  formed from UDP-d-glucuronate by decarboxylation and re-arrangement of the carbon  skeleton, leading to ring contraction and branch formation. The enzyme catalyzing  this reaction also forms UDP-d-xylose by decarboxylation of UDP-d-glucuronate,  and has therefore been named UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase. Using a  bioinformatics approach, we identified a candidate gene (AXS1) for this enzyme in  Arabidopsis and functionally expressed its cDNA in Escherichia coli. The  recombinant enzyme catalyzed the conversion of UDP-d-glucuronate to a mixture of  UDP-d-apiose and UDP-d-xylose with a turnover number of 0.3 min-1. AXS1 required  NAD+ for enzymatic activity, and was strongly inhibited by UDP-d-galacturonate.  It was highly expressed in all plant organs consistent with a function in  synthesizing an essential cell wall precursor. Database searches indicated the  presence of closely related sequences in a variety of crop plants. The cloning of  the AXS1 gene will help to investigate the biosynthesis of RG-II, and permit  insights into the mechanism by which d-apiose and other branched monosaccharides  are formed.", '2003 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01841.x', 'Reiter']
