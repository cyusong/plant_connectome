['11439135', "The Arabidopsis thaliana PROTODERMAL FACTOR1 (PDF1) gene encoding a putative  extracellular proline-rich protein is exclusively expressed in the L1 layer of  shoot apices and the protoderm of organ primordia. In order to identify essential  cis-regulatory sequences required for the L1 layer-specific expression, a series  of 5' deletions of the PDF1 promoter were fused to the beta-glucronidase (GUS)  gene and introduced into Arabidopsis plants. Our analysis revealed that the  minimum region necessary to confer L1-specific expression of PDF1 is confined  within a 260-bp fragment upstream of the transcription start site. We identified  an 8-bp motif in this region that is conserved between promoter regions of all  the L1-specific genes so far cloned, and we designated it the L1 box.  Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the L1-specific  homeodomain protein ATML1 can bind to the L1 box sequence in vitro. The GUS  expression in transgenic plants disappeared when a mutation that abolishes  binding of ATML1 was introduced into the PDF1 l1 box sequence of the construct.  These results suggest that the L1 box plays a crucial role in the regulation of  PDF1 expression in L1 cells and that ATML1 could cooperate to drive L1-specific  expression.", '2001 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01047.x', 'Komeda']
