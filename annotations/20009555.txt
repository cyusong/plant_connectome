Rab GTPases like Ras-related monomeric GTPases are well known to regulate intracellular vesicle trafficking by cycling between membrane-bound and cytosolic states. The functions of these proteins are controlled by upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Ypt/Rabs transmit signals to downstream effectors in a GTP-dependent manner. GDP-bound Rab proteins are extracted from their target membrane by cytosolic proteins known as GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), and the Rab GTPase is recruited to the membrane compartment following dissociation from the GDI by GDI displacement factor (GDF). Now, we're going to discuss the role of plant PRA concerted with Rab and GDI proteins by recycling Rab between membrane and cytosol for intracellular trafficking of cargo proteins.

Rab: !regulated by! upstream regulators
Ypt/Rabs: !transmit signals to! downstream effectors
GDP-bound Rab: !extracted from! target membrane
GDI: !dissociates! Rab GTPase
GDF: !recruits! Rab GTPase
PRA: !recycles! Rab between membrane and cytosol
