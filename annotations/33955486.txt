Both inter- and intra-specific diversity has been described for trichome patterning in fruits, which is presumably involved in plant adaptation. However, the mechanisms underlying this developmental trait have been hardly addressed. Here we examined natural populations of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that develop trichomes in fruits and pedicels, phenotypes previously not reported in the Arabidopsis genus. Genetic analyses identified five loci, MALAMBRUNO 1-5 (MAU1-5), with MAU2, MAU3, and MAU5 showing strong epistatic interactions that are necessary and sufficient to display these traits. Functional characterization of these three loci revealed cis-regulatory mutations in TRICHOMELESS1 and TRIPTYCHON, as well as a structural mutation in GLABRA1. Therefore, the multiple mechanisms controlled by three MYB transcription factors of the core regulatory network for trichome patterning have jointly been modulated to trigger trichome development in fruits. Furthermore, analyses of worldwide accessions showed that these traits and mutations only occur in a highly differentiated relict lineage from the Iberian Peninsula. In addition, these traits and alleles were associated with low spring precipitation, which suggests that trichome development in fruits and pedicels might be involved in climatic adaptation. Thus, we show that the combination of synergistic mutations in a gene regulatory circuit has driven evolutionary innovations in fruit trichome patterning in Arabidopsis.
