Plant cells can be distinguished from animal cells by their cell walls and high-turgor pressure. Although changes in turgor and the stiffness of cell walls seem coordinated, we know little about the mechanism responsible for coordination. Evidence has accumulated that plants, like yeast, have a dedicated cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism. It monitors the functional integrity of the wall and maintains integrity through adaptive responses induced by cell wall damage arising during growth, development, and interactions with the environment. These adaptive responses include osmosensitive induction of phytohormone production, defense responses, as well as changes in cell wall composition and structure. Here, we investigate how the cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism coordinates changes in cell wall stiffness and turgor in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> We show that the production of abscisic acid (ABA), the phytohormone-modulating turgor pressure, and responses to drought depend on the presence of a functional cell wall. We find that the cell wall integrity sensor THESEUS1 modulates mechanical properties of walls, turgor loss point, ABA biosynthesis, and ABA-controlled processes. We identify RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 12 as a component of cell wall integrity maintenance-controlling, cell wall damage-induced jasmonic acid (JA) production. We propose that THE1 is responsible for coordinating changes in turgor pressure and cell wall stiffness.
