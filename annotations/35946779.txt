Programmed cell death (PCD) is integral to plant life and required for stress responses, immunity, and development. Our understanding of the regulation of PCD is incomplete, especially concerning regulators involved in multiple divergent processes. The botrytis-susceptible (bos1) mutant of Arabidopsis is highly susceptible to fungal infection by Botrytis cinerea (Botrytis). BOS1 (also known as MYB108) regulates cell death propagation during plant responses to wounding. The bos1-1 allele contains a T-DNA insertion in the 5'-untranslated region upstream of the start codon. This insertion results in elevated expression of BOS1/MYB108. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system (CRISPR/Cas9) to create new bos1 alleles with disrupted exons, and found that these lines lacked the typical bos1-1 wounding and Botrytis phenotypes. They did exhibit reduced fertility, as was previously observed in other bos1 alleles. Resequencing of the bos1-1 genome confirmed the presence of a mannopine synthase (MAS) promoter at the T-DNA left border. Expression of the BOS1 gene under control of the MAS promoter in wild-type plants conferred the characteristic phenotypes of bos1-1: Botrytis sensitivity and response to wounding. Multiple overexpression lines demonstrated that BOS1 was involved in regulation of cell death propagation in a dosage-dependent manner. Our data indicate that bos1-1 is a gain-of-function mutant and that BOS1 function in regulation of fertility and Botrytis response can both be understood as misregulated cell death.
