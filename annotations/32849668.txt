Interspecies interactions play a key role in soil-borne disease suppression in intercropping systems. However, there are limited data on the underlying mechanisms of soil-borne <i>Phytophthora</i> disease suppression. Here, a field experiment confirmed the effects of maize and soybean intercropping on <i>Phytophthora</i> blight of soybean caused by <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>. Experimentally, the roots and root exudates of maize were found to attract <i>P. sojae</i> zoospores and inhibit their motility and the germination of cystospores. Furthermore, five phenolic acids (<i>p</i>-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid) that were consistently identified in the root exudates and rhizosphere soil of maize were found to interfere with the infection behavior of <i>P. sojae</i>. Among them, cinnamic acid was associated with significant chemotaxis in zoospores, and <i>p</i>-coumaric acid and cinnamic acid showed strong antimicrobial activity against <i>P. sojae</i>. However, in the rhizosphere soil of soybean, only <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic acid, low concentrations of vanillic acid, and ferulic acid were identified. Importantly, the coexistence of five phenolic acids in the maize rhizosphere compared with three phenolic acids in the soybean rhizosphere showed strong synergistic antimicrobial activity against the infection behavior of <i>P. sojae</i>. In summary, the types and concentrations of phenolic acids in maize and soybean rhizosphere soils were found to be crucial factors for <i>Phytophthora</i> disease suppression in this intercropping system.
