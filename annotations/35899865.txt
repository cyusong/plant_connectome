Plant metabolomics has been used widely in plant physiology, in particular to analyse metabolic responses to environmental parameters. Derivatization (via trimethylsilylation and methoximation) followed by GC-MS metabolic profiling is a major technique to quantify low molecular weight, common metabolites of primary carbon, sulphur and nitrogen metabolism. There are now excellent opportunities for new generation analyses, using high resolution, exact mass GC-MS spectrometers that are progressively becoming relatively cheap. However, exact mass GC-MS analyses for routine metabolic profiling are not common, since there is no dedicated available database. Also, exact mass GC-MS is usually dedicated to structural resolution of targeted secondary metabolites. Here, we present a curated database for exact mass metabolic profiling (made of 336 analytes, 1064 characteristic exact mass fragments) focused on molecules of primary metabolism. We show advantages of exact mass analyses, in particular to resolve isotopic patterns, localise S-containing metabolites, and avoid identification errors when analytes have common nominal mass peaks in their spectrum. We provide a practical example using leaves of different Arabidopsis ecotypes and show how exact mass GC-MS analysis can be applied to plant samples and identify metabolic profiles.
