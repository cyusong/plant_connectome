Sepals play important roles in protecting inner floral organs from various stresses and in guaranteeing timely flower opening. However, the exact role of sepals in coordinating interior and exterior signals remains elusive. In this study, we functionally characterized a heat shock protein gene, Arabidopsis HSP70-16, in flower opening and mild heat stress response, using combined genetics with anatomic, physiological, chemical, and molecular analyses. We showed that HSP70-16 is required for flower opening and mild heat response. Mutation of HSP70-16 led to a significant reduction in seed setting rate under 22°C, which was more severe at 27°C. Mutation of HSP70-16 also caused postgenital fusion at overlapping tips of two lateral sepals, leading to failed flower opening, abnormal floral organ formation, and impaired fertilization and seed setting. Chemical and anatomic analyses confirmed specific chemical and morphological changes of cuticle property in mutant lateral sepals, and qRT-PCR data indicated that expression levels of different sets of cuticle regulatory and biosynthetic genes were altered in mutants grown at both 22°C and 27°C temperatures. This study provides a link between thermal and developmental perception signals and expands the understanding of the roles of sepal in plant development and heat response.
