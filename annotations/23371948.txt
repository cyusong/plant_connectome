['23371948', 'Plant cell walls are comprised largely of the polysaccharides cellulose,  hemicellulose, and pectin, along with  approximately 10% protein and up to 40% lignin. These  wall polymers interact covalently and noncovalently to form the functional cell  wall. Characterized cross-links in the wall include covalent linkages between  wall glycoprotein extensins between rhamnogalacturonan II monomer domains and  between polysaccharides and lignin phenolic residues. Here, we show that two  isoforms of a purified Arabidopsis thaliana arabinogalactan protein (AGP) encoded  by hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family protein gene At3g45230 are covalently  attached to wall matrix hemicellulosic and pectic polysaccharides, with  rhamnogalacturonan I (RG I)/homogalacturonan linked to the rhamnosyl residue in  the arabinogalactan (AG) of the AGP and with arabinoxylan attached to either a  rhamnosyl residue in the RG I domain or directly to an arabinosyl residue in the  AG glycan domain. The existence of this wall structure, named ARABINOXYLAN PECTIN  ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN1 (APAP1), is contrary to prevailing cell wall models that  depict separate protein, pectin, and hemicellulose polysaccharide networks. The  modified sugar composition and increased extractability of pectin and xylan  immunoreactive epitopes in apap1 mutant aerial biomass support a role for the  APAP1 proteoglycan in plant wall architecture and function.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.107334', 'Mohnen']
