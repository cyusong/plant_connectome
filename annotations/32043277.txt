VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2), an angiosperm-specific subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub> )-regulated target of the PCO branch of the PRT6 N-degron pathway of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. How this post-translational regulation coordinates VRN2 activity remains to be fully established. Here we use Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, mutants and transgenic lines to determine how control of VRN2 stability contributes to its functions during plant development. VRN2 localizes to endogenous hypoxic regions in aerial and root tissues. In the shoot apex, VRN2 differentially modulates flowering time dependent on photoperiod, whilst its presence in lateral root primordia and the root apical meristem negatively regulates root system architecture. Ectopic accumulation of VRN2 does not enhance its effects on flowering, but does potentiate its repressive effects on root growth. In late-flowering vernalization-dependent ecotypes, VRN2 is only active outside meristems when its proteolysis is inhibited in response to cold exposure, as its function requires concomitant cold-triggered increases in other PRC2 subunits and cofactors. We conclude that the O<sub>2</sub> -sensitive N-degron of VRN2 has a dual function, confining VRN2 to meristems and primordia, where it has specific developmental roles, whilst also permitting broad accumulation outside of meristems in response to environmental cues, leading to other functions.
