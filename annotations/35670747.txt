Three MAPK cascade components in Arabidopsis, YDA (MAPKKK4) and MAPKKK3/5, function redundantly in multiple developmental processes and immunity and regulate floral organ abscission.

YDA: !functions redundantly in! multiple developmental processes and immunity
YDA: !regulates! floral organ abscission
MAPKKK3/5: !functions redundantly in! multiple developmental processes and immunity
MAPKKK3/5: !regulates! floral organ abscission
