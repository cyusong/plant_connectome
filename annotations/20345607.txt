['20345607', 'Lysophospholipids are intermediates of phospholipid metabolism resulting from  stress and lysophospholipases detoxify lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). Many  lysophospholipases have been characterized in mammals and bacteria, but few have  been reported from plants. Arabidopsis thaliana lysophospholipase 2 (lysoPL2)  (At1g52760) was identified as a protein interactor of acyl-CoA-binding protein 2  (ACBP2) in yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays. BLASTP  analysis indicated that lysoPL2 showed approximately 35% amino acid identity to  the lysoPL1 family. Co-localization of autofluorescence-tagged lysoPL2 and ACBP2  by confocal microscopy in agroinfiltrated tobacco suggests the plasma membrane as  a site for their subcellular interaction. LysoPL2 mRNA was induced by zinc (Zn)  and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and lysoPL2 knockout mutants showed enhanced  sensitivity to Zn and H(2)O(2) in comparison to wild type. LysoPL2-overexpressing  Arabidopsis was more tolerant to H(2)O(2) and cadmium (Cd) than wild type,  suggesting involvement of lysoPL2 in phospholipid repair following lipid  peroxidation arising from metal-induced stress. Lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH)  contents in ACBP2-overexpressors and lysoPL2-overexpressors after Cd-treatment  were lower than wild type, indicating that ACBP2 and lysoPL2 confer protection  during oxidative stress. A role for lysoPL2 in lysoPC detoxification was  demonstrated when recombinant lysoPL2 was observed to degrade lysoPC in vitro.  Filter-binding assays and Lipidex competition assays showed that (His)(6)-ACBP2  binds lysoPC in vitro. Binding was disrupted in a (His)(6)-ACBP2 derivative  lacking the acyl-CoA-binding domain, confirming that this domain confers lysoPC  binding. These results suggest that ACBP2 can bind both lysoPC and lysoPL2 to  promote the degradation of lysoPC in response to Cd-induced oxidative stress.', '2010 Jun 1', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04209.x', 'Chye']
