DELLA proteins are key negative regulators in the phytohormone gibberellin's (GA) signaling. In addition to this role, the DELLA proteins upregulate the gene expression levels of the positive regulators in GA signaling, such as GA 20-oxidase, GA receptor, and a transcriptional regulator, SCARECROW-LIKE3 (SCL3), which enables the regulation of GA feedback. Since DELLAs lack a known DNA binding domain, other transcription factor(s) that recruit DELLAs to DNA are essential for this regulation. Recently, we showed that the INDETERMINATE DOMAIN family proteins serve as transcriptional scaffolds to exert the transactivation activity of DELLAs. This finding and further analyses regarding the function of SCL3 indicate that the balance of the DELLAs and SCL3 protein levels (both are GRAS proteins) regulates downstream gene expression through IDDs binding to DNA. Here, we review the regulatory system in plants similar to ours and also discuss the interactive network between GRAS and IDD proteins.
