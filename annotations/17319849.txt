['17319849', 'Arabidopsis WAVE-DAMPENED 2 (WVD2) was identified by forward genetics as an  activation-tagged allele that causes plant and organ stockiness and inversion of  helical root growth handedness on agar surfaces. Plants with high constitutive  expression of WVD2 or other members of the WVD2-LIKE (WDL) gene family have stems  and roots that are short and thick, have reduced anisotropic cell elongation, are  suppressed in a root-waving phenotype, and have inverted handedness of twisting  in hypocotyls and roots compared with wild-type. The wvd2-1 mutant shows  aberrantly organized cortical microtubules in peripheral root cap cells as well  as reduced branching of trichomes, unicellular leaf structures whose development  is regulated by microtubule stability. Orthologs of the WVD2/WDL family are found  widely throughout the plant kingdom, but are not similar to non-plant proteins  with the exception of a C-terminal domain distantly related to the vertebrate  microtubule-associated protein TPX2. in vivo, WVD2 and its closest paralog WDL1  are localized to interphase cortical microtubules in leaves, hypocotyls and  roots. Recombinant glutathione-S-transferase:WVD2 or maltose binding protein:WVD2  protein bind to and bundle microtubules in vitro. We speculate that a C-terminal  domain of TPX2 has been utilised by the WVD2 family for functions critical to the  organization of plant microtubules.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.03015.x', 'Masson']
