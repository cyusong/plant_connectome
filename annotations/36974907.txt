Pollen germination is a process of polarity establishment, through which a single and unique growth axis is established. Although most of the intracellular activities associated with pollen germination are controlled by RHO OF PLANTs (ROPs) and increased ROP activation accompanies pollen germination, a critical role of ROPs in this process has not yet been demonstrated. Here, by genomic editing of all four Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ROPs that are preferentially expressed in pollen, we showed that ROPs are essential for polarity establishment during pollen germination. We further identified and characterized two ROP effectors in pollen germination (REGs) through genome-wide interactor screening, Boundary of ROP domain (BDR) members BDR8 and BDR9, whose functional loss also resulted in no pollen germination. BDR8 and BDR9 were distributed in the cytosol and the vegetative nucleus of mature pollen grains but re-distributed to the plasma membrane (PM) of the germination site and to the apical PM of growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the PM re-distribution of BDR8 and BDR9 during pollen germination relies on ROPs but not vice versa. Furthermore, enhanced expression of BDR8 partially restored germination of rop1 pollen but had no effects on that of the quadruple rop pollen, supporting their genetic epistasis. Results presented here demonstrate an ROP signaling route essential for pollen germination, which supports evolutionarily conserved roles of Rho GTPases in polarity establishment.
