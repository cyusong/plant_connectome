Plant homeodomain (PHD) transcription factors (TFs) are a class of proteins with conserved Cys4-His-Cys3 domains that play important roles in plant growth and development and in response to abiotic stresses. Although characterization of <i>PHDs</i> has been performed in plants, little is known about their function in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.), especially under stress conditions. In the present study, 244 TaPHDs were identified in wheat using comparative genomics. We renamed them <i>TaPHD1-244</i> based on their chromosomal distribution, and almost all PHD proteins were predicted to be located in the nucleus. According to the unrooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, gene structure, and motif analyses, <i>PHD</i> genes were divided into four clades. A total of 149 <i>TaPHD</i> genes were assigned to arise from duplication events. Furthermore, 230 gene pairs came from wheat itself, and 119, 186, 168, 7, 2, and 6 gene pairs came from six other species (<i>Hordeum vulgareto, Zea mays</i>, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Brassica rapa</i>, and <i>Gossypium raimondii</i>, respectively). A total of 548 interacting protein branches were identified to be involved in the protein interaction network. Tissue-specific expression pattern analysis showed that <i>TaPHDs</i> were highly expressed in the stigma and ovary during flowering, suggesting that the <i>TaPHD</i> gene plays an active role in the reproductive growth of wheat. In addition, the qRT-PCR results further confirmed that these <i>TaPHD</i> genes are involved in the abiotic stress response of wheat. In conclusion, our study provides a theoretical basis for deciphering the molecular functions of <i>TaPHDs</i>, particularly in response to abiotic stress.
