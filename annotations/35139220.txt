['35139220', "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located ATP/ADP-antiporter (ER-ANT1) occurs  specifically in vascular plants. Structurally different transporters mediate  energy provision to the ER, but the cellular function of ER-ANT1 is still  unknown. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants lacking ER-ANT1 (er-ant1  plants) exhibit a photorespiratory phenotype accompanied by high glycine levels  and stunted growth, pointing to an inhibition of glycine decarboxylase (GDC). To  reveal whether it is possible to suppress this marked phenotype, we exploited the  power of a forward genetic screen. Absence of a so far uncharacterized member of  the HaloAcid Dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase family strongly suppressed the  dwarf phenotype of er-ant1 plants. Localization studies suggested that the  corresponding protein locates to chloroplasts, and activity assays showed that  the enzyme dephosphorylates, with high substrate affinity, the B6 vitamer  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Additional physiological experiments identified  imbalances in vitamin B6 homeostasis in er-ant1 mutants. Our data suggest that  impaired chloroplast metabolism, but not decreased GDC activity, causes the  er-ant1 mutant dwarf phenotype. We present a hypothesis, setting transport of PLP  by ER-ANT1 and chloroplastic PLP dephosphorylation in the cellular context. With  the identification of this HAD-type PLP phosphatase, we also provide insight into  B6 vitamer homeostasis.", '2022 May 3', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiac048', 'ORCID:']
