['27676245', 'The aim of this work is to gain insight into the six members of the a1 subfamily  of the beta-galactosidases (BGAL) from Arabidopsis thaliana. First, the subcellular  location of all these six BGAL proteins from a1 subfamily has been established in  the cell wall by the construction of transgenic plants producing the enhanced  green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fused to the BGAL proteins. BGAL12 is also  located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our study of the AtBGAL transcript  accumulation along plant development indicated that all AtBGAL transcript  appeared in initial stages of development, both dark- and light-grown seedlings,  being AtBGAL1, AtBGAL2 and AtBGAL3 transcripts the predominant ones in the latter  condition, mainly in the aerial part and with levels decreasing with age. The  high accumulation of transcript of AtBGAL4 in basal internodes and in leaves at  the end of development, and their strong increase after treatment both with BL  and H(3)BO(3) point to an involvement of BGAL4 in cell wall changes leading to  the cease of elongation and increased rigidity. The changes of AtBGAL transcript  accumulation in relation to different stages and conditions of plant development,  suggest that each of the different gene products have a plant-specific function  and provides support for the proposed function of the subfamily a1 BGAL in plant  cell wall remodelling for cell expansion or for cell response to stress  conditions.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.09.016', 'Dopico']
