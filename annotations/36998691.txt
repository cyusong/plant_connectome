As important components of the two-component regulatory system, response regulatory proteins (RRPs) play a crucial role in histidine phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction in response to environmental fluctuations. Accumulating evidence has revealed that RRPs play important roles in plant growth and stress response. However, the specific functions of <i>RR</i> genes (<i>RRs</i>) in cultivated alfalfa remain ambiguous. Therefore, in this study, we identified and characterized the <i>RR</i> family genes in the alfalfa genome using bioinformatics methods. Our analysis revealed 37 <i>RRs</i> in the alfalfa genome of Zhongmu No.1 that were unevenly distributed on the chromosomes. Cis-elements analysis revealed the involvement of <i>RRs</i> in responses to light, stress, and various plant hormones. Expression analysis of <i>RRs</i> in different tissues revealed their distinct tissue expression patterns. These findings provide preliminary insights into the roles of <i>RRs</i> in plant responses to abiotic stress, which can be used to improve the stress tolerance of autotetraploid-cultivated alfalfa plants <i>via</i> genetic engineering.
