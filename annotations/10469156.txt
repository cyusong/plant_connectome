['10469156', 'The gene and cDNA of an Arabidopsis thaliana cytidine deaminase (CDA) were cloned  and sequenced. The gene, At-cda1, is located on chromosome 2 and is expressed in  all plant tissues tested, although with quantitative differences. Expression  analysis suggest that At-cda1 probably codes for the housekeeping cytidine  deaminase of Arabidopsis. The gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli  and the protein, At-CDA1, shows similar enzymatic and substrate specificities as  conventional cytidine deaminases: it deaminates cytidine and deoxycytidine and is  competitively inhibited by cytosine-containing compounds. Because the protein  shows no affinity to RNA, it is not likely to be involved in RNA-editing by  C-to-U deamination. When compared to cytidine deaminases from other organisms, it  becomes clear that At-CDA1 is related, both in sequence and structure, to the CDA  of E. coli and other gram-negative bacteria. The eubacterial nature of the  Arabidopsis CDA suggests that it is an additional example of a plant gene of  endosymbiotic origin.', '1999 Aug', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00591.x', 'Gualberto']
