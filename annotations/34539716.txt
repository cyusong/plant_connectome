The fourth agricultural revolution is leading us into a time of using data science as a tool to implement precision viticulture. Infrared spectroscopy provides the means for rapid and large-scale data collection to achieve this goal. The non-invasive applications of infrared spectroscopy in grapevines are still in its infancy, but recent studies have reported its feasibility. This review examines near infrared and mid infrared spectroscopy for the qualitative and quantitative investigation of intact grapevine organs. Qualitative applications, with the focus on using spectral data for categorization purposes, is discussed. The quantitative applications discussed in this review focuses on the methods associated with carbohydrates, nitrogen, and amino acids, using both invasive and non-invasive means of sample measurement. Few studies have investigated the use of infrared spectroscopy for the direct measurement of intact, fresh, and unfrozen grapevine organs such as berries or leaves, and these studies are examined in depth. The chemometric procedures associated with qualitative and quantitative infrared techniques are discussed, followed by the critical evaluation of the future prospects that could be expected in the field.
