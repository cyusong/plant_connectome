A reduction in pod shattering is one of the main components of grain legume domestication. Despite this, many domesticated legumes suffer serious yield losses due to shattering, particularly under arid conditions. Mutations related to pod shattering modify the twisting force of pod walls or the structural strength of the dehiscence zone in pod sutures. At a molecular level, a growing body of evidence indicates that these changes are controlled by a relatively small number of key genes that have been selected in parallel across grain legume species, supporting partial molecular convergence. Legume homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana silique shattering genes play only minor roles in legume pod shattering. Most domesticated grain legume species contain multiple shattering-resistance genes, with mutants of each gene typically showing only partial shattering resistance. Hence, crosses between varieties with different genes lead to transgressive segregation of shattering alleles, producing plants with either enhanced shattering resistance or atavistic susceptibility to the trait. The frequency of these resistance pod-shattering alleles is often positively correlated with environmental aridity. The continued development of pod-shattering-related functional information will be vital for breeding crops that are suited to the increasingly arid conditions expected in the coming decades.
