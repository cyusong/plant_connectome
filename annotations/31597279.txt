Autophagy, a conserved pathway in eukaryotes, degrades and recycles cellular components, thus playing an important role in nitrogen (N) remobilization. N plays an important role in the growth and development of plants, which also affects plant yield and quality. In this research, it was found that the transcriptional level of a core autophagy gene of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsATG8c</i>, was increased during N starvation conditions. It was found that the overexpression of <i>OsATG8c</i> significantly enhanced the activity of autophagy and that the number of autophagosomes, dwarfed the plant height and increased the effective tillers' number and yield. The nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) significantly increased in the transgenic rice under both optimal and suboptimal N conditions. Based on our results, <i>OsATG8c</i> is considered to be a good candidate gene for increasing NUE, especially under suboptimal field conditions.
