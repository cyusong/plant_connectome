Membrane proteins are involved in many different functions depending on their location in the cell. Characterization of the membrane proteome can bring new insights to the function of different plant membrane systems and the subcellular compartments where the proteins are found. Plant membrane proteomics can also provide valuable information about plant-specific biological processes. Despite recent advances in the separation and techniques for the analysis of plant membrane proteins, characterization of these proteins, especially the hydrophobic ones, is still challenging. In this review, plant membrane proteomics data, compiled from the literature on Arabidopsis thaliana, are described. In addition, initial attempts towards determining the physiological significance of some proteins identified from membrane proteomics in rice are also described.
