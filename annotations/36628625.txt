The AP2/ERF family is an important class of transcription factors involved in plant growth and various biological processes. One of the AP2/ERF transcription factors, RAP2.6L, participates in various stresses responses. However, the function of RAP2.6L is largely unknown in apples (Malus domestica). In this study, an apple gene homologous to Arabidopsis AtRAP2.6L, MdERF113, was analyzed by bioinformatic characterization, gene expression analysis and subcellular localization assessment. MdERF113 was highly expressed in the sarcocarp and was responsive to hormonal signals and abiotic stresses. MdERF113-overexpression apple calli were less sensitive to low temperature, drought, salinity, and abscisic acid than wild-type. Subcellular localization revealed that MdERF113 was a nuclear-localized transcription factor, and yeast experiments confirmed that MdERF113 has no autonomous activation activity. Overall, this study indicated that MdERF113 plays a role in regulating plant growth under abiotic conditions.
