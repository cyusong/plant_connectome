Selective elimination of selfed embryos, or inbreeding depression, is shared among many members of the Pinaceae but it has not been fully characterized at the phenotypic level. Here, two death pattern model hypotheses are tested using 10 621 Pinus taeda embryos sampled in two cohorts. Cones from a single pedigree based on selfed, outbred, parent-offspring and offspring-parent matings were destructively sampled weekly before, during and after fertilization. Selfed embryo deaths adhered to two patterns over the course of development: death was linear with respect to days from fertilization; and a stage-specific death peak occurred during the early embryogeny stage. This death peak occurred from 23 to 36 d after fertilization in the 2004 cohort and from 27 to 34 d after fertilization in the 2006 cohort. Of those selfed embryos that died, 64-83% died at stages where a single dominant embryo was elongating inside the female gametophyte. Additional genetic models are needed to account for the stage-specific death component of selfed P. taeda embryos.

Pinus taeda: !exhibits! Inbreeding depression 
Selfed embryos: !die in two patterns! Over development 
Death peak: !occurs between! 23-36 days after fertilization 
Death peak: !occurs between! 27-34 days after fertilization 
Selfed embryos: !die at stages! Where single dominant embryo is elongating
