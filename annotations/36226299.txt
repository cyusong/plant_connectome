Thioredoxins (TRXs) are small-molecule proteins with redox activity that play very important roles in the growth, development, and stress resistance of plants. Foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i>) gradually became a model crop for stress resistance research because of its advantages such as its resistance to sterility and its small genome. To date, the thioredoxin (TRX) family has been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, rice and wheat. However, studies of the TRX family in foxtail millet have not been reported, and the biological function of this family remains unclear. In this study, 35 <i>SiTRX</i> genes were identified in the whole genome of foxtail millet through bioinformatic analysis. According to phylogenetic analysis, 35 SiTRXs can be divided into 13 types. The chromosome distribution, gene structure, <i>cis</i>-elements and conserved protein motifs of 35 <i>SiTRXs</i> were characterized. Three nucleoredoxin (NRX) members were further identified by a structural analysis of TRX family members. The expression patterns of foxtail millet's <i>SiNRX</i> members under abiotic stresses showed that they have different stress-response patterns. In addition, subcellular localization revealed that SiNRXs were localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane. Further studies demonstrated that the overexpression of <i>SiNRX1</i> enhanced <i>Arabidopsis'</i> tolerance to drought and salt stresses, resulting in a higher survival rate and better growth performance. Moreover, the expression levels of several known stress-related genes were generally higher in overexpressed lines than in the wild-type. Thus, this study provides a general picture of the TRX family in foxtail millet and lay a foundation for further research on the mechanism of the action of TRX proteins on abiotic stresses.
