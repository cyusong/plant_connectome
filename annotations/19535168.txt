The brassinosteroids (BRs) occur ubiquitously in the plant kingdom. The occurrence of BRs has been demonstrated in almost every part of higher plants, such as pollen, flower buds, fruits, seeds, vascular cambium, leaves, shoots and roots. In this study, BRs were isolated and identified in the culture of wild-type Chlorella vulgaris. Seven BRs, including teasterone, typhasterol, 6-deoxoteasterone, 6-deoxotyphasterol, 6-deoxocastasterone, castasterone and brassinolide, were identified by GC-MS. All compounds belong to the BR biosynthetic pathway. The results suggest that early and late C6 oxidation pathways are operating in C. vulgaris. This study represents the first isolation of BRs from C. vulgaris cultures.
