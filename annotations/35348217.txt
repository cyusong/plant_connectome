Anthocyanins are visual cues for pollination and seed dispersal. Fruit containing anthocyanins also appeals to consumers due to its appearance and health benefits. In kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) studies have identified at least two MYB activators of anthocyanin, but their functions in fruit and the mechanisms by which they act are not fully understood. Here, transcriptome and small RNA high-throughput sequencing were used to comprehensively identify contributors to anthocyanin accumulation in kiwifruit. Stable overexpression in vines showed that both 35S::MYB10 and MYB110 can upregulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in Actinidia chinensis fruit, and that MYB10 overexpression resulted in anthocyanin accumulation which was limited to the inner pericarp, suggesting that repressive mechanisms underlie anthocyanin biosynthesis in this species. Furthermore, motifs in the C-terminal region of MYB10/110 were shown to be responsible for the strength of activation of the anthocyanic response. Transient assays showed that both MYB10 and MYB110 were not directly cleaved by miRNAs, but that miR828 and its phased small RNA AcTAS4-D4(-) efficiently targeted MYB110. Other miRNAs were identified, which were differentially expressed between the inner and outer pericarp, and cleavage of SPL13, ARF16, SCL6 and F-box1, all of which are repressors of MYB10, was observed. We conclude that it is the differential expression and subsequent repression of MYB activators that is responsible for variation in anthocyanin accumulation in kiwifruit species.
