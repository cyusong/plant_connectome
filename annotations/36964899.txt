Grain chalkiness is an important index of rice appearance quality and is negatively associated with rice processing and eating qualities. However, the genetic mechanism underlying chalkiness formation is largely unknown. To identify the genetic basis of chalkiness, 410 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two representative indica rice varieties, Shuhui498 (R498) and Yihui3551 (R3551), were used to discover quantitative trait loci (QTL). The two parental lines and RILs were grown in three locations in China under three controlled fertilizer application level. Analyses indicated that chalkiness was significantly affected by genotype, the environment, and the interaction between the two, and that heritability was high. Several QTLs were isolated, including the two stable QTLs, i.e., qCGP6 and qCGP8. Fine mapping and candidate gene verification of qCGP6 showed that Wx may play a key role in chalkiness formation. Chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSLs) and near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying the Wxa or Wxin allele produced more chalky grain than the R498 parent. A similar result was also observed in the 3611 background. Notably, the effect of the Wx genotype on rice chalkiness was shown to be dependent on environmental conditions and Wx alleles exhibited different sensitivities to shading treatment. Using CRISPR/Cas9, the Wxa promoter region was successfully edited, down-regulating Wx alleviates chalkiness formation in NILR498-Wxa. This study developed a new strategy for synergistic improvement of eating and appearance qualities in rice, and created a novel Wx allele with great potential in breeding applications.
