Raspberries are highly nutritious and have powerful antioxidant properties, making them functional berries with positive effects on physiological functioning. However, there is limited information available on the diversity and variability of metabolites in raspberry and its parts, especially in plateau raspberries. To address this, commercial raspberries and their pulp and seeds from two plateaus in China were subjected to LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics analysis and evaluated for antioxidant activity using four assays. A metabolite-metabolite correlation network was established based on antioxidant activity and correlation analysis. The results showed that 1661 metabolites were identified and classified into 12 categories, with significant variations in composition between the whole berry and its parts from different plateaus. Flavonoids, amino acids and their derivatives, and phenolic acids were found to be up-regulated in Qinghai's raspberry compared to Yunnan's raspberry. The main differently regulated pathways were related to flavonoid, amino acid, and anthocyanin biosynthesis. The antioxidant activity of Qinghai's raspberry was stronger than Yunnan's raspberry, and the order of antioxidant capacity was seed > pulp > berry. The highest FRAP (420.31 µM TE/g DW) values was found in the seed of Qinghai's raspberry. Overall, these findings suggest that the environment in which the berries grow can affect their chemical composition, and comprehensive exploitation and cultivation of whole raspberry and its parts from different plateaus can lead to new opportunities for phytochemical compositions and antioxidant activity.
