['17572409', 'The eukaryotic N-end rule pathway mediates ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent  turnover of proteins with a bulky amino-terminal residue. Arabidopsis locus  At5g02310 shows significant similarity to the yeast N-end rule ligase Ubr1. We  demonstrate that At5g02310 is a ubiquitin ligase and mediates degradation of  proteins with amino-terminal Arg residue. Unlike Ubr1, the Arabidopsis protein  does not participate in degradation of proteins with amino-terminal Phe or Leu.  This modified target specificity coincides with characteristic differences in  domain structure. In contrast to previous publications, our data indicate that  At5g02310 is not identical to CER3, a gene involved in establishment of a  protective surface wax layer. At5g02310 has therefore been re-designated  PROTEOLYSIS 6 (PRT6), in accordance with its ubiquitin ligase function.', '2007 Jul 10', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.06.005', 'Bachmair']
