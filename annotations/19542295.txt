['19542295', 'Aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis is highly compartmentalized, requiring  import of 2-keto acids or amino acids into chloroplasts for side chain elongation  and export of the resulting compounds into the cytosol for conversion into  glucosinolate. Aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana is  regulated by three R2R3-MYB transcription factors, the major player being High  Aliphatic Glucosinolate 1 (HAG1/MYB28). Here, we show that BAT5, which belongs to  the putative bile acid transporter family, is the only member of this family that  is transactivated by HAG1/MYB28, HAG2/MYB76, and HAG3/MYB29. Furthermore, two  isopropylmalate isomerases genes, IPMI1 and IPMI2, and the isopropylmalate  dehydrogenase gene, IPMDH1, were identified as targets of HAG1/MYB28 and the  corresponding proteins localized to plastids, suggesting a role in plastidic  chain elongation reactions. The BAT proteins also localized to plastids; however,  only mutants defective in BAT5 function contained strongly reduced levels of  aliphatic glucosinolates. The bat5 mutant chemotype was rescued by induced  overexpression of BAT5. Feeding experiments using 2-keto acids and amino acids of  different chain length suggest that BAT5 is a plastidic transporter of  (chain-elongated) 2-keto acids. Mechanical stimuli and methyl jasmonate  transiently induced BAT5 expression in inflorescences and leaves. Thus, BAT5 was  identified as the first transporter component of the aliphatic glucosinolate  biosynthetic pathway.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.066399', 'Flugge']
