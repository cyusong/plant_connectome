When Zostera marina was irradiated after a period of darkness, initiation of photosynthetic O2 evolution occurred in two phases. During a lag phase, lasting 4 to 5 min, photosynthesis was supported by a diffusive entry of CO2. Photosynthesis then rapidly increased to its full rate. Tris buffer, at a concentration of 50 mm, completely inhibited this increase without affecting CO2-supported photosynthesis during the lag phase. These results verify that the increase in photosynthesis after the lag phase depended on an activation of bicarbonate (HCO3-) utilization through acid zones generated by proton pumps located to the outer cell membrane. In similar experiments, 6.25 microm of the mitochondrial ATPase blocker oligomycin inhibited photosynthetic HCO3(-) utilization by more than 60%. Antimycin A, a selective blocker of mitochondrial electron transport, caused a similar inhibition of HCO3(-) utilization. Measurements at elevated CO2 concentrations verified that neither oligomycin nor antimycin interfered with linear photosynthetic electron transport or with CO2 fixation. Thus, a major part of the ATP used for the generation of acid zones involved in HCO3(-) utilization in Z. marina was derived from mitochondrial respiration.
