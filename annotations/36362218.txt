Effectors are small, secreted molecules that mediate the establishment of interactions in nature. While some concepts of effector biology have stood the test of time, this area of study is ever-evolving as new effectors and associated characteristics are being revealed. In the present review, the different characteristics that underly effector classifications are discussed, contrasting past and present knowledge regarding these molecules to foster a more comprehensive understanding of effectors for the reader. Research gaps in effector identification and perspectives for effector application in plant disease management are also presented, with a focus on fungal effectors in the plant-microbe interaction and interactions beyond the plant host. In summary, the review provides an amenable yet thorough introduction to fungal effector biology, presenting noteworthy examples of effectors and effector studies that have shaped our present understanding of the field.
