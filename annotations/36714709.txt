Members of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-like clade of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) induce flowering by associating with the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor FD and forming regulatory complexes in angiosperm species. However, the molecular mechanism of the FT-FD heterocomplex in Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinensis</i>) is unknown. In this study, we identified 12 <i>BrPEBP</i> genes and focused our functional analysis on four <i>BrFT-like</i> genes by overexpressing them individually in an <i>FT</i> loss-of-function mutant in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We determined that <i>BrFT1</i> and <i>BrFT2</i> promote flowering by upregulating the expression of floral meristem identity genes, whereas <i>BrTSF</i> and <i>BrBFT</i>, although close in sequence to their Arabidopsis counterparts, had no clear effect on flowering in either long- or short-day photoperiods. We also simultaneously genetically inactivated <i>BrFT1</i> and <i>BrFT2</i> in Chinese cabbage using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, which revealed that <i>BrFT1</i> and <i>BrFT2</i> may play key roles in inflorescence organogenesis as well as in the transition to flowering. We show that BrFT-like proteins, except for BrTSF, are functionally divided into FD interactors and non-interactors based on the presence of three specific amino acids in their C termini, as evidenced by the observed interconversion when these amino acids are mutated. Overall, this study reveals that although <i>BrFT-like</i> homologs are conserved, they may have evolved to exert functionally diverse functions in flowering <i>via</i> their potential to be associated with FD or independently from FD in <i>Brassica rapa</i>.
