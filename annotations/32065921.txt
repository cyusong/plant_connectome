Nitrated fatty acids (NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs) are important signaling molecules in mammals. NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs are formed by the addition reaction of nitric oxide- and nitrite-derived nitrogen dioxide with unsaturated fatty acid double bonds. The study of NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs in plant systems constitutes an interesting and emerging area. The presence of NO<sub>2</sub>-FA has been reported in olives, peas, rice and Arabidopsis. To gain a better understanding of the role of NO<sub>2</sub>-FA on plant physiology, we analyzed the effects of exogenous application of nitro-oleic acid (NO<sub>2</sub>-OA). In tomato cell suspensions we found that NO<sub>2</sub>-OA induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a dose-dependent manner via activation of NADPH oxidases, a mechanism that requires calcium entry from the extracellular compartment and protein kinase activation. In tomato and Arabidopsis leaves, NO<sub>2</sub>-OA treatments induced two waves of ROS production, resembling plant defense responses. Arabidopsis NADPH oxidase mutants showed that NADPH isoform D (RBOHD) was required for NO<sub>2</sub>-OA-induced ROS production. In addition, on Arabidopsis isolated epidermis, NO<sub>2</sub>-OA induced stomatal closure via RBOHD and F. Altogether, these results indicate that NO<sub>2</sub>-OA triggers NADPH oxidase activation revealing a new signaling role in plants.
