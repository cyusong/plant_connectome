['11041886', 'An Arabidopsis protein was found to interact specifically with the capsid protein  (CP) of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) through yeast two-hybrid screening. This  protein, designated TIP (for TCV-interacting protein), was found to be a member  of the recently recognized NAC family of proteins. NAC proteins have been  implicated in the regulation of development of plant embryos and flowers. TIP  alone was able to activate expression of reporter genes in yeast if fused to a  DNA binding domain, suggesting that it may be a transcriptional activator. The  TIP binding region in the TCV CP has been mapped to the N-terminal 25 amino  acids. Site-directed mutagenesis within this region revealed that loss of the  TIP-CP interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assay correlated with loss of the  ability of TCV to induce the hypersensitive response and resistance in the  TCV-resistant Arabidopsis ecotype Dijon (Di-0 and its inbred line Di-17). These  data suggest that TIP is an essential component in the TCV resistance response  pathway.', '2000 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.10.1917', 'Morris']
