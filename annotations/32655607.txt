Nitrogen (N) is one of the most required mineral elements for plant growth, and potassium (K) plays a vital role in nitrogen metabolism, both elements being widely applied as fertilizers in agricultural production. However, the exact relationship between K and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) remains unclear. Apple dwarf rootstock seedlings (M9T337) were used to study the impacts of different K levels on plant growth, nitrogen metabolism, and carbon (C) assimilation in water culture experiments for 2 years. The results showed that both deficiency and excess K inhibited the growth and root development of M9T337 seedlings. When the K supply concentration was 0 mM and 12 mM, the biomass of each organ, root-shoot ratio, root activity and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ion flow rate decreased significantly, net photosynthetic rate (<i>P</i> <sub>n</sub>) and photochemical efficiency (<i>F</i> <sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i> <sub>m</sub>) being lower. Meanwhile, seedlings treated with 6 mM K<sup>+</sup> had higher N and C metabolizing enzyme activities and higher nitrate transporter gene expression levels (<i>NRT1.1</i>; <i>NRT2.1</i>). <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N labeling results showed that deficiency and excess K could not only reduce <sup>15</sup>N absorption and <sup>13</sup>C assimilation accumulation of M9T337 seedlings, but also reduced the <sup>15</sup>N distribution ratio in leaves and <sup>13</sup>C distribution ratio in roots. These results suggest that appropriate K supply (6 mM) was optimal as it enhanced photoassimilate transport from leaves to roots and increased NUE by influencing photosynthesis, C and N metabolizing enzyme activities, nitrate assimilation gene activities, and nitrate transport.
