Matrix attachment region-binding filament-like protein 1 (MFP1) is a plant-specific long coiled-coil protein that binds double-stranded DNA. While originally identified as a component of the tobacco nuclear matrix, it was subsequently shown that the majority of MFP1 resides in mature chloroplast where it is located at the stroma side of the thylakoids and is able to bind to nucleoids. On the other hand, a 90 kDa MFP1-like protein from onion has been convincingly shown to be an intrinsic component of the onion meristematic nuclear matrix. Here, we have expanded the analysis of the subcellular location of MFP1 by using high-resolution confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy. Two different antisera raised against MFP1 from two species were used on isolated nuclei and chloroplasts from tomato, tobacco, and Arabidopsis. Our data show that both antibodies detect a signal in both compartments in all three species. An Arabidopsis MFP1 T-DNA insertional mutation abolishes both nuclear and chloroplast signals, indicating that the nuclear and plastidic antigens are derived from the same gene. We therefore suggest that MFP1 is a protein with a dual location, in both nuclei and chloroplasts, consistent with prior findings in onion and the dicot species investigated here.
