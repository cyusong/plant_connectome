Nitrogen (N) deficiency is a main environmental factor that induces early senescence. Cotyledons provide an important N source during germination and early seedling development. In this study, we observed that N deficient condition enhanced gene expression involved in purine catabolism in cotyledons of Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica rapa</i> ssp. <i>Pekinensis</i>). Seedlings grown with added allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase, in the growth medium showed reduced chlorophyll degradation in cotyledons and lower fresh weight, compared with seedlings grown on normal medium. On the basis of these results, we speculated that xanthine-derived metabolites might affect both seedling growth and early senescence in cotyledons. To confirm this, seedlings were grown with exogenous xanthine to analyze the role of xanthine-derived metabolites under N deficient condition. Seedlings with xanthine as the sole N-source grew faster, and more cotyledon chlorophyll was broken down, compared with seedlings grown without xanthine. The expression levels of senescence- and purine metabolism-related genes in cotyledons were higher than those in seedlings grown without xanthine. These results indicate the possibility that xanthine plays a role as an activator in both purine catabolism and chlorophyll degradation in cotyledons under N deficient condition.
