During barley germination, cysteine proteases are essential in the mobilization of storage compounds providing peptides and amino acids to sustain embryo growth until photosynthesis is completely established. Knockdown barley plants, generated by artificial miRNA, for the cathepsins B- and F-like HvPap-19 and HvPap-1 genes, respectively, showed less cysteine protease activities and consequently lower protein degradation. The functional redundancy between proteases triggered an enzymatic compensation associated with an increase in serine protease activities in both knockdown lines, which was not sufficient to maintain germination rates and behaviour. Concomitantly, these transgenic lines showed alterations in the accumulation of protein and carbohydrates in the grain. While the total amount of protein increased in both transgenic lines, the starch content decreased in HvPap-1 knockdown lines and the sucrose concentration was reduced in silenced HvPap-19 grains. Consequently, phenotypes of HvPap-1 and HvPap-19 artificial miRNA lines showed a delay in the grain germination process. These data demonstrate the potential of exploring the properties of barley proteases for selective modification and use in brewing or in the livestock feeding industry.
