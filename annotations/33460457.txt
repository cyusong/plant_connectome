Sorgoleone, a hydrophobic compound exuded from root hair cells of Sorghum spp., accounts for much of the allelopathic activity of the genus. The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of this compound have been identified and functionally characterized. Here, we report the successful assembly of the biosynthetic pathway and the significant impact of in vivo synthesized sorgoleone on the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana. A multigene DNA construct was prepared for the expression of genes required for sorgoleone biosynthesis in planta and deployed in N. benthamiana leaf tissues via Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. RNA-sequencing was conducted to investigate the effects of sorgoleone, via expression of its biosynthesis pathway, on host gene expression. The production of sorgoleone in agroinfiltrated leaves as detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) resulted in the formation of necrotic lesions, indicating that the compound caused severe phytotoxicity to these tissues. RNA-sequencing profiling revealed significant changes in gene expression in the leaf tissues expressing the pathway during the formation of sorgoleone-induced necrotic lesions. Transcriptome analysis suggested that the compound produced in vivo impaired the photosynthetic system as a result of downregulated gene expression for the photosynthesis apparatus and elevated expression of proteasomal genes which may play a major role in the phytotoxicity of sorgoleone.
