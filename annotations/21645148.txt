['21645148', 'The molecular interactions between Arabidopsis and the pathogenic powdery mildew  Golovinomyces cichoracearum were studied by characterizing a disease-resistant  Arabidopsis mutant atg2-2. The atg2-2 mutant showed enhanced resistance to  powdery mildew and dramatic mildew-induced cell death as well as early senescence  phenotypes in the absence of pathogens. Defense-related genes were constitutively  activated in atg2-2. In atg2-2 mutants, spontaneous cell death, early senescence  and disease resistance required the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, but  interestingly, mildew-induced cell death was not fully suppressed by inactivation  of SA signaling. Thus, cell death could be uncoupled from disease resistance,  suggesting that cell death is not sufficient for resistance to powdery mildew.  ATG2 encodes autophagy-related 2, a protein known to be involved in the early  steps of autophagosome biogenesis. The atg2-2 mutant exhibited typical autophagy  defects in autophagosome formation. Furthermore, mutations in several other ATG  genes, including ATG5, ATG7 and ATG10, exhibited similar powdery mildew  resistance and mildew-induced cell death phenotypes. Taken together, our findings  provide insights into the role of autophagy in cell death and disease resistance,  and may indicate general links between autophagy, senescence, programmed cell  death and defense responses in plants.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04669.x', 'Tang']
