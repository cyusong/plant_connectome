ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) mediates the induction of defense responses against pathogens in most angiosperms. However, it has recently been shown that a few species have lost EDS1. It is unknown how defense against disease unfolds and evolves in the absence of EDS1. We utilize duckweeds; a collection of aquatic species that lack EDS1, to investigate this question. We established duckweed-Pseudomonas pathosystems and used growth curves and microscopy to characterize pathogen-induced responses. Through comparative genomics and transcriptomics, we show that the copy number of infection-associated genes and the infection-induced transcriptional responses of duckweeds differ from other model species. Pathogen defense in duckweeds has evolved along different trajectories than in other plants, including genomic and transcriptional reprogramming. Specifically, the miAMP1 domain-containing proteins, which are absent in Arabidopsis, showed pathogen responsive upregulation in duckweeds. Despite such divergence between Arabidopsis and duckweed species, we found conservation of upregulation of certain genes and the role of hormones in response to disease. Our work highlights the importance of expanding the pool of model species to study defense responses that have evolved in the plant kingdom independent of EDS1.
