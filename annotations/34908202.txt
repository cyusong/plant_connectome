Homogalacturonan (HG), the most abundant pectic glycan, functions as a cell wall structural and signaling molecule essential for plant growth, development and response to pathogens. HG exists as a component of pectic homoglycans, heteroglycans and glycoconjugates. HG is synthesized by members of the GALACTURONOSYLTRANSFERASE (GAUT) family. UDP-GalA-dependent homogalacturonan:galacturonosyltransferase (HG:GalAT) activity has previously been demonstrated for GAUTs 1, 4 and 11, as well as the GAUT1:GAUT7 complex. Here, we show that GAUTs 10, 13 and 14 are also HG:GalATs and that GAUTs 1, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 1:7 synthesize polymeric HG in vitro. Comparison of the in vitro HG:GalAT specific activities of the heterologously-expressed proteins demonstrates GAUTs 10 and 11 with the lowest, GAUT1 and GAUT13 with moderate, and GAUT14 and the GAUT1:GAUT7 complex with the highest HG:GalAT activity. GAUT13 and GAUT14 are also shown to de novo synthesize (initiate) HG synthesis in the absence of exogenous HG acceptors, an activity previously demonstrated for GAUT1:GAUT7. The rate of de novo HG synthesis by GAUT13 and GAUT14 is similar to their acceptor dependent HG synthesis, in contrast to GAUT1:GAUT7 for which de novo synthesis occurred at much lower rates than acceptor-dependent synthesis. The results suggest a unique role for de novo HG synthesis by GAUTs 13 and 14. The reducing end of GAUT13-de novo-synthesized HG has covalently attached UDP, indicating that UDP-GalA serves as both a donor and acceptor substrate during de novo HG synthesis. The functional significance of unique GAUT HG:GalAT catalytic properties in the synthesis of different pectin glycan or glycoconjugate structures is discussed.
