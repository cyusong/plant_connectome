The genus <i>Populus</i> is presented by dioecious species, and it became a promising object to study the genetics of sex in plants. In this work, genomes of male and female <i>Populus</i> × <i>sibirica</i> individuals were sequenced for the first time. To achieve high-quality genome assemblies, we used Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina platforms. A protocol for the isolation of long and pure DNA from young poplar leaves was developed, which enabled us to obtain 31 Gb (N50 = 21 kb) for the male poplar and 23 Gb (N50 = 24 kb) for the female one using the MinION sequencer. Genome assembly was performed with different tools, and Canu provided the most complete and accurate assemblies with a length of 818 Mb (N50 = 1.5 Mb) for the male poplar and 816 Mb (N50 = 0.5 Mb) for the female one. After polishing with Racon and Medaka (Nanopore reads) and then with POLCA (Illumina reads), assembly completeness was 98.45% (87.48% duplicated) for the male and 98.20% (76.77% duplicated) for the female according to BUSCO (benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs). A high proportion of duplicated BUSCO and the increased genome size (about 300 Mb above the expected) pointed at the separation of haplotypes in a large part of male and female genomes of <i>P.</i> × <i>sibirica</i>. Due to this, we were able to identify two haplotypes of the sex-determining region (SDR) in both assemblies; and one of these four SDR haplotypes, in the male genome, contained partial repeats of the <i>ARR17</i> gene (Y haplotype), while the rest three did not (X haplotypes). The analysis of the male <i>P.</i> × <i>sibirica</i> SDR suggested that the Y haplotype originated from <i>P. nigra</i>, while the X haplotype is close to <i>P. trichocarpa</i> and <i>P. balsamifera</i> species. Moreover, we revealed a <i>Populus</i>-specific repeat that could be involved in translocation of the <i>ARR17</i> gene or its part to the SDR of <i>P</i>. × <i>sibirica</i> and other <i>Populus</i> species. The obtained results expand our knowledge on SDR features in the genus <i>Populus</i> and poplar phylogeny.
