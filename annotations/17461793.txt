['17461793', 'In Arabidopsis, the central stem cells of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) are  indefinitely maintained, whereas those in floral meristems differentiate into  female gametophyte-bearing organs termed carpels. The class 1 KNOX genes encode  homeodomain transcription factors that function variously in the establishment  and maintenance of the SAM, and have also been implicated in carpel development.  Here we show that the KNOX gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) induces carpel formation  and promotes homeotic conversion of ovules to carpels when ectopically expressed  in flowers, as previously reported for the related gene KNAT2. In contrast to  KNAT2, loss of which confers no phenotype, we show using inducible RNA  interference and mutational analysis that progressive loss of STM causes floral  phenotypes ranging from reduced formation of placental tissues and inhibited  carpel fusion to complete loss of carpel development. These effects result  neither from failure to establish the central stem cell niche nor from reduced  floral homeotic gene expression, but rather indicate a specific requirement for  STM in carpel initiation, as further supported by the loss of leafy carpelloid  features in stm leafy double mutants. Activation of carpel development by STM is  independent of LEAFY and WUSCHEL, but requires the function of AGAMOUS. The  essential role for STM in carpel development, together with its previous reported  role in the SAM, shows that, despite the existence of several partially redundant  paralogous genes, STM provides the critical KNOX function in the development of  both vegetative and reproductive meristematic tissues.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03095.x', 'Murray']
