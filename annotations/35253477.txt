Drought plays a central role in increasing the incidence and severity of dry root rot (DRR) disease in chickpea. This is an economically devastating disease, compromising chickpea yields particularly severely in recent years due to erratic rainfall patterns. <i>Macrophomina phaseolina</i> (formerly <i>Rhizoctonia bataticola</i>) is the causal agent of DRR disease in the chickpea plant. The infection pattern in chickpea roots under well-watered conditions and drought stress are poorly understood at present. This study provides detailed disease symptomatology and the characteristics of DRR fungus at morphological and molecular levels. Using microscopy techniques, the infection pattern of DRR fungus in susceptible chickpea roots was investigated under well-watered and drought-stress conditions. Our observations suggested that drought stress intensifies the progression of already ongoing infection by weakening the endodermal barrier and overall defense. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that the plant's innate immune defense program is downregulated in infected roots when subjected to drought stress. Furthermore, genes involved in hormonal regulation are differentially expressed under drought stress. These findings provide hints in terms of potential chickpea genes to target in crop improvement programs to develop climate-change-resilient cultivars.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
