['21576464', 'The phytohormone jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) signals through the COI1-JAZ  coreceptor complex to control key aspects of plant growth, development, and  immune function. Despite detailed knowledge of the JA-Ile biosynthetic pathway,  little is known about the genetic basis of JA-Ile catabolism and inactivation.  Here, we report the identification of a wound- and jasmonate-responsive gene from  Arabidopsis that encodes a cytochrome P450 (CYP94B3) involved in JA-Ile turnover.  Metabolite analysis of wounded leaves showed that loss of CYP94B3 function in  cyp94b3 mutants causes hyperaccumulation of JA-Ile and concomitant reduction in  12-hydroxy-JA-Ile (12OH-JA-Ile) content, whereas overexpression of this enzyme  results in severe depletion of JA-Ile and corresponding changes in 12OH-JA-Ile  levels. In vitro studies showed that heterologously expressed CYP94B3 converts  JA-Ile to 12OH-JA-Ile, and that 12OH-JA-Ile is less effective than JA-Ile in  promoting the formation of COI1-JAZ receptor complexes. CYP94B3-overexpressing  plants displayed phenotypes indicative of JA-Ile deficiency, including defects in  male fertility, resistance to jasmonate-induced growth inhibition, and  susceptibility to insect attack. Increased accumulation of JA-Ile in wounded  cyp94b3 leaves was associated with enhanced expression of jasmonate-responsive  genes. These results demonstrate that CYP94B3 exerts negative feedback control on  JA-Ile levels and performs a key role in attenuation of jasmonate responses.', '2011 May 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1103542108', 'Howe']
