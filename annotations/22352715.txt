Programmed cell death (PCD) is a physiological process to remove redundant or harmful cells, for the development of multicellular organisms, or for restricting the spread of pathogens (hypersensitive response). Metacaspases are cysteine-dependent proteases which play an essential role in PCD. Triticum aestivum metacaspase 4 (TaMCA4) is a type II metacaspase gene cloned from 'Suwon11' wheat, with typical structural features such as peptidase C14 caspase domain and a long linker sequence between the two subunits. Transient expression of TaMCA4 in tobacco leaves failed to induce PCD directly but enhanced cell death triggered by a mouse Bax gene or a candidate effector gene from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. Enhancement of PCD was also observed in wheat leaves co-bombarded with TaMCA4. When challenged with the avirulent race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, the expression level of TaMCA4 in wheat leaves was sharply upregulated, whereas the transcript level was not significantly induced by the virulent race. Moreover, knocking down TaMCA4 expression by virus-induced gene silencing enhanced the susceptibility of Suwon11 to the avirulent race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici and reduced the necrotic area at infection sites.
