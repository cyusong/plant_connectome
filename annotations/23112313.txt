Johnson and colleagues (Reports, 18 May 2012, p. 904) claim that conspecific negative density dependence is a pervasive mechanism driving forest diversity, especially for rare tree species. We show that their results are due to a statistical bias in their analysis caused by the exclusion of joint absences.
