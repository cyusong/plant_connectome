['27624758', 'Although many transcription factors involved in cell wall morphogenesis have been  identified and studied, it is still unknown how genetic and molecular regulation  of cell wall biosynthesis is integrated into developmental programs. We  demonstrate by molecular genetic studies that SEEDSTICK (STK), a transcription  factor controlling ovule and seed integument identity, directly regulates PMEI6  and other genes involved in the biogenesis of the cellulose-pectin matrix of the  cell wall. Based on atomic force microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and chemical  analyses, we propose that structural modifications of the cell wall matrix in the  stk mutant contribute to defects in mucilage release and seed germination under  water-stress conditions. Our studies reveal a molecular network controlled by STK  that regulates cell wall properties of the seed coat, demonstrating that  developmental regulators controlling organ identity also coordinate specific  aspects of cell wall characteristics.', '2016 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00454', 'ORCID:']
