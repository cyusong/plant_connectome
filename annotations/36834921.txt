The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway plays important roles in plant defenses, development, and the synthesis of specialized metabolites synthesis. Transcription factor MYC2 is a major regulator of the JA signaling pathway and is involved in the regulation of plant physiological processes and specialized metabolite synthesis. Based on our understanding of the mechanism underlying the regulation of specialized metabolite synthesis in plants by the transcription factor MYC2, the use of synthetic biology approaches to design MYC2-driven chassis cells for the synthesis of specialized metabolites with high medicinal value, such as paclitaxel, vincristine, and artemisinin, seems to be a promising strategy. In this review, the regulatory role of MYC2 in JA signal transduction of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses, plant growth, development and specialized metabolite synthesis is described in detail, which will provide valuable reference for the use of MYC2 molecular switches to regulate plant specialized metabolite biosynthesis.
