['12154138', 'The cDNA clone RXF12, which encodes a xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8), was isolated from  Arabidopsis thaliana. The C-terminal half of the amino acid sequence of the  deduced protein, named AtXyn1, showed similarity with the catalytic domain of  barley xylanase X-1. The N-terminal half of AtXyn1 also contained three regions  with sequences similar to cellulose-binding domains (CBDs). A xylanase assay  revealed that transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing exogenous AtXyn1 fused  with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) possessed approximately twice as  much xylanase activity as wild-type plants. Observation by fluorescence  microscopy of transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing a fusion protein of AtXyn1  and EGFP suggested that AtXyn1 is a cell wall protein. Analysis of the  localization of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic A. thaliana  plants containing a chimeric gene with the upstream sequence of the AtXyn1 gene  and the GUS gene demonstrated that the AtXyn1 gene is predominantly expressed in  vascular bundles, but not in vessel cells. These data suggest that AtXyn1 is  involved in the secondary cell wall metabolism of vascular bundle cells. A  database search revealed that four putative xylanase genes exist in the A.  thaliana genome, besides the AtXyn1 gene. Of these, two also contain several  regions with sequences similar to CBDs in their N-terminal regions. Comparison of  the amino acid sequences of the five xylanases suggests a possible process for  their molecular evolution.', '2002 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcf088', 'Komeda']
