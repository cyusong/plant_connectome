Developing soybean lines with high levels of stearic acid is a primary goal of the soybean industry. Most high-stearic-acid soybeans carry different GmSACPD-C mutated alleles. However, due to the dual role of GmSACPD-C in seeds and nodule development, all derived deleterious GmSACPD-C mutant alleles are of extremely poor agronomic value because of defective nodulation. The soybean stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (GmSACPD) gene family is composed of five members. Comparative genomics analysis indicated that SACPD genes were duplicated and derived from a common ancestor that is still present in chlorophytic algae. Synteny analysis showed the presence of segment duplications between GmSACPD-A/GmSACPD-B, and GmSACPD-C/GmSACPD-D. GmSACPD-E was not contained in any duplicated segment and may be the result of tandem duplication. We developed a TILLING by Target Capture Sequencing (Tilling-by-Sequencing+) technology, a versatile extension of the conventional TILLING by sequencing, and successfully identified 12, 14, and 18 ethyl methanesulfonate mutants at the GmSACPD-A, GmSACPD-B, and GmSACPD-D genes, respectively. Functional analysis of all identified mutants revealed an unprecedented role of GmSACPD-A, GmSACPD-B, and GmSACPD-D in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis without affecting nodule development and structure. This discovery will positively impact the development of high-stearic-acid lines to enhance soybean nutritional value without potential developmental tradeoffs.
