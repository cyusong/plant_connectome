The synthesis and modification of the cell wall must involve the production of new cell wall polymers and enzymes. Their targeted secretion to the apoplast is one of many potential control points. Since Rab GTPases have been strongly implicated in the regulation of vesicle trafficking, a review of their involvement in cell wall metabolism should throw light on this possibility. Cell wall polymer biosynthesis occurs mainly in the Golgi apparatus, except for cellulose and callose, which are made at the plasma membrane by an enzyme complex that cycles through the endomembrane system and which may be regulated by this cycling. Several systems, including the growth of root hairs and pollen tubes, cell wall softening in fruit, and the development of root nodules, are now being dissected. In these systems, secretion of wall polymers and modifying enzymes has been documented, and Rab GTPases are highly expressed. Reverse genetic experiments have been used to interfere with these GTPases and this is revealing their importance in regulation of trafficking to the wall. The role of the RabA (or Rab11) GTPases is particularly exciting in this respect.
