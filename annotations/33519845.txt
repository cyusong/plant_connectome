The subfamily Nolinoideae of Asparagaceae is an extremely morphologically heterogeneous group, which is comprised of seven lineages, formerly known as Eriospermaceae, Polygonateae, Ophiopogoneae, Convallarieae, Ruscaceae s.s., Dracaenaceae, and Nolinaceae from different families or even orders. Their drastically divergent morphologies and low level of molecular resolution have hindered our understanding on their evolutionary history. To resolve reliable and clear phylogenetic relationships of the Nolinoideae, a phylogenetic study was conducted based on transcriptomic sequencing of 15 species representing all the seven lineages. A dataset containing up to 2,850,331 sites across 2,126 genes was analyzed using both concatenated and coalescent methods. Except for <i>Eriospermum</i> as outgroup, the transcriptomic data strongly resolved the remaining six lineages into two groups, one is a paraphyletic grade including the woody lineages of dracaenoids, ruscoids, and nolinoids and a monophyletic herbaceous clade. Within the herbaceous group, the Ophiopogoneae + <i>Theropogon</i> is sister to a clade that is composed of Convallarieae and the monophyletic Polygonateae. Our work provides a first robust deep relationship of the highly heterogeneous Nolinoideae and paves the way for further investigations of its complex evolution.
