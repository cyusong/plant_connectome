Silicon (Si) has many beneficial effects in plants, especially for the survival from biotic and abiotic stresses. However, Si may negatively affect the quality of lignocellulosic biomass for bioenergy purposes. Despite many studies, the regulation of Si distribution and deposition in plants remains to be fully understood. Here, we have identified the Brachypodium distachyon mutant low-silicon 1 (Bdlsi1-1), with impaired channeling function of the Si influx transporter BdLSI1, resulting in a substantial reduction of Si in shoots. Bioimaging by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry showed that the wild-type plants deposited Si mainly in the bracts, awns and leaf macrohairs. The Bdlsi1-1 mutants showed substantial (>90%) reduction of Si in the mature shoots. The Bdlsi1-1 leaves had fewer, shorter macrohairs, but the overall pattern of Si distribution in bracts and leaf tissues was similar to that in the wild-type. The Bdlsi1-1 plants supplied with Si had significantly lower seed weights, compared to the wild-type. In low-Si media, the seed weight of wild-type plants was similar to that of Bdlsi1-1 mutants supplied with Si, while the Bdlsi1-1 seed weight decreased further. We conclude that Si deficiency results in widespread alterations in leaf surface morphology and seed formation in Brachypodium, showing the importance of Si for successful development in grasses.
