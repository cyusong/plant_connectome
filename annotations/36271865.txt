Callose is a plant cell wall polysaccharide whose deposition is spatiotemporally regulated in various developmental processes and environmental stress responses. The appearance of callose in premeiotic anthers is a prominent histological hallmark for the onset of meiosis in flowering plants; however, the biological role of callose in meiosis remains unknown. Here, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) GLUCAN SYNTHASE LIKE5 (OsGSL5), a callose synthase, localizes on the plasma membrane of pollen mother cells (PMCs) and is responsible for biogenesis of callose in anther locules through premeiotic and meiotic stages. In Osgsl5 mutant anthers mostly lacking callose deposition, aberrant PMCs accompanied by aggregated, unpaired, or multivalent chromosomes were frequently observed and, furthermore, a considerable number of mutant PMCs had untimely progress into meiosis compared to that of wild-type PMCs. Immunostaining of meiosis-specific protein HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS2 in premeiotic PMCs revealed precocious meiosis entry in Osgsl5 anthers. These findings provide insights into the function of callose in controlling the timing of male meiosis initiation and progression, in addition to roles in microsporogenesis, in flowering plants.
