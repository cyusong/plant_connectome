The cultivation of vining pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) faces a major constraint with root rot diseases, caused by a complex of soil-borne pathogens including the oomycetes <i>Aphanomyces euteiches</i> and <i>Phytophtora pisi</i>. Disease resistant commercial varieties are lacking but the landrace PI180693 is used as a source of partial resistance in ongoing pea breeding programs. In this study, the level of resistance and their interaction with <i>A. euteiches</i> virulence levels of six new back-crossed pea breeding lines, deriving from the cross between the susceptible commercial cultivar Linnea and PI180693, were evaluated for their resistance towards aphanomyces root rot in growth chamber and green house tests. Resistance towards mixed infections by <i>A. euteiches</i> and <i>P. pisi</i> and commercial production traits were evaluated in field trials. In growth chamber trials, pathogen virulence levels had a significant effect on plant resistance, as resistance was more consistent against <i>A. euteiches</i> strains exhibiting high or intermediate virulence compared with lowly virulent strains. In fact, line Z1701-1 showed to be significantly more resistant than both parents when inoculated with a lowly virulent strain. In two separate field trials in 2020, all six breeding lines performed equally well as the resistant parent PI180693 at sites only containing <i>A. euteiches</i>, as there were no differences in disease index. In mixed infections, PI180693 exhibited significantly lower disease index scores than Linnea. However, breeding lines displayed higher disease index scores compared with PI180693, indicating higher susceptibility towards <i>P. pisi</i>. Data on seedling emergence from the same field trials suggested that PI180693 was particularly sensitive towards seed decay/damping off disease caused by <i>P. pisi</i>. Furthermore, the breeding lines performed equally well as Linnea in traits important for green pea production, again emphasizing the commercial potential. In summary, we show that the resistance from PI180693 interacts with virulence levels of the pathogen <i>A. euteiches</i> and is less effective towards root rot caused by <i>P. pisi</i>. Our results show the potential use of combining PI180693 partial resistance against aphanomyces root rot with commercially favorable breeding traits in commercial breeding programs.
