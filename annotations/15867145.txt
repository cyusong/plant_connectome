The tumor-associated antigen EpCAM (GA733-2) is a highly expressed target on adenocarcinoma cells, as defined by murine mAb CO17-1A. We recently developed a transgenic plant system for the safe and inexpensive production of large quantities of mAb CO17-1A as a future source of clinical-grade protein. Although the glycosylation pattern of plant-derived mAb (mAb(P)) CO17-1A differs considerably from that of the mammalian-derived mAb (mAb(M)), we show here that the biological activity of both mAbs is quite similar. mAb(P) heavy and light chains assembled to bind the recombinant antigen GA733-2E and specifically bound to human SW948 colorectal carcinoma cells expressing the antigen GA733-2 to the same extent as mAb(M). mAb(P) was as effective as mAb(M) CO17-1A in inhibiting tumor growth of xenotransplanted SW948 cells in nude mice. These results suggest the promise of transgenic plants as a useful alternative way to produce full-size mAb for cancer immunotherapy.
