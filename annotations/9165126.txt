['9165126', "In a screen designed to identify genes in the specification of epidermal cell  fate in Arabidopsis primary roots we have isolated 8 new mutants that fall into 6  complementation groups corresponding to the 'root hairless' genes RHL1, RHL2 and  RHL3 and the 'ectopic root hair' genes ERH1, ERH2 and ERH3. The erh2 mutant is  allelic to pom1, a conditional root expansion mutant, and reveals a possible link  between epidermal root hair initiation and radial cell expansion. Apart from erh1  the mutants also show defects in shoot development, indicating a complex role for  the affected genes. Mutant phenotypes in the patterning and shape of leaf  trichomes in rhl1, rhl2, rhl3 and erh3 were particularly obvious. The root  hairless mutants are only partly responsive to increased ethylene concentrations,  while the ectopic root hair mutants are fully responsive to reduced  concentrations of ethylene, a permissive regulator of root hair initiation. This  result and the analysis of double mutants suggest a complex pathway leading to  root hair initiation that requires the RHL and ERH genes for correct  differentiation.", '1997 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.124.9.1789', 'Roberts']
