De novo fatty acid synthesis in plants occurs primarily in the plastids and is catalysed by a type-II fatty acid synthase (FAS) in which separate enzymes catalyse sequential reactions. Genes encoding all of the plant FAS components have been identified, following enzyme purification or by homology to Escherichia coli genes, and the structure of a number of the individual proteins determined. There are several lines of biochemical evidence indicating that FAS enzymes form a multi-protein complex and both in vitro and in vivo strategies can be used to investigate the association and interactions between them. To investigate protein interactions in vivo, tandem affinity purification-tagged FAS components are being used to purify complexes from both Arabidopsis thaliana and Synechocystis PCC6803. Here, the development of the tandem affinity purification method, its modification, and its use in plants is described and the experimental results achieved so far are reported.
