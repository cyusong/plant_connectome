Soil salinization is one of the most crucial abiotic stresses that limit the growth and production of eggplant. The existing researches in eggplant were mostly focused on salt-induced morphological, biochemical and physiological changes, with only limited works centered on salt-response genes in eggplant at the transcriptomic level. Our preliminary work found that Zhusiqie (No.118) is salt-tolerant and Hongqie (No.30) is salt-sensitive. Consequently, they were re-named as ST118 and SS30, respectively. ST118 showed less damaged on growth and higher K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratios in leaves than SS30. Comparative-transcriptome analysis was used as a powerful approach to understand the salt-response mechanisms in the leaves and roots of SS30 and ST118. And it revealed that genotype-specific and organ-specific manners exist in eggplant in response to salt stress. Strikingly, the genotype-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ST118 were considered crucial to its higher salt-tolerance, because the expression patterns of common DEGs in the leaves/roots of the two eggplant genotypes were almost the same. Among them, some transcription factors have been reported to be in response to elevated external salinity, including the members of C2C2-CO-like, WRKY, MYB and NAC family. In addition, the AKT1, KAT1 and SOS1 were up-regulated only in the leaves of ST118. Furthermore, the complementation assays demonstrated that the salt-tolerances of both yeast and Arabidopsis akt1 mutants were enhanced by heterologous expression of SmAKT1. The comparative-transcriptome analysis indicated that the salt-tolerance can be increased by higher transcript level of some genotype-specific genes. This work revealed that eggplants seem to be more inclined to absorb K<sup>+</sup> rather than to exclude Na<sup>+</sup> under salt stress conditions because seven K<sup>+</sup> transporters were significantly up-regulated, while only one Na<sup>+</sup> transporter was similarly regulated. Finally, the complementation assays of SmAKT1, which is genotype-specific up-regulated in ST118, suggest that the other TFs and K<sup>+</sup> transport genes were worthy of future investigation for their functions in salinity tolerance.
