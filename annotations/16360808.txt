A plant regeneration system through multiple adventitious shoot differentiation from callus cultures has been established in slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Influences of seven different basal media on callus induction, adventitious shoot formation, and rooting were investigated. Among the different basal media, B5, SH, and TE proved to be suitable for callus induction and plantlet regeneration. Multiple adventitious shoot formation was obtained from callus cultures of slash pine on B5, SH, and TE media containing indole-3-butyric acid, N6-benzyladenine, and thidiazuron. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the early development of adventitious shoots derived from callus cultures. These results indicate that an efficient plant regeneration protocol for micropropagation of slash pine had been established. This protocol could be most useful for future studies on genetic transformation of slash pine.
