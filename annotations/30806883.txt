The whole promoter regions of SUTs in Vitis were firstly isolated. SUTs are involved in the adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses. The vulnerability of Vitis vinifera to abiotic and biotic stresses limits its yields. In contrast, Vitis amurensis displays resistance to environmental stresses, such as microbial pathogens, low temperatures, and drought. Sucrose transporters (SUTs) are important regulators for plant growth and stress tolerance; however, the role that SUTs play in stress resistance in V. amurensis is not known. Using V. amurensis Ruper. 'Zuoshan-1' and V. vinifera 'Chardonnay', we found that SUC27 was highly expressed in several vegetative organs of Zuoshan-1, SUC12 was weakly expressed or absent in most organs in both the species, and the distribution of SUC11 in source and sink organs was highest in Zuoshan-1. A search for cis-regulatory elements in the promoter sequences of SUTs revealed that they were regulated by light, environmental stresses, physiological correlation, and hormones. The SUTs in Zuoshan-1 mostly show a higher and rapid response than in Chardonnay under the induction by Plasmopara viticola infection, cold, water deficit, and dark conditions. The induction of SUTs was associated with the upregulation of key genes involved in sucrose metabolism and the biosynthesis of plant hormones. These results indicate that stress resistance in Zuoshan-1 is governed by the differential distribution and induction of SUTs by various stimuli, and the subsequent promotion of sucrose metabolism and hormone synthesis.
