The immediate visual comparison of platinum chemotherapeutics' effects in eukaryotic cells using accessible plant models of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana is reported. The leading anticancer drug cisplatin, a third generation drug used for colon cancer, oxaliplatin and kiteplatin, promising Pt-based anticancer drugs effective against resistant lines, were administered to transgenic A. thaliana plants monitoring their effects on cells from different tissues. The transgenic plants' cell cytoskeletons were labelled by the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged microtubule-protein TUA6 (TUA6-GFP), while the vacuolar organization was evidenced by two soluble chimerical GFPs (GFPChi and AleuGFP) and one transmembrane GFP-tagged tonoplast intrinsic protein 1-1 (TIP1.1-GFP). The three drugs showed easily recognizable effects on plant subcellular organization, thereby providing evidence for a differentiated drug targeting. Genetically modified A. thaliana are confirmed as a possible rapid and low-cost screening tool for better understanding the mechanism of action of human anticancer drugs.
