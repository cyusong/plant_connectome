['31914389', 'Plants respond to cold stress by inducing the expression of transcription factors  that regulate downstream genes to confer tolerance to freezing. We screened an  Arabidopsis transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion library and identified a  cold-hypersensitive mutant, which we named stch4 (sensitive to chilling 4).  STCH4/REIL2 encodes a ribosomal biogenesis factor that is upregulated upon cold  stress. Overexpression of STCH4 confers chilling and freezing tolerance in  Arabidopsis. The stch4 mutation reduces CBF protein levels and thus delayed the  induction of C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) regulon genes. Ribosomal  RNA processing is reduced in stch4 mutants, especially under cold stress. STCH4  associates with multiple ribosomal proteins, and these interactions are modulated  by cold stress. These results suggest that the ribosome is a regulatory node for  cold stress responses and that STCH4 promotes an altered ribosomal composition  and functions in low temperatures to facilitate the translation of proteins  important for plant growth and survival under cold stress.', '2020 Jan 7', 'Cell Rep', '10.1016/j.celrep.2019.12.012', 'Zhu']
