['18557837', "Cation- and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent plant natural product  methyltransferases are referred to as CCoAOMTs because of their preferred  substrate, caffeoyl coenzyme A (CCoA). The enzymes are encoded by a small family  of genes, some of which with a proven role in lignin monomer biosynthesis. In  Arabidopsis thaliana individual members of this gene family are temporally and  spatially regulated. The gene At1g67990 is specifically expressed in flower buds,  and is not detected in any other organ, such as roots, leaves or stems. Several  lines of evidence indicate that the At1g67990 transcript is located in the flower  buds, whereas the corresponding CCoAOMT-like protein, termed AtTSM1, is located  exclusively in the tapetum of developing stamen. Flowers of At1g67990  RNAi-suppressed plants are characterized by a distinct flower chemotype with  severely reduced levels of the N ',N ''-bis-(5-hydroxyferuloyl)-N  '''-sinapoylspermidine compensated for by  N(1),N(5),N(10)-tris-(5-hydroxyferuloyl)spermidine derivative, which is  characterized by the lack of a single methyl group in the sinapoyl moiety. This  severe change is consistent with the observed product profile of AtTSM1 for  aromatic phenylpropanoids. Heterologous expression of the recombinant protein  shows the highest activity towards a series of caffeic acid esters, but  5-hydroxyferuloyl spermidine conjugates are also accepted substrates. The in  vitro substrate specificity and the in vivo RNAi-mediated suppression data of the  corresponding gene suggest a role of this cation-dependent CCoAOMT-like protein  in the stamen/pollen development of A. thaliana.", '2008 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03576.x', 'Vogt']
