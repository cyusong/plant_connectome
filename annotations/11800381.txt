['11800381', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. minD gene (AtMinD1) was isolated and  constitutively expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants using the CaMV  35S promoter. Confocal and electron-microscopic analysis of the AtMinD1  transgenic tobacco lines revealed that the chloroplasts were abnormally large and  fewer in number compared with wild-type tobacco plants. The abnormal chloroplasts  were less prevalent in guard cells than in mesophyll cells. Chloroplast and  nuclear gene expression was not significantly different in AtMinD1-overexpressing  plants relative to wild-type tobacco plants. Chloroplast DNA copy number was not  affected, based on the relative level of the rbcL gene in transgenic plants.  Transgenic tobacco plants constitutively overexpressing AtMinD1 were completely  normal phenotypically with respect to growth and development, and also displayed  normal photosynthetic electron transport rates. These results show that the  Arabidopsis MinD1 gene also functions in a heterologous system and confirm the  role of the MinD protein in regulation of chloroplast division.', '2001 Dec', 'Planta', '10.1007/s004250100605', 'Collins']
