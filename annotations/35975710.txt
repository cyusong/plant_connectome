Protein ubiquitination regulates diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms, from growth and development to stress response. Proteins subjected to ubiquitination can be found in virtually all subcellular locations and organelles, including peroxisomes, single-membrane and highly dynamic organelles ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Peroxisomes contain metabolic functions essential to plants and animals such as lipid catabolism, detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), biosynthesis of vital hormones and cofactors, and photorespiration. Plant peroxisomes possess a complex proteome with functions varying among different tissue types and developmental stages, and during plant response to distinct environmental cues. However, how these diverse functions are regulated at the post-translational level is poorly understood, especially in plants. In this review, we summarized current knowledge of the involvement of protein ubiquitination in peroxisome protein import, remodeling, pexophagy, and metabolism, focusing on plants, and referencing discoveries from other eukaryotic systems when relevant. Based on previous ubiquitinomics studies, we compiled a list of 56 ubiquitinated Arabidopsis peroxisomal proteins whose functions are associated with all the major plant peroxisomal metabolic pathways. This discovery suggests a broad impact of protein ubiquitination on plant peroxisome functions, therefore substantiating the need to investigate this significant regulatory mechanism in peroxisomes at more depths.
