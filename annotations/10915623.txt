['10915623', 'The CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) proteins form a potential receptor and  ligand pair that regulates the balance between cell proliferation and  differentiation at the shoot meristem of Arabidopsis. CLV1 encodes a  receptor-kinase, and CLV3 encodes a predicted small, secreted polypeptide. We  demonstrate that the CLV3 and CLV1 proteins coimmunoprecipitate in vivo, that  yeast cells expressing CLV1 and CLV2 bind to CLV3 from plant extracts, and that  binding requires CLV1 kinase activity. CLV3 only associates with the presumed  active CLV1 protein complex in vivo. More than 75% of CLV3 in cauliflower  extracts is bound with CLV1, consistent with hypotheses of ligand sequestration.  Soluble CLV3 was found in an approximately 25-kilodalton multimeric complex.', '2000 Jul 28', 'Science', '10.1126/science.289.5479.613', 'Clark']
