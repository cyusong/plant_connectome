The phytohormones ethylene and jasmonate play important roles in the adaptation of rice plants to salt stress. However, the molecular interactions between ethylene and jasmonate on rice seminal root growth under salt stress are unknown. In this study, the effects of NaCl on the homeostasis of ethylene and jasmonate, and on rice seminal root growth were investigated. Our results indicate that NaCl treatment promotes ethylene biosynthesis by up-regulating the expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes, whereas NaCl-induced ethylene does not inhibit rice seminal root growth directly, but rather indirectly, by promoting jasmonate biosynthesis. NaCl treatment also promotes jasmonate biosynthesis through an ethylene-independent pathway. Moreover, NaCl-induced jasmonate reduces meristem cell number and cell division activity via down-regulated expression of Oryza sativa PLETHORA (OsPLT) and cell division-related genes, respectively. Additionally, NaCl-induced jasmonate inhibits seminal root cell elongation by down-regulating the expression of cell elongation-related genes. Overall, salt stress promotes jasmonate biosynthesis through ethylene-dependent and -independent pathways in rice seminal roots, and jasmonate inhibits rice seminal root growth by inhibiting root meristem cell proliferation and root cell elongation.
