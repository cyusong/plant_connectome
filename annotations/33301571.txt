Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups ensuring electron transfer reactions, activating substrates for catalytic reactions, providing sulfur atoms for the biosynthesis of vitamins or other cofactors, or having protein-stabilizing effects. Hence, metalloproteins containing these cofactors are essential for numerous and diverse metabolic pathways and cellular processes occurring in the cytoplasm. Mitochondria are organelles where the Fe-S cluster demand is high, notably because the activity of the respiratory chain complexes I, II, and III relies on the correct assembly and functioning of Fe-S proteins. Several other proteins or complexes present in the matrix require Fe-S clusters as well, or depend either on Fe-S proteins such as ferredoxins or on cofactors such as lipoic acid or biotin whose synthesis relies on Fe-S proteins. In this review, we have listed and discussed the Fe-S-dependent enzymes or pathways in plant mitochondria including some potentially novel Fe-S proteins identified based on in silico analysis or on recent evidence obtained in non-plant organisms. We also provide information about recent developments concerning the molecular mechanisms involved in Fe-S cluster synthesis and trafficking steps of these cofactors from maturation factors to client apoproteins.
