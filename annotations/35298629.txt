Under field environments, fluctuating light conditions induce dynamic photosynthesis, which affects carbon gain by crop plants. Elucidating the natural genetic variations among untapped germplasm resources and their underlying mechanisms can provide an effective strategy to improve dynamic photosynthesis and, ultimately, improve crop yields through molecular breeding approaches. In this review, we first overview two processes affecting dynamic photosynthesis, namely (i) biochemical processes associated with CO2 fixation and photoprotection and (ii) gas diffusion processes from the atmosphere to the chloroplast stroma. Next, we review the intra- and interspecific variations in dynamic photosynthesis in relation to each of these two processes. It is suggested that plant adaptations to different hydrological environments underlie natural genetic variation explained by gas diffusion through stomata. This emphasizes the importance of the coordination of photosynthetic and stomatal dynamics to optimize the balance between carbon gain and water use efficiency under field environments. Finally, we discuss future challenges in improving dynamic photosynthesis by utilizing natural genetic variation. The forward genetic approach supported by high-throughput phenotyping should be introduced to evaluate the effects of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions on the natural variation in dynamic photosynthesis.
