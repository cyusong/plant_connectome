Although studies have shown the concomitant occurrence of autophagic and programmed cell death (PCD) in plants, the relationship between autophagy and PCD and the factors determining this relationship remain unclear. In this study, seedlings of the wheat cultivar Jimai 22 were used to examine the occurrence of autophagy and PCD during polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000-induced drought stress. Autophagy and PCD occurred sequentially, with autophagy at a relatively early stage and PCD at a much later stage. These findings suggest that the duration of drought stress determines the occurrence of PCD following autophagy. Furthermore, the addition of 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) and the knockdown of autophagy-related gene 6 (ATG6) accelerated PEG-8000-induced PCD, respectively, suggesting that inhibition of autophagy also results in PCD under drought stress. Overall, these findings confirm that wheat seedlings undergo autophagic survival under mild drought stress, with subsequent PCD only under severe drought.
