Accumulation of toxic ions in plant tissues modulates the levels of primary and secondary metabolites, which may be related to salinity tolerance. In this study two sugarcane clones, CP-4333 (tolerant) and HSF-240 (sensitive), were exposed to salinity levels at the formative stage, and evaluated three times at 10-day intervals. Although net rate of photosynthesis (Pn), leaf area, length and dry weight of shoots were decreased in both clones, the CP-4333 showed less reduction compared to HSF-240. Both clones displayed a general tendency to accumulate Na+ and Cl- and little K+, though CP-4333 accumulated less Na+ and more K+ compared to HSF-240, and thus showed a higher K+:Na+ ratio. The carotenoid (CAR) content remained steady, while total chlorophyll (CHL) was slightly reduced in the tolerant clone and significantly reduced in HSF-240. In contrast, soluble phenolics (PHE), anthocyanins (ANT) and flavones (FLA) levels were 2.5, 2.8 and 3.0 times greater in CP-4333 in comparison with HSF-240. The decrease in Pn and most secondary metabolites demonstrated by the sensitive clone, but not evidenced in the tolerant clones, suggest that the presence of those metabolites is related to increased salt tolerance of sugarcane. The increased synthesis of PHE, ANT and FLA seems to protect sugarcane from ion-induced oxidative stress, probably due to a common structural skeleton, the phenyl group, of those metabolites. CAR, as components of the light harvesting center (LHC) and biosynthesized in chloroplasts, may confer resistance to this organelle. The PHE, ANT and FLA synthesized in the cytosol may protect cells from ion-induced oxidative damage by binding the ions and thereby showing reduced toxicity on cytoplasmic structures.
