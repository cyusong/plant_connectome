Herbivorous insects represent one of the major threats to sessile plants. To cope with herbivore challenges, plants have evolved sophisticated defense systems, in which the lipid-derived phytohormone jasmonate plays a crucial role. Perception of insect attack locally and systemically elicits rapid synthesis of jasmonate, which is perceived by the F-box protein COI1 to further recruit JAZ repressors for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby releasing transcription factors that subsequently activate plant defense against insect attack. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of jasmonate action in plant defense against insects.

Insect attack: !elicits! jasmonate synthesis
jasmonate: !perceived by! COI1
COI1: !recruits! JAZ repressors
JAZ repressors: !ubiquitinate and degrade! transcription factors
transcription factors: !activate! plant defense
