Chloroplast development is a highly complex process and the regulatory mechanisms have not yet been fully characterized. In this study, we identified Early Chloroplast Development 1 (ECD1), a chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein (PPR) belonging to the PLS subfamily. Inactivation of ECD1 in Arabidopsis led to embryo lethality, and abnormal embryogenesis occurred in ecd1/+ heterozygous plants. A decrease in ECD1 expression induced by RNAi resulted in seedlings with albino cotyledons but normal true leaves. The aberrant morphology and under-developed thylakoid membrane system in cotyledons of RNAi seedlings suggests a role of ECD1 specifically in chloroplast development in seedlings. In cotyledons of ECD1-RNAi plants, RNA-editing of rps14-149 (encoding ribosomal protein S14) was seriously impaired. In addition, dramatically decreased plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent gene expression and abnormal chloroplast rRNA processing were also observed. Taken together, our results indicate that ECD1 is indispensable for chloroplast development at the seedling stage in Arabidopsis.
