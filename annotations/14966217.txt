['14966217', 'The Arabidopsis gene ZIM encodes a putative transcription factor containing a  novel GATA-type zinc-finger domain with a longer spacer between its two sets of  conserved cysteine residues (C-X2-C-X20-C-X2-C). In Arabidopsis, ZIM and  homologous proteins, ZML1 and ZML2, were identified as GATA factors containing  the C-X2-C-X20-C-X2-C motif, a CCT domain, and an uncharacterized conserved  domain. Proteins that possess this domain structure were found exclusively in  plants, indicating that they belong to a novel family of plant-specific GATA-type  transcription factors. When ZIM was overexpressed using a CaMV 35S promoter in  Arabidopsis, hypocotyls and petioles were elongated. The elongation phenotype was  observed under all wavelengths of light tested and even in the presence of  biosynthetic inhibitors of either brassinosteroid or gibberellin. In  ZIM-overexpressing plants, XTH33 which is predicted to function in cell wall  modification was detected as an up-regulated gene by microarray analysis, and  this could account for the elongation phenotype. Genes in ZIM-overexpressing  plants were identified that were up-regulated in a tissue-specific manner, which  suggests that transcriptional regulation by ZIM and its consequent effects are  spatially controlled.', '2004 Mar', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erh078', 'Kohchi']
