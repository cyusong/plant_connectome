Rhizoctonia solani is a fungal pathogen that causes sheath blight disease in rice plants. In this study, metabolomic analysis using CE/TOF-MS in negative ion mode was used to investigate the resistance response of resistant and susceptible rice lines (32R and 29S, respectively) due to R. solani infection. Two rice lines showed different responses to the infection of R. solani. In 32R, R. solani infection induced significant increases in adenosine diphosphate (ADP), glyceric acid, mucic acid and jasmonic acid. In 29S, inosine monophosphate (IMP) was involved in the plant response to R. solani infection. Phenol compounds showed an increase as a response of the rice lines to R. solani infection. The study suggests that R. solani infection effects in 32R are associated with the induction of plant metabolic processes such as respiration, photorespiration, pectin synthesis, and lignin accumulation. In 29S, the R. solani infection is suggested to correlate with nitrogen metabolism.
