Agriculture is the primary and oldest industry in the world and has been transformed over the centuries from the prehistoric era to the technology-driven 21<sup>st</sup> century, where people are always solving complex problems with the aid of technology. With the power of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), the world has become a global village, where every digital object that prevails in the world is connected to each other with the Internet of Things (IoT). The fast proliferation of IoT-based technology has revolutionized practically every sector, including agriculture, shifting the industry from statistical to quantitative techniques. Such profound transformations are reshaping traditional agricultural practices and generating new possibilities in the face of various challenges. With the opportunities created, farmers are now able to monitor the condition of crops in real time. With the automated IoT solutions, farmers can automate tasks in the farmland, as these solutions are capable of making precise decisions based on underlying challenges and executing actions to overcome such difficulties, alerting farmers in real-time, eventually leading to increased productivity and higher harvest. In this context, we present a cloud-enabled low-cost sensorized IoT platform for real-time monitoring and automating tasks dealing with a tomato plantation in an indoor environment, highlighting the necessity of smart agriculture. We anticipate that the findings of this study will serve as vital guides in developing and promoting smart agriculture solutions aimed at improving productivity and quality while also enabling the transition to a sustainable environment.
