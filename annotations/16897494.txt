['16897494', "The cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is an important  multi-subunit component of the mRNA 3'-end processing apparatus in eukaryotes.  The Arabidopsis genome contains five genes encoding CPSF homologues (AtCPSF160,  AtCPSF100, AtCPSF73-I, AtCPSF73-II and AtCPSF30). These CPSF homologues interact  with each other in a way that is analogous to the mammalian CPSF complex or their  yeast counterparts, and also interact with the Arabidopsis poly(A) polymerase  (PAP). There are two CPSF73 like proteins (AtCPSF73-I and AtCPSF73-II) that share  homology with the 73 kD subunit of the mammalian CPSF complex. AtCPSF73-I appears  to correspond to the functionally characterized mammalian CPSF73 and its yeast  counterpart. AtCPSF73-II was identified as a novel protein with uncharacterized  protein homologues in other multicellular organisms, but not in yeast. Both of  the AtCPSF73 proteins are targeted in the nucleus and were found to interact with  AtCPSF100. They are also essential since knockout or knockdown mutants are  lethal. In addition, the expression level of AtCPSF73-I is critical for  Arabidopsis development because overexpression of AtCPSF73-I is lethal.  Interestingly, transgenic plants carrying an additional copy of the AtCPSF73-I  gene, that is, the full-length cDNA under the control of its native promoter,  appeared normal but were male sterile due to delayed anther dehiscence. In  contrast, we previously demonstrated that a mutation in the AtCPSF73-II gene was  detrimental to the genetic transmission of female gametes. Thus, two 73 kD  subunits of the AtCPSF complex appear to have special functions during flower  development. The important roles of mRNA 3'-end processing machinery in  modulating plant development are discussed.", '2006 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-006-0051-6', 'Li']
