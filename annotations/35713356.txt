MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key regulatory roles in seed development and emerge as new key targets for engineering grain size and yield. The Zma-miRNA169 family is highly expressed during maize seed development, but its functional roles in seed development remain elusive. Here, we generated zma-miR169o and ZmNF-YA13 transgenic plants. Phenotypic and genetic analyses were performed on these lines. Seed development and auxins contents were investigated. Overexpression of maize miRNA zma-miR169o increases seed size and weight, whereas the opposite is true when its expression is suppressed. Further studies revealed that zma-miR169 acts by negatively regulating its target gene, a transcription factor ZmNF-YA13 that also plays a key role in determining seed size. We demonstrate that ZmNF-YA13 regulates the expression of the auxin biosynthetic gene ZmYUC1, which modulates auxin levels in the early developing seeds and determines the number of endosperm cells, thereby governing maize seed size and ultimately yield. Overall, our present study has identified zma-miR169o and ZmNF-YA13 that form a functional module regulating auxin accumulation in maize seeds and playing an important role in determining maize seed size and yield, providing a set of novel molecular tools for yield improvement in molecular breeding and genetic engineering.
