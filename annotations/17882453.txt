This study describes the molecular characterization of the genes BnSCT1 and BnSCT2 from oilseed rape (Brassica napus) encoding the enzyme 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-glucose:choline sinapoyltransferase (SCT; EC 2.3.1.91). SCT catalyzes the 1-O-beta-acetal ester-dependent biosynthesis of sinapoylcholine (sinapine), the most abundant phenolic compound in seeds of B. napus. GUS fusion experiments indicated that seed specificity of BnSCT1 expression is caused by an inducible promoter confining transcription to embryo tissues and the aleurone layer. A dsRNAi construct designed to silence seed-specifically the BnSCT1 gene was effective in reducing the sinapine content of Arabidopsis seeds thus defining SCT genes as targets for molecular breeding of low sinapine cultivars of B. napus. Sequence analyses revealed that in the allotetraploid genome of B. napus the gene BnSCT1 represents the C genome homologue from the B. oleracea progenitor whereas BnSCT2 was derived from the Brassica A genome of B. rapa. The BnSCT1 and BnSCT2 loci showed colinearity with the homologous Arabidopsis SNG2 gene locus although the genomic microstructure revealed the deletion of a cluster of three genes and several coding regions in the B. napus genome.
