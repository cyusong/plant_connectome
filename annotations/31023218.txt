Although the genome of Chinese white pear ('Dangshansuli') has been released, little is known about the functions, evolutionary history and expression patterns of NAC families in this species to date. In this study, we identified a total of 183 NAC transcription factors (TFs) in the pear genome, among which 146 pear NAC (PbNAC) members were mapped onto 16 chromosomes, and 37 PbNAC genes were located on scaffold contigs. No PbNAC genes were mapped to chromosome 2. Based on gene structure, protein motif analysis, and topology of the phylogenetic tree, the pear PbNAC family was classified into 33 groups. By comparing and analyzing the unique NAC subgroups in Rosaceae, we identified 19 NAC subgroups specific to pear. We also found that whole-genome duplication (WGD)/segmental duplication played critical roles in the expansion of the NAC family in pear, such as the 83 PbNAC duplicated gene pairs dated back to the two WGD events. Further, we found that purifying selection was the primary force driving the evolution of PbNAC family genes. Next, we used transcriptomic data to study responses to drought and cold stresses in pear, and we found that genes in groups C2f, C72b, and C100a were related to drought and cold stress response. Through the phylogenetic, evolutionary, and expression analyses of the NAC gene family in Chinese white pear, we indentified 11 PbNAC TFs associated with abiotic stress in pear.
