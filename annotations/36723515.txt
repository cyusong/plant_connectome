The plant extracellular ATP (eATP) receptor, P2K2, binds eATP with strong ligand affinity through its extracellular lectin domain. Ligand binding activates the intracellular kinase domain of P2K2 resulting in a variety of intracellular responses and, ultimately, increased plant immunity to invading fungal and bacterial pathogens. Here, using a computational prediction approach, we developed a tertiary structure model of the P2K2 extracellular lectin domain. <i>In silico</i> target docking of ATP to the P2K2-binding site predicted interaction with several residues through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Our confirmation of the modeling was obtained by showing that H99, R144, and S256 are key residues essential for <i>in vitro</i> binding of ATP by P2K2.
