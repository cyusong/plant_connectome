Sphingolipids are the structural components of membrane lipid bilayers and act as signaling molecules in many cellular processes. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first committed and rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo sphingolipids biosynthetic pathway. The core SPT enzyme is a heterodimer consisting of LONG-CHAIN BASE1 (LCB1) and LCB2 subunits. SPT activity is inhibited by orosomucoid proteins and stimulated by small subunits of SPT (ssSPTs). However, whether LCB1 is modified and how such modification might regulate SPT activity have to date been unclear. Here, we show that activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (MPK3) and MPK6 by upstream MKK9 and treatment with Flg22 (a pathogen-associated molecular pattern) increases SPT activity and induces the accumulation of sphingosine long-chain base t18:0 in Arabidopsis thaliana, with activated MPK3 and MPK6 phosphorylating AtLCB1. Phosphorylation of AtLCB1 strengthened its binding with AtLCB2b, promoted its binding with ssSPTs, and stimulated the formation of higher order oligomeric and active SPT complexes. Our findings therefore suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for SPT activity.

MKK9: !activates! MPK3/MPK6
MPK3/MPK6: !phosphorylates! AtLCB1
AtLCB1: !binds to! AtLCB2b/ssSPTs
AtLCB2b/ssSPTs: !form! higher order oligomeric SPT complexes
