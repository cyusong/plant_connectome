Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), which transfer either monomer or polymer of ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup> ) onto target proteins, are required for multiple processes in DNA damage repair, cell cycle, development, and abiotic stress in animals and plants. Here, the uncharacterized rice (Oryza sativa) OsPARP1, which has been predicted to have two alternative OsPARP1 mRNA splicing variants, OsPARP1.1 and OsPARP1.2, was investigated. However, bimolecular fluorescence complementation showed that only OsPARP1.1 interacted with OsPARP3 paralog, suggesting that OsPARP1.1 is a functional protein in rice. OsPARP1 was preferentially expressed in the stamen primordial and pollen grain of mature stamen during flower development. The osparp1 mutant and CRISPR plants were delayed in germination, indicating that defective DNA repair machinery impairs early seed germination. The mutant displayed a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but had a lower seed-setting rate than wild-type plants under normal conditions. Chromosome bridges and DNA fragmentations were detected in male meiocytes at anaphase I to prophase II. After meiosis II, malformed tetrads or tetrads with micronuclei were formed. Meanwhile, the abnormality was also found in embryo sac development. Collectively, these results suggest that OsPARP1 plays an important role in mediating response to DNA damage and gametophyte development, crucial for rice yield in the natural environment.
