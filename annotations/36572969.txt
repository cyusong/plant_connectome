Powdery mildew severely affects several important crops and cash plants. Disruption of <i>mildew resistance locus O</i> (<i>MLO</i>) genes elevates resistance against powdery mildew in several plants. However, whether rubber tree (<i>Heveae brasiliensis</i>) MLO proteins are linked to susceptibility remains unknown owing to technical limitations in the genetic manipulation of this woody plant. A previous study showed that the <i>H. brasiliensis</i> MLO-like protein HbMLO12 demonstrates high amino acid sequence similarity with the known <i>Arabidopsis</i> MLO protein AtMLO12. In this study, we investigated whether HbMLO12 regulates susceptibility to powdery mildew. <i>H. brasiliensis</i> leaves take up exogenously synthesized double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), and foliar application of dsRNA homologous to <i>HbMLO12</i> gene specifically induces <i>HbMLO12</i> silencing in <i>H. brasiliensis</i> leaf tissues. Notably, <i>HbMLO12</i> silencing inhibited fungal infection and elevated the immune response during interaction with the rubber tree powdery mildew fungus. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of HbMLO12 suppressed bacterial flg22- and fungal chitin-induced immune responses and enhanced bacterial infection in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Our study provides evidence that HbMLO12 contributes to susceptibility to powdery mildew.
