Nearly all extant land plants possess stomata, the epidermal structures that mediate gas exchange between the plant and the environment. The developmental pathways, cell division patterns, and molecules employed in the generation of these structures are simple examples of processes used in many developmental contexts. One specific module is a set of "master regulator" basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that regulate individual consecutive steps in stomatal development. Here, we profile transcriptional changes in response to inducible expression of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FAMA, a basic helix-loop-helix protein whose actions during the final stage in stomatal development regulate both cell division and cell fate. Genes identified by microarray and candidate approaches were then further analyzed to test specific hypothesis about the activity of FAMA, the shape of its regulatory network, and to create a new set of stomata-specific or stomata-enriched reporters.
