The greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza 7498) exhibits trophic diversity (photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, photoheterotrophic, and mixotrophic growth) depending on the availability of exogenous organic carbon sources and light. Here, we show that the ability to transition between various trophic growth conditions is an advantageous trait, providing great phenotypic plasticity and metabolic flexibility in S. polyrhiza 7498. By comparing S. polyrhiza 7498 growth characteristics, metabolic acclimation, and cellular ultrastructure across these trophic modes, we show that mixotrophy decreases photosynthetic performance and relieves the CO<sub>2</sub> limitation of photosynthesis by enhancing the CO<sub>2</sub> supply through the active respiration pathway. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses corroborated that S. polyrhiza 7498 increases its intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> and decreases reactive oxygen species under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions, which substantially suppressed the wasteful photorespiration and oxidative-damage pathways. As a consequence, mixotrophy resulted in a higher biomass yield than the sum of photoautotrophy and heterotrophy. Our work provides a basis for using trophic transitions in S. polyrhiza 7498 for the enhanced accumulation of value-added products.
