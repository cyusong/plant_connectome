['21749503', 'We have identified a gene, Lateral Root Development 3 (LRD3), that is important  for maintaining a balance between primary and lateral root growth. The lrd3  mutant has decreased primary root growth and increased lateral root growth. We  determined that the LRD3 gene encodes a LIM-domain protein of unknown function.  LRD3 is expressed only in the phloem companion cells, which suggested a role in  phloem function. Indeed, while phloem loading and export from the shoot appear to  be normal, delivery of phloem to the primary root tip is limited severely in  young seedlings. Abnormalities in phloem morphology in these seedlings indicate  that LRD3 is essential for correct early phloem development. There is a  subsequent spontaneous recovery of normal phloem morphology, which is correlated  tightly with increased phloem delivery and growth of the primary root. The LRD3  gene is one of very few genes described to affect phloem development, and the  only one that is specific to early phloem development. Continuous growth on auxin  also leads to recovery of phloem development and function in lrd3, which  demonstrates that auxin plays a key role in early phloem development. The root  system architecture and the pattern of phloem allocation in the lrd3 root system  suggested that there may be regulated mechanisms for selectively supporting  certain lateral roots when the primary root is compromised. Therefore, this study  provides new insights into phloem-mediated resource allocation and its effects on  plant root system architecture.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04700.x', 'Malamy']
