Barnyardgrass [<i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> (L.) P. Beauv.] is the most difficult-to-control weed species of rice production systems worldwide. It has evolved resistance to different herbicide sites of action, including the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicides. Target-site mutations conferring resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides are well documented; however, the role of the different <i>ACCase</i> genes in conferring resistance to cyhalofop-p-butyl (cyhalofop), an ACCase-inhibiting herbicide, remains poorly understood. This research assessed the contribution of gene amplification and expression of <i>ACCase</i> genes in a cyhalofop-resistant barnyardgrass accession. Additionally, the expression of <i>glutathione-S-transferases</i> (<i>GST</i>s) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (<i>P450</i>s) genes as possible contributors to resistance to cyhalofop were investigated. Results demonstrated that <i>ACCase</i> gene amplification does not contribute to cyhalofop resistance. However, <i>ACCase1</i> and <i>ACCase3</i> were found to be overexpressed in the cyhalofop-resistant barnyardgrass accession. At 24 h after cyhalofop treatment, an overexpression of 2.0- and 2.8-fold was detected in <i>ACCase1</i> and <i>ACCase3</i>, respectively. In addition, <i>CYP81A21</i> (a <i>P450</i> gene) was found to be 2.5-fold overexpressed compared to the susceptible accession in the same time period. These results suggest that <i>ACCase1, ACCase3</i>, and <i>CYP81A21</i> are crucial genes in contributing cyhalofop resistance in this barnyardgrass accession.
