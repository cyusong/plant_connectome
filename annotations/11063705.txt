['11063705', 'Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is widely used in agriculture because it induces  rooting. To better understand the in vivo role of this endogenous auxin, we have  identified 14 Arabidopsis mutants that are resistant to the inhibitory effects of  IBA on root elongation, but that remain sensitive to the more abundant auxin  indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). These mutants have defects in various IBA-mediated  responses, which allowed us to group them into four phenotypic classes.  Developmental defects in the absence of exogenous sucrose suggest that some of  these mutants are impaired in peroxisomal fatty acid chain shortening, implying  that the conversion of IBA to IAA is also disrupted. Other mutants appear to have  normal peroxisomal function; some of these may be defective in IBA transport,  signaling, or response. Recombination mapping indicates that these mutants  represent at least nine novel loci in Arabidopsis. The gene defective in one of  the mutants was identified using a positional approach and encodes PEX5, which  acts in the import of most peroxisomal matrix proteins. These results indicate  that in Arabidopsis thaliana, IBA acts, at least in part, via its conversion to  IAA.', '2000 Nov', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/156.3.1323', 'Bartel']
