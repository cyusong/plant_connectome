A large number of plant RNA viruses circulate between plants and insects. For RNA viruses, host alternations may impose a differential selective pressure on viral populations and induce variations in viral genomes. Here, we report the variations in the 3'-terminal regions of the multiple-segment RNA virus Rice stripe virus (RSV) that were discovered through de novo assembly of the genome using RNA sequencing data from infected host plants and vector insects. The newly assembled RSV genome contained 16- and 15-nt extensions at the 3'-termini of two genome segments compared with the published reference RSV genome. Our study demonstrated that these extensional sequences were consistently observed in two RSV isolates belonging to distinct genetic subtypes in RSV-infected rice, wheat and tobacco. Moreover, the de novo assembled genome of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus also contained 3'-terminal extensions in five RNA segments compared with the reference genome. Time course experiments confirmed that the 3'-terminal extensions of RSV were enriched in the vector insects, were gradually eliminated in the host plant and potentially affected viral replication. These findings indicate that variations in the 3'-termini of viral genomes may be different adaptive strategies for plant RNA viruses in insects and plants.
