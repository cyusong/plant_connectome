The Arctic is the endpoint of many climatic gradients and is presently occupied by c. 2200 vascular plant species. Glaciation started in the Middle Eocene but a significant expansion of the Greenland ice shield occurred only c. 3.2 million yr ago, leading to the expansion of the treeless circumpolar arctic tundra. Available molecular phylogenetic studies were evaluated for 148 of 374 genera occurring in the Arctic to determine the relative roles of their independent origins and their diversification in the development of the contemporary arctic flora. The number of arctic species paralleled the total number of species in a genus. Multiple arctic species within a genus originated mostly independently of each other and from different lineages. Minor radiations occurred in only a few genera and major radiations were absent. Mostly parallel evolution of arctic taxa from nonarctic ancestors, supposedly of different ages of origin, scarcity of radiations and rarity of endemics are main features of the arctic flora.
