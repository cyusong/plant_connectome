The recovery and maintenance of plant homeostasis under stressful environments are complex processes involving organelle crosstalk for a coordinated cellular response. Here, we revealed through nuclear and chloroplast subcellular proteomics, biochemical cell profiles and targeted transcriptomics how chloroplasts and nuclei developed their responses under increased temperatures in a long-lived species (Pinus radiata). Parallel to photosynthetic impairment and reactive oxygen species production in the chloroplast, a DNA damage response was triggered in the nucleus followed by an altered chromatin conformation. In addition, in the nuclei, we found several proteins, such as HEMERA or WHIRLY, which change their locations from the chloroplasts to the nuclei carrying the stress message. Additionally, our data showed a deep rearrangement of RNA metabolism in both organelles, revealing microRNAs and AGO1 as potential regulators of the acclimation mechanisms. Altogether, our study highlights the synchronisation among the different stages required for thermotolerance acquisition in P. radiata, pointing out the role of chromatin conformation and posttranscriptional gene regulation in overcoming heat stress and assuring plant survival for the following years.
