Since chlorophyll fluorescence reflects the redox state of photosynthetic electron transport chain, monitoring of chlorophyll fluorescence has been successfully applied for the screening of photosynthesis-related genes. Here we report that the mutants having a defect in the regulation of photosystem stoichiometry could be identified through the simple comparison of the induction kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence. We made a library containing 500 mutants in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with transposon-mediated gene disruption, and the mutants were used for the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics for 45 s. We picked up two genes, pmgA and sll1961, which are involved in the modulation of photosystem stoichiometry. The disruptants of the two genes share common characteristics in their fluorescence kinetics, and we searched for mutants that showed such characteristics. Out of six mutants identified so far, five showed a different photosystem stoichiometry under high-light conditions. Thus, categorization based on the similarity of fluorescence kinetics is an excellent way to identify the function of genes.
