Seed size is a major factor determining crop yields that is controlled through the coordinated development of maternal and zygotic tissues. Here, we identified Arabidopsis MATERNAL EFFECT EMBRYO ARREST45 (MEE45) as a B3 transcription factor that controls cell proliferation and maternally regulates seed size through its transcriptional activation of AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and its downstream control of auxin biosynthesis in the ovule integument. After characterizing reduced seed and organ size phenotypes in mee45 mutants and finding that overexpression of MEE45 causes oversized seeds, we discovered that the MEE45 protein can bind to the promoter region of the ANT locus and positively regulate its transcription. ANT in-turn activates the expression of auxin biosynthetic genes (e.g. YUCCA4) in the ovule integument. Our results thus illustrate mechanisms underlying maternal tissue-mediated regulation of seed size and suggest that MEE45 and its downstream components can be harnessed to develop higher-yielding crop varieties.
