Fruit set-the commitment of an angiosperm plant to develop fruit-is a key developmental process that normally occurs following successful fertilization. Parthenocarpy arises when fruit automatically develop in the absence of fertilization. This review uses parthenocarpic fruit development as a focal device through which to recapitulate and understand the molecular effectors that mediate and regulate fruit set. The review demonstrates that studies of parthenocarpy are providing vital insight into plant development, signaling and, potentially, high-value agricultural products.
