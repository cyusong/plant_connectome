['11296239', 'Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) provides protection in plants against  virus infection and can suppress expression of transgenes. Arabidopsis plants  carrying mutations at the SDE3 locus are defective in PTGS mediated by a green  fluorescent protein transgene. However, PTGS mediated by tobacco rattle virus  (TRV) was not affected by sde3. From these results we conclude that SDE3, like  the previously described RNA polymerase encoded by SDE1, acts at a stage in the  mechanism that is circumvented when PTGS is mediated by TRV. The product of SDE3  is similar to RNA helicase-like proteins including GB110 in mouse and other  proteins in Drosophila and humans. These proteins are similar to, but clearly  distinct from Upf1p and SMG-2, which are required for nonsense-mediated mRNA  decay in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans and, in the case of SMG-2, for PTGS.', '2001 Apr 17', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/20.8.2069', 'Baulcombe']
