Hand-held Raman spectroscopy is a potential tool for a confirmatory, non-invasive, and non-destructive detection and identification of rose rosette disease. Using this spectroscopic approach, structural changes in roses that are associated with this viral infection can be revealed. The commercial rose shrub industry in the United States is one of the largest of its kind. All commercial rose varieties are susceptible to rose rosette disease (RRD), a deadly viral disease vectored by eriophyid mites. This disease is typically diagnosed visually and/or by PCR-based detection assays. The present work demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy can detect RRD in intact leaf tissue. It is shown that chemometric analysis can distinguish between spectra collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic tissue, as well as between healthy and asymptomatic tissue. This method will be useful as an initial screen for RRD prior to PCR analysis to help conserve reagents and save time.
