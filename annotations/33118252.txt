For diploid organisms that are highly heterozygous, a phased haploid genome can greatly aid in functional genomic, population genetic and breeding studies. Based on the genome sequencing of 135 single sperm cells of the elite tea cultivar 'Fudingdabai', we herein phased the genome of Camellia sinensis, one of the most popular beverage crops worldwide. High-resolution genetic and recombination maps of Fudingdabai were constructed, which revealed that crossover (CO) positions were frequently located in the 5' and 3' ends of annotated genes, while CO distributions across the genome were random. The low CO frequency in tea can be explained by strong CO interference, and CO simulation revealed the proportion of interference insensitive CO ranged from 5.2% to 11.7%. We furthermore developed a method to infer the relatedness between tea accessions and detected complex kinship and genetic signatures of 106 tea accessions. Among them, 59 accessions were closely related with Fudingdabai and 31 of them were first-degree relatives. We additionally identified genes displaying allele specific expression patterns between the two haplotypes of Fudingdabai and genes displaying significantly differential expression levels between Fudingdabai and other haplotypes. These results lay the foundation for further investigation of genetic and epigenetic factors underpinning the regulation of gene expression and provide insights into the evolution of tea plants as well as a valuable genetic resource for future breeding efforts.
