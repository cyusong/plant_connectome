The salinity tolerance of two commercial rootstocks used for loquat plants (Eribotrya japonica Lindl.), loquat and anger, was studied in a pot experiment. The plants were irrigated using solutions containing 5 and 50mM NaCl and 5 and 25mM calcium acetate for 4 months. The growth, tissue mineral content, water status, and leaf gas exchange responses to salt treatment with and without additional calcium were examined. Plant growth was not modified by salinity in anger (50mM), but was reduced in loquat; leaf biomass and stem diameter were particularly affected. However, Cl(-) levels leaf increased with salinity to a greater extent in anger, while the Na(+) content increased to the same extent in both species, indicating that ion transport from root to leaves was not inhibited in either species. Additional calcium (25mM) reduced Na(+) and Cl(-) concentrations in both species, but did not minimise the effects of salinity on the growth of salt-treated loquat plants. The decrease in K(+) concentrations had no effect on growth, as anger was the most tolerant rootstock and had lowest leaf K(+) content. Salinity reduced the Ca(2+) concentration in the roots of both species. However, when calcium was added, the concentration of Ca(2+) increased in the roots of salinised plants. Leaf water potential at pre-dawn decreased significantly in both species under saline conditions. Leaf gas exchange, stomatal conductance and, in particular, net CO(2) assimilation, decreased with salinity only in loquat, indicating that photosynthesis could be the growth-limiting factor in this species.
