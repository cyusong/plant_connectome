SarkOne is a genus-specific satellite-DNA family, isolated from the genomes of the species of the genus Sarcocapnos. This satellite DNA is composed of repeats with a consensus length of 855 bp and a mean G+C content of 52.5%. We have sequenced a total of 189 SarkOne monomeric repeats belonging to a total of seven species of the genus Sarcocapnos. The comparative analysis of these sequences both at the intraspecific and the interspecific levels have revealed divergence patterns between species are proportional to between-species divergence according to the phylogeny of the genus. Our study demonstrates that the molecular drive leading to the concerted-evolution pattern of this satellite DNA is a time-dependent process by which new mutations are spreading through genomes and populations at a gradual pace. However, time is a limiting factor in the observation of concerted evolution in some pairwise comparisons. Thus, pairwise comparisons of species sharing a recent common ancestor did not reveal nucleotide sites in transitional stages higher than stage III according to the Strachan's model. By contrast, there was a gradation in the percentage of upper transition stages (IV, V, VI) the more phylogenetically distant the species were. In addition, closely related species shared a high number of polymorphic sites, but these types of sites were not common when comparing more distant species. All these data are discussed in the light of current life-cycle models of satellite-DNA evolution.
