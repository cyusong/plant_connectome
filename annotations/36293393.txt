Root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> is a major factor that affects crop growth, development, nutrient uptake, and metabolism. Oriental melon is affected by root-zone gases during growth, the microstructure, sugar and starch contents, enzymatic activities related to sugar and starch metabolism, and gene expression in the roots of oriental melon seedlings were investigated under three root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (CK: 0.2%, T1: 0.4%, T2: 1.1%). Elevated root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> altered the cellular microstructure, accelerated the accumulation and release of starch grains, disrupted organelle formation, and accelerated root senescence. The sugar and starch contents and metabolic activity in the roots increased within a short duration following treatment. Compared to the control, 232 and 1492 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified on the 6th day of treatment in T1 and T2 plants, respectively. The DEGs were enriched in three metabolic pathways. The majority of genes related to sucrose and starch hydrolysis were upregulated, while the genes related to sucrose metabolism were downregulated. The study revealed that oriental melon seedlings adapt to elevated root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> stress by adjusting sugar and starch metabolism at the transcriptome level and provides new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the response to elevated root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> stress.
