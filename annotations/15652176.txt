['15652176', 'With the aim of elucidating how plants synthesize lysine, extracts prepared from  corn, tobacco, Chlamydomonas and soybean were tested and found to lack detectable  amounts of N-alpha-acyl-L,L-diaminopimelate deacylase or  N-succinyl-alpha-amino-epsilon-ketopimelate-glutamate aminotransaminase, two key  enzymes in the central part of the bacterial pathway for lysine biosynthesis.  Corn extracts missing two key enzymes still carried out the overall synthesis of  lysine when provided with dihydrodipicolinate. An analysis of available plant DNA  sequences was performed to test the veracity of the negative biochemical  findings. Orthologs of dihydrodipicolinate reductase and diaminopimelate  epimerase (enzymes on each side of the central pathway) were readily found in the  Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Orthologs of the known enzymes needed to convert  tetrahydrodipicolinate to diaminopimelic acid (DAP) were not detected in  Arabidopsis or in the plant DNA sequence databases. The biochemical and  reinforcing bioinformatics results provide evidence that plants may use a novel  variant of the bacterial pathways for lysine biosynthesis.', '2005 Jan 18', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2004.09.008', 'Leustek']
