To study the mechanisms of exogenous NO contribution to alleviate the cadmium (Cd) toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa), rice plantlets subjected to 0.2-mM CdCl(2) exposure were treated with different concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor), and Cd toxicity was evaluated by the decreases in plant length, biomass production and chlorophyll content. The results indicated that 0.1 mM SNP alleviated Cd toxicity most obviously. Atomic absorption spectrometry and fluorescence localization showed that treatment with 0.1 mM SNP decreased Cd accumulation in both cell walls and soluble fraction of leaves, although treatment with 0.1 mM SNP increased Cd accumulation in the cell wall of rice roots obviously. Treatment with 0.1 mM SNP in nutrient solution had little effect on the transpiration rate of rice leaves, but this treatment increased pectin and hemicellulose content and decreased cellulose content significantly in the cell walls of rice roots. Based on these results, we conclude that decreased distribution of Cd in the soluble fraction of leaves and roots and increased distribution of Cd in the cell walls of roots are responsible for the NO-induced increase of Cd tolerance in rice. It seems that exogenous NO enhances Cd tolerance of rice by increasing pectin and hemicellulose content in the cell wall of roots, increasing Cd accumulation in root cell wall and decreasing Cd accumulation in soluble fraction of leaves.

NO: !enhances! Cd tolerance
NO: !increases! pectin/hemicellulose content
NO: !increases! Cd accumulation in root cell wall
NO: !decreases! Cd accumulation in soluble fraction of leaves
