Phenolic acids are the major secondary metabolites and significant bioactive constituents of the medicinal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza. Many enzyme-encoding genes and transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic acids have been identified, but the underlying post-translational regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the S. miltiorrhiza Kelch repeat F-box protein SmKFB5 physically interacts with three phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) isozymes and mediates their proteolytic turnover via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. Disturbing the expression of SmKFB5 reciprocally affected the abundance of SmPAL protein and the accumulation of phenolic acids, suggesting that SmKFB5 is a post-translational regulator responsible for the turnover of PAL and negatively controlling phenolic acids. Furthermore, we discovered that treatment of the hairy root of S. miltiorrhiza with methyl jasmonate suppressed the expression of SmKFB5 while inducing the transcription of SmPAL1 and SmPAL3. These data suggested that methyl jasmonate consolidated both transcriptional and post-translational regulation mechanisms to enhance phenolic acid biosynthesis. Taken together, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which SmKFB5 mediates the regulation of phenolic acid biosynthesis by jasmonic acid, and suggest valuable targets for plant breeders in tailoring new cultivars.
