We previously identified six drought-inducible CC-type glutaredoxins in cassava cultivars, however, less is known about their potential role in the molecular mechanism by which cassava adapted to abiotic stress. Herein, we investigate one of cassava drought-responsive CC-type glutaredoxins, namely MeGRXC3, that involved in regulation of mannitol-induced inhibition on seed germination and seedling growth in transgenic Arabidopsis. MeGRXC3 overexpression up-regulates several stress-related transcription factor genes, such as PDF1.2, ERF6, ORA59, DREB2A, WRKY40, and WRKY53 in Arabidopsis. Protein interaction assays show that MeGRXC3 interacts with Arabidopsis TGA2 and TGA5 in the nucleus. Eliminated nuclear localization of MeGRXC3 failed to result mannitol-induced inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth in transgenic Arabidopsis. Mutation analysis of MeGRXC3 indicates the importance of conserved motifs for its transactivation activity in yeast. Additionally, these motifs are also indispensable for its functionality in regulating mannitol-induced inhibition of seed germination and enhancement of the stress-related transcription factors in transgenic Arabidopsis. MeGRXC3 overexpression confers mannitol sensitivity in transgenic Arabidopsis possibly through interaction with TGA2/5 in the nucleus, and nuclear activity of MeGRXC3 is required for its function.
