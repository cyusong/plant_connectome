Terrestrial plant pollen is classified into two categories based on its metabolic status: pollen with low-metabolism are termed "orthodox" and pollen with high-metabolism are termed "recalcitrant." Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is crucial for a number of metabolisms in all extant organisms. It has recently been shown that NAD homeostasis plays an important role in a broad range of developmental processes and responses to environment. Recently, a reverse genetic approach shed light on the significance of NAD biosynthesis on pollen fate. In orthodox Arabidopsis pollen, NAD(+) that was accumulated in excess at dispersal dramatically decreased on rehydration. The lack of a key gene that is involved in NAD biosynthesis compromised the excess accumulation. Moreover, absence of the excess accumulation phenocopied the so-called recalcitrant pollen, as demonstrated by the germination inside anthers and the loss of desiccation tolerance. Upon rehydration, NAD(+)-consuming inhibitors impaired tube germination. Taken together, our results suggest that accumulation of NAD(+) functions as a physiochemical molecular switch for suspended metabolism and that the decrease of NAD(+) plays a very important role during transitions in metabolic states. Shifting of the redox state to an oxidizing environment may efficiently control the comprehensive metabolic network underlying the onset of pollen germination.
