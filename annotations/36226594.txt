Upland cotton is an important global cash crop for its long seed fibers and high edible oil and protein content. Progress in cotton genomics promotes the advancement of cotton genetics, evolutionary studies, functional genetics, and breeding, and has ushered cotton research and breeding into a new era. Here, we summarize high-impact genomics studies for cotton from the last 10 years. The diploid Gossypium arboreum and allotetraploid Gossypium hirsutum are the main focus of most genetic and genomic studies. We next review recent progress in cotton molecular biology and genetics, which builds on cotton genome sequencing efforts, population studies, and functional genomics, to provide insights into the mechanisms shaping abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, plant architecture, seed oil content, and fiber development. We also suggest the application of novel technologies and strategies to facilitate genome-based crop breeding. Explosive growth in the amount of novel genomic data, identified genes, gene modules, and pathways is now enabling researchers to utilize multidisciplinary genomics-enabled breeding strategies to cultivate "super cotton", synergistically improving multiple traits. These strategies must rise to meet urgent demands for a sustainable cotton industry.
