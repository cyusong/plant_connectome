Salt-affected farmlands are increasingly burdened by chlorides, carbonates, and sulfates of sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Intriguingly, the underlying physiological processes are studied almost always under NaCl stress. Two faba bean cultivars were subjected to low- and high-salt treatments of NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> , and KCl. Assimilation rate and leaf water vapor conductance were reduced to approximately 25-30% without biomass reduction after 7 days salt stress, but this did not cause severe carbon shortage. The equimolar treatments of Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> , and Cl<sup>-</sup> showed comparable accumulation patterns in leaves and roots, except for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> which did not accumulate. To gain a detailed understanding of the effects caused by the tested ion combinations, we performed nontargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling. Metabolic responses to various salts were in part highly linearly correlated, but only a few metabolite responses were common to all salts and in both cultivars. At high salt concentrations, only myo-inositol, allantoin, and glycerophosphoglycerol were highly significantly increased in roots under all tested conditions. We discovered several metabolic responses that were preferentially associated with the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> , or Cl<sup>-</sup> . For example, increases of leaf proline and decreases of leaf fumaric acid and malic acid were apparently associated with Cl<sup>-</sup> accumulation.
