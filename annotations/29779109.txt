['29779109', 'For the first time, the organ-specific expression pattern of the AtUSP  (At3g58450) gene, which also undergoes hormonal regulation, was shown. The USP  protein encoded by this gene is involved in seed germination of Arabidopsis  thaliana and, unlike abscisic acid, stimulates this process.', '2018 Mar', 'Dokl Biochem Biophys', '10.1134/S1607672918020151', 'Pojidaeva']
