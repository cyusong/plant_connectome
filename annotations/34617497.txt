Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway for the degradation of damaged or toxic components. Under normal conditions, autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis. It can be triggered by senescence and various stresses. In the process of autophagy, autophagy-related (ATG) proteins not only function as central signal regulators but also participate in the development of complex survival mechanisms when plants suffer from adverse environments. Therefore, ATGs play significant roles in metabolism, development and stress tolerance. In the past decade, both the molecular mechanisms of autophagy and a large number of components involved in the assembly of autophagic vesicles have been identified. In recent studies, an increasing number of components, mechanisms, and receptors have appeared in the autophagy pathway. In this paper, we mainly review the recent progress of research on the molecular mechanisms of plant autophagy, as well as its function under biotic stress and abiotic stress.
