High salinity is an important factor limiting agriculture as major crops are salt sensitive. Understanding salt stress signalling is key to producing salt tolerant crops. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a crucial regulator of signalling proteins in eukaryotes. Attachment of SUMO onto substrates is reversible and SUMO-proteases which specifically cleave the SUMO-substrate linkages play a vital regulatory role during SUMOylation. We have identified two SUMO proteases OTS1 and OTS2 that act redundantly to regulate salt stress responses in Arabidopsis. <i>ots1 ots2</i> double mutants show extreme sensitivity to salt. However during non-salt conditions, <i>ots1 ots2</i> double mutants are phenotypically similar to wild-type plants in terms of growth and development. Overexpressing SUMO1 in the <i>ots1 ots2</i> double mutants severally diminishes plant size as quantified by rosette diameter even under non-stressed conditions. This reduction in plant growth is reminiscent of <i>ots1 ots2</i> double mutants under salt stress. Our data indicates that overSUMOylation of target proteins can have severe effects on plant growth and that SUMO proteases like OTS1/2 are key to maintaining cellular balance of SUMOylation. We propose that upon environmental stress the hyperSUMOylation of key target proteins act to retard growth to survive stress periods.
