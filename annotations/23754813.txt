['23754813', 'Photosynthetic electron transport regulates chloroplast gene transcription  through the action of a bacterial-type sensor kinase known as chloroplast sensor  kinase (CSK). CSK represses photosystem I (PS I) gene transcription in PS I light  and thus initiates photosystem stoichiometry adjustment. In cyanobacteria and in  non-green algae, CSK homologues co-exist with their response regulator partners  in canonical bacterial two-component systems. In green algae and plants, however,  no response regulator partner of CSK is found. Yeast two-hybrid analysis has  revealed interaction of CSK with sigma factor 1 (SIG1) of chloroplast RNA  polymerase. Here we present further evidence for the interaction between CSK and  SIG1. We also show that CSK interacts with quinone. Arabidopsis SIG1 becomes  phosphorylated in PS I light, which then specifically represses transcription of  PS I genes. In view of the identical signalling properties of CSK and SIG1 and of  their interactions, we suggest that CSK is a SIG1 kinase. We propose that the  selective repression of PS I genes arises from the operation of a gene-regulatory  phosphoswitch in SIG1. The CSK-SIG1 system represents a novel, rewired  chloroplast-signalling pathway created by evolutionary tinkering. This regulatory  system supports a proposal for the selection pressure behind the evolutionary  stasis of chloroplast genes.', '2013 Jul 19', 'Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci', '10.1098/rstb.2012.0260', 'Allen']
