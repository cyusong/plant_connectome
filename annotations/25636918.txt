['25636918', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, multiple genes involved in shoot apical meristem (SAM)  transitions have been characterized, but the mechanisms required for the dynamic  attainment of vegetative, inflorescence, and floral meristem (VM, IM, FM) cell  fates during SAM transitions are not well understood. Here we show that a  MADS-box gene, XAANTAL2 (XAL2/AGL14), is necessary and sufficient to induce  flowering, and its regulation is important in FM maintenance and determinacy.  xal2 mutants are late flowering, particularly under short-day (SD) condition,  while XAL2 overexpressing plants are early flowering, but their flowers have  vegetative traits. Interestingly, inflorescences of the latter plants have higher  expression levels of LFY, AP1, and TFL1 than wild-type plants. In addition we  found that XAL2 is able to bind the TFL1 regulatory regions. On the other hand,  the basipetal carpels of the 35S::XAL2 lines lose determinacy and maintain high  levels of WUS expression under SD condition. To provide a mechanistic explanation  for the complex roles of XAL2 in SAM transitions and the apparently paradoxical  phenotypes of XAL2 and other MADS-box (SOC1, AGL24) overexpressors, we conducted  dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN) and epigenetic landscape modeling. We  uncovered a GRN module that underlies VM, IM, and FM gene configurations and  transition patterns in wild-type plants as well as loss and gain of function  lines characterized here and previously. Our approach thus provides a novel  mechanistic framework for understanding the complex basis of SAM development.', '2015 May', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2015.01.017', 'Alvarez-Buylla']
