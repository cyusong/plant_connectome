During their life, plants have to cope with a variety of abiotic stresses. Cadmium is highly toxic to plants, water soluble and therefore promptly adsorbed in tissues and its presence greatly influences the entire plant metabolism. In this review, we focus on the signal pathways responsible for the sensing and transduction of the "metal signal" inside the cell, ultimately driving the activation of transcription factors and consequent expression of genes that enable plants to counteract the heavy metal stress.
