['10402459', 'Prokaryotes and prokaryote-derived thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts share  multiple, evolutionarily conserved pathways for protein export. These include the  Sec, signal recognition particle (SRP), and Delta pH/Tat systems. Little is known  regarding the thylakoid membrane components involved in these pathways. We  isolated a cDNA clone to a novel component of the Delta pH pathway, Tha4, and  prepared antibodies against pea Tha4, against maize Hcf106, a protein implicated  in Delta pH pathway transport by genetic studies, and against cpSecY, the  thylakoid homologue of the bacterial SecY translocon protein. These components  were localized to the nonappressed thylakoid membranes. Tha4 and Hcf106 were  present in approximately 10-fold excess over active translocation sites.  Antibodies to either Tha4 or Hcf106 inhibited translocation of four known Delta  pH pathway substrate proteins, but not of Sec pathway or SRP pathway substrates.  This suggests that Tha4 and Hcf106 operate either in series or as subunits of a  heteromultimeric complex. cpSecY antibodies inhibited translocation of Sec  pathway substrates but not of Delta pH or SRP pathway substrates. These studies  provide the first biochemical evidence that Tha4 and Hcf106 are specific  components of the Delta pH pathway and provide one line of evidence that cpSecY  is used specifically by the Sec pathway.', '1999 Jul 12', 'J Cell Biol', '10.1083/jcb.146.1.45', 'Cline']
