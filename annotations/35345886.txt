Seventy host-adapted gene (<i>HAG</i>) effector family members from <i>Pyricularia</i> species are found in <i>P. oryzae</i> and three closely related species (isolates LS and 18-2 from an unknown <i>Pyricularia</i> sp., <i>P. grisea</i>, and <i>P. pennisetigena</i>) that share at least eight orthologous <i>HAG</i> family members with <i>P. oryzae</i>. The genome sequence of a more distantly related species, <i>P. penniseti</i>, lacks <i>HAG</i> genes, suggesting a time frame for the origin of the gene family in the genus<i>.</i> In <i>P. oryzae</i>, <i>HAG4</i> is uniquely found in the genetic lineage that contains populations adapted to <i>Setaria</i> and <i>Oryza</i> hosts. We find a nearly identical <i>HAG4</i> allele in a <i>P. grisea</i> isolate, suggesting transfer of <i>HAG4</i> from <i>P. grisea</i> to <i>P. oryzae</i>. <i>HAG4</i> encodes a suppressor of plant cell death. Yeast two-hybrid screens with several <i>HAG</i> genes independently identify common interacting clones from a rice complementary DNA library, suggesting conservation of protein surface motifs between <i>HAG</i> homologs with as little as 40% protein sequence identity. <i>HAG</i> family orthologs have diverged rapidly and <i>HAG15</i> orthologs display unusually high rates of sequence divergence compared with adjacent genes suggesting gene-specific accelerated divergence. The sequence diversity of the <i>HAG</i> homologs in <i>Pyricularia</i> species provides a resource for examining mechanisms of gene family evolution and the relationship to structural and functional evolution of <i>HAG</i> effector family activity.
