<i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i> causes the disease known as septoria leaf blotch in winter wheat and is a major factor in yield loss worldwide. Farmers are inclined to use fungicides to protect their crops; however, the efficacy of these measures is rapidly decreasing due to the natural mechanisms of mutation emergence in pathogen populations. Increasing fungicide resistance is being recorded worldwide, therefore, screening of the current situation in Lithuania is essential to determine the subsequent steps of crop protection strategies. In this study, <i>in vitro</i> fungicide sensitivity tests, mutation detection, and field experiments were carried out. The mean EC<sub>50</sub> values for prothioconazole-desthio and mefentrifluconazole were 0.14 and 0.28 mg/l, respectively. Increased frequency of the mutation S524T, linked to DMIs resistance, was observed. Results revealed that the dominant point mutation in the gene <i>CYP51</i> was I381V, and the most frequent <i>CYP51</i> haplotype was D13 (V136C, I381V, Y461H, S524T). The mutation G143A, linked to QoI resistance, was detected in ¾ of the population. Mutations conferring resistance to SDHIs were not detected in single pycnidium isolates. Two-year field experiments likewise showed no decline in field efficacy of SDHI fungicide in Lithuania. Moreover, the baseline sensitivity of the Lithuanian <i>Z. tritici</i> population to QiI fungicide fenpicoxamid was established. The findings of this study provide an update on the current status of fungicide resistance in the Lithuanian <i>Z. tritici</i> population.
