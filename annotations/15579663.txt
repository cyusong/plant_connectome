The determinants of the thioredoxin (TRX)-dependent redox regulation of the chloroplastic NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicate that a single C-terminal disulfide is responsible for this regulation. The redox midpoint potential of this disulfide is less negative than that of the higher plant enzyme. The regulation is of an all-or-nothing type, lacking the fine-tuning provided by the second N-terminal disulfide found only in NADP-MDH from higher plants. The decreased stability of specific cysteine/alanine mutants is consistent with the presence of a structural disulfide formed by two cysteine residues that are not involved in regulation of activity. Measurements of the ability of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin f (TRX f) to activate wild-type and site-directed mutants of sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) NADP-MDH suggest that the algal TRX f has a redox midpoint potential that is less negative than most those of higher plant TRXs f. These results are discussed from an evolutionary point of view.
