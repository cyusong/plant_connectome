Our study focused on the mediatory role of galactoglucomannan oligosaccharides (GGMOs) in plant protection against cadmium stress, examined mainly on the primary root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana. The application of GGMOs diminished the negative effect of cadmium on root length, root growth dynamics and also on photosynthetic pigment content. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of GGMOs is associated with decreased cadmium accumulation or its modified distribution. Cadmium distribution was observed chronologically from the first day of plant culture and depended on the duration of cadmium treatment. First, cadmium was stored in the root and hypocotyl and later transported by xylem to the leaves and stored there in trichomes. The protective effect of GGMOs was not based on modified cadmium distribution or its decreased accumulation. In cadmium and GGMOs+cadmium-treated plants, the formation of suberin lamellae was shifted closer to the root apex compared to the control and GGMOs. No significant changes between cadmium and GGMOs+cadmium variants in suberin lamellae development corresponded with any differences in cadmium uptake. GGMOs also stimulated Arabidopsis root growth under non-stress conditions. In this case, suberin lamellae were developed more distantly from the root apex in comparison with the control. Faster solute and water transport could explain the faster plant growth induced by GGMOs. Our results suggest that, in cadmium-stressed plants, GGMOs' protective action is associated with the response at the metabolic level.
