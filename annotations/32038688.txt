['32038688', "Flowering plants have evolved two distinct clades of chloroplast GrpE homologues  (CGEs), which are the nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70. In Arabidopsis, they  are named AtCGE1 (At5g17710) and AtCGE2 (At1g36390). Characterization of their  corresponding T-DNA insertion mutants revealed that there is no visible change in  phenotype except a defect in protein import in an AtCGE2-knockout mutant under  normal growth conditions. However, the embryo development of an AtCGE1-knockout  mutant was arrested early at the globular stage. An AtCGE1-knockdown mutant,  harboring a T-DNA insertion in the 5'-UTR region, exhibited growth retardation  and protein import defect, and its mutant phenotypes became more severe when  AtCGE2 was further knocked out. Sub-organellar distribution implied that AtCGE2  might be important for membrane biology due to its preferential association with  chloroplast membranes. Biochemical studies and complementation tests showed that  only AtCGE1, but not AtCGE2, can effectively rescue the heat-sensitive phenotype  of Escherichia coli grpE mutant and robustly stimulate the refolding of denatured  luciferase by DnaK. Interestingly, AtCGE1 and AtCGE2 are tending to form  heterocomplexes, which exhibit comparable co-chaperone activity to AtCGE1  homocomplexes. Our data indicate that AtCGE1 is the principle functional  homologue of GrpE. The possibility that AtCGE2 has a subsidiary or regulatory  function through homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization is discussed.", '2019', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2019.01719', 'Lai']
