Drought is one of the most important abiotic stress factors impeding crop productivity. With the uncovering of their role as potential regulators of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as new targets for developing stress resistance. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs whose abundance is significantly altered under stress conditions. Interestingly, plant miRNAs predominantly targets transcription factors (TFs), and some of which are also the most critical drought-responsive genes that in turn could regulate the expression of numerous loci with drought-adaptive potential. The phytohormone ABA plays important roles in regulating stomatal conductance and in initiating an adaptive response to drought stress. miRNAs are implicated in regulating ABA-(abscisic acid) and non-ABA-mediated drought resistance pathways. For instance, miR159-MYB module and miR169-NFYA module participates in an ABA-dependent pathway, whereas several other ABA-independent miRNA-target modules (miR156-SPL; miR393-TIR1; miR160-ARF10, ARF16, ARF17; miR167-ARF6 and ARF8; miR390/TAS3siRNA-ARF2, ARF3, ARF4) collectively regulate drought responses in plants. Overall, miRNA-mediated drought response manifests diverse molecular, biochemical and physiological processes. Because of their immense role in controlling gene expression, miRNA manipulation has significant potential to augment plant tolerance to drought stress. This review compiles the current understanding of drought-responsive miRNAs in major cereals. Also, potential miRNA manipulation strategies currently in use along with the challenges and future perspectives are discussed.
