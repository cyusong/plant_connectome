['12724537', 'The cryptochrome blue light photoreceptors mediate various photomorphogenic  responses in plants, including hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon expansion, and  control of flowering time. The molecular mechanism of cryptochrome function in  Arabidopsis is becoming increasingly clear, with recent studies showing that both  CRY1 and CRY2 are localized in the nucleus and that CRY2 is regulated by blue  light-dependent phosphorylation. Despite these advances, no positive cryptochrome  signaling component has been identified to date. Here, we demonstrate that a  novel Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (AtPP7) with high sequence similarity to the  Drosophila retinal degeneration C protein phosphatase acts as an intermediate in  blue light signaling. Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings with reduced AtPP7  expression levels exhibit loss of hypocotyl growth inhibition and display limited  cotyledon expansion in response to blue light irradiation. These effects are as  striking as those seen in hy4 mutant seedlings, which are deficient in CRY1. We  further demonstrate that AtPP7 transcript levels are not rate limiting and that  AtPP7 probably acts downstream of cryptochrome in the nucleus, ensuring signal  flux through the pathway. Based on our findings and recent data regarding  cryptochrome action, we propose that AtPP7 acts as a positive regulator of  cryptochrome signaling in Arabidopsis.', '2003 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.008649', 'Chua']
