Plant breeding for intercropping is lagging because most varieties currently available in the market are selected for sole cropping systems. The present study analyzed the response of durum wheat (12 varieties) and faba bean (3 varieties) in pure and mixed cropping. Field trials were conducted in 2019 and 2020. The performance of each variety in mixed and pure cropping was evaluated using both univariate and multivariate analyses of the grain yield and land equivalent ratio (LER). For durum wheat, grain protein content was also evaluated. Durum wheat varieties were characterized by good performance in both years, whereas faba bean varieties were more affected by the growing season, suggesting that much breeding effort is warranted to improve the latter as a pure and mixed crop. Moreover, the relative performance of all varieties was affected by their combination in mixed cropping, as evaluated based on the ratio (LERratio) between LER for wheat (LERw) and LER for faba bean (LERfb). To further evaluate the overall performance of wheat and faba bean in mixed cropping, total yield, LERtotal (LERw + LERfb), and ln(LERratio) were subjected to principal component and cluster analyses. The first principal component combined the total yield and LERtotal in a single index of the overall performance of each mixed crop combination. The second principal component, based on ln(LERratio), highlighted the relative performance of varieties in each mixed crop combination. The proposed multivariate approach can be applied in the breeding programs for intercropping to identify variety combinations based on crop performance and the relative importance of the proportion of cereal and legume grains in the total harvest.
