Despite numerous attempts to elucidate the developmental mechanisms responsible for the observed diversity of pollen and spore walls, the processes involved remained obscure until the structures observed during exine development were recognized as a sequence of self-assembling micellar mesophases. To confirm this, a series of in vitro experiments was undertaken in which exine-like patterns were generated in colloidal mixtures by self-assembly, without any genomic participation. The intention was to test whether all the main types of exine structure could be simulated experimentally. Mixtures of substances, analogous to those involved in microspore development, were left undisturbed while water evaporated and self-assembly occurred. We varied the substances, their combinations and concentrations, and the physical constraints to make the experiments closer to the situation in nature. The resulting dry films were then examined using transmission electron microscopy. A variety of microstructures, simulating the full range of exine types, was obtained by micellar self-assembly. Moreover, the signs of related physicochemical process (i.e. phase separation) were also observed. Simple, energy-efficient, physical-chemical interactions, phase separation and self-assembly, are capable of generating exine-like patterns, providing evidence that these processes share control of exine formation with the well-documented program of gene expression.
