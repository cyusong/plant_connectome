Alternative and ecological strategies are necessary and demanded for disease management in order to reduce the use of pesticides in agriculture. Thus, the use of biological control agents such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) or several strains of the beneficial fungus Trichoderma spp. to combat plant diseases is the basis of biocontrol of plant pathogens and is a good approach to reach this healthy and environmentally adequate objective.

Gene: !affects! Process
PGPR: !controls! Plant Pathogens
Trichoderma spp.: !combats! Plant Diseases
Biocontrol: !promotes! Healthy Environment
