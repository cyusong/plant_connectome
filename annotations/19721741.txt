The IAN (immune-associated nucleotide-binding protein) family belongs to a family of AIG1-like GTPases. These functionally uncharacterized GTP-binding proteins have unique structures and are differentially expressed in both vertebrate immune cells and plant cells during antibacterial responses. In mammals, the IANs, as a novel family of T cell receptor-responsive proteins, play critical roles in regulation of thymic development and survival of T lymphocytes through the interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins. The Arabidopsis AIG1 and AIG2, which are first identified IAN proteins, are involved in plant resistance to bacteria. Recent analysis of the expression patterns of Arabidopsis IANs suggests that these IAN proteins may play regulatory roles during plant development and response to both biotic and abiotic stress.
