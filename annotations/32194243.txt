Plants utilize nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) to detect pathogen effectors, leading to effector-triggered immunity. The NLR ZAR1 indirectly recognizes the Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris effector AvrAC and Pseudomonas syringae effector HopZ1a by associating with closely related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII-2 (RLCK XII-2) members RKS1 and ZED1, respectively. ZAR1, RKS1, and the AvrAC-modified decoy PBL2<sup>UMP</sup> form a pentameric resistosome in vitro, and the ability of resistosome formation is required for AvrAC-triggered cell death and disease resistance. However, it remains unknown whether the effectors induce ZAR1 oligomerization in the plant cell. In this study, we show that both AvrAC and HopZ1a can induce oligomerization of ZAR1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Residues mediating ZAR1-ZED1 interaction are indispensable for HopZ1a-induced ZAR1 oligomerization in vivo and disease resistance. In addition, ZAR1 residues required for the assembly of ZAR1 resistosome in vitro are also essential for HopZ1a-induced ZAR1 oligomerization in vivo and disease resistance. Our study provides evidence that pathogen effectors induce ZAR1 resistosome formation in the plant cell and that the resistosome formation triggers disease resistance.
