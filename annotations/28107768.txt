Polar growth of root hairs is critical for plant survival and requires fine-tuned Rho of plants (ROP) signaling. Multiple ROP regulators participate in root hair growth. However, protein S-acyl transferases (PATs), mediating the S-acylation and membrane partitioning of ROPs, are yet to be found. Using a reverse genetic approach, combining fluorescence probes, pharmacological drugs, site-directed mutagenesis and genetic analysis with related root-hair mutants, we have identified and characterized an Arabidopsis PAT, which may be responsible for ROP2 S-acylation in root hairs. Specifically, functional loss of PAT4 resulted in reduced root hair elongation, which was rescued by a wild-type but not an enzyme-inactive PAT4. Membrane-associated ROP2 was significantly reduced in pat4, similar to S-acylation-deficient ROP2 in the wild type. We further showed that PAT4 and SCN1, a ROP regulator, additively mediate the stability and targeting of ROP2. The results presented here indicate that PAT4-mediated S-acylation mediates the membrane association of ROP2 at the root hair apex and provide novel insights into dynamic ROP signaling during plant tip growth.
