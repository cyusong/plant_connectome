Stomata are essential for photosynthesis and abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we used multiomics approaches to dissect the genetic architecture and adaptive mechanisms that underlie stomatal morphology in Populus tomentosa juvenile natural population (303 accessions). We detected 46 candidate genes and 15 epistatic gene-pairs, associated with 5 stomatal morphologies and 18 leaf development and photosynthesis traits, through genome-wide association studies. Expression quantitative trait locus mapping revealed that stomata-associated gene loci were significantly associated with the expression of leaf-related genes; selective sweep analysis uncovered significant differentiation in the allele frequencies of genes that underlie stomatal variations. An allelic regulatory network operating under drought stress and adequate precipitation conditions, with three key regulators (DUF538, TRA2 and AbFH2) and eight interacting genes, was identified that might regulate leaf physiology via modulation of stomatal shape and density. Validation of candidate gene variations in drought-tolerant and F<sub>1</sub> hybrid populations of P. tomentosa showed that the DUF538, TRA2 and AbFH2 loci cause functional stabilisation of spatiotemporal regulatory, whose favourable alleles can be faithfully transmitted to offspring. This study provides insights concerning leaf physiology and stress tolerance via the regulation of stomatal determination in perennial plants.
