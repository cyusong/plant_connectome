Under waterlogged conditions, roots of gramineous plants form lysigenous aerenchyma (internal gas spaces) by inducing the death of cortical cells. Rice (Oryza sativa) roots induce aerenchyma formation through ethylene- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated signaling. Metallothionein (MT) is a small, cysteine-rich protein that acts as a ROS scavenger. In rice roots, the expression of MT1a, MT1b, MT1c and MT1Ld were higher than those of the other MT genes. In the root cortex, where aerenchyma forms exclusively, the expression of MT1a, MT1b and MT1Ld was reduced prior to aerenchyma formation. These findings suggest that ROS accumulation in the cortex, which is aided by downregulation of MT1 genes, is needed for aerenchyma formation in rice roots.

MT1a: !downregulates! aerenchyma formation
MT1b: !downregulates! aerenchyma formation
MT1c: !downregulates! aerenchyma formation
MT1Ld: !downregulates! aerenchyma formation
ROS: !accumulates in! root cortex
ROS: !aids! aerenchyma formation
