Suspension cultured cells of Capsicum chinense secrete proteins to the culture medium in both control conditions and under methyl jasmonate treatment. The exogenous application of methyl jasmonate induced the accumulation of putative pathogenesis-related proteins, class I chitinase, leucin-rich repeat protein, NtPRp27-like protein and pectinesterase which were also found in suspension cultured cells of C. annuum elicited with methyl jasmonate. However, a germin-like protein, which has never been described in methyl jasmonate-elicited C. chinense suspension cultured cells, was found. The different effects described as being the result of exogenous application of signalling molecules like methyl jasmonate on the expression of germin-like protein suggest that germin-like proteins may play a variety of roles in protecting plants against pathogen attacks and different stresses. Further studies will be necessary to characterize the differential expression of these pathogenesis-related proteins and to throw light on the complexity of their regulation.
