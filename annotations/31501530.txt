['31501530', 'Coumarins, also known as 1,2-benzopyrones, comprise a large class of secondary  metabolites that are ubiquitously found throughout the plant kingdom. In many  plant species, coumarins are particularly important for iron acquisition and  plant defence. Here, we show that COUMARIN SYNTHASE (COSY) is a key enzyme in the  biosynthesis of coumarins. Arabidopsis thaliana cosy mutants have strongly  reduced levels of coumarin and accumulate o-hydroxyphenylpropanoids instead.  Accordingly, cosy mutants have reduced iron content and show growth defects when  grown under conditions in which there is a limited availability of iron.  Recombinant COSY is able to produce umbelliferone, esculetin and scopoletin from  their respective o-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thioesters by two reaction steps-a  trans-cis isomerization followed by a lactonization. This conversion happens  partially spontaneously and is catalysed by light, which explains why the need  for an enzyme for this conversion has been overlooked. The combined results show  that COSY has an essential function in the biosynthesis of coumarins in organs  that are shielded from light, such as roots. These findings provide routes to  improving coumarin production in crops or by microbial fermentation.', '2019 Oct', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-019-0510-0', 'ORCID:']
