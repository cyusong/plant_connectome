Most retrograde signalling research in plants was performed using Arabidopsis, so an evolutionary perspective on mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) is largely missing. Here, we used phylogenetics to track the evolutionary origins of factors involved in plant MRR. In all cases, the gene families can be traced to ancestral green algae or earlier. However, the specific subfamilies containing factors involved in plant MRR in many cases arose during the transition to land. NAC transcription factors with C-terminal transmembrane domains, as observed in the key regulator ANAC017, can first be observed in non-vascular mosses, and close homologs to ANAC017 can be found in seed plants. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are common to eukaryotes, but E-type CDKs that control MRR also diverged in conjunction with plant colonization of land. AtWRKY15 can be traced to the earliest land plants, while AtWRKY40 only arose in angiosperms and AtWRKY63 even more recently in Brassicaceae. Apetala 2 (AP2) transcription factors are traceable to algae, but the ABI4 type again only appeared in seed plants. This strongly suggests that the transition to land was a major driver for developing plant MRR pathways, while additional fine-tuning events have appeared in seed plants or later. Finally, we discuss how MRR may have contributed to meeting the specific challenges that early land plants faced during terrestrialization.
