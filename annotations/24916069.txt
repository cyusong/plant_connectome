Formation of a photorespiration-based CO2-concentrating mechanism in C3-C4 intermediate plants is seen as a prerequisite for the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, but it is not known how efficient this mechanism is. Here, using in vivo Rubisco carboxylation-to-oxygenation ratios as a proxy to assess relative intraplastidial CO2 levels is suggested. Such ratios were determined for the C3-C4 intermediate species Flaveria pubescens compared with the closely related C3 plant F. cronquistii and the C4 plant F. trinervia. To this end, a model was developed to describe the major carbon fluxes and metabolite pools involved in photosynthetic-photorespiratory carbon metabolism and used quantitatively to evaluate the labelling kinetics during short-term (14)CO2 incorporation. Our data suggest that the photorespiratory CO2 pump elevates the intraplastidial CO2 concentration about 3-fold in leaves of the C3-C4 intermediate species F. pubescens relative to the C3 species F. cronquistii.

F. pubescens: !elevates! intraplastidial CO2
model: !describes! carbon fluxes/metabolite pools
14CO2: !incorporates! labelling kinetics
Rubisco: !assesses! relative CO2 levels
C3-C4 intermediate species: !seen as! prerequisite for C4 photosynthesis
