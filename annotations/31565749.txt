The closely related sulphonamide safeners, metcamifen and cyprosulfamide, were tested for their ability to protect rice from clodinafop-propargyl, a herbicide normally used in wheat. While demonstrating that both compounds were equally bioavailable in planta, only metcamifen prevented clodinafop from damaging seedlings, and this was associated with the enhanced detoxification of the herbicide. Transcriptome studies in rice cultures demonstrated that whereas cyprosulfamide had a negligible effect on gene expression over a 4 h exposure, metcamifen perturbed the abundance of 590 transcripts. Changes in gene expression with metcamifen could be divided into three phases, corresponding to inductions occurring over 30 min, 1.5 h and 4 h. The first phase of gene induction was dominated by transcription factors and proteins of unknown function, the second by genes involved in herbicide detoxification, while the third was linked to cellular homeostasis. Analysis of the inducible genes suggested that safening elicited similar gene families to those associated with specific biotic and abiotic stresses, notably those elicited by abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate. Subsequent experiments with safener biomarker genes induced in phase 1 and 2 in rice cell cultures provided further evidence of similarities in signalling processes elicited by metcamifen and salicylic acid.
