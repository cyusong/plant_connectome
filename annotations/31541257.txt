Root survival to flooding-induced hypoxic stress is dependent upon maintaining the functionality of the root apical meristem quiescent center (QC), a process that is governed by the basipetal flow of auxin leading to the formation of an auxin maximum, which is needed for the establishment of a highly oxidized environment specifying the QC niche. Perturbations in auxin flow and distribution along the root profile occurring during hypoxia can shift the redox state of the QC towards a more reduced environment, leading to the activation of the QC, degradation of the meristem, and root abortion. The maize phytoglobin gene ZmPgb1.1 is involved in minimizing these damaging effects during hypoxia in processes that result in sustaining the PIN-mediated auxin maximum and an oxidized environment in the QC. The oxidized environment is accomplished by maintaining the activity of redox enzymes oxidizing ascorbate and glutathione. These events, compromised in QCs suppressing ZmPgb1.1, ensure the functionality of the QC and root meristems under conditions of low oxygen, resulting in stable root performance.
