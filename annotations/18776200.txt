The soybean major storage protein glycinin is encoded by five genes, which are divided into two subfamilies. Expression of A3B4 glycinin in transgenic rice seed reached about 1.5% of total seed protein, even if expressed under the control of strong endosperm-specific promoters. In contrast, expression of A1aB1b glycinin reached about 4% of total seed protein. Co-expression of the two proteins doubled accumulation levels of both A1aB1b and A3B4 glycinins. This increase can be largely accounted for by their aggregation with rice glutelins, self-assembly and inter-glycinin interactions, resulting in the enrichment of globulin and glutelin fractions and a concomitant reduction of the prolamin fraction. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that the synthesized A1aB1b glycinin was predominantly deposited in protein body-II (PB-II) storage vacuoles, whereas A3B4 glycinin is targeted to both PB-II and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived protein body-I (PB-I) storage structures. Co-expression with A1aB1b facilitated targeting of A3B4 glycinin into PB-II by sequestration with A1aB1b, resulting in an increase in the accumulation of A3B4 glycinin.
