<b>Background and Aims:</b> Magnesium (Mg) fertilizer has been proved to play an important role in improving the yield and quality of tea. However, plant availability of Mg, including its use, efficiency, and quality improvement effects, were highly affected by plant species, soil characteristics (nutritional status, etc.), and Mg status (chemical-available, etc.). <b>Methods:</b> Tea plants were pot-cultivated in 12 typical tea plantation soils amended with and without Mg fertilizer. Exchangeable Mg (Ex-Mg) concentration in soils was quantitatively extracted using four extraction solutions (Mehlich-3, BaCl<sub>2</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and NH<sub>4</sub>OAC). Plant availability of Mg was evaluated by Mg uptake and its use efficiency, as well as its association with quality components in tea plants. <b>Results:</b> Ex-Mg in soils was extracted most efficiently by Mehlich-3, while Mg concentrations in tea plant tissue were higher correlated with Ex-Mg extracted by CaCl<sub>2</sub> than other extraction solutions. Mg fertilizer use efficiency in tea plant varied from 6.08 to 29.56 %, and the effect of Mg application on tea quality improvement and the use efficiency of Mg fertilizer both negatively correlated with total Mg concentration (<i>r</i> = -0.94 and -0.63, respectively) and nitrogen (N) level (<i>r</i> = -0.61 and -0.51, respectively) in soils prior to tea plant cultivation. <b>Conclusions:</b> CaCl<sub>2</sub> could be recommended for plant-available Mg extraction in tea plantation soil, and Mg fertilizer use efficiency could be affected and predicted by total N and Mg status in soils prior to tea plant cultivation, providing a potential theoretical for the guidance of Mg fertilization for tea yield and quality improvement in tea plantation management.
