Sodium dodecyl sulfate-sedimentation volume is an important index to evaluate the gluten strength of common wheat and is closely related to baking quality. In this study, a total of 15 quantitative trait locus (QTL) for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sedimentation volume (SSV) were identified by using a high-density genetic map including 2,474 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, which was constructed with a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from the cross between Non-gda3753 (ND3753) and Liangxing99 (LX99). Importantly, four environmentally stable QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1A, 2D, and 5D, respectively. Among them, the one with the largest effect was identified on chromosome 1A (designated as <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1</i>) explaining up to 39.67% of the phenotypic variance. Subsequently, <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1</i> was dissected into two QTLs named as <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1.1</i> and <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1.2</i> by saturating the genetic linkage map of the chromosome 1A. Interestedly, favorable alleles of these two loci were from different parents. Due to the favorable allele of <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1.1</i> was from the high-value parents ND3753 and revealed higher genetic effect, which explained 25.07% of the phenotypic variation, mapping of this locus was conducted by using BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>1</sub> and BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> populations. By comparing the CS reference sequence, the physical interval of <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1.1</i> was delimited into 14.9 Mb, with 89 putative high-confidence annotated genes. SSVs of different recombinants between <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1.1</i> and <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1</i> detected from DH and BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> populations showed that these two loci had an obvious additive effect, of which the combination of two favorable loci had the high SSV, whereas recombinants with unfavorable loci had the lowest. These results provide further insight into the genetic basis of SSV and <i>QSsv.cau-1A.1.1</i> will be an ideal target for positional cloning and wheat breeding programs.
