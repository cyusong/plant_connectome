NAC transcription factors are one of the largest transcription factor families having functions in a variety of stress responses. Few NACs have been reported for interactions between wheat and the wheat rust fungus <i>Puccinia triticina</i> (<i>Pt</i>). In this study, based on analysis of RNA-seq data from wheat line TcLr19 inoculated by <i>Pt</i>, the NAC transcription factor <i>TaNAC069</i> was cloned from wheat, and its transcriptional activity and homologous dimer formation were verified. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression of <i>TaNAC069</i> was induced by <i>Pt</i> and associated signaling molecules. To further characterize the function of the <i>TaNAC069</i> gene in wheat resistance to <i>Pt</i>, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was utilized, and it revealed that <i>Pt</i> resistance in <i>TaNAC069</i>-silenced plants was significantly reduced. Potential interaction targets of TaNAC069 from wheat and <i>Pt</i> were screened and identified by yeast two-hybrid technology. Eukaryotic elongation factor <i>eEF1A</i>, CBSX3 protein, and cold acclimation protein WCOR410c were screened by yeast one-hybrid technology. The results indicate that the <i>TaNAC069</i> gene plays a positive regulatory role in wheat resistance to <i>Pt</i>, laying a good foundation to analyze the molecular mechanisms of <i>TaNAC069</i> and its functional role in wheat resistance to <i>Pt</i>.
