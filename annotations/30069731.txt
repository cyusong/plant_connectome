Gibberellic acid is a plant growth hormone that promotes cell expansion and division. Studies have aimed at optimizing and reducing production costs, which could make its application economically viable for different cultivars. Gibberellins consist of a large family of plant growth hormones discovered in the 1930s, which are synthesized via the terpenes route from the geranylgeranyl diphosphate and feature a basic structure formed by an ent-gibberellane tetracyclic skeleton. Among them, only four have biological activity, including gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>), which acts as a natural plant growth regulator, especially for stem elongation, seed germination, and increased fruit size. It can be obtained from plants, fungi, and bacteria. There are also some reports about microalgae GA<sub>3</sub> producers. Fungi, especially Gibberella fujikuroi, are preferred for GA<sub>3</sub> production via submerged fermentation or solid-state fermentation. Many factors may affect its production, some of which are related to the control and scale-up of fermentation parameters. Different GA<sub>3</sub> products are available on the market. They can be found in liquid or solid formulations containing only GA<sub>3</sub> or a mixture of other biological active gibberellins, which can be applied on a wide variety of cultivars, including crops and fruits. However, the product's cost still limits its large and continuous application. New low-cost and efficient GA<sub>3</sub> production alternatives are surely welcome. This review deals with the latest scientific and technological advances on production, recovery, formulation, and applications of this important plant growth hormone.
