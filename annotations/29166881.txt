['29166881', 'BACKGROUND: Stomata are micropores surrounded by pairs of guard cells, and their  opening is finely controlled to balance water vapor loss as transpiration and  CO(2) absorption for photosynthesis. The regulatory signaling network for  stomatal movement is complicated, and increasing numbers of new genes have been  shown to be involved in this process. Our previous study indicated that a member  of the plant putative mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) family, NRGA1, is a  negative regulator of guard cell abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. In this study, we  identified novel physiological roles of pyruvate and MPC1, another member of the  MPC family, in the regulation of stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. RESULTS:  Loss-of-function mutants of MPC1 (mpc1) were hypersensitive to ABA-induced  stomatal closure and ABA-activated guard cell slow-type anion currents, and  showed a reduced rate of water loss upon drought treatment compared with  wild-type plants. In contrast, plants overexpressing MPC1 showed a hyposensitive  ABA response and increased sensitivity to drought stress. In addition, mpc1  mutants accumulated more pyruvate after drought or ABA treatment. The increased  pyruvate content also induced stomatal closure and activated the slow-type anion  channels of guard cells, and this process was dependent on the function of  RbohD/F NADPH oxidases and reactive oxygen species concentrations in guard cells.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the essential roles of MPC1 and pyruvate in  stomatal movement and plant drought resistance.', '2017 Nov 22', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-017-1175-3', 'Zhang']
