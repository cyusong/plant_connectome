Conclusions and perspectives 516 Acknowledgements 516 References 516 SUMMARY: Mineral elements required for plant growth and development must first be taken up by the roots from soil. Plants have developed an efficient uptake system for the radial transport of mineral elements from soil to central stele through the allocation of various transporters at different root cells. These transporters are regulated at transcriptional, translational and/or post-translational level to cope with the fluctuation of mineral elements in soil. In this insight, we describe an efficient uptake system for mineral elements formed by influx and efflux transporters, regulatory mechanisms and polarity of these transporters, and sensing and signal pathways, in response to spatial and temporal changes of mineral elements in soil. An understanding of the mineral element uptake system in different plant species, and its regulatory network, will contribute to high and safe crop production under varying environments.
