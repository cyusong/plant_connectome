The non-energy-conserving alternative oxidase (AOX) respiration of plant mitochondria is known to interact with chloroplast photosynthesis. This may have consequences for growth, particularly under sub-optimal conditions when energy imbalances can impede photosynthesis. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the metabolism and growth of wild-type Nicotiana tabacum with that of AOX knockdown and overexpression lines during a prolonged steady-state mild to moderate water deficit. Under moderate water deficit, the AOX amount was an important determinant of the rate of both mitochondrial respiration in the light and net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) at the growth irradiance. In particular, AOX respiration was necessary to maintain optimal proton and electron fluxes at the chloroplast thylakoid membrane, which in turn prevented a water-deficit-induced biochemical limitation of photosynthesis. As a result of differences in A, AOX overexpressors gained more biomass and knockdowns gained less biomass than wild-type during moderate water deficit. Biomass partitioning also differed, with the overexpressors having a higher percentage, and the knockdowns having a lower percentage, of total above-ground biomass in reproductive tissue than wild-type. The results establish that improving chloroplast energy balance by using a non-energy-conserving respiratory electron sink can increase photosynthesis and growth during prolonged water deficit.
