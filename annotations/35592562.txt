Ratoon rice is proposed as a promising way to improve rice productivity <i>via</i> increasing harvest frequency. Nitrogen (N) is the most effective in promoting the development and growth of ratoon plants. However, limited information is available on how different N management practices affect the biomass production of the ratoon crop (RC) through influencing canopy light interception, radiation use efficiency (RUE), and N utilization. Field experiments were conducted in central China in 2016 and 2017 to examine the effects of N management practices on the biomass accumulation of RC and the underlying physiological mechanisms. The N rates (100 vs. 200 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) in the main crop (MC) had a small and inconsistent effect on the biomass accumulation of RC. N application at 15 days after heading of MC for promoting bud development (N<sub>bud</sub>, 100 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) increased total biomass production of RC by 17.2-19.1%, due to the improvements in both pre- and post-heading biomass production during the ratoon season (BP<sub>ratoon</sub>). N application at 1-2 days after harvesting of MC for promoting the growth of regenerated tillers (N<sub>tiller</sub>, 100 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) increased total biomass production of RC by 7.8-15.9% due to the improvements in post-heading BP<sub>ratoon</sub> alone or both pre- and post-heading BP<sub>ratoon</sub>. The differences in BP<sub>ratoon</sub> caused by N<sub>bud</sub> and N<sub>tiller</sub> were associated with crop growth rate, leaf area index, RUE, and N uptake of RC. Total N uptake of RC was improved by N<sub>bud</sub> through increasing stubble N content at harvest of MC and by N<sub>tiller</sub> through increasing plant N uptake during the ratoon season. N use efficiency for BP<sub>ratoon</sub> was reduced by N<sub>tiller</sub> but not by N<sub>bud</sub>. These results suggest that both N<sub>bud</sub> and N<sub>tiller</sub> play important roles in improving biomass production in RC, although N<sub>bud</sub> was more efficient than N<sub>tiller</sub>.
