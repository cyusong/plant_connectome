Protein cysteine residues are susceptible to oxidative modifications that can affect protein functions. Proteomic techniques that comprehensively profile the cysteine redoxome, the repertoire of oxidized cysteine residues, are pivotal towards a better understanding of the protein redox signaling. Recent technical advances in chemical tools and redox proteomic strategies have greatly improved selectivity, in vivo applicability, and quantification of the cysteine redoxome. Despite this substantial progress, still many challenges remain. Here, we provide an update on the recent advances in proteomic strategies for cysteine redoxome profiling, compare the advantages and disadvantages of current methods and discuss the outstanding challenges and future perspectives for plant redoxome research.
