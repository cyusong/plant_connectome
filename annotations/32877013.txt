['32877013', 'Type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) are the largest protein phosphatase family.  PP2Cs dephosphorylate substrates for signaling in Arabidopsis, but the functions  of most PP2Cs remain unknown. Here, we characterized PP2C49 (AT3G62260, a Group G  PP2C), which regulates Na(+) distribution under salt stress and is localized to  the cytoplasm and nucleus. PP2C49 was highly expressed in root vascular tissues  and its disruption enhanced plant tolerance to salt stress. Compared with wild  type, the pp2c49 mutant contained more Na(+) in roots but less Na(+) in shoots  and xylem sap, suggesting that PP2C49 regulates shoot Na(+) extrusion. Reciprocal  grafting revealed a root-based mechanism underlying the salt tolerance of pp2c49.  Systemic Na(+) distribution largely depends on AtHKT1;1 and loss of function of  AtHKT1;1 in the pp2c49 background overrode the salt tolerance of pp2c49,  resulting in salt sensitivity. Furthermore, compared with plants overexpressing  PP2C49 in the wild-type background, plants overexpressing PP2C49 in the athtk1;1  mutant background were sensitive to salt, like the athtk1;1 mutants. Moreover,  protein-protein interaction and two-voltage clamping assays demonstrated that  PP2C49 physically interacts with AtHKT1;1 and inhibits the Na(+) permeability of  AtHKT1;1. This study reveals that PP2C49 negatively regulates AtHKT1;1 activity  and thus determines systemic Na(+) allocation during salt stress.', '2021 Mar', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13008', 'Lan']
