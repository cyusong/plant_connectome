Due to the effects of climate change, conditions tend to be increasingly extreme, with water availability being one of the main limiting factors in potato production. The objective of this study was to analyze the differential response of physiological and yield components in six potato varieties under water deficit conditions. For this purpose, a greenhouse trial was carried out with the varieties Agata, Agria, Kennebec, Monalisa, Sante and Zorba. The drought stress was applied in stressed plants 36 days after planting (DAP) by withholding water for 25 days. All measurements were taken at four different times: before stress (T0), 17 days (T1) and 24 days (T2) after stress and five days after re-watering. The physiological parameters evaluated were chlorophyll content and fluorescence, relative leaf water content, stomatal conductance, electrolytic leakage and water potential. After the drought period, the aerial part of half of the plants was cut to evaluate the produced biomass. At the end of the cycle yield components were determined. Stomatal conductance and water potential were the parameters that showed the highest differences between the two hydric conditions, and Monalisa was the variety with the best response in tuber production under stress conditions. Indirect selection based on parameters associated with water stress can be a useful tool in potato breeding programs for the identification of more tolerant varieties.
