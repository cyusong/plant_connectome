['16679416', 'Pale yellow green7-1 (pyg7-1) is a photosystem I (PSI)-deficient Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant. PSI subunits are synthesized in the mutant, but do  not assemble into a stable complex. In contrast, light-harvesting antenna  proteins of both photosystems accumulate in the mutant. Deletion of Pyg7 results  in severely reduced growth rates, alterations in leaf coloration, and plastid  ultrastructure. Pyg7 was isolated by map-based cloning and encodes a tetratrico  peptide repeat protein with homology to Ycf37 from Synechocystis. The protein is  localized in the chloroplast associated with thylakoid membranes and copurifies  with PSI. An independent pyg7 T-DNA insertion line, pyg7-2, exhibits the same  phenotype. pyg7 gene expression is light regulated. Comparison of the roles of  Ycf37 in cyanobacteria and Pyg7 in higher plants suggests that the ancient  protein has altered its function during evolution. Whereas the cyanobacterial  protein mediates more efficient PSI accumulation, the higher plant protein is  absolutely required for complex assembly or maintenance.', '2006 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.078147', 'Oelmuller']
