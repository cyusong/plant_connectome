Resistance against pathogens and herbivorous insects in many plant results from the expression of resistance (R) genes. Few reports, however, have considered the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on R gene-based resistance in plants. The current study determined the responses of two near isogenic Medicago truncatula genotypes (Jester has an R gene and A17 does not) to the pea aphid and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in open-top chambers in the field. Aphid abundance, mean relative growth rate and feeding efficiency were increased by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on A17 plants but were reduced on Jester plants. According to proteomic and gene expression data, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enhanced pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) but decreased the effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in aphid-infested A17 plants. For aphid-infested Jester plants, by contrast, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enhanced the ETI-related heat shock protein (HSP) 90 and its co-chaperones, the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. In a loss-of-function experiment, silencing of the HSP90 gene in Jester plants impaired the JA signaling pathway and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis against the aphid under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> , and negated the increased resistance against the aphid under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> . Our results suggest that increases in expression of HSP90 are responsible for the enhanced resistance against the aphid under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> .
