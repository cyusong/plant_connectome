The interaction between soybeans and the destructive common cutworm insect is complicated. In this paper, the time course of induced responses to common cutworm was characterized in two soybean lines, and the results showed that the induced resistance peaked at different times in the resistant (WX) and susceptible (NN) soybean lines. Two sets of transcriptome profiles from the WX and NN lines at the peak of their induced resistance were compared using microarray analysis. In total, 827 and 349 transcripts were differentially expressed in the WX and NN lines, respectively, with 80 probes common regulated and seven regulated in the opposite direction. All common- and unique-regulated genes were grouped into 10 functional categories based on sequence similarity searches, which showed that most of the genes were related to stress and defence responses. qRT-PCR analysis of 22 genes confirmed the results of the microarray analysis. The spatiotemporal expression patterns of the six genes revealed the consistency of systemic expression levels with the timing of the resistance response observed in the bioassay experiments. In summary, we described the conceptual model of induced resistance in two soybean lines and provided the first large-scale survey of common cutworm-induced defence transcripts in soybean.
