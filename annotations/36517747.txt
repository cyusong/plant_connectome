ASR (abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced) gene family plays a crucial role in responding to abiotic stresses in plants. However, the roles of ASR genes protecting plants against high salt and drought stresses remain unknown in Tamarix hispida. In this study, a salt and drought-induced ASR gene, ThASR3, was isolated from Tamarix hispida. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing ThASR3 exhibited stimulating root growth and increasing fresh weight compared with wild-type (WT) plants under both salt and water deficit stresses. To further analyze the gain- and loss-of-function of ThASR3, the transgenic T. hispida plants overexpressing or RNA interference (RNAi)-silencing ThASR3 were generated using transient transformation. The overexpression of ThASR3 in Tamarix and Arabidopsis plants displayed enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability under high salt and osmotic stress conditions, including increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the contents of proline and betaine, and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage rates. Our results indicate that ThASR3 functions as a positive regulator in Tamarix responses to salt and osmotic stresses and confers multiple abiotic stress tolerances in transgenic plants, which may have an important application value in the genetic improvement of forest tree resistance.
