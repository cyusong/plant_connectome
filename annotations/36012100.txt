RAV transcription factors (TFs) are unique to higher plants and contain both B3 and APETALA2 (AP2) DNA binding domains. Although sets of RAV genes have been identified from several species, little is known about this family in wheat. In this study, 26 RAV genes were identified in the wheat genome. These wheat RAV TFs were phylogenetically clustered into three classes based on their amino acid sequences. A <i>TaRAV</i> gene located on chromosome 1D was cloned and named <i>TaRAV1</i>. <i>TaRAV1</i> was expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and inflorescences, and its expression was up-regulated by heat while down-regulated by salt, ABA, and GA. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the TaRAV1 protein was localized in the nucleus. The TaRAV1 protein showed DNA binding activity in the EMSA assay and transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. Overexpressing <i>TaRAV1</i> enhanced the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis and upregulated the expression of <i>SOS</i> genes and other stress response genes. Collectively, our data suggest that TaRAV1 functions as a transcription factor and is involved in the salt stress response by regulating gene expression in the SOS pathway.
