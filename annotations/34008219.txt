Maintaining Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is a critical feature for plant survival under salt stress, which depends on the operation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transporters. Although some K<sup>+</sup> transporters mediating root K<sup>+</sup> uptake have been reported to be essential to the maintenance of Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, the effect of K<sup>+</sup> long-distance translocation via phloem on plant salt tolerance remains unclear. Here, we provide physiological and genetic evidence of the involvement of phloem-localized OsAKT2 in rice salt tolerance. OsAKT2 is a K<sup>+</sup> channel permeable to K<sup>+</sup> but not to Na<sup>+</sup> . Under salt stress, a T-DNA knock-out mutant, osakt2 and two CRISPR lines showed a more sensitive phenotype and higher Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation than wild type. They also contained more K<sup>+</sup> in shoots but less K<sup>+</sup> in roots, showing higher Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> ratios. Disruption of OsAKT2 decreases K<sup>+</sup> concentration in phloem sap and inhibits shoot-to-root redistribution of K<sup>+</sup> . In addition, OsAKT2 also regulates the translocation of K<sup>+</sup> and sucrose from old leaves to young leaves, and affects grain shape and yield. These results indicate that OsAKT2-mediated K<sup>+</sup> redistribution from shoots to roots contributes to maintenance of Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and inhibition of root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, providing novel insights into the roles of K<sup>+</sup> transporters in plant salt tolerance.
