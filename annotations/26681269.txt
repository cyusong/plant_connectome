Melatonin has been found in a wide range of plant groups. Its physiological roles have been suggested to be diverse in stress protection and plant growth regulation. An attractive hypothesis is that phytomelatonin acts as an auxin to regulate plant development. However, the auxin hypothesis is controversial, since both supporting and contradictory evidence has been reported. We systematically investigated whether melatonin fulfilled the definition for auxin in maize (Zea mays). Melatonin did not affect coleoptile elongation, root growth or ACC synthase gene expression, contrary to 10(-5)M IAA in our assay system. The auxin hypothesis of phytomelatonin action is not supported in maize, because melatonin appeared inactive in all of the auxin activity tests. On the other hand, melatonin was active in the protection of maize growth against salt stress, suggesting its importance in another context.

Melatonin: !does not affect! coleoptile elongation
Melatonin: !does not affect! root growth
Melatonin: !does not affect! ACC synthase gene expression
Melatonin: !protects against! salt stress
