<i>Forsythia suspensa</i> is an important medicinal plant and traditionally applied for the treatment of inflammation, pyrexia, gonorrhea, diabetes, and so on. However, there is limited sequence and genomic information available for <i>F. suspensa</i>. Here, we produced the complete chloroplast genomes of <i>F. suspensa</i> using Illumina sequencing technology. <i>F. suspensa</i> is the first sequenced member within the genus <i>Forsythia</i> (Oleaceae). The gene order and organization of the chloroplast genome of <i>F. suspensa</i> are similar to other Oleaceae chloroplast genomes. The <i>F. suspensa</i> chloroplast genome is 156,404 bp in length, exhibits a conserved quadripartite structure with a large single-copy (LSC; 87,159 bp) region, and a small single-copy (SSC; 17,811 bp) region interspersed between inverted repeat (IRa/b; 25,717 bp) regions. A total of 114 unique genes were annotated, including 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA, and four rRNA. The low GC content (37.8%) and codon usage bias for A- or T-ending codons may largely affect gene codon usage. Sequence analysis identified a total of 26 forward repeats, 23 palindrome repeats with lengths >30 bp (identity > 90%), and 54 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with an average rate of 0.35 SSRs/kb. We predicted 52 RNA editing sites in the chloroplast of <i>F. suspensa</i>, all for C-to-U transitions. IR expansion or contraction and the divergent regions were analyzed among several species including the reported <i>F. suspensa</i> in this study. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole-plastome revealed that <i>F. suspensa</i>, as a member of the Oleaceae family, diverged relatively early from Lamiales. This study will contribute to strengthening medicinal resource conservation, molecular phylogenetic, and genetic engineering research investigations of this species.
