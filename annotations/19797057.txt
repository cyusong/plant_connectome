['19797057', 'Arabidopsis possesses a superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.  Among these, the multidrug resistance-associated protein AtMRP5/AtABCC5 regulates  stomatal aperture and controls plasma membrane anion channels of guard cells.  Remarkably, despite the prominent role of AtMRP5 in conferring partial drought  insensitivity upon Arabidopsis, we know little of the biochemical function of  AtMRP5. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that AtMRP5 is closely related to maize  MRP4, mutation of which confers a low inositol hexakisphosphate kernel phenotype.  We now show that insertion mutants of AtMRP5 display a low inositol  hexakisphosphate phenotype in seed tissue and that this phenotype is associated  with alterations of mineral cation and phosphate status. By heterologous  expression in yeast, we demonstrate that AtMRP5 encodes a specific and high  affinity ATP-dependent inositol hexakisphosphate transporter that is sensitive to  inhibitors of ABC transporters. Moreover, complementation of the mrp5-1 insertion  mutants of Arabidopsis with the AtMRP5 cDNA driven from a guard cell-specific  promoter restores the sensitivity of the mutant to abscisic acid-mediated  inhibition of stomatal opening. Additionally, we show that mutation of residues  of the Walker B motif prevents restoring the multiple phenotypes associated with  mrp5-1. Our findings highlight a novel function of plant ABC transporters that  may be relevant to other kingdoms. They also extend the signaling repertoire of  this ubiquitous inositol polyphosphate signaling molecule.', '2009 Nov 27', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M109.030247', 'Martinoia']
