CsTPS1 encodes for a monoterpene synthase that contributes to the emission of a blend of volatile compounds emitted from flowers of Camelina sativa. The work describes the in vitro characterization of a monoterpene synthase and its regulatory region that we cloned from Camelina sativa (Camelina). Here, we named this gene as C. sativa terpene synthase 1 (CsTPS1). In vitro experiments performed with the CsTPS1 protein after expression and purification from Escherichia coli (E. coli) showed production of a blend of monoterpene volatile organic compounds, of which the emission was also detected in the floral bouquet of wild-type Camelina plants. Quantitative-PCR measurements revealed a high abundance of CsTPS1 transcripts in flowers and experiments performed with the GUS reporter showed high CsTPS1 expression in the pistil, in the cells of the wall of the ovary and in the stigma. Subcellular localization of the CsTPS1 protein was investigated with a GFP reporter construct that showed expression in plastids. The CsTPS1 gene identified in this study belongs to a mid-size family of 60 genes putatively codifying for TPS enzymes. This enlarged family of TPS genes suggests that Camelina has the structural framework for the production of terpenes and other secondary metabolites of relevance for the consumers.
