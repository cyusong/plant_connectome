Herbivore-induced plant defence responses share common components with plant responses to abiotic stresses. However, whether abiotic stress-responsive factors influence the resistance of plants to herbivores by regulating these components remains largely unknown. Here, we cloned a dehydration-responsive element-binding gene in rice, OsDREB1A, and investigated its role in the resistance of rice to the phloem-feeding herbivore, brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), under normal and low temperatures. We found that OsDREB1A localized to the nucleus, and its transcripts in rice were up-regulated in response to BPH infestation, low temperatures and treatment with methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid. Silencing OsDREB1A changed transcript levels of two defence-related WRKY and two PLD genes, enhanced levels of jasmonic acid (JA), JA-isoleucine and abscisic acid, and decreased the ethylene level in rice; these changes subsequently enhanced the resistance of plants to BPH, especially at 17°C, by decreasing the hatching rate and delaying the development of BPH eggs. Moreover, silencing OsDREB1A increased the growth of rice plants. These findings suggest that OsDREB1A, which positively regulates the resistance of rice to abiotic stresses, negatively regulates the resistance of rice to BPH.
