Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to function in the nucleus. Here, we report on the organellar localization of three rice HDACs, OsSIR2b, OsHDAC6, and OsHDAC10. The 35S:OsSIR2b-GFP and 35S:OsHDAC10-GFP constructs were introduced into tobacco BY2 cells. Co-localization analysis of the green fluorescent protein and MitoTracker fluorescent signals in the transformed BY2 cells indicated that OsSIR2b and OsHDAC10 are localized in the mitochondria. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines harboring 35S:OsHDAC6-GFP and 35S:OsHDAC10-GFP constructs were similarly analyzed, revealing that OsHDAC6-GFP is localized exclusively in chloroplasts, whereas OsHDAC10-GFP is localized in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. The presence of OsHDAC6-GFP and OsHDAC10-GFP in chloroplasts was verified by immunodetection.
