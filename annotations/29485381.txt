DELLA proteins act as negative regulators in gibberellin (GA) signal transduction. GA-induced DELLA degradation is a central regulatory system in GA signaling pathway. Intensive studies have revealed the degradation mechanism of DELLA and the functions of DELLA as a transcriptional regulator. Meanwhile, recent studies suggest the existence of a DELLA-independent GA signaling pathway. In this review, we summarized the DELLA-independent GA signaling pathway together with the well-analyzed DELLA-dependent pathway.

GA: !induces! DELLA degradation
DELLA: !regulates! GA signal transduction
DELLA: !degrades! GA-induced
DELLA: !functions as! transcriptional regulator
DELLA-independent GA signaling pathway: !exists!
