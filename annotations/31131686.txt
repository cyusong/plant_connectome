Lipids and proteins modulate both the global order of plasma membrane (PM) and its organization in distinct domains. This raises the question of the influence on PM-ordered domain formation of PM composition, which is finely controlled during cell differentiation. Labeling of plant cell PM with an environment-sensitive probe demonstrated that the level of PM order is regulated during anisotropic expansion observed during both cell regeneration from protoplasts and cell differentiation along the growing root. Indeed, PM order progressively decreased during the polarized growth of regenerated tobacco cells, without observed correlation between this parameter and the kinetics of either cell wall regeneration or cell morphology. This suggests that the dynamics of PM formation and renewal could control the PM organization, maybe by involving the secretory pathway.
