Ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factors play important roles in regulating immune responses in plants. In our study, we characterized a member of the ERF transcription factor family, <i>VaERF20</i>, from the Chinese wild <i>Vitis</i> genotype, <i>V. amurensis</i> Rupr "Shuangyou". Phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>VaERF20</i> belongs to group IXc of the ERF family, in which many members are known to contribute to fighting pathogen infection. Consistent with this, expression of <i>VaERF20</i> was induced by treatment with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea</i>) in "Shuangyou" and <i>V. vinifera</i> "Red Globe". <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants over-expressing <i>VaERF20</i> displayed enhanced resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i> and the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. tomato (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000. Patterns of pathogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were entirely distinct in <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>Pst</i>DC3000 inoculated plants. Examples of both salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) responsive defense genes were up-regulated after <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>Pst</i>DC3000 inoculation of the <i>VaERF20</i>-overexpressing transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> plants. Evidence of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), callose accumulation and stomatal defense, together with increased expression of PTI genes, was also greater in the transgenic lines. These data indicate that <i>VaERF20</i> participates in various signal transduction pathways and acts as an inducer of immune responses.
