Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (<i>SHMT</i>) plays a pivotal role in cellular one-carbon, photorespiration pathways and it influences the resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the function of SHMT proteins in wheat remains largely unexplored. In the present study, <i>SHMT</i> genes in five <i>Triticeae</i> species, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, and four dicotyledon species were identified based on whole genome information. The origin history of the target gene was traced by micro-collinearity analysis. Gene expression patterns of <i>TaSHMTs</i> in different tissues, various biotic stresses, exogenous hormones, and two biotic stresses were determined by Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The function of the selected <i>TaSHMT3A-1</i> was studied by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing in common wheat Bainong207. A total of 64 <i>SHMT</i> members were identified and further classified into two main classes based on the structure of SHMT proteins. The gene structure and motif composition analyses revealed that <i>SHMTs</i> kept relatively conserved within the same subclasses. Interestingly, there was a gene, <i>TdSHMT7B-1</i>, on chromosome 7B of <i>Triticum dicoccoides</i>, but there was no <i>SHMT</i> gene on chromosome 7 of other analyzed <i>Triticeae</i> species; <i>TdSHMT7B-1</i> had fewer exons and conserved motifs than the genes in the same subclass, suggesting that the gene of <i>TdSHMT7B-1</i> has a notable evolutionary progress. The micro-collinearity relationship showed that no homologs of <i>TaSHMT3A-1</i> and its two neighboring genes were found in the collinearity region of <i>Triticum urartu</i>, and there were 27 genes inserted into the collinearity region of <i>T</i>. <i>urartu</i>. Furthermore, qRT-PCR results showed that <i>TaSHMT3A-1</i> was responsive to abiotic stresses (NaCl and cold), abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and hydrogen peroxide. Significantly, upon <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> infection, the expression of <i>TaSHMT3A-1</i> was highly upregulated in resistant cultivar Sumai3. More importantly, silencing of <i>TaSHMT3A-1</i> compromises Fusarium head blight resistance in common wheat Bainong207. Our new findings suggest that the <i>TaSHMT3A-1</i> gene in wheat plays an important role in resistance to Fusarium head blight. This provides a valuable reference for further study on the function of this gene family.
