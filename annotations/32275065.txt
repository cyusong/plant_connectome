['32275065', 'Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants and  reduces crop yield worldwide. As obligate biotrophs, powdery mildew fungi  manipulate living host cells to suppress defence responses and to obtain  nutrients. Members of the plant order Brassicales produce indole glucosinolates  that effectively protect them from attack by non-adapted fungi. Indol-3-ylmethyl  glucosinolate is constitutively produced in the phloem and transported to  epidermal cells for storage. Upon attack, indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate is  activated by CYP81F2 to provide broad-spectrum defence against fungi. How de novo  biosynthesis and transport contribute to defence of powdery mildew-attacked  epidermal cells is unknown. Bioassays and glucosinolate analysis demonstrate that  GTR glucosinolate transporters are not involved in antifungal defence. Using  quantitative live-cell imaging of fluorophore-tagged markers, we show that  accumulation of the glucosinolate biosynthetic enzymes CYP83B1 and SUR1 is  induced in epidermal cells attacked by the non-adapted barley powdery mildew  Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei. By contrast, glucosinolate biosynthesis is  attenuated during interaction with the virulent powdery mildew Golovinomyces  orontii. Interestingly, SUR1 induction is delayed during the Golovinomyces  orontii interaction. We conclude that epidermal de novo synthesis of  indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate contributes to CYP81F2-mediated broad-spectrum  antifungal resistance and that adapted powdery mildews may target this process.', '2020 Jun', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.13766', 'ORCID:']
