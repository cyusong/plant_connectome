Three independent patterns of vein formation in Cyperus involucratus Rottb. were identified based on rare spontaneous interruptions of scape vein development. A number of developmental anomalies of vascular bundles in Cyperus involucratus Rottb. were identified and they include "turnabout", "absent", "twins", "doublet", amphivasal and various stages of "arrested". These were used to develop a computer program to explain the three vasculature patterns of the scape of (a) ordered deployment of vascular bundles, (b) arrangement of tissues within vascular bundles and (c) orientation of vascular bundles with respect to stem edge. The computer model is a cell-by-cell determination of cell types and facet states.
