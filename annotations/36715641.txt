In the context of climate change, the global rise of temperature and intense heat waves affect plant development and productivity. Among the molecular perturbations that high temperature induces in living cells is the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which perturbs the cellular redox state. In plants, the dynamics of the cellular and subcellular redox state have been poorly investigated under high temperature. Glutathione plays a major role in maintaining the cellular redox state. We investigated its contribution in adaptation of Arabidopsis thaliana to contrasting high temperature regimes: high ambient temperature inducing thermomorphogenesis and heat stress affecting plant viability. Using the genetically encoded redox marker roGFP2, we show that high temperature regimes lead to cytoplasmic and nuclear oxidation and impact the glutathione pool. This pool is restored within a few hours, which probably contributes to plant adaptation to high temperatures. Moreover, low glutathione mutants fail to adapt to heat stress and to induce thermomorphogenesis, suggesting that glutathione is involved in both heat adaptation mechanisms. We also evaluate the transcriptomic signature in the two high temperature regimes and identified gene expression deviations in low glutathione mutants, which might contribute to their sensitivity to high temperature. Thus, we define glutathione as a major player in the adaptation of Arabidopsis to contrasting high temperature regimes.
