['31889067', 'Salt stress is one of the abiotic stresses affecting crop growth and yield. The  functional screening and mechanism investigation of the genes in response to salt  stress are essential for the development of salt-tolerant crops. Here, we found  that OXIDATIVE STRESS 2 (OXS2) was a salinity-induced gene, and the mutant oxs2-1  was hypersensitive to salt stress during seed germination and root elongation  processes. In the absence of stress, OXS2 was predominantly localized in the  cytoplasm; when the plants were treated with salt, OXS2 entered the nuclear.  Further RNA-seq analysis and qPCR identification showed that, in the presence of  salt stress, a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were  activated, which contain BOXS2 motifs previously identified as the binding  element for AtOXS2. Further ChIP analysis revealed that, under salt stress, OXS2  associated with CA1 and Araport11 directly through binding the BOXS2 containing  fragments in the promoter regions. In conclusion, our results indicate that OXS2  is required for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis mainly through associating with the  downstream CA1 and Araport11 directly.', '2019 Dec 30', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-019-56456-1', 'Zhang']
