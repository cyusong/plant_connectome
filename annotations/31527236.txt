['31527236', 'The PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) play a central role in repressing  photomorphogenesis, and phosphorylation mediates the stability of PIF proteins.  Although the kinases responsible for PIF phosphorylation have been extensively  studied, the phosphatases that dephosphorylate PIFs remain largely unknown. Here,  we report that seedlings with mutations in FyPP1 and FyPP3, 2 genes encoding the  catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), exhibited short hypocotyls and  opened cotyledons in the dark, which resembled the photomorphogenic development  of dark-grown pifq mutants. The hypocotyls of dark-grown sextuple mutant fypp1  fypp3 (f1 f3) pifq were shorter than those of parental mutants f1 f3 and pifq,  indicating that PP6 phosphatases and PIFs function synergistically to repress  photomorphogenesis in the dark. We showed that FyPPs directly interacted with  PIF3 and PIF4, and PIF3 and PIF4 proteins exhibited mobility shifts in f1 f3  mutants, consistent with their hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PIF4 was more  rapidly degraded in f1 f3 mutants than in wild type after light exposure.  Whole-genome transcriptomic analyses indicated that PP6 and PIFs coregulated many  genes, and PP6 proteins may positively regulate PIF transcriptional activity.  These data suggest that PP6 phosphatases may repress photomorphogenesis by  controlling the stability and transcriptional activity of PIF proteins via  regulating PIF phosphorylation.', '2019 Oct 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1907540116', 'ORCID:']
