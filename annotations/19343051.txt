['19343051', 'Recent studies have identified a conserved WG/GW-containing motif, known as the  Argonaute (AGO) hook, which is involved in the recruitment of AGOs to distinct  components of the eukaryotic RNA silencing pathways. By using this motif as a  model to detect new components in plant RNA silencing pathways, we identified  SPT5-like, a plant-specific AGO4-interacting member of the nuclear SPT5  (Suppressor of Ty insertion 5) RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation factor family  that is characterized by the presence of a carboxy-terminal extension with more  than 40 WG/GW motifs. Knockout SPT5-like mutants show a decrease in the  accumulation of several 24-nt RNAs and hypomethylation at different loci  revealing an implication in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Here, we propose  that SPT5-like emerged in plants as a facultative RNAP elongation factor. Its  plant-specific origin and role in RdDM might reflect functional interactions with  plant-specific RNA Pols required for RdDM.', '2009 Jun', 'EMBO Rep', '10.1038/embor.2009.31', 'Lagrange']
