Plant pathogens pose a significant threat to the food industry and food security accounting for 10-40% crop losses annually on a global scale. Economic losses from plant diseases are estimated at $300B for major food crops and are associated with reduced food availability and accessibility and also high food costs. Although strategies exist to reduce the impact of diseases in plants, many of these introduce harmful chemicals to our food chain. Therefore, it is important to understand and utilize plants' immune systems to control plant pathogens to enable more sustainable agriculture. Lipids are core components of cell membranes and as such are part of the first line of defense against pathogen attack. Recent developments in omics technologies have advanced our understanding of how plant membrane lipid biosynthesis, remodelling and/or signalling modulate plant responses to infection. Currently, there is limited information available in the scientific literature concerning lipid signalling targets and their biochemical and physiological consequences in response to plant pathogens. This review focusses on the functions of membrane lipid derivatives and their involvement in plant responses to pathogens as biotic stressors. We describe major plant defense systems including systemic-acquired resistance, basal resistance, hypersensitivity and the gene-for-gene concept in this context.
