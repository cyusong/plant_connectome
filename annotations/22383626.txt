The study of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential to uncover unknown functions of proteins at the molecular level and to gain insight into complex cellular networks. Affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS), yeast two-hybrid, imaging approaches and numerous diverse databases have been developed as strategies to analyze PPIs. The past decade has seen an increase in the number of identified proteins with the development of MS and large-scale proteome analyses. Consequently, the false-positive protein identification rate has also increased. Therefore, the general consensus is to confirm PPI data using one or more independent approaches for an accurate evaluation. Furthermore, identifying minor PPIs is fundamental for understanding the functions of transient interactions and low-abundance proteins. Besides establishing PPI methodologies, we are now seeing the development of new methods and/or improvements in existing methods, which involve identifying minor proteins by MS, multidimensional protein identification technology or OFFGEL electrophoresis analyses, one-shot analysis with a long column or filter-aided sample preparation methods. These advanced techniques should allow thousands of proteins to be identified, whereas in-depth proteomic methods should permit the identification of transient binding or PPIs with weak affinity. Here, the current status of PPI analysis is reviewed and some advanced techniques are discussed briefly along with future challenges for plant proteomics.
