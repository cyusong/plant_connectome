Flower angle is crucially important for accurate pollination and flower protection against abiotic factors. Evolutionary factors shaping floral traits are particularly strong for bilaterally symmetric flowers because these flowers require more pollination accuracy than radially symmetrical flowers. We experimentally investigated the flower angle in the snowdrop's (<i>Galanthus nivalis</i>) radially symmetrical, early-blooming downward flowers. Bumblebees were able to gather significantly more pollen grains from downward flowers than from upward flowers, but female traits (fertility in the field) seem unaffected by flower angle. Similar experiments with radially symmetrical, later flowering Lesser celandine (<i>Ficaria verna</i>) upward flowers showed no differences in bees' abilities to gather pollen in upward vs downward-facing flowers. The downward angle of snowdrop flowers is an adaptation that increases the ability of insects to collect more pollen grains under unfavorable early spring weather conditions when pollinators are scarce.
