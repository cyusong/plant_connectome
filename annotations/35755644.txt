Deeper and longer roots allow crops to survive and flourish, but our understanding of the plant growth regulators promoting root system establishment is limited. Here, we report that, a novel auxin receptor agonist, named K-10, had a remarkable promotive effect on root growth in both <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> through the enhancement of root-related signaling responses. Using computer-aided drug discovery approaches, we developed potent lead compound by screening artificial chemicals on the basis of the auxin receptor TIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1), and a series of N-(benzo[d] [1,3] dioxol-5-yl)-2-(one-benzylthio) acetamides, K-1 to K-22, were designed and synthesized. The results of bioassay showed that K-10 exhibited an excellent root growth-promoting activity far exceeding that of NAA (1-naphthylacetic acid). A further morphological investigation of the auxin related mutants (<i>yucQ</i>, <i>tir1</i>) revealed that K-10 had auxin-like physiological functions and was recognized by TIR1, and K-10 significantly enhanced auxin response reporter's (<i>DR5:GUS</i>) transcriptional activity. Consistently, transcriptome analysis showed that K-10 induced a common transcriptional response with auxin and down-regulated the expression of root growth-inhibiting genes. Further molecular docking analysis revealed that K-10 had a stronger binding ability with TIR1 than NAA. These results indicated that this class of derivatives could be a promising scaffold for the discovery and development of novel auxin receptor agonists, and the employment of K-10 may be effective for enhancing root growth and crop production.
