Plant responses to salinity are becoming increasingly understood, however, salt priming mechanisms remain unclear, especially in perennial fruit trees. Herein, we showed that low-salt pre-exposure primes olive (Olea europaea) plants against high salinity stress. We then performed a proteogenomic study to characterize priming responses in olive roots and leaves. Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data along with metabolic data revealed robust salinity changes that exhibit distinct or overlapping patterns in olive tissues, among which we focused on sugar regulation. Using the multi-crossed -omics data set, we showed that major differences between primed and nonprimed tissues are mainly associated with hormone signaling and defense-related interactions. We identified multiple genes and proteins, including known and putative regulators, that reported significant proteomic and transcriptomic changes between primed and nonprimed plants. Evidence also supported the notion that protein post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylations, carbonylations and S-nitrosylations, promote salt priming. The proteome and transcriptome abundance atlas uncovered alterations between mRNA and protein quantities within tissues and salinity conditions. Proteogenomic-driven causal model discovery also unveiled key interaction networks involved in salt priming. Data generated in this study are important resources for understanding salt priming in olive tree and facilitating proteogenomic research in plant physiology.
