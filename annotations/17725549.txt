['17725549', 'Green peach aphid (GPA) Myzus persicae (Sulzer) is a phloem-feeding insect with  an exceptionally wide host range. Previously, it has been shown that Arabidopsis  thaliana PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4), which is expressed at elevated levels in  response to GPA infestation, is required for resistance to GPA in the Arabidopsis  accession Columbia. We demonstrate here that the role of PAD4 in the response to  GPA is conserved in Arabidopsis accessions Wassilewskija and Landsberg erecta.  Electrical monitoring of aphid feeding behavior revealed that PAD4 modulates a  phloem-based defense mechanism against GPA. GPA spends more time actively feeding  from the sieve elements of pad4 mutants than from wild-type plants, and less time  feeding on transgenic plants in which PAD4 is ectopically expressed. The activity  of PAD4 in limiting phloem sap uptake serves as a deterrent in host-plant choice,  and restricts aphid population size. In Arabidopsis defense against pathogens,  all known PAD4 functions require its signaling and stabilizing partner EDS1  (ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1). Bioassays with eds1 mutants alone or in  combination with pad4 and with plants conditionally expressing PAD4 under the  control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter reveal that PAD4-modulated defense  against GPA does not involve EDS1. Thus, a PAD4 mode of action that is uncoupled  from EDS1 determines the extent of aphid feeding in the phloem.', '2007 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03241.x', 'Shah']
