['19407143', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts as a developmental signal and as an  integrator of environmental cues such as drought and cold. Key players in ABA  signal transduction include the type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) ABI1 and  ABI2, which act by negatively regulating ABA responses. In this study, we  identify interactors of ABI1 and ABI2 which we have named regulatory components  of ABA receptor (RCARs). In Arabidopsis, RCARs belong to a family with 14 members  that share structural similarity with class 10 pathogen-related proteins. RCAR1  was shown to bind ABA, to mediate ABA-dependent inactivation of ABI1 or ABI2 in  vitro, and to antagonize PP2C action in planta. Other RCARs also mediated  ABA-dependent regulation of ABI1 and ABI2, consistent with a combinatorial  assembly of receptor complexes.', '2009 May 22', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1172408', 'Grill']
