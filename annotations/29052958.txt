Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera or lotus) is an important aquatic plant in horticulture and ecosystems. As a foundation for exploring genomic variation and evolution among different germplasms, we re-sequenced 19 individuals from three cultivated temperate lotus subgroups (rhizome, seed and flower lotus), one wild temperate lotus subgroup (wild lotus), one tropical lotus group (Thai lotus) and an outgroup (Nelumbo lutea). Through genetic diversity and polymorphism analysis by non-missing SNP sites widely distributed in the whole genome, we confirmed that wild and Thai lotus exhibited greater differentiation with a higher genomic diversity compared to cultivated lotus. Rhizome lotus had the lowest genomic diversity and a closer relationship to wild lotus, whereas the genomes of seed and flower lotus were admixed. Genes in energy metabolism process and plant immunity evolved rapidly in lotus, reflecting local adaptation. We established that candidate genes in genomic regions with significant differentiation associated with temperate and tropical lotus divergence always exhibited highly divergent expression pattern. Together, this study comprehensive and credible interpretates important patterns of genetic diversity and relationships, gene evolution, and genomic signature from ecotypic differentiation of sacred lotus.
