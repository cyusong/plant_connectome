<i>Aegilops sharonensis</i>, a wild relative of wheat, harbors diverse disease and insect resistance genes, making it a potentially excellent gene source for wheat improvement. In this study, we characterized and evaluated six wheat-<i>A. sharonensis</i> derivatives, which included three disomic additions, one disomic substitution + monotelosomic addition and two disomic substitution + disomic additions. A total of 51 PLUG markers were developed and used to allocate the <i>A. sharonensis</i> chromosomes in each of the six derivatives to <i>Triticeae</i> homoeologous groups. A set of cytogenetic markers specific for <i>A. sharonensis</i> chromosomes was established based on FISH using oligonucleotides as probes. Molecular cytogenetic marker analysis confirmed that these lines were a CS-<i>A</i>. <i>sharonensis</i> 2S<sup>sh</sup> disomic addition, a 4S<sup>sh</sup> disomic addition, a 4S<sup>sh</sup> (4D) substitution + 5S<sup>sh</sup>L monotelosomic addition, a 6S<sup>sh</sup> disomic addition, a 4S<sup>sh</sup> (4D) substitution + 6S<sup>sh</sup> disomic addition and a 4S<sup>sh</sup> (4D) substitution + 7S<sup>sh</sup> disomic addition line, respectively. Disease resistance investigations showed that chromosome 7S<sup>sh</sup> of <i>A</i>. <i>sharonensis</i> might harbor a new powdery mildew resistance gene, and therefore it has potential for use as resistance source for wheat breeding.
