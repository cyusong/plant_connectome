['19675149', 'Glycolysis is a central metabolic pathway that, in plants, occurs in both the  cytosol and the plastids. The glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  (GAPDH) catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to  1,3-bisphosphoglycerate with concomitant reduction of NAD(+) to NADH. Both  cytosolic (GAPCs) and plastidial (GAPCps) GAPDH activities have been described.  However, the in vivo functions of the plastidial isoforms remain unresolved. In  this work, we have identified two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  chloroplast/plastid-localized GAPDH isoforms (GAPCp1 and GAPCp2). gapcp double  mutants display a drastic phenotype of arrested root development, dwarfism, and  sterility. In spite of their low gene expression level as compared with other  GAPDHs, GAPCp down-regulation leads to altered gene expression and to drastic  changes in the sugar and amino acid balance of the plant. We demonstrate that  GAPCps are important for the synthesis of serine in roots. Serine supplementation  to the growth medium rescues root developmental arrest and restores normal levels  of carbohydrates and sugar biosynthetic activities in gapcp double mutants. We  provide evidence that the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis plays an  important role in supplying serine to roots. Overall, these studies provide  insights into the in vivo functions of the GAPCps in plants. Our results  emphasize the importance of the plastidial glycolytic pathway, and specifically  of GAPCps, in plant primary metabolism.', '2009 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.143701', 'Ros']
