['11306548', 'Chromosomal double-strand DNA breaks must be repaired; in the absence of repair  the resulting acentromeric (and telomereless) fragments may be lost and/or the  broken DNA ends may recombine causing general chromosomal instability. The  Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 protein complex acts at DNA ends and is implicated in both  homologous and non-homologous recombination. We have isolated a rad50 mutant of  the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and show here that it has a somatic  hyper-recombination phenotype in planta. This finding supports the hypothesis of  a competition between homologous and illegitimate recombination in higher  eukaryotes. To our knowledge, this is the first direct in vivo support for the  role of this complex in chromosomal recombination in a multicellular organism and  the first description of a mutation of a known gene leading to  hyper-recombination in plants.', '2001 Apr', 'EMBO Rep', '10.1093/embo-reports/kve069', 'White']
