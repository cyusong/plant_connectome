Ammonia and methanol both bind to the water oxidising complex of photosystem II during its turnover, possibly at sites where water binds during the normal water oxidation process. We have investigated the interaction between these two water analogues at the S2 state of the water oxidising cycle using electron magnetic resonance techniques. We find evidence that ammonia displaces methanol from its binding site.

Ammonia: !displaces! Methanol 
Methanol: !binds to! Water oxidising complex
