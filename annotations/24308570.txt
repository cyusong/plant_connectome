Plants utilize plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinases (RLKs) to sense extracellular signals to coordinate growth, development, and innate immune responses. BAK1 regulates multiple signaling pathways acting as a co-receptor of several distinct ligand-binding RLKs. It has been debated whether BAK1 serves as an essential regulatory component or only a signal amplifier without pathway specificity. This issue has been clarified recently. Genetic and structural analyses indicated that BAK1 and its homologs play indispensible roles in mediating brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway by directly perceiving the ligand BR and activating the receptor of BR, BRI1. The mechanism revealed by these studies now serves as a paradigm for how a pair of RLKs can function together in ligand binding and subsequent initiation of signaling.
