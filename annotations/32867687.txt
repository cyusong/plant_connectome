C2H2 zinc finger proteins (C2H2 ZFPs) play vital roles in shaping many aspects of plant growth and adaptation to the environment. Plant genomes harbor hundreds of C2H2 ZFPs, which compose one of the most important and largest transcription factor families in higher plants. Although the C2H2 ZFP gene family has been reported in several plant species, it has not been described in the model leguminous species Medicago truncatula. In this study, we identified 218 C2H2 type ZFPs with 337 individual C2H2 motifs in M. truncatula. We showed that the high rate of local gene duplication has significantly contributed to the expansion of the C2H2 gene family in M. truncatula. The identified ZFPs exhibit high variation in motif arrangement and expression pattern, suggesting that the short C2H2 zinc finger motif has been adopted as a scaffold by numerous transcription factors with different functions to recognize cis-elements. By analyzing the public expression datasets and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), we identified several C2H2 ZFPs that are specifically expressed in certain tissues, such as the nodule, seed, and flower. Our genome-wide work revealed an expanded C2H2 ZFP gene family in an important legume M. truncatula, and provides new insights into the diversification and expansion of C2H2 ZFPs in higher plants.
