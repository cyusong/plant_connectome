Wild species can be used to improve various agronomic traits in cultivars; however, a limited understanding of the genetic basis underlying the morphological differences between wild and cultivated species hinders the integration of beneficial traits from wild species. In the present study, we generated and sequenced recombinant inbred lines (RILs, 201 F<sub>10</sub> lines) derived from a cross between Solanum pimpinellifolium and Solanum lycopersicum tomatoes. Based on a high-resolution recombination bin map to uncover major loci determining the phenotypic variance between wild and cultivated tomatoes, 104 significantly associated loci were identified for 18 agronomic traits. On average, these loci explained ~39% of the phenotypic variance of the RILs. We further generated near-isogenic lines (NILs) for four identified loci, and the lines exhibited significant differences for the associated traits. We found that two loci could improve the flower number and inflorescence architecture in the cultivar following introgression of the wild-species alleles. These findings allowed us to construct a trait-locus network to help explain the correlations among different traits based on the pleiotropic or linked loci. Our results provide insights into the morphological changes between wild and cultivated tomatoes, and will help to identify key genes governing important agronomic traits for the molecular selection of elite tomato varieties.
