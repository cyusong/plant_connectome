Plant virus genomes cross the barrier of the host cell wall and move to neighboring cells either in the form of nucleoprotein complex or encapsidated into virions. Virus transport is facilitated by virus-encoded movement proteins (MP), which are different from one another in number, size, sequence, and in the strategy used to overcome the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (PD). (1) A group of them forms tubules inside the lumen of highly modified PDs upon removal of the desmotubule. To date the molecular mechanism(s) and the host factors involved in the assembly of MP tubules as well as the mechanistic aspects of virus particle transport throughout them remain substantially unknown. In a recent study, we showed that Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) MP traffics in the endocytic pathway with the help of 3 tyrosine-sorting signals, which are not required to target MP to the plasma membrane but are essential for tubule formation. (2) This evidence unravels a previously unknown connection between the plant endosomal system and tubule-mediated virus movement that is here supported by demonstration of hindrance of tubule assembly upon Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment. We discuss the implications of our data on the mechanisms of viral transport through tubules and draw parallels with plant mechanisms of polarized growth.
