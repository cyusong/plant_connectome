Reversible protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification involved in virtually all plant processes, as it mediates protein activity and signal transduction. Here, we probe dynamic protein phosphorylation during <i>de novo</i> shoot organogenesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We find that application of three kinase inhibitors in various time intervals has different effects on root explants. Short exposures to the putative histidine (His) kinase inhibitor TCSA during the initial days on shoot induction medium (SIM) are detrimental for regeneration in seven natural accessions. Investigation of cytokinin signaling mutants, as well as reporter lines for hormone responses and shoot markers, suggests that TCSA impedes cytokinin signal transduction <i>via</i> AHK3, AHK4, AHP3, and AHP5. A mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteome analysis further reveals profound deregulation of Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteins regulating protein modification, transcription, vesicle trafficking, organ morphogenesis, and cation transport. Among TCSA-responsive factors are prior candidates with a role in shoot apical meristem patterning, such as AGO1, BAM1, PLL5, FIP37, TOP1ALPHA, and RBR1, as well as proteins involved in polar auxin transport (e.g., PIN1) and brassinosteroid signaling (e.g., BIN2). Putative novel regeneration determinants regulated by TCSA include RD2, AT1G52780, PVA11, and AVT1C, while NAIP2, OPS, ARR1, QKY, and aquaporins exhibit differential phospholevels on control SIM. LC-MS/MS data are available <i>via</i> ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD030754.
