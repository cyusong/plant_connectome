Actin depolymerization factors (ADFs), as actin-binding proteins, act a crucial role in plant development and growth, as well as in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. Here, we found that CARK3 plays a role in regulating hypocotyl development and links a cross-talk between actin filament and drought stress through interaction with ADF4. By using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and GST pull-down, we confirmed that CARK3 interacts with ADF4 <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Next, we generated and characterized double mutant <i>adf4cark3-4</i> and OE-ADF4:<i>cark3-4</i>. The hypocotyl elongation assay indicated that the <i>cark3-4</i> mutant seedlings were slightly longer hypocotyls when compared with the wild type plants (WT), while <i>CARK3</i> overexpressing seedlings had no difference with WT. In addition, overexpression of <i>ADF4</i> significantly inhibited long hypocotyls of cark3-4 mutants. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of <i>ADF4</i> markedly enhance drought resistance in soil when compared with WT. On the other hand, drought tolerance analysis showed that overexpression of <i>CARK3</i> could rescue <i>adf4</i> drought susceptibility. Taken together, our results suggest that CARK3 acts as a regulator in hypocotyl elongation and drought tolerance likely <i>via</i> regulating ADF4 phosphorylation.
