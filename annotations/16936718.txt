['16936718', 'Polarized cellular distribution of the phytohormone auxin and its carriers is  essential for normal plant growth and development. Polar auxin transport is  maintained by a network of auxin influx (AUX) and efflux (PIN) carriers. Both  auxin transport and PIN protein cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes  require the activity of the endosomal GNOM; however, intracellular routes taken  by these carriers remain largely unknown. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana  SORTING NEXIN 1 (AtSNX1) is involved in the auxin pathway and that PIN2, but not  PIN1 or AUX1, is transported through AtSNX1-containing endosomes. We demonstrate  that the snx1-null mutant exhibits multiple auxin-related defects and that loss  of function of AtSNX1 severely enhances the phenotype of a weak gnom mutant. In  root cells, we further show that AtSNX1 localizes to an endosomal compartment  distinct from GNOM-containing endosomes, and that PIN2 accumulates in this  compartment after treatment with the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase inhibitor  wortmannin or after a gravity stimulus. Our data reveal the existence of a novel  endosomal compartment involved in PIN2 endocytic sorting and plant development.', '2006 Sep 7', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature05046', 'Gaude']
