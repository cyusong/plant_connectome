In the early growth stage, nutrient uptake by rice roots is weak. However, rice tillering at this stage would require high N input. Thus, it is vital to clarify the mechanism involved in tillering capacity with low N inputs. In this report, two widely-planted japonica cultivars (cvs Yangyujing 2 and Nanjing 45) were selected mainly because, unlike cv. Nanjing 45, cv. Yangyujing 2 shows low-N-induced tiller outgrowth. Responses of tillers in two rice cultivars to mixture of N forms versus sole NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> supply were similar, suggesting that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> plays a pivotal role in N-modulated rice tillering. Under low NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> supply, higher expression of OsAMT1.2, OsAMT1.3, OsGS1;2, and OsGS2 was recorded in the roots of cv. Yangyujing 2 in comparison with cv. Nanjing 45, ultimately resulting in higher N content and dry weight in cv. Yangyujing 2. Stronger <sup>3</sup>H-IAA export from tiller stems was observed in cv. Yangyujing 2, mainly due to higher expression level of auxin efflux transporters. Moreover, tillers in auxin efflux transporter mutant ospin9 did not respond to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> supply relative to wild-type plants. These findings can be used in the molecular breeding of rice varieties to simultaneously improve rice population productivity and reduce N fertilizer input.
