['21730198', 'Plastid proteins that are encoded by the nuclear genome and synthesized in the  cytosol undergo posttranslational targeting to plastids. Ankyrin repeat protein  2A (AKR2A) and AKR2B were recently shown to be involved in the targeting of  proteins to the plastid outer envelope. However, it remains unknown whether other  factors are involved in this process. In this study, we investigated a factor  involved in AKR2A-mediated protein targeting to chloroplasts in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Hsp17.8, a member of the class I (CI) cytosolic small  heat shock proteins (sHsps), was identified in interactions with AKR2A. The  interaction between Hsp17.8 and AKR2A was further confirmed by  coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of  AKR2A was responsible for AKR2A binding to Hsp17.8. Other CI cytosolic sHsps also  interact with AKR2A to varying degrees. Additionally, Hsp17.8 binds to  chloroplasts in vitro and enhances AKR2A binding to chloroplasts. HSP17.8 was  expressed under normal growth conditions, and its expression increased after heat  shock. Hsp17.8 exists as a dimer under normal physiological conditions, and it is  converted to high oligomeric complexes, ranging from 240 kD to greater than 480  kD, after heat shock. High levels of Hsp17.8 together with AKR2A resulted in  increased plastid targeting of Outer Envelope Protein7 (OEP7), a plastid outer  envelope protein expressed as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein. In  contrast, artificial microRNA suppression of HSP17.8 and closely related CI  cytosolic sHSPs in protoplasts resulted in a reduction of OEP7:green fluorescent  protein targeting to plastids. Based on these data, we propose that Hsp17.8  functions as an AKR2A cofactor in targeting membrane proteins to plastid outer  membranes under normal physiological conditions.', '2011 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.178681', 'Hwang']
