An auxilin-like J-domain-containing protein, JAC1, is necessary for chloroplast movement in Arabidopsis thaliana, to capture photosynthetic light efficiently under weak light conditions. Here, we performed crystallographic and functional analyses of the J-domain of JAC1. The crystal structure of the J-domain is quite similar to that of bovine auxilin, and possesses a similar positively charged surface, which probably forms the interface with the Hsp70 chaperone. The mutation of the highly conserved HPD motif of the JAC1 J-domain abrogated the chloroplast photorelocation response. These results suggest that the requirement of JAC1 in chloroplast photorelocation movement is attributable to the J-domain's cochaperone activity.
