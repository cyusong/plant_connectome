['9584113', 'Cytokinins elevate ethylene biosynthesis in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings via a  post-transcriptional modification of one isoform of the key biosynthetic enzyme  ACC synthase. In order to begin to dissect the signaling events leading from  cytokinin perception to this modification, we have isolated a series of mutants  that lack the ethylene-mediated triple response in the presence of cytokinin due  to their failure to increase ethylene biosynthesis. Analysis of genetic  complementation and mapping revealed that these Cin mutants  (cytokinin-insensitive) represent four distinct complementation groups, one of  which, cin4, is allelic to the constitutive photomorphogenic mutant fus9/cop10.  The Cin mutants have subtle effects on the morphology of adult plants. We further  characterized the Cin mutants by analyzing ethylene biosynthesis in response to  various other inducers and in adult tissues, as well as by assaying additional  cytokinin responses. The cin3 mutant did not disrupt ethylene biosynthesis under  any other conditions, nor did it disrupt any other cytokinin responses. Only cin2  disrupted ethylene biosynthesis in multiple circumstances. cin1 and cin2 made  less anthocyanin in response to cytokinin. cin1 also displayed reduced shoot  initiation in tissue culture in response to cytokinin, suggesting that it affects  a cytokinin signaling element.', '1998 May', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/149.1.417', 'Kieber']
