Mechanisms of the complex formation between plastocyanin and cytochrome f in higher plants (Spinacia oleracea and Brassica rapa), green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and two species of cyanobacteria (Phormidium laminosum and Nostoc sp.) were investigated using combined Brownian and molecular dynamics simulations and hierarchical cluster analysis. In higher plants and green algae, electrostatic interactions force plastocyanin molecule close to the heme of cytochrome f. In the subsequent rotation of plastocyanin molecule around the point of electrostatic contact in the vicinity of cytochrome f, copper (Cu) atom approaches cytochrome heme forming a stable configuration where cytochrome f molecule behaves as a rather rigid body without conformational changes. In Nostoc plastocyanin molecule approaches cytochrome f in a different orientation (head-on) where the stabilization of the plastocyanin-cytochrome f complex is accompanied by the conformational changes of the G188E189D190 loop that stabilizes the whole complex. In cyanobacterium P. laminosum, electrostatic preorientation of the approaching molecules was not detected, thus indicating that random motions rather than long-range electrostatic interactions are responsible for the proper mutual orientation. We demonstrated that despite the structural similarity of the investigated electron transport proteins in different photosynthetic organisms, the complexity of molecular mechanisms of the complex formation increases in the following sequence: non-heterocystous cyanobacteria - heterocystous cyanobacteria - green algae - flowering plants.
