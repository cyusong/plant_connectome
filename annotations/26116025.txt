Abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs) play important roles in abiotic stress responses; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, it is reported that overexpression of Poncirus trifoliata PtrABF significantly enhanced dehydration tolerance. The transgenic lines displayed smaller stomatal apertures, reduced stomatal density/index, and lower expression levels of genes associated with stomatal development. PtrABF was found to interact with PtrICE1, a homologue of ICE1 (Inducer of CBF Expression 1) that has been shown to be critical for stomatal development. Microarray analysis revealed that a total of 70 genes were differentially expressed in the transgenic line, 42 induced and 28 repressed. At least two units of ABREs and coupling elements were present in the promoters of most of the induced genes, among which peroxidase and arginine decarboxylase were verified as bona fide targets of PtrABF. Transgenic plants exhibited higher antioxidant enzyme activities and free polyamine levels, but lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde. Polyamines were revealed to be associated with ROS scavenging in the transgenic plants due to a modulation of antioxidant enzymes triggered by signalling mediated by H2O2 derived from polyamine oxidase (PAO)-mediated catabolism. Taken together, the results indicate that PtrABF functions positively in dehydration tolerance by limiting water loss through its influence on stomatal movement or formation and maintaining ROS homeostasis via modulation of antioxidant enzymes and polyamines through transcriptional regulation of relevant target genes.
