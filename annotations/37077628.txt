The transcription factors of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family genes play significant roles in stress response as well as growth and development in plants. However, little is known about the <i>bZIP</i> gene family in Chinese chestnut (<i>Castanea mollissima</i> Blume). To better understand the characteristics of <i>bZIP</i>s in chestnut and their function in starch accumulation, a series of analyses were performed including phylogenetic, synteny, co-expression and yeast one-hybrid analyses. Totally, we identified 59 <i>bZIP</i> genes that were unevenly distributed in the chestnut genome and named them <i>CmbZIP01</i> to <i>CmbZIP59</i>. These <i>CmbZIP</i>s were clustered into 13 clades with clade-specific motifs and structures. A synteny analysis revealed that segmental duplication was the major driving force of expansion of the <i>CmbZIP</i> gene family. A total of 41 <i>CmbZIP</i> genes had syntenic relationships with four other species. The results from the co-expression analyses indicated that seven <i>CmbZIP</i>s in three key modules may be important in regulating starch accumulation in chestnut seeds. Yeast one-hybrid assays showed that transcription factors CmbZIP13 and CmbZIP35 might participate in starch accumulation in the chestnut seed by binding to the promoters of <i>CmISA2</i> and <i>CmSBE1_2</i>, respectively. Our study provided basic information on <i>CmbZIP</i> genes, which can be utilized in future functional analysis and breeding studies.
