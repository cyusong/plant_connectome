['23121860', 'Adenylate kinase (AK; EC 2.7.4.3) is highly conserved across a wide range of  organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila  melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Homo sapiens. While AK6 orthologs play  important roles in the growth of yeast and worms, the physiological function of  AK6 in A. thaliana is still unknown. In this study, we first cloned and expressed  Arabidopsis adenylate kinase 6 (AAK6). Enzyme assays revealed that AAK6 has  characteristic adenylate kinase properties, with ATP as the preferred phosphate  donor and AMP as the best phosphate acceptor. A subcellular localization assay  demonstrated that AAK6 had a predominant nuclear localization. Through  biochemical purification and mass spectrometry analysis, a putative homolog of  the S. cerevisiae Rps14 protein was identified as a partner of AAK6. Most  importantly, we observed that aak6 T-DNA insertion mutants had decreased stem  growth compared with wild-type plants. These data indicate that AAK6 exhibits  adenylate kinase activity and is an essential growth factor in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.10.002', 'Zhang']
