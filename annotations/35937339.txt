Drought stress limits plant development and reproduction. Multiple mechanisms in plants are activated to respond to stress. The MYC2 transcription factor is a core regulator of the jasmonate (JA) pathway and plays a vital role in the crosstalk between abscisic acid (ABA) and JA. In this study, we found that <i>SlMYC2</i> responded to drought stress and regulated stomatal aperture in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Overexpression of <i>SlMYC2</i> repressed <i>SlCHS1</i> expression and decreased the flavonol content, increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in guard cells and promoted the accumulation of JA and ABA in leaves. Additionally, silencing the <i>SlCHS1</i> gene produced a phenotype that was similar to that of the <i>MYC2-</i>overexpressing (<i>MYC2</i>-OE) strain, especially in terms of stomatal dynamics and ROS levels. Finally, we confirmed that <i>SlMYC2</i> directly repressed the expression of <i>SlCHS1</i>. Our study revealed that <i>SlMYC2</i> drove stomatal closure by modulating the accumulation of flavonol and the JA and ABA contents, helping us decipher the mechanism of stomatal movement under drought stress.
