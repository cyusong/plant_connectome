['12837954', 'Xyloglucans are the principal glycans that interlace cellulose microfibrils in  most flowering plants. The mur3 mutant of Arabidopsis contains a severely altered  structure of this polysaccharide because of the absence of a conserved  alpha-L-fucosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-galactosyl side chain and excessive  galactosylation at an alternative xylose residue. Despite this severe structural  alteration, mur3 plants were phenotypically normal and exhibited tensile strength  in their inflorescence stems comparable to that of wild-type plants. The MUR3  gene was cloned positionally and shown to encode a xyloglucan  galactosyltransferase that acts specifically on the third xylose residue within  the XXXG core structure of xyloglucan. MUR3 belongs to a large family of type-II  membrane proteins that is evolutionarily conserved among higher plants. The  enzyme shows sequence similarities to the glucuronosyltransferase domain of  exostosins, a class of animal glycosyltransferases that catalyze the synthesis of  heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan with numerous roles in cell differentiation  and development. This finding suggests that components of the plant cell wall and  of the animal extracellular matrix are synthesized by evolutionarily related  enzymes even though the structures of the corresponding polysaccharides are  entirely different from each other.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.009837', 'Reiter']
