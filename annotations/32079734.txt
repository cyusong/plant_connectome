The corrinoid B<sub>12</sub> is synthesized only by prokaryotes yet is widely required by eukaryotes as an enzyme cofactor. Microalgae have evolved B<sub>12</sub> dependence on multiple occasions, and we previously demonstrated that experimental evolution of the non-B<sub>12</sub>-requiring alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> in media supplemented with B<sub>12</sub> generated a B<sub>12</sub>-dependent mutant (hereafter metE7). This clone provides a unique opportunity to study the physiology of a nascent B<sub>12</sub> auxotroph. Our analyses demonstrate that B<sub>12</sub> deprivation of metE7 disrupts C1 metabolism, causes an accumulation of starch and triacylglycerides, and leads to a decrease in photosynthetic pigments, proteins, and free amino acids. B<sub>12</sub> deprivation also caused a substantial increase in reactive oxygen species, which preceded rapid cell death. Survival could be improved without compromising growth by simultaneously depriving the cells of nitrogen, suggesting a type of cross protection. Significantly, we found further improvements in survival under B<sub>12</sub> limitation and an increase in B<sub>12</sub> use efficiency after metE7 underwent a further period of experimental evolution, this time in coculture with a B<sub>12</sub>-producing bacterium. Therefore, although an early B<sub>12</sub>-dependent alga would likely be poorly adapted to coping with B<sub>12</sub> deprivation, association with B<sub>12</sub>-producers can ensure long-term survival whilst also providing a suitable environment for evolving mechanisms to tolerate B<sub>12</sub> limitation better.
