Many plant cells retain their totipotency when cultured in vitro. The regulation of shoot regeneration from in vitro culture involves a number of gene products, but the nature of the associated post-transcriptional events remains largely unknown. Here, the post-transcriptional regulator ARGONAUTE10 (AGO10), a protein which is specifically expressed in the explant during the period when pro-shoot apical meristems (SAMs) are forming, has been known to inhibit shoot regeneration. In in vitro cultured explants of the loss-of-function mutant ago10, a much larger than normal number of SAMs was formed and, in these, the stem cell marker genes WUSCHEL, CLAVATA3 and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS were all strongly expressed. AGO10 repressed the accumulation of the microRNAs miR165/166, thereby up-regulating a suite of HD-ZIP III genes. The overproduction of miR166 was shown to promote shoot regeneration, while the absence of miR165/166 message resulted in a blockage to shoot regeneration and only a partial rescue of the phenotype of the ago10 mutant. The major conclusion was that the shoot regeneration inhibition determined by AGO10 functions via the repression of miR165/166.
