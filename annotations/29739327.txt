This study was designed to reveal potential molecular mechanisms of long-term overgrazing-induced dwarfism in sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis). An electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry system was used to generate proteomic data of dwarf sheepgrass from a long-term overgrazed rangeland and normal sheepgrass from a long-term enclosed rangeland. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between dwarf and normal sheepgrass were identified, after which their potential functions and interactions with each other were predicted. The expression of key DEPs was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) using a multiple reaction monitoring method. Compared with normal sheepgrass, a total of 51 upregulated and 53 downregulated proteins were identified in dwarf sheepgrass. The amino acids biosynthesis pathway was differentially enriched between the two conditions presenting DEPs, such as SAT5_ARATH and DAPA_MAIZE. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed a possible interaction between RPOB2_LEPTE, A0A023H9M8_9STRA, ATPB_DIOEL, RBL_AMOTI and DNAK_GRATL. Four modules were also extracted from the PPI network. The HPLC-MS analysis confirmed the upregulation and downregulation of ATPB_DIOEL and DNAK_GRATL, respectively in dwarf samples compared with in the controls. The upregulated ATPB_DIOEL and downregulated DNAK_GRATL as well as proteins that interact with them, such as RPOB2_LEPTE, A0A023H9M8_9STRA and RBL_AMOTI, may be associated with the long-term overgrazing-induced dwarfism in sheepgrass.
