['9927475', 'The life cycle of plants comprises two alternating generations, the diploid  sporophyte (spore-bearing plant) and the haploid gametophyte (gamete-bearing  plant). In contrast to animals, the postmeiotic cells give rise to haploid  organisms whose function is to produce the gametes and to mediate fertilization.  Analysis of gametophyte development and function has been hampered by the  difficulty of identifying haplo-phase-specific mutants in conventional  mutagenesis screens. Here we use a genetic strategy that is based on segregation  distortion of nearby visible markers to screen for EMS-induced gametophytic  mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using the multiple marker chromosome mm1 we have  isolated seven lines that displayed an altered segregation of markers. Reciprocal  backcrosses of these lines showed a marked reduction of the transmission of the  male and/or female gametes. Phenotypic analysis revealed that different aspects  of either gametophytic development or function were affected. Three male  gametophytic lines showed specific arrests during pollen development. One male  gametophytic line was specifically defective in pollen tube elongation. Three  gametophytic lines showed variable defects in both male and female gametophytic  development.', '1999 Feb', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/151.2.849', 'Hulskamp']
