Mycorrhizal fungi are central to the biology of land plants. However, to what extent mycorrhizal shifts - broad evolutionary transitions in root-associated fungal symbionts - are related to changes in plant trophic modes remains poorly understood. We built a comprehensive DNA dataset of Orchidaceae fungal symbionts and a dated plant molecular phylogeny to test the hypothesis that shifts in orchid trophic modes follow a stepwise pattern, from autotrophy over partial mycoheterotrophy (mixotrophy) to full mycoheterotrophy, and that these shifts are accompanied by switches in fungal symbionts. We estimate that at least 17 independent shifts from autotrophy towards full mycoheterotrophy occurred in orchids, mostly through an intermediate state of partial mycoheterotrophy. A wide range of fungal partners was inferred to occur in the roots of the common ancestor of this family, including 'rhizoctonias', ectomycorrhizal, and wood- or litter-decaying saprotrophic fungi. Phylogenetic hypothesis tests further show that associations with ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi were most likely a prerequisite for evolutionary shifts towards full mycoheterotrophy. We show that shifts in trophic mode often coincided with switches in fungal symbionts, suggesting that the loss of photosynthesis selects for different fungal communities in orchids. We conclude that changes in symbiotic associations and ecophysiological traits are tightly correlated throughout the diversification of orchids.
