VIP1 is a bZIP transcription factor in Arabidopsis thaliana. When cells are exposed to mechanical stress, VIP1 transiently accumulates in the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of its target genes and suppresses mechanical stress-induced root waving. The nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of VIP1 is regulated by phosphorylation and calcium-dependent signaling, but specific regulators of these processes remain to be identified. Here, inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are shown to inhibit both the mechanical stress-induced dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of VIP1. The PP2A B subunit, which recruits substrates of PP2A holoenzyme, is classified into B, B', B'', and B''' families. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, in vitro pull-down, and yeast two-hybrid assays, we show that VIP1 interacts with at least two of the six members of the Arabidopsis PP2A B''-family subunit, which have calcium-binding EF-hand motifs. VIP1AAA, a constitutively nuclear-localized VIP1 variant with substitutions in putative phosphorylation sites of VIP1, suppressed the root waving induced by VIP1-SRDX (a repression domain-fused variant of VIP1). These results support the idea that VIP1 is dephosphorylated by PP2A and that the dephosphorylation suppresses the root waving. The phosphorylation sites of VIP1 and its homologs were narrowed down by in vitro phosphorylation, yeast two-hybrid, and protein subcellular localization assays.
