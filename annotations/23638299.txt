['23638299', 'Transcriptional feedback loops are key to circadian clock function in many  organisms. Current models of the Arabidopsis circadian network consist of several  coupled feedback loops composed almost exclusively of transcriptional repressors.  Indeed, a central regulatory mechanism is the repression of evening-phased clock  genes via the binding of morning-phased Myb-like repressors to evening element  (EE) promoter motifs. We now demonstrate that a related Myb-like protein,  REVEILLE8 (RVE8), is a direct transcriptional activator of EE-containing clock  and output genes. Loss of RVE8 and its close homologs causes a delay and  reduction in levels of evening-phased clock gene transcripts and significant  lengthening of clock pace. Our data suggest a substantially revised model of the  circadian oscillator, with a clock-regulated activator essential both for clock  progression and control of clock outputs. Further, our work suggests that the  plant clock consists of a highly interconnected, complex regulatory network  rather than of coupled morning and evening feedback loops.
