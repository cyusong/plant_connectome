['7948914', 'AGL2 is one of several Arabidopsis floral MADS-box genes that were isolated based  on sequence similarity to the homeotic gene AGAMOUS. To investigate its possible  role in flower development, we have characterized in detail the expression  pattern of AGL2 in both wild-type and mutant flowers using RNA in situ  hybridization. We find that AGL2 is floral-specific; it is not expressed in the  inflorescence meristem. Within the floral meristem, AGL2 is first expressed very  early in development, after the floral meristem has emerged from the  inflorescence meristem but before any of the organ primordia emerge. The AGL2  transcript is very abundant and uniform throughout the floral meristem and in the  primordia of all four floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Thus,  AGL2 represents a new class of MADS-box genes which is expressed in all four  whorls of the flower. The AGL2 transcript remains abundant in each organ during  morphological differentiation, but diminishes as each organ undergoes the final  maturation phase of development. AGL2 expression is high in developing ovules  and, after fertilization, in developing embryos and seed coats, abating as seeds  mature. In the floral organ identity mutants ag-1, ap3-3 and ap2-2, the AGL2  expression pattern is organ- and stage-dependent. These results indicate that  AGL2 may play a fundamental role in the development of all floral organs, and of  seeds and embryos, and that AGL2 ultimately depends upon the organ identity genes  for proper expression.', '1994 Oct', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00013745', 'Ma']
