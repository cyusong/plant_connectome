The high number of peroxidase genes explains the description of numerous physiological functions and the fact that the in planta function of a single isoform has never been characterized yet. We analyzed in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana the localization of a zucchini isoperoxidase (APRX), previously purified thanks to its pectin binding ability. We confirmed that the protein is localized near the cell wall, mainly produced in the elongation area of the hypocotyls and respond to exogenous auxin. In addition, the ectopic overexpression of APRX induced changes in growth pattern and a significant reduction of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level. In agreement with these observations APRX showed an elevated in vitro auxin oxidase activity. We propose that APRX participates in the negative feedback regulation of auxin level and consequently terminates the hypocotyl elongation process.
