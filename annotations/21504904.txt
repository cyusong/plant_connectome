['21504904', 'In plant organelles, RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism that  converts specific cytidines to uridines in RNA of both mitochondria and plastids,  altering the information encoded by the gene. The cytidine to be edited is  determined by a cis-element surrounding the editing site that is specifically  recognized and bound by a trans-acting factor. All the trans-acting editing  factors identified so far in plant organelles are members of a large protein  family, the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. We have identified the  Organelle Transcript Processing 87 (OTP87) gene, which is required for RNA  editing of the nad7-C24 and atp1-C1178 sites in Arabidopsis mitochondria. OTP87  encodes an E-subclass PPR protein with an unusually short E-domain. The  recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli specifically binds to RNAs  comprising 30 nucleotides upstream and 10 nucleotides downstream of the nad7-C24  and atp1-C1178 editing sites. The loss-of-function of OTP87 results in small  plants with growth and developmental delays. In the otp87 mutant, the amount of  assembled respiratory complex V (ATP synthase) is highly reduced compared with  the wild type suggesting that the amino acid alteration in ATP1 caused by loss of  editing at the atp1-C1178 site affects complex V assembly in mitochondria.', '2011 Jun 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111.230516', 'Small']
