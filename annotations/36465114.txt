['36465114', 'Evolution has long been considered to be a conservative process in which new  genes arise from pre-existing genes through gene duplication, domain shuffling,  horizontal transfer, overprinting, retrotransposition, etc. However, this view is  changing as new genes originating from non-genic sequences are discovered in  different organisms. Still, rather limited functional information is available.  Here, we have identified TWISTED1 (TWT1), a possible de novo-originated  protein-coding gene that modifies microtubule arrangement and causes helicoidal  growth in Arabidopsis thaliana when its expression is increased. Interestingly,  even though TWT1 is a likely recent gene, the lack of TWT1 function affects A.  thaliana development. TWT1 seems to have originated from a non-genic sequence. If  so, it would be one of the few examples to date of how during evolution de novo  genes are integrated into developmental cellular and organismal processes.', '2022 Dec 22', 'iScience', '10.1016/j.isci.2022.105627', 'de']
