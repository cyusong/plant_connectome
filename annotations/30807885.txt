Gibberellins (GAs), a group of plant hormones, and phosphate (Pi), a macronutrient, are essential for numerous aspects of plant growth and development. During Pi starvation, plants develop many adaptive strategies to cope. However, the detailed roles of GAs in Pi deficiency responses of plants are largely unclear. In the present work, we found that low Pi (LP) treatment caused many responses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), including anthocyanin accumulation, upregulation of genes encoding high-affinity Pi transporters, and a striking induction of primary root growth. Application of exogeneous GA<sub>3</sub> in the wild-type Micro-Tom (MT) significantly impaired LP-induced shoot anthocyanin accumulation and the upregulation of several key biosynthetic genes, including SlCHS, SlDFR, and SlF3'H. Meanwhile, LP-induced primary root elongation, upregulated SlPT2 and SlPT7 (genes encoding high-affinity Pi transporters), and favored Pi uptake were obviously attenuated in GA biosynthetic mutant gib3. Moreover, LP treatment obviously decreased the content of endogenous GA<sub>4</sub> (a main form of GAs in tomato) in shoots but increased it in roots of MT seedlings. Additionally, in pro, a tomato mutant of DELLA protein, the LP-induced anthocyanin accumulation and expression of SlCHS, SlDFR, and SlF3'H were impaired, whereas the LP-induced primary root growth, expression of genes SlPT2 and SlPT7, and Pi uptake were more enhanced compared with the wild-type MT. Taking these data together, GAs play dual roles in the Pi starvation response of tomato seedlings, negatively in shoots but positively in roots. In addition, the GA-PRO system may play an important role in responding to Pi starvation in tomato.
