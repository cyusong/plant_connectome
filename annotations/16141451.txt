Plant nuclear genomes encode hundreds of predicted organellar RNA binding proteins, few of which have been connected with their physiological RNA substrates and functions. In fact, among the largest family of putative RNA binding proteins in plants, the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family, no physiologically relevant RNA ligands have been firmly established. We used the chloroplast-splicing factor CAF1 to demonstrate the fidelity of a microarray-based method for identifying RNAs associated with specific proteins in chloroplast extract. We then used the same method to identify RNAs associated with the maize (Zea mays) PPR protein CRP1. Two mRNAs whose translation is CRP1-dependent were strongly and specifically enriched in CRP1 coimmunoprecipitations. These interactions establish CRP1 as a translational regulator by showing that the translation defects in crp1 mutants are a direct consequence of the absence of CRP1. Additional experiments localized these interactions to the 5' untranslated regions and suggested a possible CRP1 interaction motif. These results enhance understanding of the PPR protein family by showing that a PPR protein influences gene expression through association with specific mRNAs in vivo, suggesting an unusual mode of RNA binding for PPR proteins, and highlighting the possibility that translational regulation may be a particularly common function of PPR proteins. Analogous methods should have broad application for the study of native RNA-protein interactions in both mitochondria and chloroplasts.
