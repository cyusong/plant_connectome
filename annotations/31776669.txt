MAIN CONCLUSION: miRNA targets from Citrus sinensis are predicted and validated using degradome data. They show an up-regulation upon infection with CPsV, with a positive correlation between target expression and symptom severity. Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) may suffer from disease symptoms induced by virus infections, thus resulting in drastic economic losses. Infection of sweet orange plants with two isolates of citrus psorosis virus (CPsV), expressing different symptomatologies, alters the accumulation of a set of endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we predicted ten putative targets from four down-regulated miRNAs: three belonging to the CCAAT-binding transcription factor family (CBFAs); an Ethylene-responsive transcription factor (RAP2-7); an Integrase-type DNA-binding superfamily protein (AP2B); Transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1); GRR1-like protein 1-related (GRR1); Argonaute 2-related (AGO2), Argonaute 7 (AGO7), and a long non-coding RNA (ncRNA). We validated six of them through analysis of leaf degradome data. Expressions of the validated targets increase in infected samples compared to healthy tissue, showing a more striking up-regulation those samples with higher symptom severity. This study contributes to the understanding of the miRNA-mediated regulation of important transcripts in Citrus sinensis through target validation and shed light in the manner a virus can alter host regulatory mechanisms leading to symptom expression.
