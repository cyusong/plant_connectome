In plants, submergence from flooding causes hypoxia, which impairs energy production and affects plant growth, productivity, and survival. In Arabidopsis, hypoxia induces nuclear localization of the group VII ethylene-responsive transcription factor RELATED TO AP2.12 (RAP2.12), following its dissociation from the plasma membrane-anchored ACYL-COA BINDING PROTEIN1 (ACBP1) and ACBP2. Here, we show that polyunsaturated linolenoyl-CoA (18:3-CoA) regulates RAP2.12 release from the plasma membrane. Submergence caused a significant increase in 18:3-CoA, but a significant decrease in 18:0-, 18:1-, and 18:2-CoA. Application of 18:3-CoA promoted nuclear accumulation of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions RAP2.12-GFP, HYPOXIA-RESPONSIVE ERF1-GFP, and RAP2.3-GFP, and enhanced transcript levels of hypoxia-responsive genes. Plants with decreased ACBP1 and ACBP2 (acbp1 ACBP2-RNAi, produced by ACBP2 RNA interference in the acbp1 mutant) had reduced tolerance to hypoxia and impaired 18:3-CoA-induced expression of hypoxia-related genes. In knockout mutants and overexpression lines of LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHASE2 (LACS2) and FATTY ACID DESATURASE 3 (FAD3), the acyl-CoA pool size and 18:3-CoA levels were closely related to ERF-VII-mediated signaling and hypoxia tolerance. These findings demonstrate that polyunsaturation of long-chain acyl-CoAs functions as important mechanism in the regulation of plant hypoxia signaling, by modulating ACBP-ERF-VII dynamics.
