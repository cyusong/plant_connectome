Phytomonitoring techniques for irrigation of avocado orchards indicate that plants respond very rapidly to fluctuations in soil water content. Root to leaf abscicic acid transport cannot fully explain the almost immediate response of stomata to either irrigation and/or sudden changes in climatic conditions. Therefore, we studied the existence of a fast conducting signal between roots and leaves, and the possible involvement of such a signal in the regulation of stomatal behavior. Two-year-old avocado trees were subjected to drying and re-watering cycles or changes in incident radiation (light or darkness). The difference in extracellular electrical potential between the leaf petiole and the base of stem (DeltaV(L-S)) was continuously recorded. Stomatal conductance (gs) was also recorded for the same leaves that were used for voltage difference measurements. A sudden change in soil water content induced by root drying and re-watering was accompanied by a slow, significant change in the recorded DeltaV(L-S) signal, which was fully developed at 52 and 32min for root drying and re-watering, respectively. We found an inverse correlation (r=-0.56) between the change of DeltaV(L-S) and the gs difference measured before and after each soil-drying treatment. Plants that were girdled to disrupt the phloem and then irrigated tended to have lower DeltaV(L-S) differences over time than non-girdled irrigated plants, suggesting that the electrical signal was transmitted in the phloem. The existence of a fast signal transmitted from the root to the leaf that can be measured and correlated with stomatal control opens the possibility of developing a new phytomonitoring technique and/or artificially modifying plant responses by imposing agronomic management strategies aimed at rapid stomatal adaptation to changes in soil water content.
