Arabidopsis CBF genes (CBF1-CBF3) encode transcription factors having a major role in cold acclimation, the adaptive process whereby certain plants increase their freezing tolerance in response to low non-freezing temperatures. Under these conditions, the CBF genes are induced and their corresponding proteins stimulate the expression of target genes configuring low-temperature transcriptome and conditioning Arabidopsis freezing tolerance. CBF2 seems to be the most determinant of the CBFs since it also regulates CBF1 and CBF3 expression. Despite the relevance of CBF genes in cold acclimation, little is known about the molecular components that control their expression. To uncover factors acting upstream of CBF2, mutagenized Arabidopsis containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the CBF2 promoter were screened for plants with de-regulated CBF2 expression. Here, the identification and characterization of five of these mutants, named acex (altered CBF2 expression), is presented. Three mutants show increased levels of cold-induced CBF2 transcripts compared with wild-type plants, the other two exhibiting reduced levels. Some mutants are also affected in cold induction of CBF1 and CBF3. Furthermore, the mutants characterized display unique phenotypes for tolerance to abiotic stresses, including freezing, dehydration, and high salt. These results demonstrate that cold induction of CBF2 is subjected to both positive and negative regulation through different signal transduction pathways, some of them also mediating the expression of other CBF genes as well as Arabidopsis responses to abiotic stresses.
