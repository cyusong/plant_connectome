Plants experiencing abiotic stress react by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), compounds that, if allowed to accumulate to excess, repress plant growth and development. Anthocyanins induced by abiotic stress are strong antioxidants that neutralize ROS, whereas their over-accumulation retards plant growth. Although the mechanism of anthocyanin synthesis has been revealed, how plants balance anthocyanin synthesis under abiotic stress to maintain ROS homeostasis is unknown. Here, ROS-related proteins, SIMILAR TO RCD-ONEs (SROs), were analysed in Zea mays (maize), and all six SRO1 genes were inducible by a variety of abiotic stress agents. The constitutive expression of one of these genes, ZmSRO1e, in maize as well as in Arabidopsis thaliana increased the sensitivity of the plant to abiotic stress, but repressed anthocyanin biosynthesis and ROS scavenging activity. Loss-of-function mutation of ZmSRO1e enhanced ROS tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation. We showed that ZmSRO1e competed with ZmR1 (a core basic helix-loop-helix subunit of the MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcriptional activation complex) for binding with ZmPL1 (a core MYB subunit of the complex). Thus, during the constitutive expression of ZmSRO1e, the formation of the complex was compromised, leading to the repression of genes, such as ZmA4 (encoding dihydroflavonol reductase), associated with anthocyanin synthesis. Overall, the results have revealed a mechanism that allows the products of maize SRO1e to participate in the abiotic stress response.
