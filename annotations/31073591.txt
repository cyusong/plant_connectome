Although exogenous applications of gibberellins (GAs) delay tomato ripening, the regulatory mechanisms of GAs in the process have never been well recognized. Here, we report that the concentration of endogenous GAs is declined before the increase of ethylene production in mature-green to breaker stage fruits. We further demonstrate that reductions in GA levels via overexpression of a GA catabolism gene SlGA2ox1 specifically in fruit tissues lead to early ripening. Consistently, we have also observed that application of a GA biosynthetic inhibitor, prohexadione-calcium, at the mature-green stage accelerates fruit ripening, while exogenous GA3 application delays the process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ethylene biosynthetic gene expressions and ethylene production are activated prematurely in GA-deficient fruits but delayed/reduced in exogenous GA3-treated WT fruits. We also show that the GA deficiency-mediated activation of ethylene biosynthesis is due to the activation of the ripening regulator genes RIN, NOR and CNR. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that GAs play a negative role in tomato fruit ripening.
