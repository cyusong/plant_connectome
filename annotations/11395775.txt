['11395775', 'Leaves and floral organs are polarized along their adaxial-abaxial  (dorsal-ventral) axis. In Arabidopsis, this difference is particularly obvious in  the first two rosette leaves, which possess trichomes (leaf hairs) on their  adaxial surface but not their abaxial surface. Mutant alleles of KANADI (KAN)  were identified in a screen for mutants that produce abaxial trichomes on these  first two leaves. kan mutations were originally identified as enhancers of the  mutant floral phenotype of crabs claw (crc), a gene that specifies abaxial  identity in carpels. Here we show that KAN is required for abaxial identity in  both leaves and carpels, and encodes a nuclear-localized protein in the GARP  family of putative transcription factors. The expression pattern of KAN messenger  RNA and the effect of ectopically expressing KAN under the regulation of the  cauliflower mosaic virus (CAMV) 35S promoter indicate that KAN may also specify  peripheral identity in the developing embryo.', '2001 Jun 7', 'Nature', '10.1038/35079629', 'Poethig']
