['16434475', 'Armadillo/beta-catenin and related proteins have important functions during  animal and Dictyostelium development, regulating cell differentiation,  proliferation, and adhesion. Armadillo-repeat-containing proteins also exist in  plants, but the majority have unknown roles. The Arabidopsis genes that show  greatest sequence homology to Armadillo/beta-catenin are called ARABIDILLO-1 and  -2. Here, we demonstrate that ARABIDILLO-1 and -2 promote lateral root  development. arabidillo-1/-2 mutants form fewer lateral roots, and  ARABIDILLO-1-overexpressing lines produce more lateral roots than wild-type  seedlings. ARABIDILLO-yellow fluorescent protein fusions are nuclear. ARABIDILLO  proteins contain an F-box motif, and thus may target other proteins for  proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of ARABIDILLO-1 protein fragments,  including F-box fragments, in wild-type seedlings reduces lateral root formation  to the level of the arabidillo-1/-2 mutant. We have shown that plant  beta-catenin-related proteins regulate root development. We suggest that  ARABIDILLO proteins may target an inhibitor of lateral root development for  degradation and propose that Arabidopsis beta-catenin-related proteins define a  previously uncharacterized pathway that promotes root branching.', '2006 Jan 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0507575103', 'Haseloff']
