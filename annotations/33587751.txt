Plants are a primary food source and can form the basis for renewable energy resources. The final size of their organs is by far the most important trait to consider when seeking increased plant productivity. Being multicellular organisms, plant organ size is mainly determined by the coordination between cell proliferation and cell expansion. The protease DA1 limits the duration of cell proliferation and thereby restricts final organ size. Since its initial identification as a negative regulator of organ growth, various transcriptional regulators of DA1, but also interacting proteins, have been identified. These interactors include cleavage substrates of DA1, and also proteins that modulate the activity of DA1 through post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and phosphorylation. In addition, many players in the DA1 pathway display conserved phenotypes in other dicot and even monocot species. In this review, we provide a timely overview of the complex, but intriguing, molecular mechanisms that fine-tune the activity of DA1 and therefore final organ size. Moreover, we lay out a roadmap to identify and characterize substrates of proteases and frame the substrate cleavage events in their biological context.
