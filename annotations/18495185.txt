['18495185', 'alpha1,2-linked fucose can be found on xyloglucans which are the main  hemicellulose compounds of dicotyledons. The fucosylated nonasaccharide XXFG  derived from xyloglucans plays a role in cell signaling and is active at  nanomolar concentrations. The plant enzyme acting on this alpha1,2-linked fucose  residues has been previously called fucosidase II; here we report on the  molecular identification of a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana (At4g34260 hereby  designed AtFuc95A) encoding this enzyme. Analysis of the predicted protein  composed of 843 amino acids shows that the enzyme belongs to the glycoside  hydrolase family 95 and has homologous sequences in different monocotyledons and  dicotyledons. The enzyme was expressed recombinantly in Nicotiana bentamiana, a  band was visible by Coomassie blue staining and its identity with the  alpha1,2-fucosidase was assessed by an antibody raised against a peptide from  this enzyme as well as by peptide-mass mapping. The recombinant AtFuc95A is  active towards 2-fucosyllactose with a Km of 0.65 mM, a specific activity of 110  mU/mg and a pH optimum of 5 but does not cleave alpha1,3, alpha1,4 or  alpha1,6-fucose containing oligosaccharides and p-nitrophenyl-fucose. The  recombinant enzyme is able to convert the xyloglucan fragment XXFG to XXLG, and  is also active against xyloglucan polymers with a Km value for fucose residues of  1.5mM and a specific activity of 36 mU/mg. It is proposed that the AtFuc95A gene  has a role in xyloglucan metabolism.', '2008 Jul', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.03.024', 'Altmann']
