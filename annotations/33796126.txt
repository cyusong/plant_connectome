The ubiquitin system is essential for multiple hormone signaling pathways in plants. Here, we show that the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> E3 ligase BRIZ, a heteromeric ligase that consists minimally of BRIZ1 and BRIZ2 proteins, functions in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling or response. <i>briz1</i> and <i>briz2</i> homozygous mutants either fail to germinate or emerge later than wild-type seedlings, with little cotyledon expansion or root elongation and no visible greening. Viability staining indicates that <i>briz1</i> and <i>briz2</i> embryos are alive but growth-arrested. Germination of <i>briz</i> mutants is improved by addition of the carotenoid biosynthetic inhibitor fluridone or gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>), and <i>briz</i> mutants have improved development in backgrounds deficient in ABA synthesis (<i>gin1-3/aba2</i>) or signaling (<i>abi5-7</i>). Endogenous ABA is not higher in <i>briz2</i> seeds compared to wild-type seeds, and exogenous ABA does not affect <i>BRIZ</i> mRNAs in imbibed seeds. These results indicate that <i>briz</i> embryos are hypersensitive to ABA and that under normal growth conditions, BRIZ acts to suppress ABA signaling or response. ABA signaling and sugar signaling are linked, and we found that <i>briz1</i> and <i>briz2</i> mutants excised from seed coats are hypersensitive to sucrose. Although <i>briz</i> single mutants do not grow to maturity, we were able to generate mature <i>briz2-3 abi5-7</i> double mutant plants that produced seeds. These seeds are more sensitive to exogenous sugar and are larger than seeds from sibling <i>abi5-7 BRIZ2/briz2-3</i> plants, suggesting that BRIZ has a parental effect on seed development. From these data, we propose a model in which the BRIZ E3 ligase suppresses ABA responses during seed maturation and germination and early seedling establishment.
