As apple fruits (Malus domestica) mature, they accumulate anthocyanins concomitantly with losing chlorophyll (Chl); however, the molecular pathways and events that coordinate Chl degradation and fruit coloration have not been elucidated. We showed previously that the transcription factor ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR17 (MdERF17) modulates Chl degradation in apple fruit peels and that variation in the pattern of MdERF17 serine (Ser) residues is responsible for differences in its transcriptional regulatory activity. Here, we report that MdERF17 interacts with and is phosphorylated by MAP KINASE4 (MdMPK4-14G). Phosphorylation of MdERF17 at residue Thr67 by MdMPK4-14G is necessary for its transcriptional regulatory activity and its regulation of Chl degradation. We also show that MdERF17 mutants with different numbers of Ser repeat insertions exhibit altered phosphorylation profiles, with more repeats increasing its interaction with MdMPK4. MdMPK4-14G can be activated by exposure to darkness and is involved in the dark-induced degreening of fruit peels. We also demonstrate that greater phosphorylation of MdERF17 by MdMPK4-14G is responsible for the regulation of Chl degradation during light/dark transitions. Overall, our findings reveal the mechanism by which MdMPK4 controls fruit peel coloration.
