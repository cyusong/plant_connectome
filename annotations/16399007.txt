Effects of foliar application of 100 mmol/L glycinebetaine (GB) on PS II photochemistry in wheat (Triticum aestivum) flag leaves under drought stress combined with high irradiance were investigated. The results show that GB-treated plants maintained a higher net photosynthetic rate during drought stress than non-GB treated plants. Exogenous GB can preserve the photochemical activity of PSII, for GB-treated plants maintain higher maximal photochemistry efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)) and recover more rapidly from photoinhibition. In addition, GB-treated plants can maintain higher anti-oxidative enzyme activities and suffer less oxidative stress. Our data suggest that GB may protect the PSII complex from damage through accelerating D1 protein turnover and maintaining anti-oxidative enzyme activities at higher level to alleviate photodamage. Diethyldithiocarbamate as well as streptomycin treatment can impair the protective effect of GB on PSII. In summary, GB can enhance the photoinhibition tolerance of PSII.

GB: !accelerates! D1 protein turnover
GB: !maintains! Anti-oxidative enzyme activities
Diethylthiocarbamate: !impairs! Protective effect of GB on PSII
Streptomycin: !impairs! Protective effect of GB on PSII
