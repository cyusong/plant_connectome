Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), a member of the genus Potyvirus, infects maize and is non-persistently transmitted by aphids. Several plant viruses have been developed as tools for gene expression and gene silencing in plants. The capacity of MDMV for both gene expression and gene silencing were examined. Infectious clones of an Ohio isolate of MDMV, MDMV OH5, were obtained, and engineered for gene expression only, and for simultaneous marker gene expression and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of three endogenous maize target genes. Single gene expression in single insertion constructs and simultaneous expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and silencing of three maize genes in a double insertion construct was demonstrated. Constructs with GFP inserted in the N-terminus of HCPro were more stable than those with insertion at the N-terminus of CP in our study. Unexpectedly, the construct with two insertion sites also retained insertions at a higher rate than single-insertion constructs. Engineered MDMV expression and VIGS constructs were transmissible by aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). These results demonstrate that MDMV-based vector can be used as a tool for simultaneous gene expression and multi-gene silencing in maize.
