Rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) is a peptide signal that plays a role in plant cell expansion. We have recently proposed that AtRALF1 negatively regulates root cell elongation and lateral root formation by opposing the effects of brassinosteroid (BR). We reported 6 AtRALF1-inducible cell wall-related genes and 2 P450 monooxygenase -encoding genes involved in the BR biosynthetic pathway. The AtRALF1-inducible genes implicated in cell wall remodeling were not downregulated by brassinolide (BL) treatment alone; their induction was only compromised following simultaneous treatment with AtRALF1 and BL. We further examined the cell wall-remodeling gene EXPANSIN A5 (AtEXPA5), which is upregulated by BL and has been shown to positively affect root cell elongation. Herein, we report that AtEXPA5 expression is downregulated by AtRALF1 in a dose-dependent manner in the roots and hypocotyls of Arabidopsis plants. AtEXPA5 is also downregulated in plants that overexpress AtRALF1, and it is upregulated in plants in which the AtRALF1 gene is partially silenced. The AtRALF1 peptide is also able to repress AtEXPA5 induction following a pre-treatment with BL. A schematic diagram showing the gene regulatory network connecting the recently reported genes with the regulation of cell expansion by AtEXPA5 is presented.

AtRALF1: !negatively regulates! root cell elongation 
AtRALF1: !downregulates! AtEXPA5 
AtEXPA5: !positively affects! root cell elongation 
AtRALF1: !represses! AtEXPA5 induction
