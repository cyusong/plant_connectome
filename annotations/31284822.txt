Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles in plant development and adaptive responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Recently, a rice MAPK gene, <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, has been reported to protect rice plants against autotoxicity by suppressing herbivore-induced ethylene and nitric oxide signaling. In this context, we observed that silencing <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> increased the percentage of leaf roll caused by leaf folder <i>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis</i> and the severity of rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> but decreased the severity of sheath blight caused by <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>. These findings show that silencing <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> has different effects on rice pests in the field, and these differences have important implications for the evolution and exploitation of resistance strategies in plants.
