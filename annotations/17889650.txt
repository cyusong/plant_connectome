A key feature of plants (as opposed to animals) is their ability to establish new organs not only during embryogenesis, but also throughout their development. A master regulator of organ initiation in plants is the phytohormone auxin. Auxin acts locally as a morphogen and is directionally transported from cell to cell by polarized auxin efflux carriers, termed PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins. Here we report that the Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast and mammalian vacuolar protein sorting 29 (VPS29), a member of the retromer complex, mediates the formation of new axes of development. Furthermore, we show that VPS29 is required for endosome homeostasis, PIN protein cycling, and dynamic PIN1 repolarization during development. We propose a model that links VPS29 function, PIN1 polarity, and organ initiation in plants.

auxin: !directs! PIN proteins
VPS29: !mediates! organ initiation
VPS29: !regulates! endosome homeostasis
VPS29: !controls! PIN protein cycling
VPS29: !influences! PIN1 repolarization
