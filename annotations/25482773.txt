Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important regulator of guard cell ion channels and stomatal movements in response to drought stress. Pyruvate is the final product of glycolysis in the cytosol, and could be transported by mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs) into mitochondrion for consequent cellular substance and energy metabolism. We recently characterized the first putative mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, NRGA1, in planta, and found that this small protein is involved in the negative regulation of drought and ABA induced guard cell signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. The findings revealed a probable link between mitochondrial pyruvate transport and guard cell signaling. It has also been shown that NRGA1 protein product was directed to the mitochondria, and co-expression of MPC1 and NRGA1 functionally complement the absence of a native pyruvate transport protein in yeast. Here, we further demonstrated that MPC1 showed similar sub-cellular localization pattern to NRGA1. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the transcription of both NRGA1 and MPC1 were induced by pyruvate or ABA, and pyruvate strengthened the ABA induced transcription of these 2 genes. The similarity in subcellular localization and gene expression to ABA strongly suggests that MPC1 may associate with NRGA1 for mitochondrial pyruvate transport and is involved in ABA mediated stomatal movements in Arabidopsis.
