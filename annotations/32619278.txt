Recognition of plant pathogens or herbivores activate a broad-spectrum plant defense priming in distal leaves against potential future attacks, leading to systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Additionally, attacked plants can release aerial or below-ground signals that trigger defense responses, such as SAR, in neighboring plants lacking initial exposure to pathogen or pest elicitors. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in interplant defense signal generation in sender plants and decoding in neighboring plants are not fully understood. We previously reported that Pieris brassicae eggs induce intraplant SAR against the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we extend this effect to neighboring plants by discovering an egg-induced interplant SAR via mobile root-derived signal(s). The generation of an egg-induced interplant SAR signal requires pipecolic acid (Pip) pathway genes ALD1 and FMO1 but occurs independently of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in sender plants. Furthermore, reception of the signal leads to accumulation of SA in the recipient plants. In response to insect eggs, plants may induce interplant SAR to prepare for potential pathogen invasion following feeding-induced wounding or to keep neighboring plants healthy for hatching larvae. Our results highlight a previously uncharacterized below-ground plant-to-plant signaling mechanism and reveals genetic components required for its generation.
