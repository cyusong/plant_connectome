Apple exhibits S-RNase-based self-incompatibility (SI), in which S-RNase plays a central role in rejecting self-pollen. It has been proposed that the arrest of pollen growth in SI of Solanaceae plants is a consequence of the degradation of pollen rRNA by S-RNase; however, the underlying mechanism in Rosaceae is still unclear. Here, we used S<sub>2</sub> -RNase as a bait to screen an apple pollen cDNA library and characterized an apple soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase (MdPPa) that physically interacted with S-RNases. When treated with self S-RNases, apple pollen tubes showed a marked growth inhibition, as well as a decrease in endogenous soluble pyrophosphatase activity and elevated levels of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). In addition, S-RNase was found to bind to two variable regions of MdPPa, resulting in a noncompetitive inhibition of its activity. Silencing of MdPPa expression led to a reduction in pollen tube growth. Interestingly, tRNA aminoacylation was inhibited in self S-RNase-treated or MdPPa-silenced pollen tubes, resulting in the accumulation of uncharged tRNA. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that this disturbance of tRNA aminoacylation is independent of RNase activity. We propose an alternative mechanism differing from RNA degradation to explain the cytotoxicity of the S-RNase apple SI process.
