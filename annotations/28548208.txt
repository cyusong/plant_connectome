Absorbed light energy is converted into excitation energy. The excitation energy is distributed to photosystems depending on the wavelength and drives photochemical reactions. A non-destructive, mechanistic and quantitative method for estimating the fraction of the excitation energy distributed to photosystem II (f) was developed. For the f values for two simultaneously provided actinic lights (ALs) with different spectral distributions to be estimated, photochemical yields of the photosystems were measured under the ALs and were then fitted to an electron transport model assuming the balance between the electron transport rates through the photosystems. For the method to be tested using leaves with different properties in terms of the long-term and short-term acclimation (adjustment of photosystem stoichiometry and state transition, respectively), the f values for red and far-red light (R and FR) were estimated in leaves grown (~1 week) under white light without and with supplemental FR and adapted (~10 min) to R without and with supplemental FR. The f values for R were clearly greater than those for FR and those of leaves grown with and adapted to supplemental FR tended to be higher than the controls. These results are consistent with previous studies and therefore support the validity of the proposed method.
