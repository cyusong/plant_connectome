Wounding stress leads to anthocyanin accumulation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, MdWRKY40 was found to promote wounding-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in association with MdMYB1 and undergo MdBT2-mediated degradation in apple. We found that MdMYB1, a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis, was essential for the wounding-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple. MdWRKY40 was identified as an MdMYB1-interacting protein, and enhanced the binding of MdMYB1 to its target genes in response to wounding. We found that MdBT2 interacted physically with MdWRKY40 and was involved in its degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Our results demonstrate that MdWRKY40 is a key modulator in the wounding-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, which provides new insights into the regulation of wounding-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels in apple.
