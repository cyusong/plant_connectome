Circadian regulations are essential for enabling organisms to synchronize physiology with environmental light-dark cycles. Post-transcriptional RNA modifications still represent an understudied level of gene expression regulation in plants, although they could play crucial roles in environmental adaptation. N<sup>6</sup>-methyl-adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent mRNA modification, established by "writer" and "eraser" proteins. It influences the clockwork in several taxa, but only few studies have been conducted in plants and none in marine plants. Here, we provided a first inventory of m<sup>6</sup>A-related genes in seagrasses and investigated daily changes in the global RNA methylation and transcript levels of writers and erasers in <i>Cymodocea nodosa</i> and <i>Zostera marina</i>. Both species showed methylation peaks during the dark period under the same photoperiod, despite exhibiting asynchronous changes in the m<sup>6</sup>A profile and related gene expression during a 24-h cycle. At contrasting latitudes, <i>Z. marina</i> populations displayed overlapping daily patterns of the m<sup>6</sup>A level and related gene expression. The observed rhythms are characteristic for each species and similar in populations of the same species with different photoperiods, suggesting the existence of an endogenous circadian control. Globally, our results indicate that m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation could widely contribute to circadian regulation in seagrasses, potentially affecting the photo-biological behaviour of these plants.
