['18267087', 'Jasmonic acid (JA) plays pivotal roles in diverse plant biological processes,  including wound response. Chloroplast lipid hydrolysis is a critical step for JA  biosynthesis, but the mechanism of this process remains elusive. We report here  that DONGLE (DGL), a homolog of DEFECTIVE IN ANTHER DEHISCENCE1 (DAD1), encodes a  chloroplast-targeted lipase with strong galactolipase and weak phospholipase A(1)  activity. DGL is expressed in the leaves and has a specific role in maintaining  basal JA content under normal conditions, and this expression regulates  vegetative growth and is required for a rapid JA burst after wounding. During  wounding, DGL and DAD1 have partially redundant functions for JA production, but  they show different induction kinetics, indicating temporally separated roles:  DGL plays a role in the early phase of JA production, and DAD1 plays a role in  the late phase of JA production. Whereas DGL and DAD1 are necessary and  sufficient for JA production, phospholipase D appears to modulate wound response  by stimulating DGL and DAD1 expression.', '2008 Feb', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2007.11.010', 'Lee']
