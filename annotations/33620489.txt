When a dark-germinated seedling reaches the soil surface and perceives sunlight for the first time, light signaling is activated to adapt the plant's development and transition to autotrophism. During this process, functional chloroplasts assemble in the cotyledons and the seedling's cell expansion pattern is rearranged to enhance light perception. Hypocotyl cells expand rapidly in the dark, while cotyledon cell expansion is suppressed. However, light reverses this pattern by activating cell expansion in cotyledons and repressing it in hypocotyls. The fact that light-regulated developmental responses, as well as the transcriptional mechanisms controlling them, are organ-specific has been largely overlooked in previous studies of seedling de-etiolation. To analyze the expansion pattern of the hypocotyl and cotyledons separately in a given Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedling, we define an organ ratio, the morphogenic index (MI), which integrates either phenotypic or transcriptomic data for each tissue and provides an important resource for functional analyses. Moreover, based on this index, we identified organ-specific molecular markers to independently quantify cotyledon and hypocotyl growth dynamics in whole-seedling samples. The combination of these marker genes with those of other developmental processes occurring during de-etiolation will allow improved molecular dissection of photomorphogenesis. Along with organ growth markers, this MI contributes a key toolset to unveil and accurately characterize the molecular mechanisms controlling seedling growth.
