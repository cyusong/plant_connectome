Hexokinases (HXKs, EC 2.7.1.1) and fructokinases (FRKs, EC 2.7.1.4) play important roles in carbohydrate metabolism and sugar signaling during the growth and development of plants. However, the HXKs and FRKs in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) remain largely unknown. In this manuscript, we present the molecular characterization, phylogenetic relationships, conserved domains and expression profiles of four HXK and seven FRK genes of the tea plant. The 11 deduced CsHXK and CsFRK proteins were grouped into six main classes. All of the deduced proteins, except for CsFKR7, possessed putative ATP-binding motifs and a sugar recognition region. These genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns, which suggests that they play different roles in the metabolism and development of source and sink tissues in the tea plant. There were variations in CsHXKs and CsFRKs transcript abundance in response to four abiotic stresses: cold, salt, drought and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Remarkably, CsHXK3 and CsHXK4 were significantly induced in the leaves and roots under cold conditions, CsHXK1 was apparently up-regulated in the leaves and roots under salt and drought stresses, and CsHXK3 was obviously stimulated in the leaves and roots under short-term treatment with exogenous ABA. These findings demonstrate that CsHXKs play critical roles in response to abiotic stresses in the tea plant. Our research provides a fundamental understanding of the CsHXK and CsFRK genes of the tea plant and important information for the breeding of stress-tolerant tea cultivars.
