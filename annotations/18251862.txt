New metabolic profiling technologies provide data on a wider range of metabolites than traditional targeted approaches. Metabolomic technologies currently facilitate acquisition of multivariate metabolic data using diverse, mostly hyphenated, chromatographic detection systems, such as GC-MS or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy or NMR-based methods. Analysis of the resulting data can be performed through a combination of non-supervised and supervised statistical methods, such as independent component analysis and analysis of variance, respectively. These methods reduce the complex data sets to information, which is relevant for the discovery of metabolic markers or for hypothesis-driven, pathway-based analysis. Plant responses to salinity involve changes in the activity of genes and proteins, which invariably lead to changes in plant metabolism. Here, we highlight a selection of recent publications in the salt stress field, and use gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles of polar fractions from the plant models, Arabidopsis thaliana, Lotus japonicus and Oryza sativa to demonstrate the power of metabolite profiling. We present evidence for conserved and divergent metabolic responses among these three species and conclude that a change in the balance between amino acids and organic acids may be a conserved metabolic response of plants to salt stress.
