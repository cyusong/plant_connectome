The phytohormone auxin is essential for plant development and contributes to nearly every aspect of the plant life cycle. The spatio-temporal distribution of auxin depends on a complex interplay between auxin metabolism and cell-to-cell auxin transport. Auxin metabolism and transport are both crucial for plant development; however, it largely remains to be seen how these processes are integrated to ensure defined cellular auxin levels or even gradients within tissues or organs. In this review, we provide a glance at very diverse topics of auxin biology, such as biosynthesis, conjugation, oxidation, and transport of auxin. This broad, but certainly superficial, overview highlights the mutual importance of auxin metabolism and transport. Moreover, it allows pinpointing how auxin metabolism and transport get integrated to jointly regulate cellular auxin homeostasis. Even though these processes have been so far only separately studied, we assume that the phytohormonal crosstalk integrates and coordinates auxin metabolism and transport. Besides the integrative power of the global hormone signaling, we additionally introduce the hypothetical concept considering auxin transport components as gatekeepers for auxin responses.
