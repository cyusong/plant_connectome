['22238602', 'Secreted papain-like Cys proteases are important players in plant immunity. We  previously reported that the C14 protease of tomato is targeted by cystatin-like  EPIC proteins that are secreted by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans  (Pinf) during infection. C14 has been under diversifying selection in wild potato  species coevolving with Pinf and reduced C14 levels result in enhanced  susceptibility for Pinf. Here, we investigated the role C14-EPIC-like  interactions in the natural pathosystem of Arabidopsis with the oomycete pathogen  Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). In contrast to the Pinf-solanaceae  pathosystem, the C14 orthologous protease of Arabidopsis, RD21, does not evolve  under diversifying selection in Arabidopsis, and rd21 null mutants do not show  phenotypes upon compatible and incompatible Hpa interactions, despite the evident  lack of a major leaf protease. Hpa isolates express highly conserved EPIC-like  proteins during infections, but it is unknown if these HpaEPICs can inhibit RD21  and one of these HpaEPICs even lacks the canonical cystatin motifs. The rd21  mutants are unaffected in compatible and incompatible interactions with  Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, but are significantly more susceptible for the  necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, demonstrating that RD21 provides  immunity to a necrotrophic pathogen.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0029317', 'van']
