Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms. However, excess Mn supply that can occur in acid or waterlogged soils has toxic effects on plant physiology and development. Although a variety of Mn transporter families have been characterized, we have only a rudimentary understanding of how these transporters are regulated to uphold and adjust Mn homeostasis in plants. Here, we demonstrate that two calcineurin-B-like proteins, CBL2/3, and their interacting kinases, CIPK3/9/26, are key regulators of plant Mn homeostasis. Arabidopsis mutants lacking CBL2 and 3 or their interacting protein kinases CIPK3/9/26 exhibit remarkably high Mn tolerance. Intriguingly, CIPK3/9/26 interact with and phosphorylate the tonoplast-localized Mn and iron (Fe) transporter MTP8 primarily at Ser35, which is conserved among MTP8 proteins from various species. Mn transport complementation assays in yeast combined with multiple physiological assays indicate that CBL-CIPK-mediated phosphorylation of MTP8 negatively regulates its transport activity from the cytoplasm to the vacuole. Moreover, we show that sequential phosphorylation of MTP8, initially at Ser31/32 by the calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK5 and subsequently at Ser35 by CIPK26, provides an activation/deactivation fine-tuning mechanism for differential regulation of Mn transport. Collectively, our findings define a two-tiered calcium-controlled mechanism for dynamic regulation of Mn homeostasis under conditions of fluctuating Mn supply.
