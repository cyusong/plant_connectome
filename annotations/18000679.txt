The cuticular waxes on the leaves of Prunus laurocerasus are arranged in distinct layers differing in triterpenoid concentrations (Jetter et al., Plant Cell Environ 23:619-628, 2000). In addition to this transversal gradient, the lateral distribution of cuticular triterpenoids must be investigated to fully describe the spatial distribution of wax components on the leaf surfaces. In the present investigation, near infrared (NIR) Raman microspectroscopy, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, and third harmonic generation (THG) spectroscopy were employed to map the triterpenoid distribution in isolated cuticles from adaxial and abaxial sides of P. laurocerasus leaves. The relative concentrations of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were calculated by treating the cuticle spectra as linear combinations of reference spectra from the major compounds found in the wax. Raman maps of the adaxial cuticle showed that the triterpenoids accumulate to relatively high concentrations over the periclinal regions of the pavement cells, while the very long chain aliphatic wax constituents are distributed fairly evenly across the entire adaxial cuticle. In the analysis of the abaxial cuticles, the triterpenoids were found to accumulate in greater amounts over the guard cells relative to the pavement cells. The very long chain aliphatic compounds accumulated in the cuticle above the anticlinal cell walls of the pavement cells, and were found at low concentrations above the periclinals and the guard cells.
