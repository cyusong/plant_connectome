RNAi-induced gene silencing plays a role in plant DNA methylation and defense. While most gene silencing studies have been performed on annuals, little is known about the expression of key components of this process (like ARGONAUTE proteins) in ornamentals. Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction techniques, an ARGONAUTE4 gene, PhAGO4, was isolated from Pelargonium. PhAGO4 encodes a predicted product of 934 amino acids that contains the PAZ and PIWI domains typical of ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PhAGO4 clusters with other plant AGO4 proteins. Organ expression patterns of the AGO4 genes in Pelargonium and Arabidopsis show intriguing differences. AGO4 RNA levels decline with leaf age in both Arabidopsis and Pelargonium. In contrast AGO4 RNA levels in roots relative to leaves are higher in Pelargonium than in Arabidopsis. Both Arabidopsis and Pelargonium AGO4 showed higher RNA levels in flowers than leaves or roots. Even though flowers show higher levels of PhAGO4 RNA when compared to leaves and roots, protein gel blot analysis shows that at the protein level, the reverse is true. This suggests that PhAGO4 expression may be regulated at the translational or post-translational level in Pelargonium flowers.
