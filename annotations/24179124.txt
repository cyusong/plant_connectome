Translational control plays a vital role in regulating gene expression. To decipher the molecular basis of translational regulation in photomorphogenic Arabidopsis thaliana, we adopted a ribosome profiling method to map the genome-wide positions of translating ribosomes in Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings in the dark and after light exposure. We found that, in Arabidopsis, a translating ribosome protects an ~30-nucleotide region and moves in three-nucleotide periodicity, characteristics also observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammals. Light enhanced the translation of genes involved in the organization and function of chloroplasts. Upstream open reading frames initiated by ATG but not CTG mediated translational repression of the downstream main open reading frame. Also, we observed widespread translational repression of microRNA target genes in both light- and dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. This genome-wide characterization of transcripts undergoing translation at the nucleotide-resolution level reveals that a combination of multiple translational mechanisms orchestrates and fine-tunes the translation of diverse transcripts in plants with environmental responsiveness.

Light: !enhances! Translation of genes 
Upstream ORF: !represses! Downstream ORF
microRNA target genes: !repressed! in light and dark-grown seedlings
Ribosome: !protects! ~30-nucleotide region
Ribosome: !moves in! 3-nucleotide periodicity
