Oxidative tailoring of C(40) carotenoids by double bond-specific cleavage enzymes (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, CCDs) gives rise to various apocarotenoids. AtCCD1 generating C(13) and C(14) apocarotenoids and orthologous enzymes in other plants are the only CCDs acting in the cytosol, while the hitherto presumed C(40) substrate is localized in the plastid. A new model for CCD1 action arising from a RNAi-mediated CCD1 gene silencing study in mycorrhizal hairy roots of Medicago truncatula may solve this contradiction. This approach unexpectedly resulted in the accumulation of C(27) apocarotenoids but not C(40) carotenoids suggesting C(27) as the main substrates for CCD1 in planta. It further implies a consecutive two-step cleavage process, in which another CCD performs the primary cleavage of C(40) to C(27) in the plastid followed by C(27) export and further cleavage by CCD1 in the cytosol. We compare the specificities and subcellular locations of the various CCDs and propose the plastidial CCD7 to be the first player in mycorrhizal apocarotenoid biogenesis.

CCD1: !generates! C(13) and C(14) apocarotenoids 
CCD1: !cleaves! C(27) in cytosol 
CCD7: !cleaves! C(40) in plastid 
C(40): !localizes to! plastid 
C(27): !exported from! plastid
