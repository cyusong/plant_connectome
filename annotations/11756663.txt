['11756663', 'Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are strongly associated with plant defense  responses. The origin of these ROI has been controversial. Arabidopsis  respiratory burst oxidase homologues (rboh genes) have been proposed to play a  role in ROI generation. We analyzed lines carrying dSpm insertions in the highly  expressed AtrbohD and AtrbohF genes. Both are required for full ROI production  observed during incompatible interactions with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas  syringae pv. tomato DC3000(avrRpm1) and the oomycete parasite Peronospora  parasitica. We also observed reduced cell death, visualized by trypan blue stain  and reduced electrolyte leakage, in the Atrboh mutants after DC3000(avrRpm1)  inoculation. However, enhanced cell death is observed after infection of mutant  lines with P. parasitica. Paradoxically, although atrbohD mutation eliminated the  majority of total ROI production, atrbohF mutation exhibited the strongest effect  on cell death.', '2002 Jan 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.012452499', 'Jones']
