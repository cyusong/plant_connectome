<i>Jatropha curcas</i> L. is monoecious with a low female-to-male ratio, which is one of the factors restricting its seed yield. Because the phytohormone cytokinins play an essential role in flower development, particularly pistil development, in this study, we elevated the cytokinin levels in <i>J. curcas</i> flowers through transgenic expression of a cytokinin biosynthetic gene (<i>AtIPT4</i>) from Arabidopsis under the control of a <i>J. curcas</i> orthologue of <i>TOMATO MADS BOX GENE 6</i> (<i>JcTM6</i>) promoter that is predominantly active in flowers. As expected, the levels of six cytokinin species in the inflorescences were elevated, and flower development was modified without any alterations in vegetative growth. In the transgenic <i>J. curcas</i> plants, the flower number per inflorescence was significantly increased, and most flowers were pistil-predominantly bisexual, i.e., the flowers had a huge pistil surrounded with small stamens. Unfortunately, both the male and the bisexual flowers of transgenic <i>J. curcas</i> were infertile, which might have resulted from the continuously high expression of the transgene during flower development. However, the number and position of floral organs in the transgenic flowers were well defined, which suggested that the determinacy of the floral meristem was not affected. These results suggest that fine-tuning the endogenous cytokinins can increase the flower number and the female-to-male ratio in <i>J. curcas</i>.
