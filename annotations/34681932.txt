Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins form a large protein family in land plants, with hundreds of different members in angiosperms. In the last decade, a number of studies have shown that PPR proteins are sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins involved in multiple aspects of plant organellar RNA processing, and perform numerous functions in plants throughout their life cycle. Recently, computational and structural studies have provided new insights into the working mechanisms of PPR proteins in RNA recognition and cytidine deamination. In this review, we summarized the research progress on the functions of PPR proteins in plant growth and development, with a particular focus on their effects on cytoplasmic male sterility, stress responses, and seed development. We also documented the molecular mechanisms of PPR proteins in mediating RNA processing in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts.
