Comparative analyses of growth-regulatory mechanisms between Arabidopsis and maize revealed that even when the gene space is conserved, the translation of knowledge from model species to crops is not trivial. Based on these insights, we formulate future opportunities to improve the interpretation of curiosity-driven research towards crop improvement.
