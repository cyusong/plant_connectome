['28740502', "Autophagy is a highly conserved system in eukaryotes for the bulk degradation and  recycling of intracellular components. Autophagy is involved in many  physiological processes including development, senescence, and responses to  abiotic and biotic stress. The adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein  kinase AMPK positively regulates autophagy in mammals; however, the potential  function of AMPK in plant autophagy remains largely unknown. Here, we identified  KIN10, a plant ortholog of the mammalian AMPK, as a positive regulator of plant  autophagy and showed that it acts by affecting the phosphorylation of ATG1  (AUTOPHAGY-RELATED GENE 1) proteins in Arabidopsis. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines  overexpressing KIN10 (KIN10-OE) showed delays in leaf senescence, and increased  tolerance to nutrient starvation, these phenotypes required a functional  autophagy pathway. Consistent with KIN10 having a potential role in autophagy,  the nutrient starvation-induced formation of autophagosomes and cleavage of  GFP-ATG8e were accelerated in the KIN10-OE lines compared to the wild type.  Moreover, the KIN10-OE lines were less sensitive to drought and hypoxia  treatments, compared with wild type. Carbon starvation enhanced the level of  phosphorylated YFP-ATG1a in the KIN10-OE lines compared to that of wild type.  Together, these findings suggest that KIN10 is involved in positive regulation of  autophagy, possibly by affecting the phosphorylation of ATG1s in Arabidopsis.", '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.01201', 'Chen']
