['9576796', 'To evaluate the relative importance of ornithine (Orn) as a precursor in proline  (Pro) synthesis, we isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the  Orn-delta-aminotransferase (delta-OAT) from Arabidopsis thaliana. The deduced  amino acid sequence showed high homology with bacterial, yeast, mammalian, and  plant sequences, and the N-terminal residues exhibited several common features  with a mitochondrial transit peptide. Our results show that under both salt  stress and normal conditions, delta-OAT activity and mRNA in young plantlets are  slightly higher than in older plants. This appears to be related to the necessity  to dispose of an easy recycling product, glutamate. Analysis of the expression of  the gene revealed a close association with salt stress and Pro production. In  young plantlets, free Pro content, Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase mRNA,  delta-OAT activity, and delta-OAT mRNA were all increased by salt-stress  treatment. These results suggest that for A. thaliana, the Orn pathway, together  with the glutamate pathway, plays an important role in Pro accumulation during  osmotic stress. Conversely, in 4-week-old A. thaliana plants, although free Pro  level also increased under salt-stress conditions, the delta-OAT activity  appeared to be unchanged and delta-OAT mRNA was not detectable.  Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase mRNA was still induced at a similar  level. Therefore, for the adult plants the free Pro increase seemed to be due to  the activity of the enzymes of the glutamate pathway.', '1998 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.117.1.263', 'Jacobs']
