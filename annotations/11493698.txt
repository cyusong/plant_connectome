['11493698', 'We describe lacerata (lcr) mutants of Arabidopsis, which display various  developmental abnormalities, including postgenital organ fusions, and report  cloning of the LCR gene by using the maize transposon Enhancer/Suppressor-mutator  (En/Spm). The pleiotropic mutant phenotype could be rescued by genetic  complementation of lcr mutants with the wild-type LCR gene. The LCR gene encodes  a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP86A8, which catalyzes omega-hydroxylation of  fatty acids ranging from C12 to C18:1, as demonstrated by expression of the gene  in yeast. Although palmitic and oleic acids were efficient substrates for LCR,  9,10-epoxystearate was not metabolized. Taken together with previous studies, our  findings indicate that LCR-dependent omega-hydroxylation of fatty acids could be  implicated in the biosynthesis of cutin in the epidermis and in preventing  postgenital organ fusions. Strikingly, the same pathway seems to control trichome  differentiation, the establishment of apical dominance, and senescence in plants.', '2001 Aug 14', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.171285998', 'Yephremov']
