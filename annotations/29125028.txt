Coevolution has shaped the molecular basis of an extensive number of defense mechanisms in plant-pathogen interactions. Phytophthora parasitica, a hemibiothrophic oomycete pathogen and the causal agent of citrus root rot and gummosis, interacts differently with Citrus sunki and Poncirus trifoliata, two commonly favored citrus rootstocks that are recognized as susceptible and resistant, respectively, to P. parasitica. The molecular core of these interactions remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence on the defense strategies employed by both susceptible and resistant citrus rootstocks, in parallel with P. parasitica deployment of effectors. Time course expression analysis (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) of several defense-related genes were evaluated during i) plant disease development, ii) necrosis, and iii) pathogen effector gene expression. In C. sunki, P. parasitica deploys effectors, including elicitins, NPP1 (necrosis-inducing Phytophthora protein 1), CBEL (cellulose-binding elicitor and lectin activity), RxLR, and CRN (crinkler), and, consequently, this susceptible plant activates its main defense signaling pathways that result in the hypersensitive response and necrosis. Despite the strong plant-defense response, it fails to withstand P. parasitica invasion, confirming its hemibiothrophic lifestyle. In Poncirus trifoliata, the effectors were strongly expressed, nevertheless failing to induce any immunity manipulation and disease development, suggesting a nonhost resistance type, in which the plant relies on preformed biochemical and anatomical barriers.
