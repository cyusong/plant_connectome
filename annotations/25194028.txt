['25194028', 'In the exalbuminous species Arabidopsis thaliana, seed maturation is accompanied  by the deposition of oil and storage proteins and the reduction of the endosperm  to one cell layer. Here, we consider reserve partitioning between embryo and  endosperm compartments. The pattern of deposition, final amount, and composition  of these reserves differ between the two compartments, with the embryo  representing the principal storage tissue in mature seeds. Complex regulatory  mechanisms are known to prevent activation of maturation-related programs during  embryo morphogenesis and, later, during vegetative growth. Here, we describe a  regulator that represses the expression of maturation-related genes during  maturation within the endosperm. MYB118 is transcriptionally induced in the  maturing endosperm, and seeds of myb118 mutants exhibit an endosperm-specific  derepression of maturation-related genes associated with a partial relocation of  storage compounds from the embryo to the endosperm. Moreover, MYB118 activates  endosperm-induced genes through the recognition of TAACGG elements. These results  demonstrate that the differential partitioning of reserves between the embryo and  endosperm in exalbuminous Arabidopsis seeds does not only result from  developmental programs that establish the embryo as the preponderant tissue  within seeds. This differential partitioning is also regulated by MYB118, which  regulates the biosynthesis of reserves at the spatial level during maturation.', '2014 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.130021', 'Baud']
