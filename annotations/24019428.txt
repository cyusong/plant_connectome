['24019428', "Cytosolic Ca(2+) in guard cells plays an important role in stomatal movement  responses to environmental stimuli. These cytosolic Ca(2+) increases result from  Ca(2+) influx through Ca(2+)-permeable channels in the plasma membrane and Ca(2+)  release from intracellular organelles in guard cells. However, the genes encoding  defined plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channel activity remain unknown in guard  cells and, with some exceptions, largely unknown in higher plant cells. Here, we  report the identification of two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cation  channel genes, CNGC5 and CNGC6, that are highly expressed in guard cells.  Cytosolic application of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and extracellularly applied  membrane-permeable 8-Bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-cGMP both  activated hyperpolarization-induced inward-conducting currents in wild-type guard  cells using Mg(2+) as the main charge carrier. The cGMP-activated currents were  strongly blocked by lanthanum and gadolinium and also conducted Ba(2+), Ca(2+),  and Na(+) ions. cngc5 cngc6 double mutant guard cells exhibited dramatically  impaired cGMP-activated currents. In contrast, mutations in CNGC1, CNGC2, and  CNGC20 did not disrupt these cGMP-activated currents. The yellow fluorescent  protein-CNGC5 and yellow fluorescent protein-CNGC6 proteins localize in the cell  periphery. Cyclic AMP activated modest inward currents in both wild-type and  cngc5cngc6 mutant guard cells. Moreover, cngc5 cngc6 double mutant guard cells  exhibited functional abscisic acid (ABA)-activated hyperpolarization-dependent  Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel currents, intact ABA-induced stomatal closing  responses, and whole-plant stomatal conductance responses to darkness and changes  in CO2 concentration. Furthermore, cGMP-activated currents remained intact in the  growth controlled by abscisic acid2 and abscisic acid insensitive1 mutants. This  research demonstrates that the CNGC5 and CNGC6 genes encode unique cGMP-activated  nonselective Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels in the plasma membrane of  Arabidopsis guard cells.", '2013 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.225045', 'Schroeder']
