Carotenoids are a group of natural tetraterpenoid pigments with indispensable roles in the plant life cycle and the human diet. Although the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway has been well characterized, the regulatory mechanisms that control carotenoid metabolism, especially in floral organs, remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified an anthocyanin-related R2R3-MYB protein, WHITE PETAL1 (WP1), that plays a critical role in regulating floral carotenoid pigmentation in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> Carotenoid analyses showed that the yellow petals of the wild-type <i>M. truncatula</i> contained high concentrations of carotenoids that largely consisted of esterified lutein and that disruption of <i>WP1</i> function via <i>Tnt1</i> insertion led to substantially reduced lutein accumulation. WP1 mainly functions as a transcriptional activator and directly regulates the expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes including <i>MtLYCe</i> and <i>MtLYCb</i> through its C-terminal acidic activation motif. Further molecular and genetic analyses revealed that WP1 physically interacts with MtTT8 and MtWD40-1 proteins and that this interaction facilitates WP1's function in the transcriptional activation of both carotenoid and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Our findings demonstrate the molecular mechanism of WP1-mediated regulation of floral carotenoid pigmentation and suggest that the conserved MYB-basic-helix-loop-helix-WD40 regulatory module functions in carotenoid biosynthesis in <i>M. truncatula</i>, with specificity imposed by the MYB partner.
