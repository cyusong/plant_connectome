Potassium(K<sup>+</sup>) plays a vital role in improving the quality of tobacco leaves. However, how to improve the potassium content of tobacco leaves has always been a difficult problem in tobacco planting. K<sup>+</sup> content in tobacco hybrid is characterized by heterosis, which can improve the quality of tobacco leaves, but its underlying molecular genetic mechanisms remain unclear. Through a two-year field experiment, G70×GDH11 with strong heterosis and K326×GDH11 with weak heterosis were screened out. Transcriptome analyses revealed that 80.89% and 57.28% of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the strong and weak heterosis combinations exhibited an overdominant expression pattern, respectively. The genes that up-regulated the overdominant expression in the strong heterosis hybrids were significantly enriched in the ion homeostasis. Genes involved in K<sup>+</sup> transport (KAT1/2, GORK, AKT2, and KEA3), activity regulation complex (CBL-CIPK5/6), and vacuole (TPKs) genes were overdominant expressed in strong heterosis hybrids, which contributed to K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and heterosis in tobacco leaves. K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and accumulation in tobacco hybrids were collectively improved. The overdominant expression of K<sup>+</sup> transport and homeostasis-related genes conducted a crucial role in the heterosis of K<sup>+</sup> content in tobacco leaves.
