Most environmental perturbations have a direct or indirect deleterious impact on photosynthesis, and, in consequence, the overall energy status of the cell. Despite our increased understanding of convergent energy and stress signals, the connections between photosynthesis, energy and stress signals through putative common nodes are still unclear. Here we identified an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized adenine nucleotide transporter1 (ER-ANT1), whose deficiency causes seedling lethality in air but viable under high CO<sub>2</sub>, exhibiting the typical photorespiratory phenotype. Metabolic analysis suggested that depletion of ER-ANT1 resulted in circadian rhythm disorders in sucrose synthesis and induced sucrose signaling pathways, indicating that the ER is involved in the regulation of vital energy metabolism in plants. In addition, the defect of ER-ANT1 triggers ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response in plant cells, suggesting ER stress and photorespiration are closely linked. These findings provide an important evidence for a key role of ER-localized ER-ANT1 in convergent energy and stress signals in rice. Our findings support the idea that ATP is a central signal involved in the plant response to a variety of stresses.
