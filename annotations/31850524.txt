Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is a globally abundant marine metabolite and a significant source of organic carbon and sulfur for marine microbial ecosystems with the potential to influence climate regulation. However, the physiological function of DMSP has remained enigmatic for >30 yr. Recent insight suggests that there are different physiological roles for DMSP based on the cellular DMSP concentrations in producers. Differential production of DMSP was tested with multiple physiological experiments that altered nitrate availability, salinity and temperature to create stressed growth and target different metabolic conditions in Emiliania huxleyi, a high DMSP producer and Thalassiosira oceanica, a low DMSP producer. Emiliania huxleyi intracellular DMSP did not respond to metabolically imbalanced conditions, while Thalassiosira oceanica intracellular DMSP was significantly correlated to stressed growth rate across all conditions tested and exhibited a plastic response on a timescale of hours in nonsteady-state. The previous assumption that proposed DMSP mechanism(s) can be universally applied to all producers is shown to be unlikely. Rather, two distinct ecological roles for DMSP likely exist that differ by producer type, where: (1) the primary role of DMSP in high producers is a constitutive compatible solute; and (2) DMSP production in low producers is a finely tuned stress response.
