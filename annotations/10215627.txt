['10215627', 'A recessive mutation in the Arabidopsis STERILE APETALA (SAP) causes severe  aberrations in inflorescence and flower and ovule development. In sap flowers,  sepals are carpelloid, petals are short and narrow or absent, and anthers are  degenerated. Megasporogenesis, the process of meiotic divisions preceding the  female gametophyte formation, is arrested in sap ovules during or just after the  first meiotic division. More severe aberrations were observed in double mutants  between sap and mutant alleles of the floral homeotic gene APETALA2 (AP2)  suggesting that both genes are involved in the initiation of female gametophyte  development. Together with the organ identity gene AGAMOUS (AG) SAP is required  for the maintenance of floral identity acting in a manner similar to APETALA1. In  contrast to the outer two floral organs in sap mutant flowers, normal sepals and  petals develop in ag/sap double mutants, indicating that SAP negatively regulates  AG expression in the perianth whorls. This supposed cadastral function of SAP is  supported by in situ hybridization experiments showing ectopic expression of AG  in the sap mutant. We have cloned the SAP gene by transposon tagging and revealed  that it encodes a novel protein with sequence motifs, that are also present in  plant and animal transcription regulators. Consistent with the mutant phenotype,  SAP is expressed in inflorescence and floral meristems, floral organ primordia,  and ovules. Taken together, we propose that SAP belongs to a new class of  transcription regulators essential for a number of processes in Arabidopsis  flower development.', '1999 Apr 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.13.8.1002', 'Angenent']
