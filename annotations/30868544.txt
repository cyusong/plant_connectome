Here we demonstrate that the APUM9 RNA-binding protein and its co-factors play a role in mRNA destabilization and how this activity might regulate early plant development. APUM9 is a conserved PUF RNA-binding protein (RBP) under complex transcriptional control mediated by a transposable element (TE) that restricts its expression in Arabidopsis. Currently, little is known about the functional and mechanistic details of the plant PUF regulatory system and the biological relevance of the TE-mediated repression of APUM9 in plant development and stress responses. By combining a range of transient assays, we show here, that APUM9 binding to target transcripts can trigger their rapid decay via its conserved C-terminal RNA-binding domain. APUM9 directly interacts with DCP2, the catalytic subunit of the decapping complex and DCP2 overexpression induces rapid decay of APUM9 targeted mRNAs. We show that APUM9 negatively regulates the expression of ABA signaling genes during seed imbibition, and thereby might contribute to the switch from dormant stage to seed germination. By contrast, strong TE-mediated repression of APUM9 is important for normal plant growth in the later developmental stages. Finally, APUM9 overexpression plants show slightly enhanced heat tolerance suggesting that TE-mediated control of APUM9, might have a role not only in embryonic development, but also in plant adaptation to heat stress conditions.
