['26895630', 'Pectins are major components of plant primary cell walls. They include  homogalacturonans (HGs), which are the most abundant pectin and can be the target  of apoplastic enzymes like pectin methylesterases (PMEs) that control their  methylesterification level. Several PMEs are expressed in the seed coat of  Arabidopsis thaliana, particularly in mucilage secretory cells (MSCs). On the  basis of public transcriptomic data, seven PME genes were selected and checked  for their seed-specific expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Of  these, PME58 presented the highest level of expression and was specifically  expressed in MSCs at the early stages of seed development. pme58 mutants  presented two discrete phenotypes: (i) their adherent mucilage was less stained  by ruthenium red when compared to wild-type seeds, but only in the presence of  EDTA, a Ca(2+)chelator; and (ii) the MSC surface area was decreased. These  phenotypes are the consequence of an increase in the degree of HG  methylesterification connected to a decrease in PME activity. Analysis of the  sugar composition of soluble and adherent mucilage showed that, in the presence  of EDTA, sugars of adherent mucilage were more readily extracted in pme58  mutants. Immunolabelling with LM19, an antibody that preferentially recognizes  unesterified HGs, also showed that molecular interactions with HGs were modified  in the adherent mucilage of pme58 mutants, suggesting a role of PME58 in mucilage  structure and organization. In conclusion, PME58 is the first PME identified to  play a direct role in seed mucilage structure.', '2016 Apr', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erw025', 'ORCID:']
