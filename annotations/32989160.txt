['32989160', 'The plant trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a central trafficking hub where secretory,  vacuolar, recycling, and endocytic pathways merge. Among currently known  molecular players involved in TGN transport, three different adaptor protein (AP)  complexes promote vesicle generation at the TGN with different cargo specificity  and destination. Yet, it remains unresolved how sorting into diverging vesicular  routes is spatially organized. Here, we study the family of Arabidopsis thaliana  Epsin-like proteins, which are accessory proteins to APs facilitating vesicle  biogenesis. By comprehensive molecular, cellular, and genetic analysis of the  EPSIN gene family, we identify EPSIN1 and MODIFIED TRANSPORT TO THE VACUOLE1  (MTV1) as its only TGN-associated members. Despite their large phylogenetic  distance, they perform overlapping functions in vacuolar and secretory transport.  By probing their relationship with AP complexes, we find that they define two  molecularly independent pathways: While EPSIN1 associates with AP-1, MTV1  interacts with AP-4, whose function is required for MTV1 recruitment. Although  both EPSIN1/AP-1 and MTV1/AP-4 pairs reside at the TGN, high-resolution  microscopy reveals them as spatially separate entities. Our results strongly  support the hypothesis of molecularly, functionally, and spatially distinct  subdomains of the plant TGN and suggest that functional redundancy can be  achieved through parallelization of molecularly distinct but functionally  overlapping pathways.', '2020 Oct 13', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2004822117', 'ORCID:']
