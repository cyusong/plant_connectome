Heavy metal stress affects the quality of medicinal plants, and rare earth elements can effectively alleviate heavy metal stress. In this paper, we investigated the effects of rare earth element cerium (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg/L) on the physiological and medicinal components of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. under copper (200 mg/L) stress. The results revealed that cerium (Ce) had a good alleviating effect on copper (Cu) stress, low concentrations of Ce (10-20 mg/L) significantly improved the resistance and medicinal qualities of the plant such as polysaccharide, polyphenol and flavonoid, it also increased the content of photosynthetic pigment, proline, soluble sugar and soluble protein of D. nobile Lindl., effectively balance the osmotic pressure and the generation and removal of reactive oxygen species in the plant, thereby the toxic effect of copper on D. nobile Lindl. is alleviated. From the point of view of the treatment time when the optimal relieving concentration appeared, the optimal concentration for relieving antioxidant enzyme activity all appeared at the treatment time of 10 d, the optimum concentrations of other indicators all appeared at the treatment time of 15 d. Overall, this study suggests that the optimum level of Ce (10-20 mg/L) might be promising for alleviating the adverse impacts of copper stress and promoting the accumulation of medicinal components in D. nobile Lindl.
