Nuclear matrix constituent proteins (NMCPs), the structural components of the plant lamina, are considered to be the analogues of lamins in plants based on numerous structural and functional similarities. Current phylogenetic knowledge suggests that, in contrast to lamins, which are widely distributed in eukaryotes, NMCPs are taxonomically restricted to Streptophyta. At present, most information about NMCPs comes from angiosperms, and virtually no data are available from more ancestral groups. In angiosperms, the NMCP family comprises two phylogenetic groups, NMCP1 and NMCP2, which evolved from the NMCP1 and NMCP2 progenitor genes. Based on sequence conservation and the presence of NMCP-specific domains, we determined the structure and number of NMCP genes present in different Streptophyta clades. We analysed 91 species of embryophytes and report additional NMCP sequences from mosses, liverworts, clubmosses, horsetail, ferns, gymnosperms, and Charophyta algae. Our results confirm an origin of NMCPs in Charophyta (the earliest diverging group of Streptophyta), resolve the number and structure of NMCPs in the different clades, and propose the emergence of additional NMCP homologues by whole-genome duplication events. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated localization of a basal NMCP from the moss Physcomitrella patens at the nuclear envelope, suggesting a functional conservation for basal and more evolved NMCPs.
