<i>Phytophthora capsici</i> is a broad-host range oomycete pathogen that can cause severe phytophthora blight disease of pepper and hundreds of other plant species worldwide. Natural resistance against <i>P. capsici</i> is inadequate, and it is very difficult to control by most of existing chemical fungicides. Therefore, it is urgent to develop alternative strategies to control this pathogen. Recently, host-induced or spray-induced gene silencing of essential or virulent pathogen genes provided an effective strategy for disease controls. Here, we demonstrate that <i>P. capsici</i> can effectively take up small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from the environment. According to RNA-seq and quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis, we identified four <i>P. capsici</i> RXLR effector genes that are significantly up-regulated during the infection stage. Transient overexpression and promote-infection assays indicated that RXLR1 and RXLR4 could promote pathogen infection. Using a virus-induced gene silencing system in pepper plants, we found that in planta-expressing RNA interference (RNAi) constructs that target <i>RXLR1</i> or <i>RXLR4</i> could significantly reduce pathogen infection, while co-interfering <i>RXLR1</i> and <i>RXLR4</i> could confer a more enhanced resistance to <i>P. capsici</i>. We also found that exogenously applying siRNAs that target <i>RXLR1</i> or <i>RXLR4</i> could restrict growth of <i>P. capsici</i> on the pepper and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves; when targeting <i>RXLR1</i> and <i>RXLR4</i> simultaneously, the control effect was more remarkable. These data suggested that RNAi-based gene silencing of RXLR effectors has great potential for application in crop improvement against <i>P. capsici</i> and also provides an important basis for the development of RNA-based antioomycete agents.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
