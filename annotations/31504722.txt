Plants exhibit remarkable regeneration capacity, ensuring developmental plasticity. In vitro tissue culture techniques are based on plant regeneration ability and facilitate production of new organs and even the whole plant from explants. Plant somatic cells can be reprogrammed to form a pluripotent cell mass called the callus. A portion of pluripotent callus cells gives rise to a fertile shoot via de novo shoot organogenesis (DNSO). Here, we reconstitute the shoot regeneration process with four phases, namely pluripotency acquisition, shoot promeristem formation, establishment of the confined shoot progenitor, and shoot outgrowth. Additionally, other biological processes, including cell cycle progression and reactive oxygen species metabolism, which further contribute to successful completion of DNSO, are also summarized. Overall, this study highlights recent advances in the molecular and cellular events involved in DNSO, as well as the regulatory mechanisms behind key steps of DNSO.
