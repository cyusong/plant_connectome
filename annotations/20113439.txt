['20113439', 'Plants often experience challenging hypoxic conditions imposed by soil  waterlogging or complete flooding. In rice, Sub1A, a flooding-induced ethylene  responsive factor (ERF) plays a crucial role in submergence tolerance. In this  study, we examined two Arabidopsis Hypoxia Responsive ERF genes (HRE1 and HRE2),  belonging to the same ERF group as Sub1A. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants, which  over-expressed HRE1, showed an improved tolerance of anoxia, whereas a  double-knockout mutant hre1hre2 was more susceptible than the wild type. HRE1  over-expressing plants showed an increased activity in the fermentative enzymes  pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase together with increased ethanol  production under hypoxia, but not in normoxia. Whole-genome microarray analyses  suggested that an over-expression of HRE1, but not HRE2, increased the induction  of most anaerobic genes under hypoxia. Real-time quantitative (q)PCR analyses  confirmed a positive effect of HRE1 over-expression on several anaerobic genes,  whereas the double-knockout mutant hre1hre2 showed a decreased expression in the  same genes after 4 h of hypoxia. Single-knockout mutants did not show significant  differences from the wild type. We found that the regulation of HRE1 and HRE2 by  low oxygen relies on different mechanisms, since HRE1 requires protein synthesis  to be induced while HRE2 does not. HRE2 is likely to be regulated  post-transcriptionally by mRNA stabilization. We propose that HRE1 and HRE2 play  a partially redundant role in low oxygen signalling in Arabidopsis thaliana, thus  improving the tolerance of the plant to the stress by enhancing anaerobic gene  expression and ethanolic fermentation.', '2010 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04149.x', 'Perata']
