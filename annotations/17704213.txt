['17704213', 'Chromatin-based silencing provides a crucial mechanism for the regulation of gene  expression. We have identified a WD40 domain cyclophilin, CYCLOPHILIN71 (CYP71),  which functions in gene repression and organogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Disruption of CYP71 resulted in ectopic activation of homeotic genes that  regulate meristem development. The cyp71 mutant plants displayed dramatic  defects, including reduced apical meristem activity, delayed and abnormal lateral  organ formation, and arrested root growth. CYP71 was associated with the  chromatin of target gene loci and physically interacted with histone H3. The  cyp71 mutant showed reduced methylation of H3K27 at target loci, consistent with  the derepression of these genes in the mutant. As CYP71 has close homologs in  eukaryotes ranging from fission yeast to human, we propose that it serves as a  highly conserved histone remodeling factor involved in chromatin-based gene  silencing in eukaryotic organisms.', '2007 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.053579', 'Luan']
