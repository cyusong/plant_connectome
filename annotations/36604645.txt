The sterile lemma is a unique organ of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) spikelet. However, the characteristics and origin of the rice sterile lemma have not been determined unequivocally, so it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the development of the sterile lemma. In the paper, we outline the regulatory mechanism of sterile lemma development by LONG STERILE LEMMA1 (G1), which has been identified as the gene controlling sterile lemma development. Based on the comprehensive analyses of transcriptome dynamics during sterile lemma development with G1 alleles between wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT) in rice, we obtained co-expression data and regulatory networks related to sterile lemma development. Co-transfection assays of rice protoplasts confirmed that G1 affects the expression of various phytohormone-related genes by regulating a number of critical transcription factors, such as OsLBD37 and OSH1. The hormone levels in sterile lemmas from WT and MT of rice supports the hypotheses that lower auxin, lower gibberellin, and higher cytokinin concentrations are required to maintain a normal phenotype of sterile lemmas. The regulatory networks have considerable reference value, and some of the regulatory relationships exhibiting strong correlations are worthy of further study. Taken together, these work provided a detailed guide for further studies into the molecular mechanism of sterile lemma development.
