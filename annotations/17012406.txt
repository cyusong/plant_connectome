Kip-related proteins (KRPs) play a major role in the regulation of the plant cell cycle. We report the identification of five putative rice (Oryza sativa) proteins that share characteristic motifs with previously described plant KRPs. To investigate the function of KRPs in rice development, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing the Orysa;KRP1 gene. Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development. The reduced cell production in the leaf meristem was partly compensated by an increased cell size, demonstrating the existence of a compensatory mechanism in monocot species by which growth rate is less reduced than cell production, through cell expansion. Furthermore, Orysa;KRP1 overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling. Sectioning through the overexpressed KRP1 seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells. The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of KRP1 in connecting endocycle with endosperm development. Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation.
