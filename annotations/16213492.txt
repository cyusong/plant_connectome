Pyrococcus furiosus superoxide reductase (SOR) is a thermostable archaeal enzyme that reduces superoxide without producing oxygen. When produced as a fusion protein with the green fluorescent protein in plant cells, P. furiosus SOR is located in the cytosol and nucleus. The recombinant SOR enzyme retains its function and heat stability when assayed in vitro. Importantly, expressing SOR in plant cells enhances their survival at high temperature indicating that it functions in vivo. The archaeal SOR provides a novel mechanism to reduce superoxide and demonstrates the potential for using archaeal genes to alter eukaryotic metabolism.
