In flowering plants, the transition of a shoot apical meristem from vegetative to reproductive destiny is a graduated, multistage process that involves sequential conversion of the vegetative meristem to an inflorescence meristem, initiation of floral meristems, emergence of flower organ primordia, and formation of floral organs. This orderly process can be derailed by phytoplasma, a bacterium that parasitizes phloem sieve cells. In a previous study, we showed that phytoplasma-induced malformation of flowers reflects stage-specific derailment of shoot apical meristems from their genetically preprogrammed reproductive destiny. Our current study unveiled new symptoms of abnormal morphogenesis, pointing to derailment of meristem transition at additional stages previously unidentified. We also found that the fate of developing meristems may be derailed even after normal termination of the floral meristem and onset of seed production. Although previous reports by others have indicated that different symptoms may be induced by different phytoplasmal effectors, the phenomenon observed in our experiment raises interesting questions as to (i) whether effectors can act at specific stages of meristem transition and (ii) whether specific floral abnormalities are attributable to meristem fate-derailment events triggered by different effectors that each act at a specific stage in meristem transition. Research addressing such questions may lead to discoveries of an array of phytoplasmal effectors.
