Proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) are an important class of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) containing an extracellular proline-rich domain. While they are thought to be putative sensors of the cell wall integrity, there are very few reports on their biological functions in the plant, as compared with other RLKs. Several studies support a role for PERKs in plant growth and development, but their effect on the cell wall composition to regulate cell expansion is still lacking. Gene expression data suggest that they may intervene in response to environmental changes, in agreement with their subcellular localization. And there is growing evidence for PERKs as novel sensors of environmental stresses such as insects and viruses. However, little is known about their precise role in plant immunity and in the extracellular network of RLKs, as no PERK-interacting RLK or any coreceptor has been identified as yet. Similarly, their signaling activities and downstream signaling components are just beginning to be deciphered, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes, reactive oxygen species accumulation and phosphorylation events. Here we outline emerging roles for PERKs as novel sensors of environmental stresses, and we discuss how to better understand this overlooked class of receptor kinases via several avenues of research.
