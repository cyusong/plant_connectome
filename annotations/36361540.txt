Gretchen Hagen3 (<i>GH3</i>), one of the three major auxin-responsive gene families, is involved in hormone homeostasis in vivo by amino acid splicing with the free forms of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Until now, the functions of sugarcane <i>GH3</i> (<i>SsGH3</i>) family genes in response to biotic stresses have been largely unknown. In this study, we performed a systematic identification of the <i>SsGH3</i> gene family at the genome level and identified 41 members on 19 chromosomes in the wild sugarcane species, <i>Saccharum spontaneum</i>. Many of these genes were segmentally duplicated and polyploidization was the main contributor to the increased number of <i>SsGH3</i> members. SsGH3 proteins can be divided into three major categories (SsGH3-I, SsGH3-II, and SsGH3-III) and most <i>SsGH3</i> genes have relatively conserved exon-intron arrangements and motif compositions. Diverse <i>cis</i>-elements in the promoters of <i>SsGH3</i> genes were predicted to be essential players in regulating <i>SsGH3</i> expression patterns. Multiple transcriptome datasets demonstrated that many <i>SsGH3</i> genes were responsive to biotic and abiotic stresses and possibly had important functions in the stress response. RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that <i>SsGH3</i> genes were differentially expressed in sugarcane tissues and under <i>Sporisorium scitamineum</i> stress. In addition, the <i>SsGH3</i> homolog <i>ScGH3-1</i> gene (GenBank accession number: OP429459) was cloned from the sugarcane cultivar (<i>Saccharum</i> hybrid) ROC22 and verified to encode a nuclear- and membrane-localization protein. <i>ScGH3-1</i> was constitutively expressed in all tissues of sugarcane and the highest amount was observed in the stem pith. Interestingly, it was down-regulated after smut pathogen infection but up-regulated after MeJA and SA treatments. Furthermore, transiently overexpressed <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, transduced with the <i>ScGH3-1</i> gene, showed negative regulation in response to the infection of <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> and <i>Fusarium solani</i> var. <i>coeruleum</i>. Finally, a potential model for <i>ScGH3-1</i>-mediated regulation of resistance to pathogen infection in transgenic <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants was proposed. This study lays the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the sequence characteristics, structural properties, evolutionary relationships, and expression of the <i>GH3</i> gene family and thus provides a potential genetic resource for sugarcane disease-resistance breeding.
