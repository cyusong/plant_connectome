Regulation of the cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) gene promoter from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was studied in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants using a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene fusion (PvACCase::GUS). Under normal growth conditions, GUS was expressed in hydathodes, stipules, trichome bases, flowers, pollen, and embryos. In roots, expression was observed in the tip, elongation zone, hypocotyl-root transition zone, and lateral root primordia. The PvACCase promoter was induced by wounding, Pseudomonas syringae infection, hydrogen peroxide, jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene, or auxin treatment. Analysis of PvACCase::GUS expression in JA and ethylene mutants (coronatine insensitive1-1 [coi1-1], ethylene resistant1-1 [etr1-1], coi1-1/etr1-1) suggests that neither JA nor ethylene perception participates in the activation of this gene in response to wounding, although each of these independent signaling pathways is sufficient for pathogen or hydrogen peroxide-induced PvACCase gene expression. We propose a model involving different pathways of PvACCase gene activation in response to stress.
