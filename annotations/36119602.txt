<i>Zanthoxylum armatum</i> is a prominent plant for food industries. Its male flowers often occur in gynogenesis plants; however, the potential mechanism remains poorly understood. Herein, a total of 26 floral sex differentiation stages were observed to select four vital phases to reveal key factors by using RNA-seq, phytohormones and carbohydrates investigation. The results showed that a selective abortion of stamen or pistil primordia could result in the floral sex differentiation in <i>Z. armatum</i>. Carbohydrates might collaborate with cytokinin to effect the male floral differentiation, whereas female floral differentiation was involved in SA, GA<sub>1</sub>, and ABA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways. Meanwhile, these endogenous regulators associated with reproductive growth might be integrated into ABCDE model to regulate the floral organ differentiation in <i>Z. armatum</i>. Furthermore, the 21 crucial candidates were identified in co-expression network, which would contribute to uncovering their roles in floral sex differentiation of <i>Z. armatum</i> in further studies. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first comprehensive investigation to link floral sex differentiation with multi-level endogenous regulatory factors in <i>Z. armatum</i>. It also provided new insights to explore the regulatory mechanism of floral sex differentiation, which would be benefited to cultivate high-yield varieties in <i>Z. armatum</i>.
