Glyceollins are the major pathogen- and stress-inducible natural products (phytoalexins) of soybean that possess broad-spectrum anticancer and neuroprotective properties. Yet like other phytoalexins, glyceollins are difficult to obtain because they are typically biosynthesized only transiently and in low amounts in plant tissues. We recently identified acidity stress (pH 3.0 growth medium) as an elicitor that exerted prolonged (week-long) inductive effects on glyceollin biosynthesis and identified the NAC family TF gene <i>GmNAC42-1</i> that activates glyceollin biosynthesis in response to acidity stress or WGE from the soybean pathogen <i>Phytophthora sojae. GmNAC42-1</i> was annotated as an SAR gene and SAR genes were statistically overrepresented in the transcriptomic response to acidity stress suggesting that acidity stress triggers the systemic elicitation of glyceollin biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that acidity stress acts as a systemic elicitor when provided to soybean roots. Acidity stress preferentially elicited specific glyceollins in different soybean organs with exceptionally high yields of glyceollin I in root tissues.
