Successful plant establishment in a particular environment depends on the root architecture of the seedlings and the extent of edaphic resource utilization. However, diverse habitats often pose a predicament on the suitability of the fundamental root structure of a species that evolved over a long period. We hypothesized that the plasticity in the genetically controlled root architecture in variable habitats provides an adaptive advantage to worldwide-distributed wild radish (<i>Raphanus raphanistrum</i>, <i>Rr</i>) over its close relative (<i>R. pugioniformis</i>, <i>Rp</i>) that remained endemic to the East Mediterranean region. To test the hypothesis, we performed a reciprocal comparative analysis between the two species, growing in a common garden experiment on their native soils (Hamra/Sandy for <i>Rr</i>, Terra Rossa for <i>Rp</i>) and complementary controlled experiments mimicking the major soil compositions. Additionally, we analyzed the root growth kinetics <i>via</i> semi-automated digital profiling and compared the architecture between <i>Rr</i> and <i>Rp</i>. In both experiments, the primary roots of <i>Rr</i> were significantly longer, developed fewer lateral roots, and showed slower growth kinetics than <i>Rp</i>. Multivariate analyses of seven significant root architecture variables revealed that <i>Rr</i> could successfully adapt to different surrogate growth conditions by only modulating their main root length and number of lateral roots. In contrast, <i>Rp</i> needs to modify several other root parameters, which are very resource-intensive, to grow on non-native soil. Altogether the findings suggest an evo-devo adaptive advantage for <i>Rr</i> as it can potentially establish in various habitats with the minimal tweak of key root parameters, hence allocating resources for other developmental requirements.
