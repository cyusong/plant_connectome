Tomato fruit growth is characterized by the occurrence of numerous rounds of DNA endoreduplication in connection to cell expansion and final fruit size determination. Endoreduplication occurs as an impairment of mitosis, which can originate from the selective degradation of M-phase-specific cyclins via the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, requiring the E3 ubiquitin ligase Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). In plants CCS52A is the ortholog of CDH1/FZR proteins from yeast, drosophila and human, belonging to the WD40-repeat protein family. During fruit development, the SlCCS52A gene expression is specifically associated to endoreduplication in tomato. Altering SlCCS52A expression in either negative or positive manner impacts the extent of endoreduplication in fruit and affects fruit size. When SlCCS52A is down-expressed endoreduplication is impaired during fruit growth leading to reduced fruit growth. However when SlCCS52A is over-expressed, endoreduplication is initially delayed, accounting for the altered final fruit size, but resumes and is even enhanced leading to fruit growth recovery, pointing at the physiological role of endoreduplication in growth induction during tomato fruit development.
