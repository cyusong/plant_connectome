Plant <i>Cellulose synthase</i> genes constitute a supergene family that includes the <i>Cellulose synthase</i> (CesA) family and nine <i>Cellulose synthase</i>-like (Csl) families, the members of which are widely involved in the biosynthesis of cellulose and hemicellulose. However, little is known about the <i>Cellulose synthase</i> superfamily in the family Orchidaceae, one of the largest families of angiosperms. In the present study, we identified and systematically analyzed the <i>CesA/Csl</i> family members in three fully sequenced Orchidaceae species, i.e., <i>Dendrobium officinale</i>, <i>Phalaenopsis equestris</i>, and <i>Apostasia shenzhenica</i>. A total of 125 <i>Cellulose synthase</i> superfamily genes were identified in the three orchid species and classified into one CesA family and six Csl families: CslA, CslC, CslD, CslE, CslG, and CslH according to phylogenetic analysis involving nine representative plant species. We found species-specific expansion of certain gene families, such as the CslAs in <i>D. officinale</i> (19 members). The <i>CesA/Csl</i> families exhibited sequence divergence and conservation in terms of gene structure, phylogeny, and deduced protein sequence, indicating multiple origins via different evolutionary processes. The distribution of the <i>DofCesA/DofCsl</i> genes was investigated, and 14 tandemly duplicated genes were detected, implying that the expansion of <i>DofCesA/DofCsl</i> genes may have originated via gene duplication. Furthermore, the expression profiles of the <i>DofCesA/DofCsl</i> genes were investigated using transcriptome sequencing and quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, which revealed functional divergence in different tissues and during different developmental stages of <i>D. officinale</i>. Three <i>DofCesAs</i> were highly expressed in the flower, whereas <i>DofCslD</i> and <i>DofCslC</i> family genes exhibited low expression levels in all tissues and at all developmental stages. The 19 <i>DofCslAs</i> were differentially expressed in the <i>D. officinale</i> stems at different developmental stages, among which six <i>DofCslAs</i> were expressed at low levels or not at all. Notably, two <i>DofCslAs</i> (<i>DofCslA14</i> and <i>DofCslA15</i>) showed significantly high expression in the stems of <i>D. officinale</i>, indicating a vital role in mannan synthesis. These results indicate the functional redundancy and specialization of <i>DofCslAs</i> with respect to polysaccharide accumulation. In conclusion, our results provide insights into the evolution, structure, and expression patterns of <i>CesA/Csl</i> genes and provide a foundation for further gene functional analysis in Orchidaceae and other plant species.
