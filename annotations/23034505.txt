Temporal controlled degradation of key cell division proteins ensures a correct onset of the different cell cycle phases and exit from the cell division program. In light of the cell cycle, the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is an important conserved multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase, marking targets for degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, whereas the APC/C has been studied extensively in yeast and mammals, only in the last decade has the plant APC/C started to unveil its secrets. Research results have shown the importance of the APC/C core complex and its activators during gametogenesis, growth, hormone signaling, symbiotic interactions, and endoreduplication onset. In addition, recently, the first plant APC/C inhibitors have been reported, allowing a fine-tuning of APC/C activity during the cell cycle. Together with the identification of the first APC/C targets, a picture emerges of APC/C activity being essential for many different developmental processes.
