['11701881', 'Interactions between TALE (three-amino acid loop extension) homeodomain proteins  play important roles in the development of both fungi and animals. Although in  plants, two different subclasses of TALE proteins include important developmental  regulators, the existence of interactions between plant TALE proteins has  remained unexplored. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate that  the Arabidopsis BELL1 (BEL1) homeodomain protein can selectively heterodimerize  with specific KNAT homeodomain proteins. Interaction is mediated by BEL1  sequences N terminal to the homeodomain and KNAT sequences including the MEINOX  domain. These findings validate the hypothesis that the MEINOX domain has been  conserved between plants and animals as an interaction domain for developmental  regulators. In yeast, BEL1 and KNAT proteins can activate transcription only as a  heterodimeric complex, suggesting a role for such complexes in planta. Finally,  overlapping patterns of BEL1 and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) expression within the  inflorescence meristem suggest a role for the BEL1-STM complex in maintaining the  indeterminacy of the inflorescence meristem.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010161', 'Haughn']
