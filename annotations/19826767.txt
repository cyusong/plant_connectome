This work describes the further characterization of the tumorous shoot development1 (tsd1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which develops disorganized tumorous-like shoot tissue instead of organized leaves and stems. Map-based cloning revealed that tsd1 is a novel strong allele of the KOR1 gene, encoding a membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase involved in cellulose synthesis. To study developmental changes accompanying the aberrant growth of the tsd1 mutant, patterning in the meristems and the hormonal status were analysed by marker genes. Expression of key regulators of meristem maintenance, the CLV3 and STM genes, indicated the presence of numerous meristems in the tsd1 shoot callus. Expression of the LFY::GUS marker supported the ability of the tsd1 callus to form organ primordia, which however failed to develop further. An epidermal marker showed that the L1 layer was maintained only in distinct areas of the tsd1 callus, which could be a reason of disorganized shoot growth. In the tsd1 root meristem, quiescent center activity was lost early after germination, which caused differentiation of the root meristem. The spatial expression of genes reporting the auxin and cytokinin status was altered in the tsd1 mutant. Modifying the endogenous levels of these hormones partially rescued shoot and root development of the tsd1 mutant. Together, the work shows that TSD1/KOR1 is required for maintaining a correct meristematic pattern and organ growth as well as for a normal hormonal response.
