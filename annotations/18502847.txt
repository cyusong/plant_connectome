['18502847', 'Plant morphogenesis depends on polarized exocytic and endocytic membrane  trafficking. Members of the Arabidopsis thaliana dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)  subfamily are required for polarized cell expansion and cytokinesis. Using a  combination of live-cell imaging techniques, we show that a functional DRP1C  green fluorescent fusion protein (DRP1C-GFP) was localized at the division plane  in dividing cells and to the plasma membrane in expanding interphase cells. In  both tip growing root hairs and diffuse-polar expanding epidermal cells,  DRP1C-GFP organized into dynamic foci at the cell cortex, which colocalized with  a clathrin light chain fluorescent fusion protein (CLC-FFP), suggesting that  DRP1C may participate in clathrin-mediated membrane dynamics. DRP1C-GFP and  CLC-GFP foci dynamics are dependent on cytoskeleton organization, cytoplasmic  streaming, and functional clathrin-mediated endocytic traffic. Our studies  provide insight into DRP1 and clathrin dynamics in the plant cell cortex and  indicate that the clathrin endocytic machinery in plants has both similarities  and striking differences to that in mammalian cells and yeast.', '2008 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.059428', 'Bednarek']
