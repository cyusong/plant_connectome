Cadmium is a highly toxic heavy metal pollutant arising mainly from increasing industrial disposal of electronic components. Due to its high solubility it easily enters soil and aquatic environments. Via its similarity to calcium it may interfere with different kinds of Ca dependent metabolic or developmental processes in biological systems. In the present study we investigate primary cell physiological, morphological and ultrastructural responses of Cd on the unicellular freshwater green alga Micrasterias which has served as a cell biological model system since many years and has proved to be highly sensitive to any kind of abiotic stress. Our results provide evidence that the severe Cd effects in Micrasterias such as unidirectional disintegration of dictyosomes, occurrence of autophagy, decline in photosystem II activity and oxygen production as well as marked structural damage of the chloroplast are based on a disturbance of Ca homeostasis probably by displacement of Ca by Cd. This is indicated by the fact that physiological and structural cadmium effects could be prevented in Micrasterias by pre-treatment with Ca. Additionally, thapsigargin an inhibitor of animal and plant Ca(2+)-ATPase mimicked the adverse Cd induced morphological and functional effects on dictyosomes. Recovery experiments indicated rapid repair mechanisms after Cd stress.
