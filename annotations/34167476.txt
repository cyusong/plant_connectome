Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is an important leafy vegetable crop, and leaf-related traits including leaf length, leaf width, and petiole length, are important commercial traits. However, the underlying genes remain unclear. The objective of the study was to conduct QTL mapping of leaf-related traits in spinach. A BC<sub>1</sub> population was used to construct the linkage map and for QTL mapping of leaf length, leaf width, petiole length, and the ratio of leaf length to width in 2015 and 2019. Two genetic linkage maps were constructed by specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), and kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) technology, respectively using BC<sub>1</sub> population in 2015. Based on the results of 2015, the specific linkage groups (LG) detected QTLs were generated using BC<sub>1</sub> population in 2019. A total of 13 QTLs were detected for leaf-related traits, only five QTLs being repeatedly detected in multiple years or linkage maps. Interestingly, the major QTLs of leaf length, petiole length, and the ratio of leaf length to width were highly associated with the same SNP markers (KM3102838, KM1360385 and KM2191098). A major QTL of leaf width was mapped on chromosome 1 from 41.470-42.045 Mb. And 44 genes were identified within the region. Based on the GO analysis, these genes were significantly enriched on ribonuclease, lyase activity, phosphodiester bond hydrolysis process, and cell wall component, thus it might change cell size to determine leaves shape. Five QTLs for leaf-related traits were repeatedly detected at least two years or linkage maps. The major QTLs of leaf length, petiole length, and the ratio of leaf length to width were mapped on the same loci. And three genes (Spo10792, Spo21018, and Spo21019) were identified as important candidate genes for leaf width.
