Production of new cells as a result of progression through the cell division cycle is a fundamental biological process for the perpetuation of both unicellular and multicellular organisms. In the case of plants, their developmental strategies and their largely sessile nature has imposed a series of evolutionary trends. Studies of the plant cell division cycle began with cytological and physiological approaches in the 1950s and 1960s. The decade of 1990 marked a turn point with the increasing development of novel cellular and molecular protocols combined with advances in genetics and, later, genomics, leading to an exponential growth of the field. In this article, I review the current status of plant cell cycle studies but also discuss early studies and the relevance of a multidisciplinary background as a source of innovative questions and answers. In addition to advances in a deeper understanding of the plant cell cycle machinery, current studies focus on the intimate interaction of cell cycle components with almost every aspect of plant biology.
