Male-sterile mutants are useful materials to study the anther and pollen development. Here, whole transcriptome sequencing was performed for inflorescences in three sterile lines of Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica campestris</i> L. ssp. <i>chinensis</i> Makino, syn. <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i>), the genic male-sterile line (A line), the <i>Polima</i> cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) line (P line), and the <i>Ogura</i> CMS line (O line) along with their maintainer line (B line). In total, 7,136 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 361 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (DELs), 56 differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) (DEMs) were selected out. Specific regulatory networks related to anther cell differentiation, meiosis cytokinesis, pollen wall formation, and tapetum development were constructed based on the abortion characteristics of male-sterile lines. Candidate genes and lncRNAs related to cell differentiation were identified in sporocyteless P line, sixteen of which were common to the DEGs in <i>Arabidopsis spl</i>/<i>nzz</i> mutant. Genes and lncRNAs concerning cell plate formation were selected in A line that is defected in meiosis cytokinesis. Also, the orthologs of pollen wall formation and tapetum development genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed distinct expression patterns in the three different sterile lines. Among 361 DELs, 35 were predicted to interact with miRNAs, including 28 targets, 47 endogenous target mimics, and five precursors for miRNAs. Two lncRNAs were further proved to be functional precursors for bra-miR156 and bra-miR5718, respectively. Overexpression of <i>bra-miR5718HG</i> in <i>B. campestris</i> slowed down the growth of pollen tubes, caused shorter pollen tubes, and ultimately affected the seed set. Our study provides new insights into molecular regulation especially the ncRNA interaction during pollen development in <i>Brassica</i> crops.
