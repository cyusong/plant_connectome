Respiration of stems and branches of trees (R(S)) has typically been estimated by measuring radial CO(2) efflux from woody tissue (E(A)) and rates of efflux are often scaled temporally using a temperature relationship (Q(10)). High concentrations of CO(2) in xylem sap ([CO(2)*]) have been shown to affect E(A), and the transport of CO(2) in the xylem stream has been suggested as a mechanism to explain field observations of temperature-independent fluctuations in E(A). Sap velocity and temperature were manipulated in detached branch segments of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) under controlled conditions to quantify these effects. Within individual branches of similar size, E(A) and [CO(2)*] were greater at low sap velocity, while the amount of respired CO(2) transported in sap (transport flux, F(T)) was greater at high sap velocity. E(A) was linearly correlated with [CO(2)*]. In branches of three diameter classes (1, 2, and 3 cm), volume-based E(A), F(T), and R(S) did not differ, but surface-area based CO(2) fluxes increased with diameter class. Regardless of diameter, E(A) accounted for only 30% of respired CO(2) at high sap velocity, while at low sap velocity, E(A) accounted for 71% of respired CO(2). E(A), F(T), and R(S) measured at 5, 20, and 35 degrees C at the same sap velocity showed a typical exponential response to temperature. However, at the lowest temperature, E(A) accounted for only 18% of the CO(2) released from respiring cells compared with 44% at the highest temperature, perhaps due to the effect of temperature on the solubility of CO(2) in water. These results directly demonstrate the transport of respired CO(2) in the xylem stream and may help to explain inconsistencies in stem and branch respiration measurements made in situ.
