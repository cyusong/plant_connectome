The coding sequence of NtabSPL6-1 was cloned by high-fidelity PCR with specific primers and was used in construction of a binary vector for overexpression. Wild-type Col-0 Arabidopsis plants and Qinyan95 tobacco leaves were transformed using floral dip and leaf disc methods, respectively. Phenotypic observation showed that constitutive expression of NtabSPL6-1 in Arabidopsis could promote the development of trichomes on leaf epidermis and influence the growth pattern of cauline leaves. In tobacco, ectopic expression of NtabSPL6-1 led to dwarfism of the plants and alteration of the leaf structure, accompanied by changes of the glandular trichomes in development. At the same time, the self-regulation capability of NtabSPL6-1 was determined by yeast two-hybrid system. The results indicated that SBP-C terminal domain and C terminal domain of NtabSPL6-1 possessed strong transcriptional activation ability; the intact protein, N terminal domain, and the first peptide fragment in N terminal domain possessed weak transcriptional activation ability; and the second and the third peptide fragments in N terminal domain had no transcriptional activation ability, suggesting the N terminal domain of NtabSPL6-1 could block the activity of the C terminal domain. NtabSPL6-1 may affect the resistance of plants to biotic stress factors indirectly by regulation of the trichome growth.
