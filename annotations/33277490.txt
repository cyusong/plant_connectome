Pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity are two primary forms of innate immunity in land plants. The molecular components and connecting nodes of pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity are not fully understood. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK3 is a key regulator of both pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity. In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation assays, coupled with genetic and cell biology-based analyses, show that actin-depolymerization factor 4 (ADF4) is a physiological substrate of CPK3, and that phosphorylation of ADF4 by CPK3 governs actin cytoskeletal organization associated with pattern-triggered immunity. CPK3 regulates stomatal closure induced by flg22 and is required for resistance to Pst DC3000. Our data further demonstrates that CPK3 is required for resistance to Pst DC3000 carrying the effector AvrPphB. These results suggest that CPK3 is a missing link between cytoskeleton organization, pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity.
