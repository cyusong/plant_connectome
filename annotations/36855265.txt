The cleavage of plant carotenoids leads to apocarotenoids, a group of metabolites including precursors of the hormones strigolactones (SLs) and abscisic acid, regulatory and signaling molecules. Zaxinone is a recently discovered apocarotenoid growth regulator that improves growth and suppress SL biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To test if zaxinone also counteracts the growth regulatory effects of SLs in rice, we co-supplied zaxinone and the synthetic SL analog <i>rac</i>-GR24 to the rice SL-deficient <i>DWARF17</i> (<i>d17)</i> mutant. Results showed that co-application of GR24 and zaxinone still rescued <i>d17</i> phenotype, indicating that zaxinone and GR24 act independently in regulating root and shoot growth and development in rice.
