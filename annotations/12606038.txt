['12606038', 'Divalent metal binding proteins in the Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome were  analysed by mobility shifts in the presence of divalent cations during  two-dimensional diagonal sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis. Tandem mass spectrometry and searches of the predicted  Arabidopsis protein dataset were used in an attempt to identify 34 of the  proteins which shifted. This analysis identified a total of 23 distinct protein  spots as the products of at least 11 different Arabidopsis genes. A series of  proteins known to be divalent cation-binding proteins, or to catalyse divalent  cation-dependent reactions, were identified. These included: succinyl CoA ligase  beta subunit, Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), an Fe-S centred component of complex  I and the REISKE iron-sulphur protein of the b/c(1) complex. A further set of  four proteins of known function but without known divalent binding properties  were also identified: the Vb subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, a subunit of ATP  synthase (orfB), the acyl carrier protein, and the translocase of the outer  membrane (TOM20). Three other proteins, of unknown function, were also found to  shift in the presence of divalent cations. This approach has broad application  for the identification of sub-proteomes based on the metal interaction of  polypeptides.', '2003 Feb 27', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(03)00101-7', 'Millar']
