Extensive histology of pistillate flowers revealed two pollen tube arresting sites (the style-joining and micropyle) within the pistil of Quercus acutissima during the postpollination-prezygotic stage, which reflects a unique female and male gametophyte recognition/selection mechanism. Sexual reproduction is among the most delicate and essential stages in plant life cycles and involves a series of precise interactions between pistils and male gametophytes. Quercus is a woody genus that dominates Northern Hemisphere forests and is notorious for interspecific hybridization, but its sexual reproduction is poorly understood, especially its pollen tube (PT) growth dynamics within pistils. This study used microtome techniques and scanning electron microscopy to observe the postpollination-prezygotic process in the biennially fruiting oak Quercus acutissima. Many pollen grains germinated at anthesis instantly, and PTs penetrated stigmatic surfaces and elongated through the stylar transmitting tissue, then arrested at style-joining for about 12-13 months. Few PTs resumed growth along the compitum in the upper ovarian locule wall in the subsequent April, concurrent with the rapid growth of rudimentary ovules. PTs arrived in the micropyle, and upper septum during megaspore mother cell meiosis, then arrested again for 7-10 days waiting for the embryo sac maturation. Fertilization occurred one week later. Our study shows a clear female dominant crosstalk growth pattern between PT and the ovule. The intermittent PT growth might reflect a unique male gametophyte recognition/selection mechanism to avoid self-pollination and enhance PT competition while increasing interspecific hybridization.
