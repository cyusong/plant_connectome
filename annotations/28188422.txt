This review highlights that the auxin gradient, established by local auxin biosynthesis and transport, can be controlled by ethylene, and steers seedling growth. A better understanding of the mechanisms in Arabidopsis will increase potential applications in crop species. In dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, exogenous ethylene treatment triggers an exaggeration of the apical hook, the inhibition of both hypocotyl and root elongation, and radial swelling of the hypocotyl. These features are predominantly based on the differential cell elongation in different cells/tissues mediated by an auxin gradient. Interestingly, the physiological responses regulated by ethylene and auxin crosstalk can be either additive or synergistic, as in primary root and root hair elongation, or antagonistic, as in hypocotyl elongation. This review focuses on the crosstalk of these two hormones at the seedling stage. Before illustrating the crosstalk, ethylene and auxin biosynthesis, metabolism, transport and signaling are briefly discussed.
