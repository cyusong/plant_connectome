Vernalization is an important process that regulates the floral transition in plants. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNA (sRNA) molecules that function in plant growth and development. Despite that miRNAs related to flowering have previously been characterized, their roles in response to vernalization in pak-choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) has never been studied. Here, two sRNA libraries from B. rapa leaves (vernalized and non-vernalized plants) were constructed and sequenced. Two hundred eight known and 535 novel miRNAs were obtained, of which 20 known and 66 new miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed and considered as vernalization-related miRNAs. The corresponding targets were predicted on the basic of sequence homology search. In addition, 11 miRNAs and eight targets were selected for real-time quantitative PCR to confirm their expression profiles. Functional annotation of targets using gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes results suggested that most targets were significantly enriched in the hormone signaling pathway. Moreover, a decreased indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and an increased GA<sub>3</sub> hormone were detected after vernalization, indicating that the IAA and GA<sub>3</sub> might response to vernalization. These results indicated that vernalization regulates flowering through microRNA mechanism by affecting endogenous hormone level in B. rapa. This study provides useful insights of promising miRNAs candidates involved in vernalization in B. rapa, and facilitates further investigation of the miRNA-mediated molecular mechanisms of vernalization in B. rapa.
