<i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i> is an important bacterial pathogen that causes black rot and brings about enormous production loss for cruciferous vegetables worldwide. Currently, genome sequences for only a few <i>X. campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i> isolates are available, most of which are draft sequences. Based on the next-generation sequencing and single-molecule sequencing in real time technologies, we present here the complete genome sequence of strain WHRI 3811 race 1 of <i>X. campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i>, which is a type strain that has been extensively used. The genome data will contribute to our understanding of <i>X. campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i> genomic features and pave the way for research on <i>X. campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i>-host interactions.
