Since we are living in the 'age of transcription', awareness of aspects other than transcription in auxin signal transduction seems to have faded. One purpose of this review is to recall these other aspects. The focus will also be on the time scales of auxin responses and their potential or known dependence on either AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) or on TRANSPORT-INHIBITOR-RESISTANT1 (TIR1) as a receptor. Furthermore, both direct and indirect evidence for the function of ABP1 as a receptor will be reviewed. Finally, the potential functions of a two-receptor system for auxin and similarities to other two-receptor signalling systems in plants will be discussed. It is suggested that such a functional arrangement is a property of plants which strengthens tissue autonomy and overcomes the lack of nerves or blood circulation which are responsible for rapid signal transport in animals.
