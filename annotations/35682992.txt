Inconsistency in flavour is one of the major challenges to the Australian papaya industry. However, objectively measurable standards of the compound profiles that provide preferable taste and aroma, together with consumer acceptability, have not been set. In this study, three red-flesh papayas (i.e., 'RB1', 'RB4', and 'Skybury') and two yellow-flesh papayas (i.e., '1B' and 'H13') were presented to a trained sensory panel and a consumer panel to assess sensory profiles and liking. The papaya samples were also examined for sugar components, total soluble solids, and 14 selected volatile compounds. Additionally, the expression patterns of 10 genes related to sweetness and volatile metabolism were assessed. In general, red papaya varieties had higher sugar content and tasted sweeter than yellow varieties, while yellow varieties had higher concentrations of citrus floral aroma volatiles and higher aroma intensity. Higher concentrations of glucose, linalool oxide, and terpinolene were significantly associated with decreased consumer liking. Significant differences were observed in the expression profiles of all the genes assessed among the selected papaya varieties. Of these, <i>cpGPT2</i> and <i>cpBGLU31</i> were positively correlated to glucose production and were expressed significantly higher in '1B' than in 'RB1' or 'Skybury'. These findings will assist in the strategic selective breeding for papaya to better match consumer and, hence, market demand.
