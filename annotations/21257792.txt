['21257792', 'In plants, whole-genome doubling (polyploidization) is a widely occurring process  largely contributing to plant evolution and diversification. The generation and  fusion of diploid gametes is now considered the major route of plant  polyploidization. The parallel arrangement or fusion of meiosis II MII spindles  (ps) is one of the most frequently reported mechanisms generating triploid  offspring. Through a forward genetics screen of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) ethyl methanesulfonate population, we identified Arabidopsis thaliana  Parallel Spindles1 (AtPS1), which was recently reported as a major gene  implicated in the control of the ps meiotic defect. In addition, we describe the  isolation and characterization of a novel allele of JASON, involved in male  gametophytic ploidy regulation in plants. Similar to atps1 mutants, jason  produces more than 25% 2n pollen grains and spontaneously forms triploid  offspring. By combining both cytological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate  that loss of JASON causes the formation of parallel arranged and fused spindles  in male MII, resulting in the production of unreduced first division restitution  2n spores. Although JASON encodes a protein of unknown function, we additionally  show that the meiotic ps defect in jason is caused by a reduction in AtPS1  transcript levels, indicating that JASON positively regulates AtPS1 expression,  allowing the proper organization and orientation of metaphase II spindle plates  in MII.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.170415', 'Geelen']
