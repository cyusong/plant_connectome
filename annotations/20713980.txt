Pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) are recognized by host cell surface-localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate plant immunity. PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) constitutes the first layer of plant immunity that restricts pathogen proliferation. PTI signaling components often are targeted by various Pseudomonas syringae virulence effector proteins, resulting in diminished plant defenses and increased bacterial virulence. Some of the proteins targeted by pathogen effectors have evolved to sense the effector activity by associating with cytoplasmic immune receptors classically known as resistance proteins. This allows plants to activate a second layer of immunity termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Recent studies on PTI regulation and P. syringae effector targets have uncovered new components in PTI signaling. Although MAP kinase (MAPK) cascades have been considered crucial for PTI, emerging evidence indicates that a MAPK-independent pathway also plays an important role in PTI signaling.
