['17462988', 'The first committed step in the biosynthesis of L-ascorbate from D-glucose in  plants requires conversion of GDP-L-galactose to L-galactose 1-phosphate by a  previously unidentified enzyme. Here we show that the protein encoded by VTC2, a  gene mutated in vitamin C-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana strains, is a member of  the GalT/Apa1 branch of the histidine triad protein superfamily that catalyzes  the conversion of GDP-L-galactose to L-galactose 1-phosphate in a reaction that  consumes inorganic phosphate and produces GDP. In characterizing recombinant VTC2  from A. thaliana as a specific GDP-L-galactose/GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase, we  conclude that enzymes catalyzing each of the ten steps of the Smirnoff-Wheeler  pathway from glucose to ascorbate have been identified. Finally, we identify VTC2  homologs in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, suggesting that a similar  reaction is used widely in nature.', '2007 Jun 29', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M702094200', 'Clarke']
