The timing of leaf emergence at the shoot apical meristem, or plastochron, is highly regulated in plants. Among the genes known to regulate the plastochron in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), KLUH (KLU), orthologous to the rice (Oryza sativa) PLASTOCHRON1, encodes the cytochrome P450 CYP78A5, and is thought to act through generation of a still unknown mobile signal. As klu mutants display not only a short plastochron but also a branching phenotype reminiscent of strigolactone (SL) mutants, we investigated whether KLU/CYP78A5 is involved in SL biosynthesis. We combined a genetic approach, a parasitic plant seed germination bioassay to test klu root exudates, and analysis of transcript abundances of SL-biosynthesis genes in the Arabidopsis klu mutants. We demonstrate that KLU is not involved in the SL-biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, this work allowed us to uncover a new role for SL during Arabidopsis development in modulating plastochron via a KLU-dependent pathway. Globally our data reveal that KLU is required for plastochron-specific SL responses, a first indication of crosstalk between SL and the KLU-derived signal.
