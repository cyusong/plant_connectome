['14507999', 'The previously reported Arabidopsis dominant gain-of-function mutant accelerated  cell death6-1 (acd6-1) shows spontaneous cell death and increased disease  resistance. acd6-1 also confers increased responsiveness to the major defense  signal salicylic acid (SA). To further explore the role of ACD6 in the defense  response, we cloned and characterized the gene. ACD6 encodes a novel protein with  putative ankyrin and transmembrane regions. It is a member of one of the largest  uncharacterized gene families in higher plants. Steady state basal expression of  ACD6 mRNA required light, SA, and an intact SA signaling pathway. Additionally,  ACD6 mRNA levels were increased in the systemic, uninfected tissue of Pseudomonas  syringae-infected plants as well as in plants treated with the SA agonist  benzothiazole (BTH). A newly isolated ACD6 loss-of-function mutant was less  responsive to BTH and upon P. syringae infection had reduced SA levels and  increased susceptibility. Conversely, plants overexpressing ACD6 showed modestly  increased SA levels, increased resistance to P. syringae, and BTH-inducible  and/or a low level of spontaneous cell death. Thus, ACD6 is a necessary and  dose-dependent activator of the defense response against virulent bacteria and  can activate SA-dependent cell death.', '2003 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.015412', 'Greenberg']
