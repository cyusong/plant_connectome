Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a widely cultivated fruit crop whose growth and productivity are greatly affected by low temperatures. On the other hand, wild Vitis species represent valuable genetic resources of natural stress tolerance. We have isolated and characterized a MYB-like gene encoding a putative GARP-type transcription factor from Amur grape (V. amurensis) designated as VaAQUILO. AQUILO (AQ) is induced by cold in both V. amurensis and V. vinifera, and its overexpression results in significantly improved tolerance to cold both in transgenic Arabidopsis and in Amur grape calli. In Arabidopsis, the ectopic expression of VaAQ increased antioxidant enzyme activities and up-regulated reactive oxygen species- (ROS) scavenging-related genes. Comparative mRNA sequencing profiling of 35S:VaAQ Arabidopsis plants suggests that this transcription factor is related to phosphate homeostasis like their Arabidopsis closest homologues: AtHRS1 and AtHHO2. However, when a cold stress is imposed, AQ is tightly associated with the cold-responsive pathway and with the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), as observed by the up-regulation of galactinol synthase (GoLS) and raffinose synthase genes. Gene co-expression network (GCN) and cis-regulatory element (CRE) analyses in grapevine indicated AQ as potentially regulating VvGoLS genes. Increased RFO content was confirmed in both transgenic Arabidopsis and Amur grape calli overexpressing VaAQ. Taken together, our results imply that AQ improves cold tolerance through promoting the accumulation of osmoprotectants.
