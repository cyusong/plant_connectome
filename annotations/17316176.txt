['17316176', 'gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is the enzyme responsible for breaking the  gamma-glutamyl bond between Glu and Cys in glutathione (GSH). We are using this  gene family to study GSH degradation in plants. There are four putative GGT genes  in Arabidopsis, and one of them, GGT3 (At4g29210), is analyzed in this study.  GGT3 is localized to the vacuole based on organelle-targeting programs,  subcellular distribution of GFP fusion proteins during transient expression in  onion (Allium cepa) epidermal tissues, and its ability to metabolize vacuolar  substrates in Arabidopsis plants. While Northern blots and promoter:GUS  expression patterns have suggested that GGT3 is transcribed at relatively high  levels in all parts of the plant, a comparison of enzyme activities in different  organs of wild-type and a ggt3 knockout mutant showed that GGT3 was a major  contributor to total GGT activity in roots, but a relatively minor contributor in  other tissues. Wild-type Arabidopsis plants treated with monobromobimane (mBB)  form a fluorescent GSH-mBB conjugate that is moved into the vacuole and then  metabolized to Cys-Gly-mBB and Cys-mBB in that order. The first step is catalyzed  by GGT3, and GSH-mBB metabolism is completely blocked in the roots of ggt3  knockout plants. In ggt3 leaves, some GSH-mBB metabolism still proceeds using the  apoplastic GGT1. This identifies GGT3 as catalyzing the obligate initial step in  GSH conjugate metabolism, and suggests that it has an important role in  protecting plants from some xenobiotic chemicals.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.03005.x', 'Oliver']
