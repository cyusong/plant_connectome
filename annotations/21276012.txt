In spite of the mounting concerns, current understanding of the extent and mechanisms of phytotoxicity of manufactured nanomaterials remains limited. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, ultra-small anatase TiO(2) nanoparticles cause reorganization and elimination of microtubules followed by the accelerated and 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of tubulin monomers. Similar to other microtubule-disrupting agents, TiO(2) nanoparticles induce isotropic growth of root cells. Because microtubules are essential for the normal function of all eukaryotic cells, these results reveal a potentially important consequence of environmental pollution by this widely used nanomaterial.

TiO2 nanoparticles: !disrupt! microtubules 
microtubules: !induce! isotropic growth of root cells 
TiO2 nanoparticles: !accelerate! 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of tubulin monomers 
TiO2 nanoparticles: !eliminate! microtubules
