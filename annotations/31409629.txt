Plant photoreceptors tightly regulate gene expression to control photomorphogenic responses. Although gene expression is modulated by photoreceptors at various levels, the regulatory mechanism at the pre-mRNA splicing step remains unclear. Alternative splicing, a widespread mechanism in eukaryotes that generates two or more mRNAs from the same pre-mRNA, is largely controlled by splicing regulators, which recruit spliceosomal components to initiate pre-mRNA splicing. The red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome participates in light-mediated splicing regulation, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Here, using protein-protein interaction analysis, we demonstrate that in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>, phytochrome4 physically interacts with the splicing regulator heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (PphnRNP-H1) in the nucleus, a process dependent on red light. We show that PphnRNP-H1 is involved in red light-mediated phototropic responses in <i>P. patens</i> and that it binds with higher affinity to the splicing factor pre-mRNA-processing factor39-1 (PpPRP39-1) in the presence of red light-activated phytochromes. Furthermore, PpPRP39-1 associates with the core component of U1 small nuclear RNP in <i>P. patens</i> Genome-wide analyses demonstrated the involvement of both PphnRNP-H1 and PpPRP39-1 in light-mediated splicing regulation. Our results suggest that phytochromes target the early step of spliceosome assembly via a cascade of protein-protein interactions to control pre-mRNA splicing and photomorphogenic responses.
