Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) function as calcium sensors and play important roles in plant immunity. Loss of function of the exocyst complex subunit EXO70B1 leads to autoimmunity caused by activation of TN2, a truncated Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-nucleotide binding sequence protein. Here we show, based on a screen for suppressors of <i>exo70B1</i>, that <i>exo70B1</i>-activated autoimmune responses require <i>CPK5</i> However, the CPK5 homologs CPK4, CPK6, and CPK11, which were previously reported to function redundantly with CPK5 in effector-triggered immunity, did not contribute to <i>exo70B1</i>-associated phenotypes, indicating that CPK5 plays a unique role in plant immunity. Overexpressing <i>CPK5</i> results in TN2-dependent autoimmunity and enhanced disease resistance, reminiscent of the <i>exo70B1</i> phenotypes. Ectopic expression of <i>CPK5</i> in the <i>exo70B1</i> mutant led to constitutive CPK5 protein kinase activity, which was not detectable in <i>tn2</i> mutants. Furthermore, TN2 interacts with the CPK5 N-terminal variable and kinase domains, stabilizing CPK5 kinase activity in vitro. This work uncovers a direct functional link between an atypical immune receptor and a crucial component of early immune signaling: increased immunity in <i>exo70B1</i> depends on TN2 and CPK5 and, in a positive feedback loop, TN2 keeps CPK5 enzymatically active beyond the initiating stimulus.
