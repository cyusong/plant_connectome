Heat stress causes inhibition of photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation, affects light photosynthetic reactions and accelerates alternative pathways of plastoquinone pool reduction (APPR). We have studied all these heat-sensitive processes after preheating to a broad range of physiological temperatures (24-46 degrees C) to explore a role of these alternative pathways during heat stress. Primarily, the effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry was reduced (at 40 degrees C). This PSII downregulation was accompanied by the stimulation of APPR and preceded reduction of photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation by 2 degrees ; it occurred after preheating at 42 degrees C because of inhibition in Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) activation process. Thus, we suggest that the heat-induced stimulation of APPR is not associated with the heat-induced inhibition of Calvin cycle as it was reported for other types of stresses. A possible role of APPR in the compensation of PSII downregulation is briefly discussed.
