['28514654', 'Jasmonates (JAs) are essential plant hormones that play important roles in the  regulation of plant growth and the response to environmental stress. In the JA  signaling pathway, the core transcription factors are a class of basic  helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, including MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, that have  different regulatory capacities. Here, we report the 2.7 A crystal structure of  the MYC2 bHLH domain complexed with G-box DNA, showing a cis-tetrameric  structure. Biochemical assays confirmed that full-length MYC2 forms a stable  homo-tetramer both in solution and in DNA-bound states, whereas MYC3 forms only a  homodimer. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays demonstrated that  tetramerization enhanced DNA binding affinity, and fluorescence resonance energy  transfer (FRET) assay indicated DNA looping potential of tetrameric MYC2.  Luciferase assay further confirmed the importance of tetramerization in  transcriptional regulation. Our studies provide a mechanistic explanation for the  regulatory differences of MYC transcription factors.', '2017 May 16', 'Cell Rep', '10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.057', 'Su']
