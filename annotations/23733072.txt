Studies on the basic mechanisms that regulate vacuolar delivering of proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have a great importance in plant cell biology. Indeed, many aspects of plant physiology are affected by this intracellular traffic, for example, germination or reaction to biotic stresses due to the accumulation of storage proteins in seeds or enzymes in vegetative tissues, respectively. Up to now, the Golgi complex has been considered the main hub in the sorting of vacuolar secretory proteins; those polypeptides able to reach their final destination without the aid of this organelle are regarded as exceptions to an established route. This mini-review aims to emphasize the existence of several Golgi-independent pathways involved in the trafficking of different types of vacuolar proteins.
