In flowering plants, the interaction of pollen tubes with female tissues is important for the accomplishment of double fertilization. Little information is known about the mechanisms that underlie signalling between pollen tubes and female tissues. In this study, two Arabidopsis pollen tube-expressed CrRLK1L protein kinases, Buddha's Paper Seal 1 (BUPS1) and BUPS2, were identified as being required for normal tip growth of pollen tubes in the pistil. They are expressed prolifically in pollen and pollen tubes and are localized on the plasma membrane of the pollen tube tip region. Mutations in BUPS1 drastically reduced seed set. Most of the bups1 mutant pollen tubes growing in the pistil exhibited a swollen pollen tube tip, leading to failure of fertilization. The bups2 pollen tubes had a slightly abnormal morphology but could still accomplish double fertilization. The bups1 bups2 double mutant exhibited a slightly enhanced phenotype compared to the single bups1 mutants. The BUPS1 proteins could form homomers and heteromers with BUPS2, whereas BUPS2 could only form heteromers with BUPS1. The BUPS proteins could interact with the Arabidopsis pollen-expressed RopGEFs in the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. The results indicated that the BUPSs may mediate normal polar growth of pollen tubes in the pistil.
