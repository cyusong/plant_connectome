<i>WRKY</i> transcription factors (TFs), one of the largest TF families, serve critical roles in the regulation of secondary metabolite production. However, little is known about the expression pattern of <i>WRKY</i> genes during the germination and maturation processes of <i>Toona sinensis</i> buds. In the present study, the new assembly of the <i>T. sinensis</i> genome was used for the identification of 78 <i>TsWRKY</i> genes, including gene structures, phylogenetic features, chromosomal locations, conserved protein domains, cis-regulatory elements, synteny, and expression profiles. Gene duplication analysis revealed that gene tandem and segmental duplication events drove the expansion of the <i>TsWRKYs</i> family, with the latter playing a key role in the creation of new <i>TsWRKY</i> genes. The synteny and evolutionary constraint analyses of the <i>WRKY</i> proteins among <i>T. sinensis</i> and several distinct species provided more detailed evidence of gene evolution for <i>TsWRKYs</i>. Besides, the expression patterns and co-expression network analysis show <i>TsWRKYs</i> may multi-genes co-participate in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis. The findings revealed that <i>TsWRKYs</i> potentially play a regulatory role in secondary metabolite synthesis, forming the basis for further functional characterization of <i>WRKY</i> genes with the intention of improving <i>T. sinensis</i>.
