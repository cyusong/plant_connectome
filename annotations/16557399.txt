Tracheid analysis was carried out on the veinlets and minor veins of the coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides [L.] Codd) leaf. Third- to fifth-order, or minor, veins average 3.4 tracheids in tandem and they bipartition islets when these enclosed islets reach a critical size; both these features of vein length and islet size contribute to a self-similar process of vein pattern generation. An areole was calculated to be initially comprised of about ten cells making the patterning event for vein formation requiring only a few cells. An algorithmic model developed here for minor vein formation includes five production rules, and this computer model explains the 3-4 tracheids per minor vein, presence of isolated tracheids, the structure of veinlets, and the elaborate branching patterns of veinlets in coleus and other plants.
