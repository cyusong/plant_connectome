['24415840', 'Low temperature affects plant growth and crop productivity. The CBF genes are a  class of transcription factors that play important roles in cold response. Here  we report that AtMYB14 participates in freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis by  affecting expression of CBF genes. The AtMYB14 gene was down-regulated by cold  treatment. AtMYB14 encodes a nuclear protein that functions as an R2R3-MYB  transcription activator. Knock-down of AtMYB14 by artificial microRNA increased  the tolerance to freezing stress. Both the CBF genes and the downstream genes  were induced to a much higher level in AtMYB14 knock-down plants than in wild  type under cold treatment. Our results suggest that AtMYB14 plays an important  role in the plant response to cold stress.', '2013', 'Plant Mol Biol Report', '10.1007/s11105-012-0481-z', 'Qin']
