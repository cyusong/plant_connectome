The adaptor protein (AP) complexes play crucial roles in vesicle formation in post-Golgi trafficking. Land plants have five types of AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-5), each of which consists of two large subunits, one medium subunit and one small subunit. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis AP-1 complex mediates the polarized secretion and accumulation of a pectic polysaccharide called mucilage in seed coat cells. Previously, a loss-of-function mutant of AP1M2, the medium subunit of AP-1, has been shown to display deleterious growth defects because of defective cytokinesis. To investigate the function of AP-1 in interphase, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing AP1M2-GFP (green fluorescent protein) under the control of the cytokinesis-specific KNOLLE (KN) promoter in the ap1m2 background. These transgenic plants, designated pKN lines, successfully rescued the cytokinesis defect and dwarf phenotype of ap1m2. pKN lines showed reduced mucilage extrusion from the seed coat. Furthermore, abnormal accumulation of mucilage was found in the vacuoles of the outermost integument cells of pKN lines. During seed development, the accumulation of AP1M2-GFP was greatly reduced in the integument cells of pKN lines. These results suggest that trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized AP-1 is involved in the trafficking of mucilage components to the outer surface of seed coat cells. Our study highlights an evolutionarily conserved function of AP-1 in polarized sorting in eukaryotic cells.
