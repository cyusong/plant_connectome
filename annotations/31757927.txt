Nitrogen (N) limits crop yield, and improvement of N nutrition remains a key goal for crop research; one approach to improve N nutrition is identifying plant-interacting, N<sub>2</sub>-fixing microbes. <i>Rhodotorula mucilaginosa</i> JGTA-S1 is a basidiomycetous yeast endophyte of narrowleaf cattail (<i>Typha angustifolia</i>). JGTA-S1 could not convert nitrate or nitrite to ammonium but harbors diazotrophic (N<sub>2</sub>-fixing) endobacteria (<i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i>) that allow JGTA-S1 to fix N<sub>2</sub> and grow in a N-free environment; moreover, <i>P. stutzeri</i> dinitrogen reductase was transcribed in JGTA-S1 even under adequate N. Endobacteria-deficient JGTA-S1 had reduced fitness, which was restored by reintroducing <i>P. stutzeri</i> JGTA-S1 colonizes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), significantly improving its growth, N content, and relative N-use efficiency. Endofungal <i>P. stutzeri</i> plays a significant role in increasing the biomass and ammonium content of rice treated with JGTA-S1; also, JGTA-S1 has better N<sub>2</sub>-fixing ability than free-living <i>P. stutzeri</i> and provides fixed N to the plant. Genes involved in N metabolism, N transporters, and <i>NODULE INCEPTION</i>-like transcription factors were upregulated in rice roots within 24 h of JGTA-S1 treatment. In association with rice, JGTA-S1 has a filamentous phase and <i>P. stutzeri</i> only penetrated filamentous JGTA-S1. Together, these results demonstrate an interkingdom interaction that improves rice N nutrition.
