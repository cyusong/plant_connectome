Cell wall biosynthesis plays essential roles in cell division and expansion and thus is fundamental to plant growth and development. In this work, we show that an <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutant <i>dpr3</i>, isolated by a forward genetic screen, displays embryo defects and short, swelling primary root with the failure of maintenance of root apical meristem reminiscent to several cell wall-deficient mutants. Map-based cloning identified <i>dpr3</i> is a mutant allele of <i>RIBOSE PHOSPHATE ISOMERSASE 1</i> (<i>RPI1</i>), an enzyme involved in cellulose synthesis. Cellulose content in the mutant was dramatically decreased. Moreover, <i>dpr3</i> (<i>rpi1</i> from hereon) caused aberrant auxin distribution, as well as defective accumulation of root master regulators PLETHORA (PLT1 and PLT2) and misexpression of auxin response factor 5 (<i>MONOPTEROS, MP</i>). The abnormal auxin distribution is likely due to the reduced accumulation of auxin efflux transporters PIN-FORMED (PIN1 and PIN3). Surprisingly, we found that the orientation of actin microfilaments was severely altered in <i>rpi1</i> root cells, whereas the cortical microtubules stay normal. Our study provides evidence that the defects in cellulose synthesis <i>in rpi1</i> affect polar auxin transport possibly connected with altered F-actin organization, which is critically important for vesicle trafficking, thus exerting effects on auxin distribution, signaling, and auxin-mediated plant development.
