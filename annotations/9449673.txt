['9449673', 'The control of cell division by growth regulators is critical to proper plant  development. The isolation of single-gene mutants altered in the response to  plant hormones should permit the identification of essential genes controlling  the growth and development of plants. We have isolated mutants pasticcino  belonging to 3 complementation groups (pas1, pas2, pas3) in the progeny of  independent ethyl methane sulfonate and T-DNA mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana  plants. The screen was performed in the presence or absence of cytokinin. The  mutants isolated were those that showed a significant hypertrophy of their apical  parts when grown on cytokinin-containing medium. The pas mutants have altered  embryo, leaf and root development. They display uncoordinated cell divisions  which are enhanced by cytokinin. Physiological and biochemical analyses show that  cytokinins are probably involved in pas phenotypes. The PAS genes have been  mapped respectively to chromosomes 3, 5 and 1 and represent new plant genes  involved in the control of cell division and plant development.', '1998 Mar', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.125.5.909', 'Bellini']
