Shoot branching and complex leaf development relies on the establishment of boundaries that precedes the formation of axillary meristems (AMs) and leaflets. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) super determinant mutant is compromised in both processes, due to a mutation in Sde1A. Sde1A encodes a protein with a RAWUL domain, which is also present in Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) RING finger proteins and WD Repeat Domain 48 proteins. Genetic analysis revealed that Sde1A and Bmi1A cooperate, whereas Bmi1C antagonizes both activities, indicating the existence of functionally opposing PRC1 complexes that interact with Sde1A. Sde1A is expressed at early stages of boundary development in a small group of cells in the center of the leaf-axil boundary, but its activity is required for meristem formation at later stages. This suggests that Sde1A and Bmi1A promote AM formation and complex leaf development by safeguarding a pool of cells in the developing boundary zones. Genetic and protein interaction analyses showed that Sde1A and Lateral suppressor (Ls) are components of the same genetic pathway. In contrast to ls, sde1a mutants are not compromised in inflorescence branching, suggesting that Sde1A is a potential target for breeding tomato cultivars with reduced side-shoot formation during vegetative development.
