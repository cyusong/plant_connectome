Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for both plants and animals, while its deficiency in crops and humans is a global problem that affects both crop productivity and human health. Since plants and humans differ in their Zn requirements, it is crucial to balance plant nutrition and human nutrition for Zn. In this review, we focus on the transport system of Zn from soil to grain in rice (Oryza sativa), which is a major dietary source of Zn for people subsiding on rice-based diets. We describe transporters belonging to the different families that are involved in the uptake, vacuolar sequestration, root-to-shoot translocation, and distribution of Zn, and discuss their mechanisms of regulation. We give examples for enhancing Zn accumulation and bioavailability in rice grains through the manipulation of genes that are highly expressed in the nodes, where Zn is deposited at high concentrations. Finally, we provide our perspectives on breeding rice cultivars with both increased tolerance to Zn-deficiency stress and high Zn density in the grains.
