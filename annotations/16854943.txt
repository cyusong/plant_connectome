We have analyzed plastid proliferation in root cortical cells of Medicago truncatula colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi by concomitantly labeling fungal structures, root plastids, a protein involved in plastid division (FtsZ1) and a protein involved in the biosynthesis of AM-specific apocarotenoids. Antibodies directed against FtsZ1 have been generated after heterologous expression of the respective gene from M. truncatula and characterization of the gene product. Analysis of enzymatic activity and assembly experiments showed similar properties of this protein when compared with the bacterial proteins. Immunocytological experiments allowed two phases of fungal and plastid development to be clearly differentiated and plastid division to be monitored during these phases. In the early phase of arbuscule development, lens-shaped plastids, intermingled with the arbuscular branches, divide frequently. Arbuscule degradation, in contrast, is characterized by large, tubular plastids, decorated by a considerable number of FtsZ division rings.
