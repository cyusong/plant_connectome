['24635033', "The Arabidopsis thaliana tandem zinc finger 1 (AtTZF1) protein is characterized  by two tandem-arrayed CCCH-type zinc fingers. We have previously found that  AtTZF1 affects hormone-mediated growth, stress and gene expression responses.  While much has been learned at the genetic and physiological level, the molecular  mechanisms underlying the effects of AtTZF1 on gene expression remain obscure. A  human TZF protein, hTTP, is known to bind and trigger the degradation of mRNAs  containing AU-rich elements (AREs) at the 3' untranslated regions. However, while  the TZF motif of hTTP is characterized by  C(X8)C(X5)C(X3)H-(X18)-C(X8)C(X5)C(X3)H, AtTZF1 contains an atypical motif of  C(X7)C(X5)C(X3)H-(X16)-C(X5)C(X4)C(X3)H. Moreover, the TZF motif of AtTZF1 is  preceded by an arginine-rich (RR) region that is unique to plants. Using  fluorescence anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift binding assays, we  have demonstrated that AtTZF1 binds to RNA molecules with specificity and the  interaction is dependent on the presence of zinc. Compared with hTTP, in which  TZF is solely responsible for RNA binding, both TZF and RR regions of AtTZF1 are  required to achieve high-affinity RNA binding. Moreover, zinc finger integrity is  vital for RNA binding. Using a plant protoplast transient expression analysis we  have further revealed that AtTZF1 can trigger the decay of ARE-containing mRNAs  in vivo. Taken together, our results support the notion that AtTZF1 is involved  in RNA turnover.", '2014 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12485', 'Jang']
