['14675533', 'The plant hormone ethylene regulates a wide range of developmental processes and  the response of plants to stress and pathogens. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis  led to a partial elucidation of the mechanisms of ethylene action. Ethylene  signal transduction initiates with ethylene binding at a family of ethylene  receptors and terminates in a transcription cascade involving the EIN3/EIL and  ERF families of plant-specific transcription factors. Here, we identify two  Arabidopsis F box proteins called EBF1 and EBF2 that interact physically with  EIN3/EIL transcription factors. EBF1 overexpression results in plants insensitive  to ethylene. In contrast, plants carrying the ebf1 and ebf2 mutations display a  constitutive ethylene response and accumulate the EIN3 protein in the absence of  the hormone. Our work places EBF1 and EBF2 within the genetic framework of the  ethylene-response pathway and supports a model in which ethylene action depends  on EIN3 protein stabilization.', '2003 Dec 12', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00968-1', 'Genschik']
