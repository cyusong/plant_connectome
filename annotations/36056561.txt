Phytohormones integrate external environmental and developmental signals with internal cellular responses for plant survival and multiplication in changing surroundings. Jasmonate (JA), which might originate from prokaryotes and benefit plant terrestrial adaptation, is a vital phytohormone that regulates diverse developmental processes and defense responses against various environmental stresses. In this review, we first provide an overview of ligand-receptor binding techniques used for the characterization of phytohormone-receptor interactions, then introduce the identification of the receptor COI1 and active JA molecules, and finally summarize recent advances on the regulation of JA perception and its evolution.
