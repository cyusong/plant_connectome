BcMAF2 plays a key role in flowering regulation by controlling BcTEM1, BcSOC1 and BCSPL15 in Pak-choi. Flowering is a key event in the life cycle of plants. Flowering time shows an extensive variation from different Pak-choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) cultivars. However, the regulation mechanism of flowering in Pak-choi remains rarely known. In this study, a systematic identification and functional analysis of a Pak-choi MADS Affecting Flowering (MAF) gene, BcMAF2, was carried out. BcMAF2 encoded a protein containing a conserved MADS-box domain, which was localized in the nucleus. QPCR analysis indicated that the expression of BcMAF2 was higher in the leaves and flowers. Overexpression of BcMAF2 in Arabidopsis showed that BcMAF2 repressed flowering, which was further confirmed by silencing endogenous BcMAF2 in Pak-choi. In addition, Tempranillo 1 (TEM1) expression was up-regulated and MAF2 expression was down-regulated in the BcMAF2-overexpressing Arabidopsis. The expression of BcMAF2 and BcTEM1 was down-regulated in BcMAF2-silencing Pak-choi plants. The yeast one-hybrid, dual luciferase and qPCR results revealed that BcMAF2 protein could directly bind to BcTEM1 promoter and activate its expression, which was not reported in Arabidopsis. Meanwhile, a self-inhibition was found in BcMAF2. Taken together, this work suggested that BcMAF2 could repress flowering by directly activating BcTEM1.
