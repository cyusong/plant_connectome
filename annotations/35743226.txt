Eight <i>Trichoderma</i> strains were evaluated for their potential to protect wheat seedlings against severe (no irrigation within two weeks) water stress (WS). Considering the plant fresh weight and phenotype, <i>T. asperellum</i> T140, which displays 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase activity and which is able to produce several phytohormones, was selected. The molecular and biochemical results obtained from 4-week-old wheat seedlings linked T140 application with a downregulation in the WS-response genes, a decrease in antioxidant activities, and a drop in the proline content, as well as low levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in response to severe WS. All of these responses are indicative of T140-primed seedlings having a higher tolerance to drought than those that are left untreated. A greenhouse assay performed under high nitrogen fertilization served to explore the long-term effects of T140 on wheat plants subjected to moderate (halved irrigation) WS. Even though all of the plants showed acclimation to moderate WS regardless of T140 application, there was a positive effect exerted by <i>T. asperellum</i> on the level of tolerance of the wheat plants to this stress. Strain T140 modulated the expression of a plant ABA-dependent WS marker and produced increased plant superoxide dismutase activity, which would explain the positive effect of <i>Trichoderma</i> on increasing crop yields under moderate WS conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of <i>T. asperellum</i> T140 as a biostimulant for wheat plants under WS conditions, making them more tolerant to drought.
