Rice is the most salt sensitive cereal crop and its cultivation is particularly threatened by salt stress, which is currently worsened due to climate change. This study reports the development of salt tolerant introgression lines (ILs) derived from crosses between the salt tolerant <i>indica</i> rice variety FL478, which harbors the <i>Saltol</i> quantitative trait <i>loci</i> (QTL), and the salt-sensitive <i>japonica</i> elite cultivar OLESA. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASPar) genotyping, in combination with step-wise phenotypic selection in hydroponic culture, were used for the identification of salt-tolerant ILs. Transcriptome-based genotyping allowed the fine mapping of <i>indica</i> genetic introgressions in the best performing IL (IL22). A total of 1,595 genes were identified in <i>indica</i> regions of IL22, which mainly located in large introgressions at Chromosomes 1 and 3. In addition to <i>OsHKT1;5</i>, an important number of genes were identified in the introgressed <i>indica</i> segments of IL22 whose expression was confirmed [e.g., genes involved in ion transport, callose synthesis, transcriptional regulation of gene expression, hormone signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation]. These genes might well contribute to salt stress tolerance in IL22 plants. Furthermore, comparative transcript profiling revealed that <i>indica</i> introgressions caused important alterations in the background gene expression of IL22 plants (<i>japonica</i> cultivar) compared with its salt-sensitive parent, both under non-stress and salt-stress conditions. In response to salt treatment, only 8.6% of the salt-responsive genes were found to be commonly up- or down-regulated in IL22 and OLESA plants, supporting massive transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression caused by <i>indica</i> introgressions into the recipient genome. Interactions among <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> genes might provide novel regulatory networks contributing to salt stress tolerance in introgression rice lines. Collectively, this study illustrates the usefulness of transcriptomics in the characterization of new rice lines obtained in breeding programs in rice.
