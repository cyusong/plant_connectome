Calcium serves as a second messenger in a variety of developmental and physiological processes and has long been identified as important for plant immune responses. We discuss recent discoveries regarding plant immune-related calcium-permeable channels and how the two intertwined branches of the plant immune system are intricately linked to one another through calcium signalling. Cell surface immune receptors carefully tap the immense calcium gradient that exists between apoplast and cytoplasm in a short burst via tightly regulated plasma membrane (PM)-resident cation channels. Intracellular immune receptors form atypical calcium-permeable cation channels at the PM and mediate a prolonged calcium influx, overcoming the deleterious influence of pathogen effectors and enhancing plant immune responses.
