Stomata - cellular valves in the epidermis of land plants - close their apertures to prevent water loss or pathogen entry. A new study now reports that the plant immune response induces the expression of a peptide ligand-receptor pair that re-opens stomata to resume gas exchange and transpiration after pathogen infection.
