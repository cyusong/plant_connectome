['30287954', "The bulk of a plant's biomass, termed secondary cell walls, accumulates in woody  xylem tissues and is largely recalcitrant to biochemical degradation and  saccharification(1). By contrast, primary cell walls, which are chemically  distinct, flexible and generally unlignified(2), are easier to deconstruct. Thus,  engineering certain primary wall characteristics into xylem secondary walls would  be interesting to readily exploit biomass for industrial processing. Here, we  demonstrated that by expressing AP2/ERF transcription factors from group IIId and  IIIe in xylem fibre cells of mutants lacking secondary walls, we could generate  plants with thickened cell wall characteristics of primary cell walls in the  place of secondary cell walls. These unique, newly formed walls displayed  physicochemical and ultrastructural features consistent with primary walls and  had gene expression profiles illustrative of primary wall synthesis. These data  indicate that the group IIId and IIIe AP2/ERFs are transcription factors  regulating primary cell wall deposition and could form the foundation for  exchanging one cell wall type for another in plants.", '2018 Oct', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-018-0260-4', 'ORCID:']
