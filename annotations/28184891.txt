In contrast to the function of reactive oxygen species, calcium, hormones and small RNAs in systemic signaling, systemic electrical signaling in plants is poorly studied and understood. Pulse amplitude-modulated Chl fluorescence imaging and surface electrical potential measurements accompanied by pharmacological treatments were employed to study stimuli-induced electrical signals in leaves from a broad range of plant species and in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants. Here we report that rapid electrical signals in response to a local heat stimulus regulate systemic changes in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and PSII quantum efficiency. Both stimuli-induced systemic changes in NPQ and photosynthetic capacity as well as electrical signaling depended on calcium channel activity. Use of an Arabidopsis respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD) mutant (rbohD) as well as an RBOH inhibitor further suggested a cross-talk between ROS and electrical signaling. Our results suggest that higher plants evolved a complex rapid long-distance calcium-dependent electrical systemic signaling in response to local stimuli that regulates and optimizes the balance between PSII quantum efficiency and excess energy dissipation in the form of heat by means of NPQ.
