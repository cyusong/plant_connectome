Pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i> L.) is an important legume crop for both food and feed. Bruchids (<i>Callosobruchus</i> spp.) are destructive insect pests of pea in the field and during storage. In this study, we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling seed resistance to <i>C. chinensis</i> (L.) and <i>C. maculatus</i> (Fab.) in field pea using F<sub>2</sub> populations derived from a cross between PWY19 (resistant) and PHM22 (susceptible). QTL analysis in the two F<sub>2</sub> populations grown in different environments consistently identified a single major QTL, <i>qPsBr2.1</i>, controlling the resistance to both bruchid species. <i>qPsBr2.1</i> was mapped onto linkage group 2 between DNA markers 18339 and PSSR202109 and explained 50.91% to 70.94% of the variation in resistance, depending on the environment and bruchid species. Fine mapping narrowed down <i>qPsBr2.1</i> to a genomic region of 1.07 Mb on chromosome 2 (chr2LG1). Seven annotated genes were found in this region, including <i>Psat2g026280</i> (designated as <i>PsXI</i>), which encodes a xylanase inhibitor and was considered as a candidate gene for bruchid resistance. PCR amplification and sequence analysis of <i>PsXI</i> suggested the presence of an insertion of unknown length in an intron of PWY19, which causes variation in the open reading frame (ORF) of <i>PsXI</i>. Moreover, the subcellular localization of <i>PsXI</i> differed between PWY19 and PHM22. These results together suggested that <i>PsXI</i> encoding xylanase inhibitor is responsible for the bruchid resistance of the field pea PWY19.

QTL: !controls! Bruchid resistance
PWY19: !contains! insertion in intron of PsXI
PsXI: !encodes! xylanase inhibitor
PWY19: !localizes to! different subcellular location than PHM22
QTL: !explains! 50.91-70.94% variation in resistance
