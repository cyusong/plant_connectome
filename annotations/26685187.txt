Gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinins (CKs) are plant hormones that act either synergistically or antagonistically during the regulation of different developmental processes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, GAs and CKs overlap in the positive regulation of processes such as the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase and the development of epidermal adaxial trichomes. Despite the fact that both developmental processes originate in the rosette leaves, they occur separately in time and space. Here we review how, as genetic and molecular mechanisms are being unraveled, both processes might be closely related. Additionally, this shared genetic network is not only dependent on GA and CK hormone signaling but is also strictly controlled by specific clades of transcription factor families. Some key flowering genes also control other rosette leaf developmental processes such as adaxial trichome formation. Conversely, most of the trichome activator genes, which belong to the MYB, bHLH and C2H2 families, were found to positively control the floral transition. Furthermore, three MADS floral organ identity genes, which are able to convert leaves into floral structures, are also able to induce trichome proliferation in the flower. These data lead us to propose that the spatio-temporal regulation and integration of diverse signals control different developmental processes, such as floral induction and trichome formation, which are intimately connected through similar genetic pathways.
