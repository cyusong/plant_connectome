['9383080', 'Arabidopsis seedlings repair UV-induced DNA damage via light-dependent and  independent pathways. The mechanism of the "dark repair" pathway is still  unknown. To determine the number of genes required for dark repair and to  investigate the substrate-specificity of this process we isolated mutants with  enhanced sensitivity to UV radiation in the absence of photoreactivating light.  Seven independently derived UV sensitive mutants were isolated from an  EMS-mutagenized population. These fell into six complementation groups, two of  which (UVR1 and UVH1) have previously been defined. Four of these mutants are  defective in the dark repair of UV-induced pyrimidine [6-4]pyrimidinone dimers.  These four mutant lines are sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of gamma  radiation, suggesting that this repair pathway is also involved in the repair of  some type of gamma-induced DNA damage product. The requirement for the coordinate  action of several different gene products for effective repair of pyrimidine  dimers, as well as the nonspecific nature of the repair activity, is consistent  with nucleotide excision repair mechanisms previously described in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae and nonplant higher eukaryotes and inconsistent with  substrate-specific base excision repair mechanisms found in some bacteria,  bacteriophage, and fungi.', '1997 Nov', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/147.3.1401', 'Britt']
