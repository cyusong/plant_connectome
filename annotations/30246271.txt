Domestication is an important key co-evolutionary process through which humans have extensively altered the genomic make-up and appearance of both plants and animals. The identification of domestication-related genes remains very arduous. In this study, we present a systematic analytical approach that harnesses two recent advances in genomics, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and prediction of loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, to greatly facilitate the assembly of an enriched catalogue of domestication-related candidate genes. Using WGS data for 296 cultivated (Glycine max) and 64 wild soybean accessions, we identified 8699 LOF variants, and 116 genes that are uniquely fixed for one or more LOF allele(s) in domesticated soybeans. Existing soybean transcriptomic data led us to overcome analytical challenges associated with whole-genome duplications and to identify neo- or subfunctionalized genes. This systematic approach allowed us to identify 110 candidate domestication-related genes in an efficient and rapid way. This catalogue contains previously well characterized domestication genes in soybean, as well as some orthologs from other domesticated crop species. In addition, it comprises many promising candidate domestication genes. Overall, this collection of candidate domestication-related genes in soybean is almost twice as large as the sum of all previously reported candidate genes in all other crops. We believe this systematic approach could readily be used in wide range of species.
