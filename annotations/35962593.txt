MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 20-24-nucleotide non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in many biological processes in eukaryotes. miRNAs modulate the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level by transcript cleavage or translational inhibition. The identification of miRNA target genes has been extensively investigated in Arabidopsis and rice, but an in-depth global analysis of miRNA-mediated target regulation is still lacking in maize. Here, we report a transcriptome-wide identification of miRNA targets by analyzing parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) datasets derived from nine different tissues at five developmental stages of the maize (Zea mays L.) B73 cultivar. In total, 246 targets corresponding to 60 miRNAs from 25 families were identified, including transcription factors and other genes. In addition, PARE analysis revealed that miRNAs guide specific target transcript cleavage in a tissue-preferential manner. Primary transcripts of MIR159c and MIR169e were found to be cleaved by mature miR159 and miR169, respectively, indicating a negative-feedback regulatory mechanism in miRNA biogenesis. Moreover, several miRNA-target gene pairs involved in seed germination were identified and experimentally validated. Our PARE analyses generated a wide and detailed miRNA-target interaction atlas, which provides a valuable resource for investigating the roles of miRNAs and their targets in maize.
