Recent studies predict that global food demand of major grain crops will not be accompanied by the required increase in yield (Hall and Richards, 2013). Additionally, current figures estimate that the impact of climate change on agriculture will yield losses of 8-43%, mainly due to abiotic stresses. A second generation of transgenic crops (SGTC) was projected to mitigate these constraints worldwide. However, SGTC remain unavailable as market products. Here, we present our viewpoints about current limitations and future perspectives.
