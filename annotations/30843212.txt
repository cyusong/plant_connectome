The mint family (Lamiaceae) is well documented as a rich source of terpene natural products. More than 200 diterpene skeletons have been reported from mints, but biosynthetic pathways are known for just a few of these. We crossreferenced chemotaxonomic data with publicly available transcriptomes to select common selfheal (Prunella vulgaris) and its highly unusual vulgarisin diterpenoids as a case study for exploring the origins of diterpene skeletal diversity in Lamiaceae. Four terpene synthases (TPS) from the TPS-a subfamily, including two localised to the plastid, were cloned and functionally characterised. Previous examples of TPS-a enzymes from Lamiaceae were cytosolic and reported to act on the 15-carbon farnesyl diphosphate. Plastidial TPS-a enzymes using the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl diphosphate are known from other plant families, having apparently arisen independently in each family. All four new enzymes were found to be active on multiple prenyl-diphosphate substrates with different chain lengths and stereochemistries. One of the new enzymes catalysed the cyclisation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate into 11-hydroxy vulgarisane, the likely biosynthetic precursor of the vulgarisins. We uncovered the pathway to a rare diterpene skeleton. Our results support an emerging paradigm of substrate and compartment switching as important aspects of TPS evolution and diversification.
