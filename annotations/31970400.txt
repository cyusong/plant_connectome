The chance to watch floral organs develop live is not to be missed! Here, we outline reasons why quantitative, live-cell imaging is an important approach to study floral morphogenesis, and provide a basic workflow of how to get started. We highlight key advances in morphodynamics of lateral organ development, and discuss recent work that uses live confocal imaging to address the regulation of floral organ number, its robustness, and patterning mechanisms that exploit stochasticity.
