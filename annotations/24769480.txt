['24769480', 'Ammonium (NH(4)(+)) is both a necessary nutrient and an important signal in  plants, but can be toxic in excess. Ammonium sensing and regulatory mechanisms in  plant cells have not been fully elucidated. To decipher the complex network of  NH(4)(+) signaling, we analyzed [Ca(2+)](cyt)-associated protein kinase (CAP)  genes, which encode signaling components that undergo marked changes in  transcription levels in response to various stressors. We demonstrated that CAP1,  a tonoplast-localized receptor-like kinase, regulates root hair tip growth by  maintaining cytoplasmic Ca(2+) gradients. A CAP1 knockout mutant (cap1-1)  produced elevated levels of cytoplasmic NH(4)(+). Furthermore, root hair growth  of cap1-1 was inhibited on Murashige and Skoog medium, but NH(4)(+) depletion  reestablished the Ca(2+) gradient necessary for normal growth. The lower net  NH(4)(+) influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH  of cap1-1 root hairs implied that mutation of CAP1 increased NH(4)(+)  accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented the  npr1 (nitrogen permease reactivator protein) kinase yeast mutant, which is  defective in high-affinity NH(4)(+) uptake via MEP2 (methylammonium permease 2),  distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH(4)(+) levels that participates  in NH(4)(+) homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused  cytoplasmic Ca(2+) gradients.', '2014 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.124586', 'Song']
