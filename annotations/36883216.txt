In the developing seeds of all higher plants, filial cells are symplastically isolated from the maternal tissue supplying photosynthate to the reproductive structure. Photoassimilates must be transported apoplastically, crossing several membrane barriers; a process facilitated by sugar transporters. Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) have been proposed to play a crucial role in apoplastic sugar transport during phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway in sink tissues. Evidence for this is presented here for developing seeds of the C4 model grass Setaria viridis. Using immunolocalisation, SvSWEET4 was detected in various maternal and filial tissues within the seed along the sugar transport pathway, in the vascular parenchyma of the pedicel and the xylem parenchyma of the stem. Expression of SvSWEET4a in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that they function as high-capacity glucose and sucrose transporters. Carbohydrate and transcriptional profiling of Setaria seed heads showed that there were some developmental shifts in hexose and sucrose levels and consistent expression of SvSWEET4 homologues. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the involvement of SWEETs in the apoplastic transport pathway of sink tissues and allow a pathway for post-phloem sugar transport into the seed to be proposed.
