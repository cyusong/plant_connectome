Studies on direct and indirect defenses of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) revealed a quantitative trade-off between cyanogenesis and the total quantitative release of herbivore-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this addendum we focus on the qualitative variability in the VOC bouquets. We found intraspecific and ontogenetic variation. Five out of eleven lima bean accessions lacked particular VOCs in the bouquets released from secondary and/or primary leaves. These compounds (cis-3-hexenyl acetate, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate) can induce and prime indirect defenses in neighboring plants. Thus, the variability in VOC quality as described here might have substantial effects on plant-plant communication.
