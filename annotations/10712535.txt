['10712535', 'We describe mutant tissue lines of Arabidopsis that are able to grow in vitro as  callus on hormone-free medium. The 14 lines presented here show different hormone  autotrophic differentiation behaviors that can be classified into three  categories: (a) forming roots (rooty callus), (b) forming shoots or shoot-like  structures (shooty callus), or (c) growing without organ formation (callus).  Three fast-growing lines showed altered steady-state mRNA levels of the Cdc2 and  CycD3 cell cycle genes. Three of the six rooty callus lines contained about 20-  to 30-fold higher levels of auxins than wild-type callus. These and two other  lines with normal auxin content showed an increased steady-state level of IAA1  and IAA2 transcripts in the absence of exogenous auxin. Five of the six shooty  callus lines had increased steady-state mRNA levels of the CKI1 gene and/or of  the homeobox genes KNAT1 and STM, suggesting that the phenotype is linked to  altered cytokinin signaling. Also, one cytokinin-overproducing line with only 5%  of wild-type cytokinin oxidase activity was identified. These results indicate  that screening for hormone-autonomous growth identifies mutants with altered  hormone content or signaling.', '2000 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.122.3.721', 'Schmulling']
