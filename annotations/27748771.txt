C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis acts as a carbon concentrating mechanism that leads to large increases in photosynthetic efficiency. The C<sub>4</sub> pathway is found in more than 60 plant lineages<sup>1</sup> but the molecular enablers of this evolution are poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how non-photosynthetic proteins in the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> system have repeatedly become strongly expressed and integrated into photosynthesis gene regulatory networks in C<sub>4</sub> leaves. Here, we provide clear evidence that in C<sub>3</sub> leaves, genes encoding key enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway are already co-regulated with photosynthesis genes and are controlled by both light and chloroplast-to-nucleus signalling. In C<sub>4</sub> leaves this regulation becomes increasingly dependent on the chloroplast. We propose that regulation of C<sub>4</sub> cycle genes by light and the chloroplast in the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> state has facilitated the repeated evolution of the complex and convergent C<sub>4</sub> trait.
