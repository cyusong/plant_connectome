Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins comprise a large family that plays important roles in the regulation of abiotic stress, however, no in-depth analysis of LEA genes has been performed in grapevine to date. In this study, we analyzed a total of 52 putative LEA genes in grapevine at the genomic and transcriptomic level, compiled expression profiles of four selected (V. amurensis) VamLEA genes under cold and osmotic stresses, and studied the potential function of the V. amurensis DEHYDRIN3 (VamDHN3) gene in grapevine callus. The 52 LEA proteins were classified into seven phylogenetic groups. RNA-seq and quantitative real-time PCR results demonstrated that a total of 16 and 23 VamLEA genes were upregulated under cold and osmotic stresses, respectively. In addition, overexpression of VamDHN3 enhanced the stability of the cell membrane in grapevine callus, suggesting that VamDHN3 is involved in osmotic regulation. These results provide fundamental knowledge for the further analysis of the biological roles of grapevine LEA genes in adaption to abiotic stress.
