Continuous cropping of soybean leads to soil environment deterioration and soil-borne disease exacerbation, which in turn limits the sustainability of agricultural production. Chitin amendments are considered promising methods for alleviating soybean continuous cropping obstacles; however, the underlying mechanisms of soil sickness reduction remain unclear. In this study, soil amendments with pure and crude chitin at different addition dosages were employed to treat diseased soil induced by continuous cropping of soybean for five years. Chitin amendments, especially crude chitin, remarkably increased soil pH, available phosphorus (AP), potassium (AK) and nitrate nitrogen ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </mrow> </math> -N) contents, and improved soybean plant growth and soil microbial activities (FDA). Additionally, chitin application significantly enriched the relative abundances of the potential biocontrol bacteria <i>Sphingomonas</i>, <i>Streptomyces</i>, and <i>Bacillus</i> and the fungi <i>Mortierella</i>, <i>Purpureocillium</i>, and <i>Metarhizium</i> while depleted those of the potential plant pathogens <i>Fusarium</i>, <i>Cylindrocarpon</i> and <i>Paraphoma</i>. Moreover, chitin amendments induced looser pathogenic subnetwork structures and less pathogenic cooperation with other connected microbial taxa in the rhizosphere soils. The structural equation model (SEM) revealed that pure and crude chitin amendments promoted soybean plant growth by indirectly regulating soil pH-mediated soil microbial activities and potentially beneficial microbes, respectively. Therefore, the reduction strategies for continuous cropping obstacles by adding pure and crude chitin were distinct; pure chitin amendments showed general disease suppression, while crude chitin exhibited specific disease suppression. Overall, chitin amendments could suppress potential plant pathogens and improve soil health, thereby promoting soybean growth, which provides new prospects for cultivation practices to control soybean continuous cropping obstacles.
