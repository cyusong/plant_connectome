Slow progress has been made in discovering plant genes governing the interaction of plant pathogens and their hosts using classical genetic approaches. Extensive studies employing DNA microarray techniques to identify global changes in gene expression during pathogen-host interaction have greatly enhanced discovery of genetic components regulating the plant defence response to pathogen attack. In this study, a complementary approach was used to identify changes in protein abundance during interaction of Arabidopsis cell cultures with a pathogen-derived elicitor. The soluble protein fractions were analysed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and proteins differentially expressed in response to treatment with fungal elicitor were identified via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Elicitor responsive proteins included molecular chaperones, oxidative stress defence proteins, mitochondrial proteins, and enzymes of a diverse number of metabolic pathways. The findings, in combination with currently available microarray data, will form the basis of a filter to identify pivotal genes whose role in pathogen defence systems will require confirmation using gene knockout mutants.
