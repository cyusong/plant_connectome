Root formation under natural conditions is plastic in response to multiple signals. Recent studies suggested that the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11 (WOX11)-mediated adventitious root formation pathway can occur in the primary root (PR) in Arabidopsis thaliana, resulting in the production of a specific type of lateral roots (LRs) in response to wounding or environmental signals. This process differs from the previously characterized process for LR development, which does not require WOX11. The WOX11-mediated PR-derived roots can be considered like LRs that exhibit an 'adventitious' feature. Therefore, we consider these roots to be adventitious lateral roots (adLRs). The identification of WOX11-mediated adLRs implies that studying the formation of roots in response to wounding and environmental signals is important for characterizing the plasticity of the root system architecture.
