Field and pot experiments were conducted to investigate the control effects of parasitoid wasps (<i>Chelonus munakatae</i> Munakata) on striped rice stem borers and their impacts on N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields. Three treatments including no insect (NI), striped stem borer (CS) and parasitoid wasp + striped stem borer (CS+CM) were implemented. The abundance of GHG-related microorganisms in soils was determined by absolute real-time qPCR. Compared with NI, CS and CS+CM significantly increased the ratio of dead tillers, inhibited the growth and vitality of rice roots, and decreased the rice grain yield, while they significantly reduced the seasonal cumulative emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> by 17.7-24.6 and 13.6-35.1%, and decreased the total seasonal global warming potential (GWP) by 13.6-34.7%, respectively. Moreover, compared with CS, CS+CM significantly enhanced the growth and vitality of rice roots, decreased the ratio of dead tillers, improved the rice grain yield, as well as increased the seasonal cumulative CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and the total seasonal GWP. Principal component analysis indicated that the morphological features of rice roots play a more important role in regulating GHG emissions than GHG-related microorganisms. The results suggested that <i>C. munakatae</i> can effectively control the outbreak of <i>C. suppressalis</i> and alleviate crop damage with acceptably higher GHG emissions. It is concluded that it can be recommended as an effective, environment-friendly and sustainable approach to prevent and control <i>C. suppressalis</i>.
