The stylar component to gametophytic self-incompatibility in Solanaceae is an S-RNase. Its primary structure has a characteristic pattern of two hypervariable regions, involved in pollen recognition, and five constant regions. Two of the latter (C2 and C3) constitute the active site, while the highly hydrophobic C1 and C5 are believed to be involved in protein stability. We analyzed the role of the C4 region by site-directed mutagenesis. A GGGG mutant, in which the four charged residues in the C4 region were replaced with glycine, did not accumulate the protein to detectable levels in styles, suggestive of a role in protein stability. A R115G mutant, in which a charged amino acid was eliminated to reduce the potential binding affinity, had no effect on the pollen rejection phenotype. This suggests the C4 does not interact with partners such as potential pollen tube receptors facilitating S-RNase uptake. Finally, a K113R mutant replaced a potential ubiquitination target with arginine. However, this RNase acted as the wild type in both incompatible and compatible crosses. The latter crosses rule out the role of the conserved C4 lysine in ubiquitination.
