Cyclophilin proteins are the members of immunophillin group of proteins, known for their property of binding to the immune-suppressant drug cyclosporin A, hence named as cyclophilins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerisation process of proline residues. In the present study, an in-silico based approach was followed to identify and characterize the cyclophilin family from rice, Arabidopsis and yeast. We were able to identify 28 rice, 35 Arabidopsis and 8 yeast cyclophilin genes from their respective genomes on the basis of their annotation as well as the presence of highly conserved PPIase domain. The evolutionary relationship of the cyclophilin genes from the three genomes was analyzed using the phylogenetic tree. We have also classified the rice cyclophilin genes on the basis of localization of the protein in cell. The structural similarity of the cyclophilins was also analyzed on the basis of their homology model. The expression analysis performed using Genevestigator revealed a very strong stress responsive behavior of the gene family which was more prominent in later stages of stress. The study indicates the importance of the gene family in stress response as well as several developmental stages thus opening up many avenues for future study on the cyclophilin proteins.
