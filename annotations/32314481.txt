['32314481', 'The overly zinc sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant ozs3 shows reduced growth  of the primary root, which is exacerbated by an excess specifically of Zn ions.  In addition, ozs3 plants display various subtle developmental phenotypes, such as  longer petioles and early flowering. Also, ozs3 seedlings are completely but  reversibly growth-arrested when shifted to 4 degrees C. The causal mutation was mapped to  a gene encoding a putative substrate-recognition receptor of cullin4 E3 ligases.  OZS3 orthologous genes can be found in almost all eukaryotic genomes. Most  species from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to Homo sapiens, and including A.  thaliana, possess one ortholog. No functional data are available for these genes  in any of the multicellular model systems. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout  demonstrated that a complete loss of OZS3 function is embryo-lethal, indicating  essentiality of OZS3 and its orthologs. The OZS3 protein interacts with the  adaptor protein DAMAGED DNA BINDING1 (DDB1) in the nucleus. Thus, it is indeed a  member of the large yet poorly characterized family of DDB1-cullin4 associated  factors in plants. Mutant phenotypes of ozs3 plants are apparently caused by the  weakened DDB1-OZS3 interaction as a result of the exchange of a conserved amino  acid near the conserved WDxR motif.', '2020 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14779', 'ORCID:']
