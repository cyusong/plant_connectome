Hydathodes are typically found at leaf teeth in vascular plants and are involved in water release to the outside. Although morphological and physiological analysis of hydathodes has been performed in various plants, little is known about the genes involved in hydathode function. In this study, we performed fluorescent protein-based imaging and tissue-specific RNA-seq analysis in Arabidopsis hydathodes. We used the enhancer trap line E325, which has been reported to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its hydathodes. We found that E325-GFP was expressed in small cells found inside the hydathodes (named E cells) that were distributed between the water pores and xylem ends. No fluorescence of the phloem markers pSUC2:GFP and pSEOR1:SEOR1-YFP was observed in the hydathodes. These observations indicate that Arabidopsis hydathodes are composed of three major components: water pores, xylem ends, and E cells. In addition, we performed transcriptome analysis of the hydathode using the E325-GFP line. Microsamples were collected from GFP-positive or -negative regions of E325 leaf margins with a needle-based device (~130 µm in diameter). RNA-seq was performed with each single microsample using a high-throughput library preparation method called Lasy-Seq. We identified 72 differentially expressed genes. Among them, 68 genes showed significantly higher and four genes showed significantly lower expression in the hydathode. Our results provide new insights into the molecular basis for hydathode physiology and development.
