Mediator complex is a multiprotein complex that regulates RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Moreover, it functions in several signaling pathways, including those involved in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely <i>OsMED16</i> and <i>OsMED25</i> in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice. Both genes were differentially induced by <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> (<i>M. grisea</i>), the causative agent of blast disease, hormone treatment, and abiotic stress. We found that both BMV: OsMED16- and BMV: OsMED25-infiltrated seedlings reduced the resistance to <i>M. grisea</i> by regulating the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and expression of defense-related genes. Furthermore, BMV: OsMED16-infiltrated seedlings decreased the tolerance to cold by increasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reducing the expression of cold-responsive genes.
