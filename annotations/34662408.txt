Brassinosteroids (BRs) play essential roles in regulating plant growth and development, however, gaps still remain in our understanding of the BR signaling network. We previously cloned a grain length quantitative trait locus qGL3, encoding a rice (Oryza sativa L.) protein phosphatase with Kelch-like repeat domain (OsPPKL1), that negatively regulates grain length and BR signaling. To further explore the BR signaling network, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis to screen qGL3-regulated downstream components. We selected a 14-3-3 protein OsGF14b from the phosphoproteomic data for further analysis. qGL3 promoted the phosphorylation of OsGF14b and induced the interaction intensity between OsGF14b and OsBZR1. In addition, phosphorylation of OsGF14b played an important role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of OsBZR1. The serine acids (Ser258Ser259) residues of OsGF14b play an essential role in BR-mediated responses and plant development. Genetic and molecular analyses indicated that OsGF14b functions as a negative regulator in BR signaling and represses the transcriptional activation activity of OsBZR1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that qGL3 induces the phosphorylation of OsGF14b, which modulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and transcriptional activation activity of OsBZR1, to eventually negatively regulate BR signaling and grain length in rice.
