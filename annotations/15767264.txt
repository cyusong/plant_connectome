In Arabidopsis thaliana, AUTHENTIC RESPONSE REGULATORS (ARRs) act as downstream components of the His-to-Asp phosphorelay (two-component) signaling pathway that is propagated primarily by the cytokinin receptor kinases, AUTHENTIC HIS-KINASES (AHK2, AHK3 and AHK4/CRE1). Thus, this bacterial type of signaling system is essential for responses to a class of hormones in plants. Interestingly, this higher plant has also evolved its own atypical (or unique) variants of two-component signal transducers, PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS (PRRs). Several lines of recent results suggest that the functions of PRRs are closely relevant to the plant clock (oscillator) that is central to circadian rhythms, the underlying mechanisms of which have long been the subject of debate. Through an overview of recent results, the main issue addressed here is whether or not the pseudo-response regulators (PRRs) are true oscillator components (TOCs).

AHK2: !acts as! downstream component 
AHK3: !acts as! downstream component 
AHK4/CRE1: !acts as! downstream component 
ARRs: !act as! downstream components 
PRRs: !are relevant to! plant clock 
PRRs: !are true oscillator components?
