FLS2 and EFR are pattern recognition receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana perceiving the bacterial proteins flagellin and Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Both receptors belong to the > 200 membered protein family of Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor Kinases (LRR-RKs) in Arabidopsis. FLS2 and EFR are engaged in the activation of a common intracellular signal output and they belong to the same subfamily of LRR-RKs, sharing structural features like the intracellular kinase domain and the ectodomain organized in LRRs. On the amino acid sequence level, however, they are only < 50 % identical even in their kinase domains. In our recently published paper1 we demonstrated that it is possible to create chimeric receptors of EFR and FLS2 which are fully functional in ligand binding and receptor activation. Chimeric receptors consisting of the complete EFR ectodomain and the FLS2 kinase domain proved to be sensitive to elf18, the minimal peptide required for EF-Tu recognition, similar to the native EFR. In chimeric receptors where parts of the FLS2 ectodomain were swapped into the EFR LRR-domain, the receptor function was strongly affected even in cases with only small fragments exchanged. In this addendum we want to address problems and limits but also possibilities and chances of studying receptor functions using a chimeric approach.
