Pecan scab, caused by <i>Venturia effusa</i>, is a devastating disease of pecan (<i>Carya illinoinensis</i>), which results in economic losses on susceptible cultivars throughout the southeastern United States. To enhance our understanding of pathogenicity in <i>V. effusa</i>, we have generated a complete telomere-to-telomere reference genome of <i>V. effusa</i> isolate FRT5LL7-Albino. By combining Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION data, we assembled a 45.2-Mb genome represented by 20 chromosomes and containing 10,820 putative genes, of which 7,619 have at least one functional annotation. The likely causative mutation of the albino phenotype was identified as a single base insertion and a resulting frameshift in the gene encoding the polyketide synthase <i>ALM1</i>. This genome represents the first full chromosome-level assembly of any <i>Venturia</i> sp.
