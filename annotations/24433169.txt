['24433169', 'pPLA-I is the evolutionarily oldest patatin-related phospholipase A (pPLA) in  plants, which have previously been implicated to function in auxin and defence  signalling. Molecular and physiological analysis of two allelic null mutants for  pPLA-I [ppla-I-1 in Wassilewskija (Ws) and ppla-I-3 in Columbia (Col) ] revealed  pPLA-I functions in auxin and light signalling. The enzyme is localized in the  cytosol and to membranes. After auxin application expression of early  auxin-induced genes is significantly slower compared with wild type and both  alleles show a slower gravitropic response of hypocotyls, indicating compromised  auxin signalling. Additionally, phytochrome-modulated responses like abrogation  of gravitropism, enhancement of phototropism and growth in far red-enriched light  are decreased in both alleles. While early flowering, root coils and delayed  phototropism are only observed in the Ws mutant devoid of phyD, the light-related  phenotypes observed in both alleles point to an involvement of pPLA-I in  phytochrome signalling.', '2014 Jul', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12278', 'Scherer']
