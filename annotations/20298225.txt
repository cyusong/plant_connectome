['20298225', 'Plant organs, such as ovules and flowers, arise through cellular events that are  precisely co-ordinated between cells within and across clonally distinct cell  layers. Receptor-like kinases are cell-surface receptors that perceive and relay  intercellular information. In Arabidopsis the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like  kinase STRUBBELIG (SUB) is required for integument initiation and outgrowth  during ovule development, floral organ shape and the control of the cell division  plane in the first subepidermal cell layer of floral meristems, among other  functions. A major goal is to understand SUB-mediated signal transduction at the  molecular level. Present evidence suggests that SUB affects neighbouring cells in  a non-cell-autonomous fashion. In addition, our results indicate that SUB is an  atypical, or kinase-dead, kinase. Forward genetics identified three genes, QUIRKY  (QKY), ZERZAUST and DETORQUEO, that are thought to contribute to SUB-dependent  signal transduction. QKY encodes a predicted membrane-bound protein with four  cytoplasmic C(2) domains. By analogy to animal proteins with related domain  topology, we speculate that QKY may be involved in Ca(2+)-dependent signalling  and membrane trafficking. Studying SUB-dependent signalling will contribute to  our understanding of how atypical kinases mediate signal transduction and how  cells co-ordinate their behaviour to allow organs, such as ovules, to develop  their three-dimensional architecture.', '2010 Apr', 'Biochem Soc Trans', '10.1042/BST0380583', 'Schneitz']
