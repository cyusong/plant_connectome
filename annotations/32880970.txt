Silicon (Si) has been widely reported to improve plant resistance to water stress via various mechanisms including cuticular Si deposition to reduce leaf transpiration. However, there is limited understanding of the effects of Si on stomatal physiology, including the underlying mechanisms and implications for resistance to water stress. We grew tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. cv. Fortuna) hydroponically, with or without Si, and treated half of the plants with 20% polyethylene glycol to impose physiological drought (osmotic stress). Scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with X-ray mapping found that Si was deposited on stomatal guard cells and as a sub-cuticular layer in Si-treated plants. Plants grown in Si had a 28% reduction in stomatal conductance and a 23% reduction in cuticular conductance. When abscisic acid was applied exogenously to epidermal leaf peels to promote stomatal closure, Si plants had 19% lower stomatal aperture compared to control plants (i.e. increased stomatal sensitivity) and an increased efflux of guard cell K<sup>+</sup> ions. However, the changes in stomatal physiology with Si were not substantial enough to improve water stress resistance, as shown by a lack of significant effect of Si on water potential, growth, photosynthesis and water-use efficiency. Our findings suggest a novel underlying mechanism for reduced stomatal conductance with Si application; specifically, that Si deposition on stomatal guard cells promotes greater stomatal sensitivity as mediated by guard cell K<sup>+</sup> efflux.
