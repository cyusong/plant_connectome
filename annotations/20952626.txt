Although the discovery of double fertilization in flowering plants took place at the end of the nineteenth century little progress had been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved until the end of the twentieth century. After attempts to study fertilization with isolated male and female gametes, researchers turned to Arabidopsis thaliana as a model for genetic analysis and in vivo imaging. The development of confocal imaging and fluorescent proteins, coupled with new molecular insights into cell fate specification of plant gametes, allowed the development of robust markers for cells participating in double fertilization. These markers enabled the imaging of double fertilization in vivo in Arabidopsis. These studies have been coupled with the identification and molecular characterization of genes controlling fertilization in Arabidopsis. Live imaging has already provided new insights on sperm cell delivery, the equivalence of the fate of the sperm cells, gamete fusion, and re-initiation of the zygotic life. This review covers these topics and outlines many important aspects of double fertilization that remain unknown.
