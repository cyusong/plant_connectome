Rht8 is a gibberellin-sensitive Reduced height (Rht) locus that has been widely used in crop wheat semi-dwarfing breeding. In this study, the authors reported the map-based cloning of Rht8 candidate gene, and confirmed that loss of Ribonuclease H-Like 1 (RNHL-D1) is responsible for Rht8 semi-dwarfing effect.
