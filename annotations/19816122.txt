In plants, the division of peroxisomes is mediated by several classes of proteins, including PEROXIN11 (PEX11), FISSION1 (FIS1) and DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3 (DRP3). DRP3A and DRP3B are two homologous dynamin-related proteins playing overlapping roles in the division of both peroxisomes and mitochondria, with DRP3A performing a stronger function than DRP3B in peroxisomal fission. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the <i>peroxisome division defective 2 (pdd2)</i> mutant, which was later proven to be another <i>drp3A</i> allele. The <i>pdd2</i> mutant generates a truncated DRP3A protein and exhibits pale green and retarded growth phenotypes. Intriguingly, this mutant displays much stronger peroxisome division deficiency in root cells than in leaf mesophyll cells. Our data suggest that the partial GTPase effector domain retained in <i>pdd2</i> may have contributed to the distinct mutant phenotype of this mutant.
