We report the discovery of three types of transcripts for the gene encoding large subunit of Rubisco (rbcL) from chloroplast genome of Populus deltoides, an angiospermic tree. While the larger two transcripts are in confirmation with reported transcripts for other rbcL genes as far as the 5' ends are concerned, the third transcript is unique since it lacks the consensus ribosome-binding site. We also report the molecular weights of several proteins interacting with the 5' untranslated region of the same mRNA and that the RNA-protein interaction in vitro is influenced by redox reagents.
