['17559518', 'The Arabidopsis AtMTP family of genes encode proteins of the cation diffusion  facilitator (CDF) family, with several members having roles in metal tolerances.  Four of the 11 proteins in the family form a distinct cluster on a phylogenetic  tree and are closely related to ShMTP8, a CDF identified in the tropical legume  Stylosanthes hamata that is implicated in the transport of Mn(2+) into the  vacuole as a tolerance mechanism. Of these four genes, AtMTP11 was the most  highly expressed member of the Arabidopsis subgroup. When AtMTP11 was expressed  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it conferred Mn(2+) tolerance and transported Mn(2+)  by a proton-antiport mechanism. A mutant of Arabidopsis with a disrupted AtMTP11  gene (mtp11) was found to have increased sensitivity to Mn(2+) but not to Cu(2+)  or Zn(2+). At a non-toxic but sufficient Mn(2+) supply (basal), the mutant  accumulated more Mn(2+) than the wild type, but did not show any obvious  deleterious effects on growth. When grown with Mn(2+) supplies that ranged from  basal to toxic, the mutant accumulated Mn(2+) concentrations in shoots similar to  those in wild-type plants, despite showing symptoms of Mn(2+) toxicity. AtMTP11  fused to green fluorescent protein co-localized with a reporter specific for  pre-vacuolar compartments. These findings provide evidence for Mn(2+)-specific  transport activity by AtMTP11, and implicate the pre-vacuolar compartments in  both Mn(2+) tolerance and Mn(2+) homeostasis mechanisms of Arabidopsis.', '2007 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03138.x', 'Richardson']
