Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule regulating diverse biological processes in all living organisms. A major physiological function of NO is executed via protein S-nitrosylation, a redox-based posttranslational modification by covalently adding a NO molecule to a reactive cysteine thiol of a target protein. S-nitrosylation is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism modulating multiple aspects of cellular signaling. During the past decade, significant progress has been made in functional characterization of S-nitrosylated proteins in plants. Emerging evidence indicates that protein S-nitrosylation is ubiquitously involved in the regulation of plant development and stress responses. Here we review current understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of protein S-nitrosylation in various biological processes in plants and highlight key challenges in this field.
