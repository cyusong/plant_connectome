The widespread presence of Na(+)-specific uptake systems across plants and fungi is a controversial topic. In this study, we identify two HAK genes, one in the moss Physcomitrella patens and the other in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, that encode Na(+)-specific transporters. Because HAK genes are numerous in plants and are duplicated in many fungi, our findings suggest that some HAK genes encode Na(+) transporters and that Na(+) might play physiological roles in plants and fungi more extensively than is currently thought.

HAK gene: !encodes! Na(+) transporters 
Physcomitrella patens: !contains! HAK gene 
Yarrowia lipolytica: !contains! HAK gene 
plants: !have! numerous HAK genes 
fungi: !have! duplicated HAK genes 
Na(+): !plays! physiological roles in plants and fungi
