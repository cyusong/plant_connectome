Vacuolar sodium/proton (Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>) antiporters (NHXs) can stabilize ion contents to improve the salt tolerance of plants. Here, <i>GhNHX3D</i> was cloned and characterized from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). Phylogenetic and sequence analyses showed that <i>GhNHX3D</i> belongs to the vacuolar-type NHXs. The GhNHX3D-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fusion protein localized on the vacuolar membrane when transiently expressed in <i>Arabidopsis</i> protoplasts. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that <i>GhNHX3D</i> was induced rapidly in response to salt stress in cotton leaves, and its transcript levels increased with the aggravation of salt stress. The introduction of <i>GhNHX3D</i> into the salt-sensitive yeast mutant ATX3 improved its salt tolerance. Furthermore, silencing of <i>GhNHX3D</i> in cotton plants by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) increased the Na<sup>+</sup> levels in the leaves, stems, and roots and decreased the K<sup>+</sup> content in the roots, leading to greater salt sensitivity. Our results indicate that <i>GhNHX3D</i> is a member of the vacuolar NHX family and can confer salt tolerance by adjusting the steady-state balance of cellular Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions.
