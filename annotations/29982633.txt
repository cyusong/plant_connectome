SAG12 is the most widely used senescence-associated reference gene for characterizing leaf senescence, and the increase in SAG12 protein during leaf senescence is remarkable. However, the role of this cysteine protease in N remobilization and the leaf senescence process remains unclear. The role of SAG12 has been poorly investigated and the few reports dealing with this are somewhat controversial. Indeed, sag12 Arabidopsis mutants have not shown any phenotype, while OsSAG12-1 and OsSAG12-2 overexpression in rice moderates senescence progression. Therefore, this study aims at clarifying the role of the SAG12 cysteine protease during the entire plant life span and during leaf senescence. Arabidopsis thaliana plants knocked-out for the SAG12 gene (sag12) did not exhibit any special phenotypic traits when grown under optimal nitrogen supply (HN), suggesting that other cysteine proteases could provide compensatory effects. Moreover, for the first time, this study shows that aspartate protease activity is significantly increased in sag12. Among the putative aspartate proteases involved, a CND41-like aspartate protease has been identified. Under low nitrogen (LN) availability, when inducible proteolytic systems are not sufficient to cope with SAG12 depletion, a decrease in yield is observed. Altogether, these results show that SAG12 (and perhaps also aspartate proteases) could be involved in RuBisCO degradation during the leaf senescence associated with seed filling.
