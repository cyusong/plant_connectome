In cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), the preexisting fruits inhibit the growth of subsequent fruits. To study the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we examined the sink activity, the level of free sugars, and the activity of SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) in the peduncles of two types of fruits. In the two-fruit cucumber plants, the growth rate and sink activity [evaluated by alkaline alpha-galactosidase (CsAGA) activity in the peduncle] of the first fruit were greater than those of the second fruit. The (14)C-labeling experiment revealed that assimilates produced by the leaves closer to the second fruit tended to move to the first fruit. Sucrose and trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) levels in the peduncle of the first fruit were higher than those in the peduncle of the second fruit. The SnRK1 activity was lower in the peduncle of the first fruit than in that of the second fruit at 0-8 days after anthesis. The growth rate and sink activity of the second fruit were enhanced after the removal of the first fruit or after treatment with 6-benzyl aminopurine, as determined by comparison with an increase in the sucrose and T6P levels and a decrease in the SnRK1 activity in its peduncle. The SnRK1 activity was inhibited by T6P in an in vitro kinase assay, and the mRNA level of CsAGA1 in cucumber calli was up-regulated by exogenous trehalose treatment, confirming that the SnRK1 activity and CsAGA1 expression can be regulated by T6P levels. Our results suggest that the T6P- and SnRK1-mediated signaling functions are involved in the regulation of first-fruit inhibition in cucumber plants.
