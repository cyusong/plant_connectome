['28096354', 'Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)  proteins are key players in cellular trafficking and coordinate vital cellular  processes, such as cytokinesis, pathogen defense, and ion transport regulation.  With few exceptions, SNAREs are tail-anchored (TA) proteins, bearing a C-terminal  hydrophobic domain that is essential for their membrane integration. Recently,  the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway was described in  mammalian and yeast cells that serve as a blueprint of TA protein insertion  [Schuldiner M, et al. (2008) Cell 134(4):634-645; Stefanovic S, Hegde RS (2007)  Cell 128(6):1147-1159]. This pathway consists of six proteins, with the cytosolic  ATPase GET3 chaperoning the newly synthesized TA protein posttranslationally from  the ribosome to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Structural and  biochemical insights confirmed the potential of pathway components to facilitate  membrane insertion, but the physiological significance in multicellular organisms  remains to be resolved. Our phylogenetic analysis of 37 GET3 orthologs from 18  different species revealed the presence of two different GET3 clades. We  identified and analyzed GET pathway components in Arabidopsis thaliana and found  reduced root hair elongation in Atget lines, possibly as a result of reduced  SNARE biogenesis. Overexpression of AtGET3a in a receptor knockout (KO) results  in severe growth defects, suggesting presence of alternative insertion pathways  while highlighting an intricate involvement for the GET pathway in cellular  homeostasis of plants.', '2017 Feb 21', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1619525114', 'ORCID:']
