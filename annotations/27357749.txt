['27357749', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that mediates abiotic stress tolerance and  regulates growth and development. ABA binds to members of the PYL/RCAR ABA  receptor family that initiate signal transduction inhibiting type 2C protein  phosphatases. Although crosstalk between ABA and the hormone Jasmonic Acid (JA)  has been shown, the molecular entities that mediate this interaction have yet to  be fully elucidated. We report a link between ABA and JA signaling through a  direct interaction of the ABA receptor PYL6 (RCAR9) with the basic  helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2. PYL6 and MYC2 interact in yeast two  hybrid assays and the interaction is enhanced in the presence of ABA. PYL6 and  MYC2 interact in planta based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation and  co-immunoprecipitation of the proteins. Furthermore, PYL6 was able to modify  transcription driven by MYC2 using JAZ6 and JAZ8 DNA promoter elements in yeast  one hybrid assays. Finally, pyl6 T-DNA mutant plants show an increased  sensitivity to the addition of JA along with ABA in cotyledon expansion  experiments. Overall, the present study identifies a direct mechanism for  transcriptional modulation mediated by an ABA receptor different from the core  ABA signaling pathway, and a putative mechanistic link connecting ABA and JA  signaling pathways.', '2016 Jun 30', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep28941', 'Schroeder']
