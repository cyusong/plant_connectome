Although SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes are known to regulate diverse biological functions in plants, the classification, compositions and functional mechanisms of the complexes remain to be determined. Here we comprehensively characterized SWI/SNF complexes by affinity purification and mass spectrometry in Arabidopsis thaliana, and found three classes of SWI/SNF complexes, which we termed BAS, SAS and MAS (BRM-, SYD- and MINU1/2-associated SWI/SNF complexes). By investigating multiple developmental phenotypes of SWI/SNF mutants, we found that three classes of SWI/SNF complexes have both overlapping and specific functions in regulating development. To investigate how the three classes of SWI/SNF complexes differentially regulate development, we mapped different SWI/SNF components on chromatin at the whole-genome level and determined their effects on chromatin accessibility. While all three classes of SWI/SNF complexes regulate chromatin accessibility at proximal promoter regions, SAS is a major SWI/SNF complex that is responsible for mediating chromatin accessibility at distal promoter regions and intergenic regions. Histone modifications are related to both the association of SWI/SNF complexes with chromatin and the SWI/SNF-dependent chromatin accessibility. Three classes of SWI/SNF-dependent accessibility may enable different sets of transcription factors to access chromatin. These findings lay a foundation for further investigation of the function of three classes of SWI/SNF complexes in plants.
