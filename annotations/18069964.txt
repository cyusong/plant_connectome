Vertical conduit tapering is proposed as an effective mechanism to almost eliminate the increase in hydraulic resistance with increased height. Despite this potential role, very little is known about its changes during ontogeny. Here, conduit tapering and stem morphology of young/small and old/tall individuals of Acer pseudoplatanus in the field, as well as 3-yr-old grafted trees from both age classes, were analysed. The distribution of hydraulic resistance along stems was also determined in a subsample of trees. Substantial conduit tapering was found in small trees (field-grown and grafted from both age classes), whereas values were lower in tall trees, indicating that tapering was a size-related, not an age-related process. Apical conduit diameters were larger in tall trees and were inversely correlated with the degree of tapering. Hydraulic resistance increased less than linearly with distance from the apex. Its scaling against distance was indistinguishable from that predicted from anatomical measurements. Conduit tapering was an effective but partial mechanism of compensation for the increase in hydraulic resistance with tree height. Size-related changes in tapering and in apical conduit diameters may be explained by the combined need to reduce the build-up of hydraulic resistance while minimizing the carbon costs of building vessel walls.
