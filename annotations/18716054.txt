['18716054', "CLASP proteins associate with either the plus ends or sidewalls of microtubules  depending on the subcellular location and cell type. In plant cells, CLASP's  distribution along the full length of microtubules corresponds with the uniform  anchorage of microtubules to the cell cortex. Using live cell imaging, we show  here that loss of CLASP in Arabidopsis thaliana results in partial detachment of  microtubules from the cortex. The detached portions undergo extensive waving,  distortion, and changes in orientation, particularly when exposed to the forces  of cytoplasmic streaming. These deviations from the normal linear polymerization  trajectories increase the likelihood of intermicrotubule encounters that are  favorable for subsequent bundle formation. Consistent with this, cortical  microtubules in clasp-1 leaf epidermal cells are hyper-parallel. On the basis of  these data, we identify a novel mechanism where modulation of CLASP activity  governs microtubule-cortex attachment, thereby contributing to self-organization  of cortical microtubules.", '2008 Nov', 'Mol Biol Cell', '10.1091/mbc.e08-06-0665', 'Wasteneys']
