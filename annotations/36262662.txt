Dehydration tolerance is a vital factor for land plant evolution and world agricultural production. Numerous studies enlightened that the plant-specific C2H2-type zinc-finger proteins (C2H2-ZFPs) as master regulators played pivotal roles in the abiotic stress responses of plants. However, a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of C2H2-ZFPs in terrestrial plants and its regulatory mechanism in dehydration and rehydration response remains a mystery. In this study, the genome-wide identification of C2H2-ZFP genes revealed 549 homologs in the representatives of terrestrial plant lineages from liverwort to angiosperms. Based on the characteristics of the conserved C2H2-ZF domains, four major C2H2-ZF types (M-, Z-, Q-, and D-type) were identified in the C2H2-ZFPs, with the dominants of M-type in all selected species and followed by Z-type in non-seed plants and Q-type in seed plants, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of the identified C2H2-ZFPs supported four major groups in the land plant representatives, among which the members from the desiccation-tolerant <i>Physcomitrium patens</i> and the dehydration-sensitive <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> displayed different topological relationships in the phylogenies reconstructed for a single species. C2H2-ZFPs clustered in the same subclades shared similar features in their conserved domains and gene structures. Approximately, 81% of the <i>C2H2-ZFP</i> promoters of all 549 identified C2H2-ZFPs harbored the conserved ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) and/or dehydration-responsive elements (DREs). Comparative transcriptomic analyses showed that 50 <i>PpZFPs</i> and 56 <i>AtZFPs</i> significantly changed their transcripts abundance. Interestingly, most of the dehydration- and rehydration-responsive <i>PpZPFs</i> and <i>AtZFPs</i> had been predicted to contain the ABRE and DRE elements in their promoter regions and with over half of which phylogenetically belonging to group III. The differences in the expression patterns of <i>C2H2-ZFPs</i> in responses to dehydration and rehydration between <i>P. patens</i> and <i>A. thaliana</i> reflected their different strategies to adapt to dehydration. The identified candidate <i>PpZFPs</i> were specifically induced by moderate dehydration and reached the peak transcript abundance in severe dehydration. Our study lays the foundations for further functional investigation of C2H2-ZFPs in dehydration responses from an evolutionary perspective in land plants. The findings will provide us with genetic resources and potential targets for drought tolerance breeding in crops and beyond.
