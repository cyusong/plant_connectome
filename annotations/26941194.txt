['26941194', 'Photosynthetic organisms have the ability to adapt to changes in light quality by  readjusting the cross sections of the light-harvesting systems of photosystem II  (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI). This process, called state transitions, maintains  the redox poise of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and ensures a high  photosynthetic yield when light is limiting. It is mediated by the Stt7/STN7  protein kinase, which is activated through the cytochrome b6f complex upon  reduction of the plastoquinone pool. Its probable major substrate, the  light-harvesting complex of PSII, once phosphorylated, dissociates from PSII and  docks to PSI, thereby restoring the balance of absorbed light excitation energy  between the two photosystems. Although the kinase is known to be inactivated  under high-light intensities, the molecular mechanisms governing its regulation  remain unknown. In this study we monitored the redox state of a conserved and  essential Cys pair of the Stt7/STN7 kinase and show that it forms a disulfide  bridge. We could not detect any change in the redox state of these Cys during  state transitions and high-light treatment. It is only after prolonged  anaerobiosis that this disulfide bridge is reduced. It is likely to be mainly  intramolecular, although kinase activation may involve a transient covalently  linked kinase dimer with two intermolecular disulfide bonds. Using the yeast  two-hybrid system, we have mapped one interaction site of the kinase on the  Rieske protein of the cytochrome b6f complex.', '2016 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01893', 'ORCID:']
