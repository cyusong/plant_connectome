['19995721', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) are important plant hormones that act synergistically with  auxin to regulate a variety of plant developmental and physiological processes.  In the past decade, genetic and biochemical studies have revealed a linear  signaling pathway that relies on protein phosphorylation to transmit the BR  signal into the nucleus, altering expression of hundreds of genes to promote  plant growth. We conducted an activation-tagging based suppressor screen to look  for Arabidopsis genes that, when overexpressed by inserted 35S enhancer elements,  could suppress the dwarf phenotype of a weak BR receptor mutant bri1-301. This  screen identified a total of six dominant activation-tagged bri1 suppressors  (atbs-Ds). Using a plasmid rescue approach, we discovered that the bri1-301  suppression effect in four atbs-D mutants (atbs3-D to atbs6-D) was caused by  overexpression of a YUCCA gene thought to be involved in tryptophan-dependent  auxin biosynthesis. Interestingly, the three activation-tagged YUCCA genes belong  to the YUCCA IIA subfamily that includes two other members out of 11 known  Arabidopsis YUCCA genes. In addition, our molecular studies revealed a T-DNA  insertion near a basic helix-loop-helix gene in atbs1-D and a T-DNA insertion in  a region carrying a BR biosynthetic gene in atbs2-D. Further studies of these  atbs-D mutants could lead to better understanding of the BR signaling process and  the BR-auxin interaction.', '2010 Jan', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssp099', 'Li']
