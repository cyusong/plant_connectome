In a continuously changing and challenging environment, passing down the memory of encountered stress factors to offspring could provide an evolutionary advantage. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of 'intergenerational acquired resistance' in the progeny of rice (Oryza sativa) plants attacked by the belowground parasitic nematode Meloidogyne graminicola. Transcriptome analyses revealed that genes involved in defense pathways are generally downregulated in progeny of nematode-infected plants under uninfected conditions but show a stronger induction upon nematode infection. This phenomenon was termed "spring loading" and depends on initial downregulation by the 24nt siRNA biogenesis gene dicer-like 3a (dcl3a) involved in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Knock-down of dcl3a led to increased nematode susceptibility and abolished intergenerational acquired resistance, as well as jasmonic acid/ethylene spring loading in the offspring of infected plants. The importance of ethylene signaling in intergenerational resistance was confirmed by experiments on a knock-down line of ethylene insensitive 2 (ein2b), which lacks intergenerational acquired resistance. Taken together, these data indicate a role for DCL3a in regulating plant defense pathways during both within-generation and intergenerational resistance against nematodes in rice.
