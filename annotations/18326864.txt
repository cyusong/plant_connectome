Cereal lip19 genes encoding bZIP-type transcription factors are assumed to play a regulatory role in gene expression during the cold acclimation process. However, no direct evidence shows an association of LIP19-type bZIPs with stress tolerance or activation of stress-responsive Cor/Lea genes. To understand the molecular basis of development of abiotic stress tolerance through the LIP19 transcription factor, a wheat lip19 homologue, Wlip19, was isolated and characterized. Wlip19 expression was activated by low temperature in seedlings and was higher in a freezing-tolerant cultivar than in a freezing-sensitive one. Wlip19 also responded to drought and exogenous ABA treatment. Wlip19-expressing transgenic tobacco showed a significant increase in abiotic stress tolerance, especially freezing tolerance. Expression of a GUS reporter gene under the control of promoter sequences of four wheat Cor/Lea genes, Wdhn13, Wrab17, Wrab18, and Wrab19, was enhanced by Wlip19 expression in wheat callus and tobacco plants. These results indicate that WLIP19 acts as a transcriptional regulator of Cor/Lea genes in the development of abiotic stress tolerance. Moreover, direct protein-protein interaction between WLIP19 and a wheat OBF1 homologue TaOBF1, another bZIP-type transcription factor, was observed, suggesting that this interaction is conserved in cereals.
