['15525647', 'Plant growth and development are sensitive to light. Light-responsive DNA-binding  transcription factors have been functionally identified. However, how  transcription initiation complex integrates light signals from enhancer-bound  transcription factors remains unknown. In this work, we characterized mutations  within the Arabidopsis HAF2 gene encoding TATA-binding protein-associated factor  TAF1 (or TAF(II)250). The mutation of HAF2 induced decreases on chlorophyll  accumulation, light-induced mRNA levels, and promoter activity. Genetic analysis  indicated that HAF2 is involved in the pathways of both red/far-red and blue  light signals. Double mutants between haf2-1 and hy5-1, a mutation of a light  signaling positive DNA-binding transcription factor gene, had a synergistic  effect on photomorphogenic traits and light-activated gene expression under  different light wavelengths, suggesting that HAF2 is required for interaction  with additional light-responsive DNA-binding transcription factors to fully  respond to light induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the  mutation of HAF2 reduced acetylation of histone H3 in light-responsive promoters.  In addition, transcriptome analysis showed that the mutation altered the  expression of about 9% of genes in young leaves. These data indicate that TAF1  encoded by the Arabidopsis HAF2 gene functions as a coactivator capable of  integrating light signals and acetylating histones to activate light-induced gene  transcription.', '2005 Jan 14', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M409000200', 'Zhou']
