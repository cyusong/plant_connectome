Ascorbate oxidase (AO) plays important roles in plant growth and development. Previously, we reported a cotton <i>AO</i> gene that acts as a positive factor in cell growth. Investigations on <i>Gossypium hirsutum AO</i> (<i>GhAO</i>) family genes and their multiple functions are limited. The present study identified eight <i>GhAO</i> family genes and performed bioinformatic analyses. Expression analyses of the tissue specificity and developmental feature of <i>GhAO</i>s displayed their diverse expression patterns. Interestingly, <i>GhAO1A</i> demonstrated the most rapid significant increase in expression after 1 h of light recovery from the dark. Additionally, the transgenic <i>ao1-1</i>/<i>GhAO1A</i> <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines overexpressing <i>GhAO1A</i> in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>ao1-1</i> late-flowering mutant displayed a recovery to the normal phenotype of wild-type plants. Moreover, compared to the <i>ao1-1</i> mutant, the <i>ao1-1</i>/<i>GhAO1A</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> presented delayed leaf senescence that was induced by the dark, indicating increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) under normal conditions that might be caused by a reduction in ascorbic acid (AsA) and ascorbic acid/dehydroascorbate (AsA/DHA) ratio. The results suggested that <i>GhAOs</i> are functionally diverse in plant development and play a critical role in light responsiveness. Our study serves as a foundation for understanding the <i>AO</i> gene family in cotton and elucidating the regulatory mechanism of <i>GhAO1A</i> in delaying dark-induced leaf senescence.
