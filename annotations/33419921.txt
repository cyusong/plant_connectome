Terrestrial ecosystems are increasingly enriched with resources such as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> that limit ecosystem processes. The consequences for ecosystem carbon cycling depend on the feedbacks from other limiting resources and plant community change, which remain poorly understood for soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux, J<sub>CO2</sub>, a primary carbon flux from the biosphere to the atmosphere. We applied a unique CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment gradient (250 to 500 µL L<sup>-1</sup>) for eight years to grassland plant communities on soils from different landscape positions. We identified the trajectory of J<sub>CO2</sub> responses and feedbacks from other resources, plant diversity [effective species richness, exp(H)], and community change (plant species turnover). We found linear increases in J<sub>CO2</sub> on an alluvial sandy loam and a lowland clay soil, and an asymptotic increase on an upland silty clay soil. Structural equation modeling identified CO<sub>2</sub> as the dominant limitation on J<sub>CO2</sub> on the clay soil. In contrast with theory predicting limitation from a single limiting factor, the linear J<sub>CO2</sub> response on the sandy loam was reinforced by positive feedbacks from aboveground net primary productivity and exp(H), while the asymptotic J<sub>CO2</sub> response on the silty clay arose from a net negative feedback among exp(H), species turnover, and soil water potential. These findings support a multiple resource limitation view of the effects of global change drivers on grassland ecosystem carbon cycling and highlight a crucial role for positive or negative feedbacks between limiting resources and plant community structure. Incorporating these feedbacks will improve models of terrestrial carbon sequestration and ecosystem services.
