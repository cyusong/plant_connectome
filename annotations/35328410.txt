Laxogenin C (LGC) is a natural spirostanol deriving from plant hormone which has shown growing regulation similar to those of brassinosteroids. In the present study, LGC showed a promoting effect on tomato seed germination and seedling growth in a dose-dependent manner. We applied LC-MS/MS to investigate metabolome variations in the tomato treated with LGC, which revealed 10 differential metabolites (DMs) related to KEGG metabolites, associated with low and high doses of LGC. Enrichment and pathway mapping based on the KEGG database indicated that LGC regulated expressions of 2-hydroxycinnamic acid and l-phenylalanine to interfere with phenylalanine metabolism and phenylpropanoids biosynthesis. The two pathways are closely related to plant growth and lignin formation. In our further phenotypic verification, LGC was confirmed to affect seedling lignification and related phenylpropanoids, trans-ferulic acid and l-phenylalanine levels. These findings provided a metabolomic aspect on the plant hormone derivates and revealed the affected metabolites. Elucidating their regulation mechanisms can contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture. Further studies on agrichemical development would provide eco-friendly and efficient regulators for plant growth control and quality improvement.
