['19363093', 'In open places, plants are exposed to higher fluence rates of photosynthetically  active radiation and to higher red to far-red ratios than under the shade of  neighbor plants. High fluence rates are known to increase stomata density. Here  we show that high, compared to low, red to far-red ratios also increase stomata  density in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). High red to far-red ratios  increase the proportion of phytochrome B (phyB) in its active form and the phyB  mutant exhibited a constitutively low stomata density. phyB increased the stomata  index (the ratio between stomata and epidermal cells number) and the level of  anphistomy (by increasing stomata density more intensively in the adaxial than in  the abaxial face). phyB promoted the expression of FAMA and TOO MANY MOUTHS genes  involved in the regulation of stomata development in young leaves. Increased  stomata density resulted in increased transpiration per unit leaf area. However,  phyB promoted photosynthesis rates only at high fluence rates of  photosynthetically active radiation. In accordance to these observations, phyB  reduced long-term water-use efficiency estimated by the analysis of isotopic  discrimination against (13)CO(2). We propose a model where active phyB promotes  stomata differentiation in open places, allowing plants to take advantage of the  higher irradiances at the expense of a reduction of water-use efficiency, which  is compensated by a reduced leaf area.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.135509', 'Casal']
