In this paper, we discuss biological potassium acquisition and utilization processes over an evolutionary timescale, with emphasis on modern vascular plants. The quintessential osmotic and electrical functions of the K<sup>+</sup> ion are shown to be intimately tied to K<sup>+</sup>-transport systems and membrane energization. Several prominent themes in plant K<sup>+</sup>-transport physiology are explored in greater detail, including: (1) channel mediated K<sup>+</sup> acquisition by roots at low external [K<sup>+</sup>]; (2) K<sup>+</sup> loading of root xylem elements by active transport; (3) variations on the theme of K<sup>+</sup> efflux from root cells to the extracellular environment; (4) the veracity and utility of the "affinity" concept in relation to transport systems. We close with a discussion of the importance of plant-potassium relations to our human world, and current trends in potassium nutrition from farm to table.
