Soil contamination by heavy metals and metalloids such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) poses a major threat to the environment and to human health. Vacuolar sequestration is one of the main mechanisms by which plants control toxic materials including Cd and As. Understanding the mechanisms of heavy metal tolerance and accumulation can be useful for both phytoremediation and safe crop development. In this review, we summarize recent advances in deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying vacuolar sequestration of Cd and As, and discuss potential biotechnological applications of this knowledge and efforts towards attaining these goals.
