['15833920', 'SNF2 chromatin-remodeling ATPases play an important role in ensuring proper  development in higher eukaryotes by controlling accessibility of cis-regulatory  DNA regions to transcription factors and to the transcriptional machinery.  However, the biological targets controlled by these ATPases are largely unknown.  Using genetic and molecular analyses we have identified WUSCHEL (WUS) as a  biologically important target of the SNF2-class ATPase SPLAYED (SYD) in the shoot  apical meristem of Arabidopsis. We present evidence that SYD is recruited to the  WUS promoter and that it is involved in regulation of the stem cell pool  maintenance via direct transcriptional control of this master regulator.', '2005 Apr 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1276305', 'Wagner']
