It is documented that some plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) enhance plant salt tolerance. However, as to how PGPR may influence two crucial components of plant salt tolerance such as, root hydraulic characteristics and aquaporin regulation has been almost unexplored. Here, maize (Zea mays L.) plants were inoculated with a Bacillus megaterium strain previously isolated from a degraded soil and characterized as PGPR. Inoculated plants were found to exhibit higher root hydraulic conductance (L) values under both unstressed and salt-stressed conditions. These higher L values in inoculated plants correlated with higher plasma membrane type two (PIP2) aquaporin amount in their roots under salt-stressed conditions. Also, ZmPIP1;1 protein amount under salt-stressed conditions was higher in inoculated leaves than in non-inoculated ones. Hence, the different regulation of PIP aquaporin expression and abundance by the inoculation with the B. megaterium strain could be one of the causes of the different salt response in terms of root growth, necrotic leaf area, leaf relative water content and L by the inoculation treatment.

B. megaterium: !enhances! Plant salt tolerance
B. megaterium: !increases! Root hydraulic conductance
PIP2 aquaporin: !increases! In inoculated roots under salt-stressed conditions
ZmPIP1;1 protein: !increases! In inoculated leaves under salt-stressed conditions
