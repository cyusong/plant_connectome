The extent to which ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi decay soil organic matter (SOM) has implications for accurately predicting forest ecosystem response to climate change. Investigating the distribution of gene traits associated with SOM decay among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities could improve understanding of SOM dynamics and plant nutrition. We hypothesized that soil inorganic nitrogen (N) availability structures the distribution of ECM fungal genes associated with SOM decay and, specifically, that ECM fungal communities occurring in inorganic N-poor soils have greater SOM decay potential. To test this hypothesis, we paired amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 60 ECM fungal communities associating with Quercus rubra along a natural soil inorganic N gradient. Ectomycorrhizal fungal communities occurring in low inorganic N soils were enriched in gene families involved in the decay of lignin, cellulose, and chitin. Ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition was the strongest driver of shifts in metagenomic estimates of fungal decay potential. Our study simultaneously illuminates the identity of key ECM fungal taxa and gene families potentially involved in the decay of SOM, and we link rhizomorphic and medium-distance hyphal morphologies with enhanced SOM decay potential. Coupled shifts in ECM fungal community composition and community-level decay gene frequencies are consistent with outcomes of trait-mediated community assembly processes.
