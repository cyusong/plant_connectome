Disruption of the Arabidopsis thaliana ACAULIS5 (ACL5) gene, which has recently been shown to encode thermospermine synthase, results in a severe dwarf phenotype. A previous study showed that sac51-d, a dominant suppressor mutant of acl5-1, has a premature termination codon in an upstream open reading frame (ORF) of SAC51, which encodes a putative transcription factor, and suggested the involvement of upstream ORF-mediated translational control in ACL5-dependent stem elongation. Here we report the identification of a gene responsible for sac52-d, another semi-dominant suppressor mutant of acl5-1. SAC52 encodes ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10A), which is highly conserved among eukaryotes and implicated in translational regulation. Transformation of acl5-1 mutants with a genomic fragment containing the sac52-d allele rescued the dwarf phenotype of acl5-1. GUS reporter activity under the control of a SAC51 promoter with its upstream ORF was higher in acl5-1 sac52-d than in acl5-1, suggesting that suppression of the acl5-1 phenotype by sac52-d is attributable, in part, to enhanced translation of certain transcripts including SAC51. We also found that a T-DNA insertion allele of SAC52/RPL10A causes lethality in the female gametophyte.
