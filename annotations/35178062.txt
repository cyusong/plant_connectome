The "Spring-red-leaf" crabapple cultivar has young red leaves and mature green leaves. However, the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in crabapple leaves in spring remains unknown. In this study, Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on <i>Malus</i> 'Radiant' leaf tissues in different stages of development. Twenty-two genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and 44 MYB transcription factors (TFs) were significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Three R2R3-MYB TFs in subgroup 22 of the MYB TF family, <i>MrMYB44-like1</i>, <i>MrMYB44-like2</i>, and <i>MrMYB44-like3</i>, were highly expressed in green leaves according to RNA-Seq and quantitative real-time quantitative PCR results. Their expression levels were negatively correlated with anthocyanin content. In transient assays, overexpression of <i>MrMYB44-like1</i>, <i>MrMYB44-like2</i>, or <i>MrMYB44-like3</i> inhibited anthocyanin accumulation and reduced pigment in leaf disks of <i>M</i>. 'Radiant' and fruit peels of <i>M. domestica</i> 'Fuji.' When the conserved region of the three <i>MrMYB44-like</i>s was silenced, the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was activated and pigments increased in both tissues. Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed <i>MrMYB44-like</i>s interacted with <i>MrWRKY6</i> to form protein complexes that regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis.
