Plant cuticles are lipid membranes with separate diffusion paths for lipophilic non-electrolytes and hydrated ionic compounds. Ions are lipid insoluble and require an aqueous pathway across cuticles. Based on experimental data, the aqueous pathway in cuticles has been characterized. Aqueous pores arise by hydration of permanent dipoles and ionic functional groups. They can be localized using ionic fluorescent dyes, silver nitrate, and mercuric chloride. Aqueous pores preferentially occur in cuticular ledges, at the base of trichomes, and in cuticles over anticlinal walls. Average pore radii ranged from 0.45 to 1.18 nm. Penetration of ions was a first order process as the fraction of the salt remaining on the cuticle surface decreased exponentially with time. Permeability of cuticles to ions depended on humidity and was highest at 100% humidity. Wetting agents increased rate constants by factors of up to 12, which indicates that the pore openings are surrounded by waxes. The pores in cuticular ledges of Helxine soleirolii allowed passage of berberine sulphate, which has a molecular weight of 769 g mol(-1). Increasing the molecular weight of solutes from 100 to 500 g mol(-1) decreased the rate constants of penetration by factors of 7 (Vicia faba) and 13 (Populus canescens), respectively. Half-times of penetration of inorganic salts and organic ions across Populus cuticles and Vicia leaf surfaces varied between 1 and 12 h. This shows that penetration of ionic compounds can be fairly rapid, and ions with molecular weights of up to 800 g mol(-1) can penetrate cuticles that possess aqueous pores.
