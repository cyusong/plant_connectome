Drought is a global threat that affects agricultural production. Plants have evolved several adaptive strategies to cope with drought. Stomata are essential structures for plants to control water status and photosynthesis rate. Stomatal closure is an efficient way for plants to reduce water loss and improve survivability under drought conditions. The opening and closure of stomata depend on the turgor pressure in guard cells. Three key signaling molecules, including abscisic acid (ABA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), play pivotal roles in controlling stomatal closure. Plants sense the water-deficit signal mainly via leaves and roots. On the one hand, ABA is actively synthesized in root and leaf vascular tissues and transported to guard cells. On the other hand, the roots sense the water-deficit signal and synthesize CLAVATA3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION RELATED 25 (CLE25) peptide, which is transported to the guard cells to promote ABA synthesis. ABA is perceived by pyrabactin resistance (PYR)/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory components of ABA receptor (RCAR) receptors, which inactivate PP2C, resulting in activating the protein kinases SnRK2s. Many proteins regulating stomatal closure are activated by SnRK2s via protein phosphorylation. ABA-activated SnRK2s promote apoplastic ROS production outside of guard cells and transportation into the guard cells. The apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be directly sensed by a receptor kinase, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INDUCED CA<sup>2+</sup> INCREASES1 (HPCA1), which induces activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the cytomembrane of guard cells, and triggers an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cytoplasm of guard cells, resulting in stomatal closure. In this review, we focused on discussing the signaling transduction of ABA, ROS, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in controlling stomatal closure in response to drought. Many critical genes are identified to have a function in stomatal closure under drought conditions. The identified genes in the process can serve as candidate genes for genetic engineering to improve drought resistance in crops. The review summarizes the recent advances and provides new insights into the signaling regulation of stomatal closure in response to water-deficit stress and new clues on the improvement of drought resistance in crops.
