Quantitative disease resistance (QDR) is a conserved form of plant immunity that limits infections caused by a broad range of pathogens. QDR has a complex genetic determinism. The extent to which molecular components of the QDR response vary across plant species remains elusive. The fungal pathogen <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, causal agent of white mold diseases on hundreds of plant species, triggers QDR in host populations. To document the diversity of local responses to <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> at the molecular level, we analyzed the complete transcriptomes of six species spanning the Pentapetalae (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>, <i>Ricinus communis</i>, Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], <i>Helianthus annuus</i>, <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, and <i>Beta vulgaris</i>) inoculated with the same strain of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> About one-third of plant transcriptomes responded locally to <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>, including a high proportion of broadly conserved genes showing frequent regulatory divergence at the interspecific level. Evolutionary inferences suggested a trend toward the acquisition of gene induction relatively recently in several lineages. Focusing on a group of ABCG transporters, we propose that exaptation by regulatory divergence contributed to the evolution of QDR. This evolutionary scenario has implications for understanding the QDR spectrum and durability. Our work provides resources for functional studies of gene regulation and QDR molecular mechanisms across the Pentapetalae.
