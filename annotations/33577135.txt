Cytosolic calcium signals are evoked by a large variety of biotic and abiotic stimuli and play an important role in cellular and long distance signalling in plants. While the function of the plasma membrane in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling has been intensively studied, the role of the vacuolar membrane remains elusive. A newly developed vacuolar voltage clamp technique was used in combination with live-cell imaging, to study the role of the vacuolar membrane in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH homeostasis of bulging root hair cells of Arabidopsis. Depolarisation of the vacuolar membrane caused a rapid increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and alkalised the cytosol, while hyperpolarisation led to the opposite responses. The relationship between the vacuolar membrane potential, the cytosolic pH and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration suggests that a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> /Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange mechanism plays a central role in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Mathematical modelling further suggests that the voltage-dependent vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostat could contribute to calcium signalling when coupled to a recently discovered K<sup>+</sup> channel-dependent module for electrical excitability of the vacuolar membrane.
