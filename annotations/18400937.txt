An Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant that exhibited a delayed greening phenotype (dg1) was isolated from a population of activation-tagged Arabidopsis lines. Young, inner leaves of dg1 mutants were initially very pale, but gradually greened and mature outer leaves, more than 3 weeks old, appeared similar to those of wild-type plants. Sequence and transcription analyses showed that DG1 encodes a chloroplast protein consisting of eight pentratricopeptide repeat domains and that its expression depends on both light and developmental status. In addition, analysis of the transcript profiles of chloroplast genes revealed that plastid-encoded polymerase-dependent transcript levels were markedly reduced, while nucleus-encoded polymerase-dependent transcript levels were increased, in dg1 mutants. Thus, DG1 is probably involved in the regulation of plastid-encoded polymerase-dependent chloroplast gene expression during early stages of chloroplast development.
