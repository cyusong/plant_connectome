We investigated the production and function of nitric oxide (NO) in Arabidopsis thaliana leaf discs as well as whole plants elicited by oligogalacturonides (OGs). Using genetic, biochemical and pharmacological approaches, we provided evidence that OGs induced a Nitrate Reductase (NR)-dependent NO production together with an increased NR activity and NR transcripts accumulation. In addition, NO production was sensitive to the mammalian NOS inhibitor L-NAME. Intriguingly, L-NAME impaired OG-induced NR activity and did not further affect the remaining OG-induced NO production in the nia1nia2 mutant. These data suggest that the L-arginine and NR pathways, co-involved in NO production, do not work independently. Taking account these new data, we propose scenarios to explain NO production in response to biotic stress.

OGs: !induce! NR activity 
OGs: !induce! NR transcripts accumulation 
L-NAME: !impairs! OG-induced NR activity 
L-NAME: !does not affect! OG-induced NO production in nia1nia2 mutant
