Originally identified as allelochemicals involved in plant-parasite interactions, more recently, Strigolactones (SLs) have been shown to play multiple key roles in the rhizosphere communication between plants and mycorrhizal fungi. Even more recent is the hormonal role ascribed to SLs which broadens the biological impact of these relatively simple molecules. In spite of the crucial and multifaceted biological role of SLs, there are no data on the receptor(s) which bind(s) such active molecules, neither in the producing plants nor in parasitic weeds or AM fungi. Information about the putative receptor of SLs can be gathered by means of structural, molecular, and genetic approaches. Our contribution on this topic is the design and synthesis of fluorescent labeled SL analogs to be used as probes for the detection in vivo of the receptor(s). Knowledge of the putative receptor structure will boost the research on analogs of the natural substrates as required for agricultural applications.
