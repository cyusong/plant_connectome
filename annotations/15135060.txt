['15135060', "An Arabidopsis cDNA coding for a previously uncharacterized isoform of inorganic  pyrophosphatase was isolated. It was used to complement an E. coli mutant,  demonstrating that it coded for an active enzyme. MgCl(2) was necessary for the  protein's activity, whilst NaF inhibited it. The K(m) for pyrophosphate and the  pH optimum of the protein was determined. The gene coding for this protein was  expressed in all tissues, and its expression in rosette leaves was induced by  incubation on metabolizable sugars. In vitro import experiments demonstrated that  the protein could be imported into chloroplasts and localized to the stromal  compartment.", '2004 May 7', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2004.03.080', 'Lloyd']
