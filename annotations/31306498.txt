To protect above-ground plant organs from excessive water loss, their surfaces are coated by waxes. The genes involved in wax formation have been investigated in detail in Arabidopsis but scarcely in crop species. Here, we aimed to isolate and characterize a CER1 enzyme responsible for formation of the very long-chain alkanes present in high concentrations especially during late stages of wheat development. On the basis of comparative wax and transcriptome analyses of various wheat organs, we selected TaCER1-1A as a primary candidate and demonstrated that it was located to the endoplasmic reticulum, the subcellular compartment for wax biosynthesis. A wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic substitution line lacking TaCER1-1A had significantly reduced amounts of C<sub>33</sub> alkane, whereas rice plants overexpressing TaCER1-1A showed substantial increases of C<sub>25</sub> -C<sub>33</sub> alkanes relative to wild type control. Similarly, heterologous expression of TaCER1-1A in Arabidopsis wild type and the cer1 mutant resulted in increased levels of unbranched alkanes, iso-branched alkanes and alkenes. Finally, the expression of TaCER1-1A was found activated by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid treatment, resulting in increased production of alkanes in wheat. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TaCER1-1A plays an important role in wheat wax alkane biosynthesis and involved in responding to drought and other environmental stresses.
