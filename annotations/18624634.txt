Aphids occupy a niche comprising two conceptual realms: a micron-scale feeding site beneath the plant surface, in which a syringe-like appendage mediates chemical exchange with a specific plant cell type; and the larger realm of a metazoan with sensory organs, a nervous system, and behavior, all responsive to the condition of the host plant and the broader environment. The biology that connects these realms is not well understood, but new details are emerging with the help of genomic tools. The power of these tools is set to increase substantially now that the first genome of an aphid is being sequenced and annotated. This has been possible because a community of aphid researchers focused their efforts to develop and share genomic resources through an international consortium. This complete genome sequence, along with other resources, should permit major advances in understanding the complex and peculiar biological traits responsible for aphids' evolutionary success and their damaging effects on agriculture. This review highlights early progress in the application of aphid genomics and identifies key issues of plant-aphid interactions likely to benefit as molecular tools are further developed. Use of this new knowledge could make significant contributions to crop protection against these and other phloem-feeding insects.
