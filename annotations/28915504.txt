Flavonoids are a ubiquitous multifunctional group of phenolics of paramount importance for the terrestrial plants involved in protection from biotic and abiotic stresses, color and chemical signaling and other functions. Deciphering of in situ absorption of foliar Flv is important but was thought to be impossible due to a strong overlap with other pigments, complex in situ chemistry of Flv and sophisticated leaf optics. We deduced in situ absorbance of foliar Flv and introduced a concept of specific absorbance spectrum indicative of each pigment group contribution to light absorption and provided a rationale for the choice of spectral bands for non-destructive assessment of Flv in leaves with variable content of other pigments including anthocyanins. Only a narrow band 400-430nm was suitable for Flv assessment, however the effect of other pigments remained substantial, so subtraction of their contribution was necessary. The devised leaf absorbance-based algorithm allowed estimating Flv with error below 21%. Absorption by Flv in plant tissues might extend into the blue and can be commensurate to that of chlorophylls and carotenoids. The potential capacity of Flv to shield the cell in situ from the visible light might be essential for assessments of high light stress tolerance of plants.
