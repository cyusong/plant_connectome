Preprophase bands are belts of cortical microtubules that appear at the end of interphase and predict where cell plates will fuse with parental walls during division. Phragmoplasts are microtubule-rich arrays that orchestrate the growth and guidance of cell plates during cytokinesis. Descriptions of the development of these arrays often assume non-polar formation, with preprophase bands developing more or less simultaneously around the cell circumference. Phragmoplasts are often described as initiating at the cell center and then expanding evenly outwards until fusion with parent cell walls. We analyzed the spatio-temporal development of both arrays because initial observations of array growth in the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis revealed directional variability. Almost all preprophase bands formed in a polar fashion, with initiation and maturation occurring first in the cell cortex near the inside of the leaf, and later in the outer cell cortex. A similar polarity developed in phragmoplasts and cell plates, raising the possibility that polarized division is common in plants. Together, these findings identify additional polar features of the epidermis, and thereby provide a visually accessible system for identifying new proteins and subcellular components involved in the development of cell division and the previously formed division site.
