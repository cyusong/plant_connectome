['23404890', 'The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) enzyme catalyzes the major  rate-limiting step of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway from which sterols and  other isoprenoids are synthesized. In contrast with our extensive knowledge of  the regulation of HMGR in yeast and animals, little is known about this process  in plants. To identify regulatory components of the MVA pathway in plants, we  performed a genetic screen for second-site suppressor mutations of the  Arabidopsis thaliana highly drought-sensitive drought hypersensitive2 (dry2)  mutant that shows decreased squalene epoxidase activity. We show that mutations  in SUPPRESSOR OF DRY2 DEFECTS1 (SUD1) gene recover most developmental defects in  dry2 through changes in HMGR activity. SUD1 encodes a putative E3 ubiquitin  ligase that shows sequence and structural similarity to yeast Degradation of alpha  factor (Doalpha10) and human TEB4, components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated  degradation C (ERAD-C) pathway. While in yeast and animals, the alternative  ERAD-L/ERAD-M pathway regulates HMGR activity by controlling protein stability,  SUD1 regulates HMGR activity without apparent changes in protein content. These  results highlight similarities, as well as important mechanistic differences,  among the components involved in HMGR regulation in plants, yeast, and animals.', '2013 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.108696', 'Botella']
