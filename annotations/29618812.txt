['29618812', 'Mammalian peptide hormones propagate extracellular stimuli from sensing tissues  to appropriate targets to achieve optimal growth maintenance (1) . In land  plants, root-to-shoot signalling is important to prevent water loss by  transpiration and to adapt to water-deficient conditions (2, 3) . The  phytohormone abscisic acid has a role in the regulation of stomatal movement to  prevent water loss (4) . However, no mobile signalling molecules have yet been  identified that can trigger abscisic acid accumulation in leaves. Here we show  that the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 25 (CLE25) peptide transmits  water-deficiency signals through vascular tissues in Arabidopsis, and affects  abscisic acid biosynthesis and stomatal control of transpiration in association  with BARELY ANY MERISTEM (BAM) receptors in leaves. The CLE25 gene is expressed  in vascular tissues and enhanced in roots in response to dehydration stress. The  root-derived CLE25 peptide moves from the roots to the leaves, where it induces  stomatal closure by modulating abscisic acid accumulation and thereby enhances  resistance to dehydration stress. BAM receptors are required for the CLE25  peptide-induced dehydration stress response in leaves, and the CLE25-BAM module  therefore probably functions as one of the signalling molecules for long-distance  signalling in the dehydration response.', '2018 Apr', 'Nature', '10.1038/s41586-018-0009-2', 'Shinozaki']
