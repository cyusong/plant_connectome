<i>Desmodium styracifolium</i> is a medicinal plant from the <i>Desmodieae</i> tribe, also known as <i>Grona styracifolia</i>. Its role in the treatment of urolithiasis, urinary infections, and cholelithiasis has previously been widely documented. The complete chloroplast genome sequence of <i>D. Styracifolium</i> is 149,155 bp in length with a GC content of 35.2%. It is composed of a large single copy (LSC) of 82,476 bp and a small single copy (SSC) of 18,439 bp, which are separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IR) of 24,120 bp each and has 128 genes. We performed a comparative analysis of the <i>D. styracifolium</i> cpDNA with the genome of previously investigated members of the <i>Sesamoidea</i> tribe and on the outgroup from its <i>Phaseolinae</i> sister tribe. The size of all seven cpDNAs ranged from 148,814 bp to 151,217 bp in length due to the contraction and expansion of the IR/SC boundaries. The gene orientation of the SSC region in <i>D. styracifolium</i> was inverted in comparison with the other six studied species. Furthermore, the sequence divergence of the IR regions was significantly lower than that of the LSC and the SSC, and five highly divergent regions, <i>trnL-UAA-trnT-UGU</i>, <i>psaJ-ycf4</i>, <i>psbE-petL</i>, <i>rpl36-rps8</i>, and <i>rpl32-trnL-UGA</i>, were identified that could be used as valuable molecular markers in future taxonomic studies and phylogenetic constructions.
