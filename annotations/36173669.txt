Regulating the central CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco is as complex as its ancient reaction mechanism and involves interaction with a series of cofactors and auxiliary proteins that activate catalytic sites and maintain activity. A key component among the regulatory mechanisms is the binding of sugar phosphate derivatives that inhibit activity. Removal of inhibitors via the action of Rubisco activase is required to restore catalytic competency. In addition, specific phosphatases dephosphorylate newly released inhibitors, rendering them incapable of binding to Rubisco catalytic sites. The best studied inhibitor is 2-carboxy-d-arabinitol 1-phosphate (CA1P), a naturally occurring nocturnal inhibitor that accumulates in most species during darkness and low light, progressively binding to Rubisco. As light increases, Rubisco activase removes CA1P from Rubisco, and the specific phosphatase CA1Pase dephosphorylates CA1P to CA, which cannot bind Rubisco. Misfire products of Rubisco's complex reaction chemistry can also act as inhibitors. One example is xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate (XuBP), which is dephosphorylated by XuBPase. Here we revisit key findings related to sugar phosphate derivatives and their specific phosphatases, highlighting outstanding questions and how further consideration of these inhibitors and their role is important for better understanding the regulation of carbon assimilation.
