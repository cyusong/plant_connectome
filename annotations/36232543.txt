<i>Santalum album</i> is a semi parasitic plant and its growth is often restricted due to a lack of a host or water during plantation establishment. In this study, the effects of water and the host on the growth of <i>S. album</i> seedlings were studied in pot culture. The results showed that the net photosynthetic rate and height of <i>S. album</i> seedlings decreased significantly under drought stress. Compared with the seedlings of <i>S. album</i> grown without a host, the host could significantly increase the growth of <i>S. album</i> seedlings. The contents of soluble sugar and proline in <i>S. album</i> leaves increased significantly under drought stress. Drought stress resulted in a significant accumulation of malondialdehyde, increments of antioxidant enzymes activity, and non-enzymatic antioxidant substances. Antioxidant capacity was stronger and malondialdehyde content was lower in the seedling leaves of <i>S. album</i> with a host than in the seedlings without a host. RNA-seq was used to analyze the transcription expression profiles of <i>S. album</i> leaves and the results were consistent with the physiological data. These results indicate that the host can promote the seedling growth of <i>S. album</i> and it can increase the antioxidant capacity and osmotic adjustment substance content of the seedlings of <i>S. album</i>, alleviating the damage caused by drought.
