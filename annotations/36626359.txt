Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of phytohormones regulating branching/tillering, and their biosynthesis has been associated with nutritional signals and plant adaptation to nutrient-limiting conditions. The enzymes in the SL biosynthetic pathway downstream of carlactone are of interest as they are responsible for structural diversity in SLs, particularly cytochrome P450 CYP711A subfamily members, such as MORE AXILLARY GROWTH1 (MAX1) in Arabidopsis. We identified 13 MAX1 homologues in wheat, clustering in four clades and five homoeologous subgroups. The utilization of RNA-sequencing data revealed a distinct expression pattern of MAX1 homologues in above- and below-ground tissues, providing insights into the distinct roles of MAX1 homologues in wheat. In addition, a transcriptional analysis showed that SL biosynthetic genes were systematically regulated by nitrogen supply. Nitrogen limitation led to larger transcriptional changes in the basal nodes than phosphorus limitation, which was consistent with the observed tillering suppression, as wheat showed higher sensitivity to nitrogen. The opposite was observed in roots, with phosphorus limitation leading to stronger induction of most SL biosynthetic genes compared with nitrogen limitation. The observed tissue-specific regulation of SL biosynthetic genes in response to nutritional signals is likely to reflect the dual role of SLs as rhizosphere signals and branching inhibitors.
