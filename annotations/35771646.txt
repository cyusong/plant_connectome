Land plant life cycles are separated into distinct haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte stages. Indeterminate apical growth evolved independently in bryophyte (moss, liverwort, and hornwort) and fern gametophytes, and tracheophyte (vascular plant) sporophytes. The extent to which apical growth in tracheophytes co-opted conserved gametophytic gene networks, or exploited ancestral sporophytic networks, is a long-standing question in plant evolution. The recent phylogenetic confirmation of bryophytes and tracheophytes as sister groups has led to a reassessment of the nature of the ancestral land plant. Here, we review developmental genetic studies of apical regulators and speculate on their likely evolutionary history.
