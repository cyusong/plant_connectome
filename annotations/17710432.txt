Gene expression in amyloplasts derived from potato tubers was analyzed at the levels of transcription, mRNA accumulation and formation of polysomes. Compared with chloroplasts, overall transcriptional activity is considerably reduced in amyloplasts. Nevertheless, several transcripts are synthesized in amyloplasts during growth of tubers. Among the transcribed amyloplast genes are the ribosomal operon and the psbA gene. Primer extension analysis provided evidence that in amyloplasts the plastid encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is the principal RNA polymerase involved in the transcription of the rrn operon. Analysis of plastid steady state transcripts showed that there are only small differences in the levels of specific transcripts between amyloplasts and chloroplasts. With respect to the low transcription rate of the accumulating RNA-species in amyloplasts, a high stability of these transcripts is obvious. Though amyloplasts possess polysomes, specific mRNAs associated with such polysomes could not be detected. This suggests that translation could be impaired in amyloplasts, which, in turn, implies that these organelles are not suitable targets for the expression of transgenes introduced into the plastid genome by plastid transformation.
