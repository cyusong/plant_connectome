The endosperm is a seed tissue unique to flowering plants. Due to its central role in nourishing and protecting the embryo, endosperm development is subject to parental conflicts and adaptive processes, which led to the evolution of parent-of-origin-dependent gene regulation. The role of higher-order chromatin organization in regulating the endosperm genome was long ignored due to technical hindrance. We developed a combination of approaches to analyze nuclear structure and chromatin organization in Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm. Endosperm nuclei showed a less condensed chromatin than other types of nuclei and a peculiar heterochromatin organization, with smaller chromocenters and additional heterochromatic foci interspersed in euchromatin. This is accompanied by a redistribution of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me1 from chromocenters toward euchromatin and interspersed heterochromatin. Thus, endosperm nuclei have a specific nuclear architecture and organization, which we interpret as a relaxed chromocenter-loop model. The analysis of endosperm with altered parental genome dosage indicated that the additional heterochromatin may be predominantly of maternal origin, suggesting differential regulation of maternal and paternal genomes, possibly linked to genome dosage regulation.
