Photosystem I (PSI) is a major player in the light reactions of photosynthesis. In higher plants, it consists of a core complex and four external antennae, Lhca1-4 forming the PSI-light-harvesting complex I (LHCI) supercomplex. The protein and pigment composition as well as the spectroscopic properties of this complex are considered to be identical in different higher plant species. In addition to the four Lhca, a pool of mobile LHCII increases the antenna size of PSI under most light conditions. In this work, we have first investigated purified PSI complexes and then PSI in vivo upon long-term dark-adaptation of four well-studied plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Nicotiana tabacum and Hordeum vulgare. By performing time-resolved fluorescence measurements, we show that LHCII is associated with PSI also in a dark-adapted state in all the plant species investigated. The number of LHCII subunits per PSI is plant-dependent, varying between one and three. Furthermore, we show that the spectroscopic properties of PSI-LHCI supercomplexes differ in different plants.
