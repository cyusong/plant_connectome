['21193572', 'The precise structure of the sporopollenin polymer that is the major constituent  of exine, the outer pollen wall, remains poorly understood. Recently,  characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana genes and corresponding enzymes involved  in exine formation has demonstrated the role of fatty acid derivatives as  precursors of sporopollenin building units. Fatty acyl-CoA esters synthesized by  ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE5 (ACOS5) are condensed with malonyl-CoA by POLYKETIDE  SYNTHASE A (PKSA) and PKSB to yield alpha-pyrone polyketides required for exine  formation. Here, we show that two closely related genes encoding oxidoreductases  are specifically and transiently expressed in tapetal cells during microspore  development in Arabidopsis anthers. Mutants compromised in expression of the  reductases displayed a range of pollen exine layer defects, depending on the  mutant allele. Phylogenetic studies indicated that the two reductases belong to a  large reductase/dehydrogenase gene family and cluster in two distinct clades with  putative orthologs from several angiosperm lineages and the moss Physcomitrella  patens. Recombinant proteins produced in bacteria reduced the carbonyl function  of tetraketide alpha-pyrone compounds synthesized by PKSA/B, and the proteins were  therefore named TETRAKETIDE alpha-PYRONE REDUCTASE1 (TKPR1) and TKPR2 (previously  called DRL1 and CCRL6, respectively). TKPR activities, together with those of  ACOS5 and PKSA/B, identify a conserved biosynthetic pathway leading to  hydroxylated alpha-pyrone compounds that were previously unknown to be sporopollenin  precursors.', '2010 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.080036', 'Legrand']
