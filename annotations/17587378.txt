Here, the advantages for a shrub of having long vs short-lived leaves was investigated in Rhododendron ferrugineum by following nitrogen(15N) and carbon(14C) resorption and translocation, and photosynthetic capacity over the life span. Mean leaf life span was 19 months. Nitrogen (N) resorption in attached leaves occurred mainly in the first year (23%) and reached a maximum of 31% in the second. Although, resorption was similar in attached and fallen 1-yr-old leaves, it was on average one-third higher in fallen than in attached older leaves. Final N resorption of a leaf compartment reached 41%, half occurring from healthy leaves during the first year. Photosynthetic capacity decreased slightly during the life span. Before shoot growth, plant photosynthesis was mainly supported by 1-yr-old leaves, although the contribution of the 2-yr-old leaves was nonnegligible (15% of the capacity and higher carbon transfer toward the roots). After shoot growth, the current-year leaves made the greatest contribution. Our results suggest that short-lived leaves (half of the cohort) are mainly involved in a photosynthetic function, having a high photosynthetic capacity and drawing most of their resorbed N towards current-year leaves; and long-lived leaves are also involved in a conservative function, increasing N resorption and mean residence time (MRT).
