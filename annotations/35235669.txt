Far from a homogeneous environment, biological membranes are highly structured with lipids and proteins segregating in domains of different sizes and dwell times. In addition, membranes are highly dynamics especially in response to environmental stimuli. Understanding the impact of the nanoscale organization of membranes on cellular functions is an outstanding question. Plant channels and transporters are tightly regulated to ensure proper cell nutrition and signaling. Increasing evidence indicates that channel and transporter nano-organization within membranes plays an important role in these regulation mechanisms. Here, we review recent advances in the field of ion, water, but also hormone transport in plants, focusing on protein organization within plasma membrane nanodomains and its cellular and physiological impacts.
