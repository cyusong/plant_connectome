Development of leaf margins is an important process in leaf morphogenesis. CIN-clade TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF) transcription factors are known to have redundant roles in specifying leaf margins, but the specific mechanisms through which individual TCP genes function remain elusive. In this study, we report that the CIN-TCP gene TCP5 is involved in repressing the initiation and outgrowth of leaf serrations by activating two key regulators of margin development, the Class II KNOX factor KNAT3 and BEL-like SAW1. Specifically, TCP5 directly promotes the transcription of KNAT3 and indirectly activates the expression of SAW1. We also show that TCP5 regulates KNAT3 and SAW1 in a temporal- and spatial- specific manner that is largely in accordance with the progress of formation of serrations. This regulation might serve as a key mechanism in patterning margin morphogenesis and in sculpting the final form of the leaf.
