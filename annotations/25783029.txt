['25783029', 'Although seed size is one of the most important agronomic traits in plants, the  genetic and molecular mechanisms that set the final size of seeds are largely  unknown. We previously identified the ubiquitin receptor DA1 as a negative  regulator of seed size, and the Arabidopsis thaliana da1-1 mutant produces larger  seeds than the wild type. Here, we describe a B3 domain transcriptional repressor  NGATHA-like protein (NGAL2), encoded by the suppressor of da1-1 (SOD7), which  acts maternally to regulate seed size by restricting cell proliferation in the  integuments of ovules and developing seeds. Overexpression of SOD7 significantly  decreases seed size of wild-type plants, while the simultaneous disruption of  SOD7 and its closest homolog DEVELOPMENT-RELATED PcG TARGET IN THE APEX4  (DPA4/NGAL3) increases seed size. Genetic analyses indicate that SOD7 and DPA4  act in a common pathway with the seed size regulator KLU to regulate seed growth,  but do so independently of DA1. Further results show that SOD7 directly binds to  the promoter of KLUH (KLU) in vitro and in vivo and represses the expression of  KLU. Therefore, our findings reveal the genetic and molecular mechanisms of SOD7,  DPA4, and KLU in seed size regulation and suggest that they are promising targets  for seed size improvement in crops.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.135368', 'ORCID:']
