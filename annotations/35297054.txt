CERK1 (Chitin Elicitor Receptor Kinase 1), a lysin motif-containing pattern recognition receptor (PRR), perceives chitooligosaccharides (COs) to mount immune and symbiotic responses. However, CERK1, for a relatively long time, has been regarded as a co-receptor in plant immunity, mainly due to its lack of high binding affinity to known elicitors. Recent studies demonstrated several novel carbohydrates as ligands of CERK1 in different plant species and recognized CERK1 as a key receptor in plant immunity and symbiosis. This review summarizes recent knowledge acquired on the role of CERK1 in plant-microbe interactions.
