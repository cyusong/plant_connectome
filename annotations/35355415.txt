The important antimalarial drug artemisinin is biosynthesized and stored in Artemisia annua glandular trichomes and the artemisinin content correlates with trichome density; however, the factors affecting trichome development are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the A. annua R2R3 MYB transcription factor TrichomeLess Regulator 1 (TLR1) negatively regulates trichome development. In A. annua, TLR1 overexpression lines had 44.7%-64.0% lower trichome density and 11.5%-49.4% lower artemisinin contents and TLR1-RNAi lines had 33%-93.3% higher trichome density and 32.2%-84.0% higher artemisinin contents compared with non-transgenic controls. TLR1 also negatively regulates the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway genes in A. annua. When heterologously expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, TLR1 interacts with GLABROUS3a, positive regulator of trichome development, and represses trichome development. Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays indicated that TLR1 interacts with the WUSCHEL homeobox (WOX) protein AaWOX1, which interacts with the LEAFY-like transcription factor TLR2. TLR2 overexpression in Arabidopsis and A. annua showed that TLR2 reduces trichome development by reducing gibberellin levels. Furthermore, artemisinin contents were 19%-43% lower in TLR2-overexpressing A. annua plants compared to controls. These data indicate that TLR1 and TLR2 negatively regulate trichome density by lowering gibberellin levels and may enable approaches to enhance artemisinin yields.
