Sorghum is often exposed to suboptimal low temperature stress under field conditions, particularly at the seedling establishment stage. Enhancing chilling tolerance will facilitate earlier planting and so minimize the negative impacts of other stresses experienced at later growth stages. Genome-wide association mapping was performed on a sorghum association panel grown under control (30/20 °C; day/night) and chilling (20/10 °C) conditions. Genomic regions on chromosome 7, controlling the emergence index and seedling (root and shoot) vigor, were associated with increased chilling tolerance but they did not co-localize with undesirable tannin content quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Shoot and root samples from highly contrasting haplotype pairs expressing differential responses to chilling stress were used to identify candidate genes. Three candidate genes (an alpha/beta hydrolase domain protein, a DnaJ/Hsp40 motif-containing protein, and a YTH domain-containing RNA-binding protein) were expressed at significantly higher levels under chilling stress in the tolerant haplotype compared with the sensitive haplotype and BTx623. Moreover, two CBF/DREB1A transcription factors on chromosome 2 showed a divergent response to chilling in the contrasting haplotypes. These studies identify haplotype differences on chromosome 7 that modulate chilling tolerance by either regulating CBF or feeding back into this signaling pathway. We have identified new candidate genes that will be useful markers in ongoing efforts to develop tannin-free chilling-tolerant sorghum hybrids.
