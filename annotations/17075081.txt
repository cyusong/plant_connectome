In a previous work, a Cicer arietinum cDNA clone (CaXTH1) encoding a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH1) protein was isolated and characterized. CaXTH1 showed an expression pattern specific to growing tissue: mostly epicotyls and the upper growing internodes of adult stems. CaXTH1 mRNA was not detected in any other organs of either seedlings or adult plants, suggesting an involvement of the putative XTH encoded by CaXTH1 in the chickpea cell expansion process. After the generation of polyclonal antibodies by using the XTH1 recombinant protein and the analysis of the specificity of the antibodies for XTH proteins, here the specific location of the chickpea XTH1-cross-reacting protein in cell walls of epicotyls, radicles, and stems is reported, evaluated by western blot and immunocytochemical studies. The results indicate a function for this protein in the elongation of parenchyma cells of epicotyls and also in developing vascular tissue, suggesting a role in the elongation of vascular cells.
