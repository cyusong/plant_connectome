MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate numerous crucial abiotic stress processes in plants. However, information is limited on their involvement in cadmium (Cd) stress response and tolerance mechanisms in plants, including ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.) that produces a number of economic valuable as an important natural fibre crop and an ideal crop for Cd pollution remediation. Four small RNA libraries of Cd-stressed and non-stressed leaves and roots of ramie were constructed. Using small RNA-sequencing, 73 novel miRNAs were identified. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed that a set of miRNAs was differentially regulated in response to Cd stress. In silico target prediction identified 426 potential miRNA targets that include several uptake or transport factors for heavy metal ions. The reliability of small RNA sequencing and the relationship between the expression levels of miRNAs and their target genes were confirmed by quantitative PCR (q-PCR). We showed that the expression patterns of miRNAs obtained by q-PCR were consistent with those obtained from small RNA sequencing. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of six randomly selected target genes was inversely related to that of their corresponding miRNAs, indicating that the miRNAs regulate Cd stress response in ramie. This study enriches the number of Cd-responsive miRNAs and lays a foundation for the elucidation of the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism in ramie during Cd stress.
