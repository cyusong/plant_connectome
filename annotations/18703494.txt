A better knowledge of the nitrogen nutrition of Medicago truncatula at the whole plant level and its modulation by environmental factors is a crucial step to reach a complete understanding of legume nitrogen nutrition. This study was based on the symbiotic system that is the most commonly used by the research community (M. truncatula cv. Jemalong A17 x Rhizobium meliloti strain 2011). Plant nitrogen nutrition was analysed in relation to carbon nutrition, under a range of nitrate concentrations in the nutrient solution and different light conditions. This study shows that this 'model symbiotic association' does not allow the plant to meet its nitrogen requirements, when dinitrogen fixation is the main nitrogen source for plant growth. A strong interaction between nitrogen and carbon nutrition was shown: when plant nitrogen requirements were not sustained, plant leaf area was much affected whereas photosynthesis per unit leaf area remained relatively stable. Both total nitrogen uptake and leaf area increased with increasing nitrate concentration in the nutrient solution; the magnitude of these responses varied according to the light conditions. Interestingly, the plant nitrogen nutrition level remained nearly unaffected by the light conditions. The observed nitrogen-limitation in this 'model symbiotic association' is an important finding for the research community. Based on practical recommendations regarding both the experimental conditions and the phenotypic traits to consider, a methodological framework was proposed to (i) help genomicists to assess plant nitrogen nutrition better, and (ii) assist in the detection of new genetic variants affected for nitrogen uptake in large-scale phenotyping studies.
