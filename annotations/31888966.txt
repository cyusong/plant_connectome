Salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) are important phytohormones that regulate numerous plant growth, development, and stress response processes. Previous studies have suggested functional interplay of SA and ET in defense responses, but precisely how these two hormones coregulate plant growth and development processes remains unclear. Our present work reveals antagonism between SA and ET in apical hook formation, which ensures successful soil emergence of etiolated dicotyledonous seedlings. Exogenous SA inhibited ET-induced expression of <i>HOOKLESS1</i> (<i>HLS1</i>) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner dependent on ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1), the core transcription factors in the ET signaling pathway. SA-activated NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES1 (NPR1) physically interacted with EIN3 and interfered with the binding of EIN3 to target gene promoters, including the <i>HLS1</i> promoter. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NPR1 and EIN3/EIL1 coordinately regulated subsets of genes that mediate plant growth and stress responses, suggesting that the interaction between NPR1 and EIN3/EIL1 is an important mechanism for integrating the SA and ET signaling pathways in multiple physiological processes. Taken together, our findings illuminate the molecular mechanism underlying SA regulation of apical hook formation as well as the antagonism between SA and ET in early seedling establishment and possibly other physiological processes.
