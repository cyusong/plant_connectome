Recognizing plant diseases is a major challenge in agriculture, and recent works based on deep learning have shown high efficiency in addressing problems directly related to this area. Nonetheless, weak performance has been observed when a model trained on a particular dataset is evaluated in new greenhouse environments. Therefore, in this work, we take a step towards these issues and present a strategy to improve model accuracy by applying techniques that can help refine the model's generalization capability to deal with complex changes in new greenhouse environments. We propose a paradigm called "control to target classes." The core of our approach is to train and validate a deep learning-based detector using target and control classes on images collected in various greenhouses. Then, we apply the generated features for testing the inference of the system on data from new greenhouse conditions where the goal is to detect target classes exclusively. Therefore, by having explicit control over inter- and intra-class variations, our model can distinguish data variations that make the system more robust when applied to new scenarios. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on our extended tomato plant diseases dataset with 14 classes, from which 5 are target classes and the rest are control classes. Our detector achieves a recognition rate of target classes of 93.37% mean average precision on the inference dataset. Finally, we believe that our study offers valuable guidelines for researchers working in plant disease recognition with complex input data.
