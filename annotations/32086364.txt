['32086364', 'Male and female gametophytes are generated from micro- or megaspore mother cells  through consecutive meiotic and mitotic cell divisions. Defects in these  divisions often result in gametophytic lethality. Gametophytic lethality was also  reported when genes encoding ribosome-related proteins were mutated. Although  numerous ribosomal proteins (RPs) have been identified in plants based on  homology with their yeast and metazoan counterparts, how RPs are regulated, e.g.,  through dynamic subcellular targeting, is unknown. We report here that an  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) importin beta, KETCH1 (karyopherin enabling the  transport of the cytoplasmic HYL1), is critical for gametogenesis. Karyopherins  are molecular chaperones mediating nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. However,  the role of KETCH1 during gametogenesis is independent of HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1  (HYL1), a previously reported KETCH1 cargo. Instead, KETCH1 interacts with  several RPs and is critical for the nuclear accumulation of RPL27a, whose  mutations caused similar gametophytic defects. We further showed that knocking  down KETCH1 caused reduced ribosome biogenesis and translational capacity, which  may trigger the arrest of mitotic cell cycle progression and lead to gametophytic  lethality.', '2020 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00791', 'ORCID:']
