Plant species may acquire different forms of nitrogen (N) to reduce competition for the same resource, but how plants respond to neighbors with different densities in their N uptake is still poorly understood. We investigated the effects of competition regime on the uptake of different N forms by two hygrophytes, <i>Carex thunbergii</i> and <i>Polygonum criopolitanum</i>, by conducting a hydroponic test of excised roots and an <i>in situ</i> experiment in a subtropical wetland ecosystem. The two species were grown either in monocultures or mixtures with various neighbor densities. Root functional traits and N uptake rates of different N forms were measured. Our results showed that N uptake was mainly determined by N form, rather than species identity. Both species were able to use organic N sources, but they took up relatively more N supplied as NO <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi></mi> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> than as NH <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi></mi> <mn>4</mn> <mo>+</mo></msubsup> </math> or glycine, irrespective of competition treatments. Both species preferred NO <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi></mi> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> when grown in monoculture, but in the presence of competitors, the preference of fast-growing <i>C. thunbergii</i> persisted while <i>P. criopolitanum</i> acquired more NH <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi></mi> <mn>4</mn> <mo>+</mo></msubsup> </math> and glycine, with stronger responses being observed at the highest neighbor density. The hydroponic test suggested that these divergences in N acquisition between two species might be partially explained by different root functional traits. To be specific, N uptake rates were significantly positively correlated with root N concentration and specific root length, but negatively correlated with root dry matter content. Our results implicated that <i>C. thunbergii</i> has a competitive advantage with relatively more stable N acquisition strategy despite a lower N recovery than <i>P. criopolitanum</i>, whereas <i>P. criopolitanum</i> could avoid competition with <i>C. thunbergii</i> via a better access to organic N sources, partly mediated by competition regimes.
