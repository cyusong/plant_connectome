Crop breeding heavily relies on natural genetic variation. However, additional new variations are desired to meet the increasing human demand. Inflorescence architecture determines grain number per spike, a major determinant of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield. Here, using Brachypodium distachyon as a wheat proxy, we identified DUO-B1, encoding an APETALA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor, regulating spike inflorescence architecture in bread wheat. Mutations of DUO-B1 lead to mild supernumerary spikelets, increased grain number per spike and, importantly, increased yield under field conditions without affecting other major agronomic traits. DUO-B1 suppresses cell division and promotes the expression of BH<sup>t</sup>/WFZP, whose mutations could lead to branched 'miracle-wheat'. Pan-genome analysis indicated that DUO-B1 has not been utilized in breeding, and holds promise to increase wheat yield further.
