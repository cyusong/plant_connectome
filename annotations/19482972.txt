['19482972', 'At the onset of flowering, the Arabidopsis thaliana primary inflorescence  meristem starts to produce flower meristems on its flank. Determination of floral  fate is associated with changes in the growth pattern and expression of meristem  identity genes and suppression of a subtending leaf called a bract. Here, we show  a role in floral fate determination and bract suppression for the PUCHI gene, an  AP2/EREBP family gene that has previously been reported to play roles in lateral  root morphogenesis. Mutations in PUCHI cause partial conversion of flowers to  inflorescences, indicating that PUCHI is required for flower meristem identity.  PUCHI is transiently expressed in the early flower meristem and accelerates  meristem bulging while it prevents the growth of the bract primordium. The  function of PUCHI in floral fate determination and bract suppression overlaps  that of the BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1 (BOP1) and BOP2 genes, which encode a pair of  redundant regulatory proteins involved in various developmental processes,  including leaf morphogenesis and flower patterning. We also show that PUCHI acts  together with BOP1 and BOP2 to promote expression of LEAFY and APETALA1, two  central regulators of floral meristem identity. Expression patterns of the PUCHI  and BOP genes point to a role in spatial control of flower-specific activation of  these meristem identity genes.', '2009 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.067025', 'Aida']
