['11749958', 'Here we report on the isolation of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA that is able to  complement a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant unable to synthesise adenine. This  cDNA encodes a highly hydrophobic protein (ENT1,At) of 428 amino acids, showing  high similarity to the human nucleoside transporter hENT1. Yeast cells expressing  ENT1,At are able to grow on adenosine-containing media, adenosine import  exhibited an apparent affinity (K(M)) of 3.6 microM, and led to accumulation of  this nucleoside within the yeast cell. Transport is inhibited by various  nucleosides. Typical inhibitors of ENT-type nucleoside transporters do not  inhibit (3)H-adenosine import. The presence of protonophores abolished adenosine  import, indicating that ENT1,At catalyse a proton-dependent adenosine transport.  This is the first functional characterisation of a plant nucleoside transport  protein.', '2001 Dec 14', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(01)03195-7', 'Neuhaus']
