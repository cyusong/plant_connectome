High-throughput sequencing is a revolutionary technological innovation in DNA sequencing. This technology has an ultra-low cost per base of sequencing and an overwhelmingly high data output. High-throughput sequencing has brought novel research methods and solutions to the research fields of genomics and post-genomics. Furthermore, this technology is leading to a new molecular breeding revolution that has landmark significance for scientific research and enables us to launch multi-level, multi-faceted, and multi-extent studies in the fields of crop genetics, genomics, and crop breeding. In this paper, we review progress in the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies to plant molecular breeding studies.
