The major effect of nitrogen (N) deficiency is the inhibition on CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation regulated by light energy absorption, transport and conversion, as well as N allocation. In this study, a yellow-green wheat mutant (Jimai5265yg) and its wild type (Jimai5265, WT) were compared between 0 mM N (N<sub>0</sub>) and 14 mM N (N<sub>14</sub>) treatments using hydroponic experiments. The mutant exhibited higher photosynthetic efficiency (A<sub>n</sub>) than WT despite low chlorophyll (Chl) content in non-stressed conditions. The photosynthetic advantages of the mutant were maintained under N deficient condition. The quantitative analysis of limitations to photosynthesis revealed that CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion associated with mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub>) was the dominant limitation. Relative easiness to gain CO<sub>2</sub> in the chloroplast contributed to the higher A<sub>n</sub> of Jimai5265yg. N deficiency induced the photoinhibition of PSII, but the cyclic electron transport and photochemical activity of PSI was higher in Jimai5265yg compared to Jimai5265, which was a protective mechanism to avoid photodamage. Because of the sharp drop of A<sub>n</sub>, N deficient seedlings had much lower photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE). However, N deficiency increased the relative content of photosynthetic N (N<sub>psn</sub>) and decreased the relative content of storage N (N<sub>store</sub>). The range of change in N partitioning induced by N deficiency was smaller for Jimai5265yg compared to WT. The less insensitive to N deficiency for the mutant in terms of photosynthetic property and N partitioning suggested that g<sub>m</sub>, cyclic electron transport around PSI and more optimal N partitioning pattern is necessary to sustain photosynthesis under N deficient condition.
