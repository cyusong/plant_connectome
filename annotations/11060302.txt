['11060302', 'Nitrilases (nitrile aminohydrolases, EC ) are enzymes that catalyze the  hydrolysis of nitriles to the corresponding carbon acids. Among the four known  nitrilases of Arabidopsis thaliana, the isoform NIT4 is the most divergent one,  and homologs of NIT4 are also known from species not belonging to the  Brassicaceae like Nicotiana tabacum and Oryza sativa. We expressed A. thaliana  NIT4 as hexahistidine tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme  showed a strong substrate specificity for beta-cyano-l-alanine (Ala(CN)), an  intermediate product of cyanide detoxification in higher plants. Interestingly,  not only aspartic acid but also asparagine were identified as products of  NIT4-catalyzed Ala(CN) hydrolysis. Asn itself was no substrate for NIT4,  indicating that it is not an intermediate but one of two reaction products. NIT4  therefore has both nitrilase and nitrile hydratase activity. Several lines of  evidence indicate that the catalytic center for both reactions is the same. The  NIT4 homologs of N. tabacum were found to catalyze the same reactions and protein  extracts of A. thaliana, N. tabacum and Lupinus angustifolius also converted  Ala(CN) to Asp and Asn in vitro. NIT4 may play a role in cyanide detoxification  during ethylene biosynthesis because extracts from senescent leaves of A.  thaliana showed higher Ala(CN) hydratase/nitrilase activities than extracts from  nonsenescent tissue.', '2001 Jan 26', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M007890200', 'Weiler']
