['18543065', 'Rhomboid proteins comprise a class of serine proteases that are conserved in all  kingdoms of organisms. They contain six or seven transmembrane helices and  control a wide range of cellular functions and developmental processes by  intramembrane proteolysis. This paper provides experimental evidence for the  existence of rhomboid proteases in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. Among 15  putative rhomboid-like proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, we selected five  predicted as mitochondrially targeted. For these proteins we performed the GFP  transient assay, and identified two homologues, AtRBL11 (At5g25752) and AtRBL12  (At1g18600) to be targeted into plastids and mitochondria, respectively.  Phylogenetic analysis reveals that AtRBL12 or AtRBL11 have only one clear  orthologue in plant species with completely sequenced genomes. Complementation of  the yeast lacking a functional copy of mitochondrial rhomboid with AtRBL12  indicates that this plant protease, in contrast to the human orthologue, does not  recognize the yeast substrates, cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) or dynamin-like  GTPase (Mgm1). In agreement with this, we did not observe processing of Mgm1 when  labeled precursor of this protein was incubated in vitro with Arabidopsis  mitochondrial extract. Our results imply that plant mitochondrial rhomboids  function in a specific manner and thus differ from their yeast and mammal  counterparts.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9359-8', 'Janska']
