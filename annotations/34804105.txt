The genus <i>Cilevirus</i> groups enveloped single-stranded (+) RNA virus members of the family <i>Kitaviridae</i>, order <i>Martellivirales</i>. Proteins P15, scarcely conserved polypeptides encoded by cileviruses, have no apparent homologs in public databases. Accordingly, the open reading frames (ORFs) <i>p15</i>, located at the 5'-end of the viral RNA2 molecules, are considered orphan genes (ORFans). In this study, we have delved into ORFs <i>p15</i> and the relatively poorly understood biochemical properties of the proteins P15 to posit their importance for viruses across the genus and theorize on their origin. We detected that the ORFs <i>p15</i> are under purifying selection and that, in some viral strains, the use of synonymous codons is biased, which might be a sign of adaptation to their plant hosts. Despite the high amino acid sequence divergence, proteins P15 show the conserved motif [FY]-L-x(3)-[FL]-H-x-x-[LIV]-S-C-x-C-x(2)-C-x-G-x-C, which occurs exclusively in members of this protein family. Proteins P15 also show a common predicted 3D structure that resembles the helical scaffold of the protein ORF49 encoded by radinoviruses and the phosphoprotein C-terminal domain of mononegavirids. Based on the 3D structural similarities of P15, we suggest elements of common ancestry, conserved functionality, and relevant amino acid residues. We conclude by postulating a plausible evolutionary trajectory of ORFans <i>p15</i> and the 5'-end of the RNA2 of cileviruses considering both protein fold superpositions and comparative genomic analyses with the closest kitaviruses, negeviruses, nege/kita-like viruses, and unrelated viruses that share the ecological niches of cileviruses.
