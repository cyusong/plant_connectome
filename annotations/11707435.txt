['11707435', 'In saline environments, plants accumulate Na(+) in vacuoles through the activity  of tonoplast Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. The first gene for a putative plant vacuolar  Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, AtNHX1, was isolated from Arabidopsis and shown to  increase plant tolerance to NaCl. However, AtNHX1 mRNA was up-regulated by Na(+)  or K(+) salts in plants and substituted for the homologous protein of yeast to  restore tolerance to several toxic cations. To study the ion selectivity of the  AtNHX1 protein, we have purified a histidine-tagged version of the protein from  yeast microsomes by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography, reconstituted the protein  into lipid vesicles, and measured cation-dependent H(+) exchange with the  fluorescent pH indicator pyranine. The protein catalyzed Na(+) and K(+) transport  with similar affinity in the presence of a pH gradient. Li(+) and Cs(+) ions were  also transported with lower affinity. Ion exchange by AtNHX1 was inhibited 70% by  the amiloride analog ethylisopropyl-amiloride. Our data indicate a role for  intracellular antiporters in organelle pH control and osmoregulation.', '2002 Jan 25', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M105043200', 'Donaire']
