['12372626', 'The mitochondrial membrane bound dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH; EC  1.3.99.11) catalyzes the fourth step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. By the present  correction of a known cDNA sequence for Arabidopsis thaliana DHODH we revealed  the importance of the very C-terminal part for its catalytic activity and the  reason why--in contrast to mammalian and insect species--the recombinant plant  flavoenzyme was unaccessible to date for in vitro characterization.  Structure-activity relationship studies explained that potent inhibitors of  animal DHODH do not significantly affect the plant enzyme. These difference could  be exploited for a novel approach to herb or pest growth control by limitation of  pyrimidine nucleotide pools.', '2002 Oct 9', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03425-7', 'Loffler']
