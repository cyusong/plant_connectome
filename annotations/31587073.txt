The positive effects of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations [CO2] decrease over time in most C3 plants because of down-regulation of photosynthesis. A notable exception to this trend is plants hosting N-fixing bacteria. The decrease in photosynthetic capacity associated with an extended exposure to high [CO2] was therefore studied in non-nodulating rice that can establish endophytic interactions. Rice plants were inoculated with diazotrophic endophytes isolated from the Salicaceae and CO2 response curves of photosynthesis were determined in the absence or presence of endophytes at the panicle initiation stage. Non-inoculated plants grown under elevated [CO2] showed a down-regulation of photosynthesis compared to those grown under ambient [CO2]. In contrast, the endophyte-inoculated plants did not show a decrease in photosynthesis associated with high [CO2], and they exhibited higher photosynthetic electron transport and mesophyll conductance rates than non-inoculated plants under high [CO2]. The endophyte-dependent alleviation of decreases in photosynthesis under high [CO2] led to an increase in water-use efficiency. These effects were most pronounced when the N supply was limited. The results suggest that inoculation with N-fixing endophytes could be an effective means of improving plant growth under high [CO2] by alleviating N limitations.
