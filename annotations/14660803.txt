['14660803', 'CDC45 is required for the initiation of DNA replication in yeast and cell  proliferation in mammals and functions as a DNA polymerase alpha loading factor  in Xenopus. We have cloned a CDC45 homolog from Arabidopsis whose expression is  upregulated at the G1/S transition and in young meiotic flower buds. One-third of  Arabidopsis 35S:CDC45 T1 RNA interference lines are partially to completely  sterile, and the proportion of sterile plants is increased by using a dmc1  promoter. T1 plants have decreased levels of the CDC45 transcript and contain 21-  to 23-bp RNA fragments specific to the CDC45 gene. T2 transgenic lines, in which  small RNA fragments are still present, were used to analyze S-phase entry by  5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, which was not altered compared with that in  the wild type. However, microarray data show that other cell cycle genes are  upregulated or downregulated. T2 plants also have highly reduced fertility. The  severity of the phenotype is correlated with the levels of the CDC45 transcript  and small RNA fragments. Severe chromosome fragmentation arising during meiosis,  which is not the result of a defect in the repair of SPO11-induced double strand  breaks, leads to abnormal chromosome segregation and defective pollen and ovule  development.', '2004 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.016865', 'Bergounioux']
