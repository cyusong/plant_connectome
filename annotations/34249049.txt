Polyploidization can have a significant ecological and evolutionary impact by providing substantially more genetic material that may result in novel phenotypes upon which selection may act. While the effects of polyploidization are broadly reviewed across the plant tree of life, the reproducibility of these effects within naturally occurring, independently formed polyploids is poorly characterized. The flowering plant genus <i>Tragopogon</i> (Asteraceae) offers a rare glimpse into the intricacies of repeated allopolyploid formation with both nascent (< 90 years old) and more ancient (mesopolyploids) formations. Neo- and mesopolyploids in <i>Tragopogon</i> have formed repeatedly and have extant diploid progenitors that facilitate the comparison of genome evolution after polyploidization across a broad span of evolutionary time. Here, we examine four independently formed lineages of the mesopolyploid <i>Tragopogon castellanus</i> for homoeolog expression changes and fractionation after polyploidization. We show that expression changes are remarkably similar among these independently formed polyploid populations with large convergence among expressed loci, moderate convergence among loci lost, and stochastic silencing. We further compare and contrast these results for <i>T. castellanus</i> with two nascent <i>Tragopogon</i> allopolyploids. While homoeolog expression bias was balanced in both nascent polyploids and <i>T. castellanus</i>, the degree of additive expression was significantly different, with the mesopolyploid populations demonstrating more non-additive expression. We suggest that gene dosage and expression noise minimization may play a prominent role in regulating gene expression patterns immediately after allopolyploidization as well as deeper into time, and these patterns are conserved across independent polyploid lineages.
