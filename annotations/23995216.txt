['23995216', 'Photosynthetic organisms during acclimation to light, differences in the amount  of energy absorbed by photosystems leads to an imbalance in the energy  distribution between photosystem (PS) II and PSI. Here, we describe the changes  in fast chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence transients (OJIP) in wild type and stn7  under state I and state II light conditions. Fluorescence quenching in the OJIP  transients recorded from state II exposed wt leaves is due to mobilization of  LHCII to PSI. Similar kind of quenching was not observed in stn7 plants exposed  to state II light. OJIP transients can be used to study the changes in Chl a  fluorescence upon state transitions in A. thaliana. Immunoblotting and 2  dimensional gel electrophoresis studies have shown that phosphorylated Lhcb2  under state II condition exhibited 4 isoforms, whereas dephosphorylated Lhcb2  exhibited 3 isoforms in state I. Phosphorylation and migration of LHCII to PSI  resulted in changes in the pigment protein profile of the thylakoid membranes in  state II from wt. The increase in circular dichroism (CD) signals at 663 nm and  679 nm was due to association of chirally active trimeric LHCII to PSI-LHCI  supercomplex leading to macro-aggregation of pigment-pigment complexes in state  II pre-illuminated conditions in wt A. thaliana.', '2013 Nov 5', 'J Photochem Photobiol B', '10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2013.07.028', 'Subramanyam']
