['27685353', 'Proteases play crucial physiological functions in all organisms by controlling  the lifetime of proteins. Here, we identified an atypical protease of the  subtilase family [SBT5.2(b)] that attenuates the transcriptional activation of  plant defence independently of its protease activity. The SBT5.2 gene produces  two distinct transcripts encoding a canonical secreted subtilase [SBT5.2(a)] and  an intracellular protein [SBT5.2(b)]. Concomitant to SBT5.2(a) downregulation,  SBT5.2(b) expression is induced after bacterial inoculation. SBT5.2(b) localizes  to endosomes where it interacts with and retains the defence-related  transcription factor MYB30. Nuclear exclusion of MYB30 results in its reduced  transcriptional activation and, thus, suppressed resistance. sbt5.2 mutants, with  abolished SBT5.2(a) and SBT5.2(b) expression, display enhanced defence that is  suppressed in a myb30 mutant background. Moreover, overexpression of SBT5.2(b),  but not SBT5.2(a), in sbt5.2 plants reverts the phenotypes displayed by sbt5.2  mutants. Overall, we uncover a regulatory mode of the transcriptional activation  of defence responses previously undescribed in eukaryotes.', '2016 Sep 29', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.19755', 'ORCID:']
