Pharmacological studies, using Ca(2+) channel blockers (LaCl 3 and verapamil) and calmodulin (CaM) antagonists (CPZ and W7), were carried out to understand the role of Ca(2+)/CaM in the regulation of heat shock-induced expression of Hsp90 (Hsp87 and Hsp85) and Hsp70 (Hsp75 and Hsp73) members in sorghum. It was observed that the expression of both Hsp87 and Hsp85 proteins was decreased in presence of Ca ( 2+) channel blockers and CaM antagonists, under both control and heat stress conditions, as contrary to the steady state levels of Hsp75 and Hsp73, which were not affected significantly under similar conditions. Further, the exposure of sorghum seedlings to geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90, resulted in induction of Hsp87 and Hsp85 in the absence of heat shock also. This study provides the first evidence suggesting that in plants, the in vivo expression of Hsp90 (Hsp87 and Hsp85) is likely to be modulated by Ca(2+)/CaM under normal and thermal stress conditions. The likely implications of these findings are discussed.

Ca(2+)/CaM: !regulates! Hsp90 (Hsp87 and Hsp85)
Ca(2+)/CaM: !decreases! expression of Hsp87 and Hsp85
geldanamycin: !induces! Hsp87 and Hsp85
heat shock: !increases! expression of Hsp75 and Hsp73
