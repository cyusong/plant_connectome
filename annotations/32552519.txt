<i>Botrytis cinerea</i> is a foliar necrotrophic fungal-pathogen capable of infecting >580 genera of plants, is often used as model organism for studying fungal-host interactions. We used RNAseq to study transcriptome of <i>B. cinerea</i> infection on a major (worldwide) vegetable crop, tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Most previous works explored only few infection stages, using RNA extracted from entire leaf-organ diluting the expression of studied infected region. Many studied <i>B. cinerea</i> infection, on detached organs assuming that similar defense/physiological reactions occurs in the intact plant. We analyzed transcriptome of the pathogen and host in 5 infection stages of whole-plant leaves at the infection site. We supply high quality, pathogen-enriched gene count that facilitates future research of the molecular processes regulating the infection process.
