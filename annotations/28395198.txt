The hop metabolome important for the brewing industry and for medical purposes is endangered worldwide due to multiple viroid infections affecting hop physiology. Combinatorial biolistic hop inoculation with Citrus bark cracking viroid (CBCVd), Apple fruit crinkle viroid (AFCVd), Hop latent viroid, and Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) showed a low CBCVd compatibility with HSVd, while all other viroid combinations were highly compatible. Unlike to other viroids, single CBCVd propagation showed a significant excess of (-) over (+) strands in hop, tomato, and Nicotiana benthamiana, but not in citruses. Inoculation of hop with all viroids led to multiple infections with unstable viroid levels in individual plants in the pre- and post-dormancy periods, and to high plant mortality and morphological disorders. Hop isolates of CBCVd and AFCVd were highly stable, only minor quasispecies were detected. CBCVd caused a strong suppression of some crucial mRNAs related to the hop prenylflavonoid biosynthesis pathway, while AFCVd-caused effects were moderate. According to mRNA degradome analysis, this suppression was not caused by a direct viroid-specific small RNA-mediated degradation. CBCVd infection led to a strong induction of two hop transcription factors from WRKY family and to a disbalance of WRKY/WDR1 complexes important for activation of lupulin genes.
