Redox modification of functional or regulatory proteins has emerged as an important mechanism of post-translational modification. However, the role of redox modifications of transcription factors mediated by methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) in regulating physiological processes in plants remains unclear, especially in fruit ripening. In this study, we determined that MaNAC42, a transcriptional activator, is involved in the regulation of fruit ripening in banana under oxidative stress. Integrated analysis of ChIP-qPCR and EMSA data showed that MaNAC42 directly binds to promoters of genes related to oxidative stress and ripening. Ectopic overexpression of MaNAC42 in Arabidopsis delays dark-induced senescence in leaves, indicating that MaNAC42 plays a negative role in senescence. Furthermore, we found that MaNAC42 is a target of MaMsrB2, a methionine sulfoxide reductase B. Methionine oxidation in MaNAC42 (i.e. sulfoxidation) or mimicking sulfoxidation by mutating methionine to glutamine both lead to decreased DNA-binding capacity and transcriptional activity. On the other hand, MaMsrB2 can partially repair oxidized MaNAC42 and restore its DNA-binding capacity. Thus, our results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of fruit ripening in banana involving MaMsrB2-mediated redox regulation of the ripening-related transcription factor MaNAC42.
