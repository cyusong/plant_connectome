Beech seedlings from 11 German climatic provenances were exposed to a realistically timed drought treatment in a greenhouse experiment. The stable isotope composition of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) was analysed in pooled bulk material of roots, stems and leaves, as well as in the aqueous extracts and starch fractions. The delta 13C values increased in bulk samples (BS) of roots, stems and leaves by drought, although no leaf growth occurred during the experimental period. A clear drought effect on delta 13C in aqueous extracts was detected in leaves. In aqueous extracts of stems and roots as well as in starch fractions of all organs, abundance of delta 13C also tended to be increased by drought, but this effect was not statistically significant. For both delta 13C and delta 15N, enrichment was observed from the site of uptake/ source to the site of use/sink. A gradient for delta 13C in all fractions from leaves (-29.49, -28.89 and -27.85 per thousand) to stems (-28.81, -27.48 and -26.98 per thousand) and to roots (-27.60, -26.37 and -26.48 per thousand) was detected in BS, aqueous extracts and starch, respectively. An opposite gradient for delta 15N was found in BS: 1.59 per thousand, 1.84 per thousand and 3.05 per thousand in roots, stems and leaves, respectively. delta 15N was neither affected by drought in the BS nor in aqueous extracts, but an effect of provenance was observed. Particularly in roots and stems, drought-sensitive provenances showed the strongest shifts in delta 13C induced by drought and the lowest delta 15N values. In the present experiment, delta 13C values were more affected by the environmental factor drought, while delta 15N values were more affected by the genetic factor provenance.
