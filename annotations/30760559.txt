['30760559', 'Potassium and nitrogen are essential nutrients for plant growth and development.  Plants can sense potassium nitrate (K(+)/NO(3) (-)) levels in soils, and  accordingly they adjust root-to-shoot K(+)/NO(3) (-) transport to balance the  distribution of these ions between roots and shoots. In this study, we show that  the transcription factorMYB59 maintains this balance by regulating the  transcription of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Nitrate Transporter1.5  (NRT1.5)/ Nitrate Transporter/Peptide Transporter Family7.3 (NPF7.3) in response  to low K(+) (LK) stress. The myb59 mutant showed a yellow-shoot sensitive  phenotype when grown on LK medium. Both the transcript and protein levels of  NPF7.3 were remarkably reduced in the myb59 mutant. LK stress repressed  transcript levels of both MYB59 and NPF7.3 The npf7.3 and myb59 mutants, as well  as the npf7.3 myb59 double mutant, showed similar LK-sensitive phenotypes. Ion  content analyses indicated that root-to-shoot K(+)/NO(3) (-) transport was  significantly reduced in these mutants under LK conditions. Moreover, chromatin  immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis mobility shift assay assays confirmed  that MYB59 bound directly to the NPF7.3 promoter. Expression of NPF7.3 in root  vasculature driven by the PHOSPHATE 1 promoter rescued the sensitive phenotype of  both npf7.3 and myb59 mutants. Together, these data demonstrate that MYB59  responds to LK stress and directs root-to-shoot K(+)/NO(3) (-) transport by  regulating the expression of NPF7.3 in Arabidopsis roots.', '2019 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00674', 'ORCID:']
