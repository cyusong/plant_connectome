The root-apex transition zone (TZ), the major perception site for aluminium (Al) toxicity, is crucial for the Al-induced root-growth inhibition, while the mechanism underlying silicon-mediated alleviation of Al toxicity in the TZ is largely unknown. In this study, the role of silicon (Si) in alleviating Al-induced damage in the TZ and root-growth inhibition of rice was investigated. We found that Si had direct alleviative effect on Al toxicity as revealed by less root growth-inhibition, Al accumulation, and callose formation. Si reversed Al-induced decreases of the cell wall elongation and extensibility, and reduced Al-induced increments of cell wall polysaccharides in the TZ. The similar distribution patterns of Al and Si in the cell wall indicated that Si might detoxify Al by forming hydroxyaluminumsilicates in the apoplast of the root-apex TZ. Moreover, the wall-bound form of Si reduced Al binding sites, thereby reducing the capability of Al bound to the cell wall. These results suggest that Si-mediated cell wall modification in the TZ alleviates Al-induced root-growth inhibition in rice involving the promotion of cell wall extensibility and the decrease of Al accumulation in the cell wall.
