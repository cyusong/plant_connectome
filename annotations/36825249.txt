The cultivation and sale of medicinal plants are some of the main ways to meet the increased market demand for plant-based drugs. <i>Panax notoginseng</i> is a widely used Chinese medicinal material. The growth and accumulation of bioactive constituents mainly depend on a satisfactory growing environment. Additionally, the occurrence of market fraud means that care should be taken when purchasing. In this study, we report the correlation between saponins and climate factors based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and evaluate the influence of climate factors on the quality of <i>P. notoginseng</i>. In addition, the synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) images of near infrared (NIR) data combined with the deep learning model were applied to traceability of geographic origins of <i>P. notoginseng</i> at two different levels (district and town levels). The results indicated that the contents of saponins in <i>P. notoginseng</i> are negatively related to the annual mean temperature and the temperature annual range. A lower annual mean temperature and temperature annual range are favorable for the content accumulation of saponins. Additionally, high annual precipitation and high humidity are conducive to the content accumulation of Notoginsenoside R1 (NG-R1), Ginsenosides Rg1 (G-Rg1), and Ginsenosides Rb1 (G-Rb1), while Ginsenosides Rd (G-Rd), this is not the case. Regarding geographic origins, classifications at two different levels could be successfully distinguished through synchronous 2D-COS images combined with the residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) model. The model accuracy of the training set, test set, and external validation is achieved at 100%, and the cross-entropy loss function curves are lower. This demonstrated the potential feasibility of the proposed method for <i>P. notoginseng</i> geographic origin traceability, even if the distance between sampling points is small. The findings of this study could improve the quality of <i>P. notoginseng</i>, provide a reference for cultivating <i>P. notoginseng</i> in the future and alleviate the occurrence of market fraud.
