A common feature of these intracellular symbioses is the requirement for mutual recognition between the two partners before host-regulated microbial entry. As part of this molecular dialogue, symbiosis-specific microbial factors set in motion a highly conserved plant signal transduction pathway, of which a central component is the activation of sustained nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in target cells of the host epidermis. Here, we focus on recent findings concerning this crucial Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent signalling step for endosymbiotic associations involving either arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or nitrogen-fixing Frankia actinomycetes, and in particular how this knowledge is contributing to the identification of the respective microbial factors.
