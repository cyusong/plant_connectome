Silicon protects plants against various biotic and abiotic stresses, including metal toxicity. Under a high metal concentration, Si can externally decrease metal availability to the plant by its precipitation in the growth media, and Si also affects the metal distribution inside the plant, diminishing the damage. Could Si also protect plants against metal deficiency stress? Recently, the physiological role of Si in relation to micronutrients deficiency symptoms has been assessed in several plant species in hydroponics. In cucumber, Si supply mitigated the symptoms of Fe deficiency, but this effect was not clear under Zn- or Mn-deficiency conditions. The main factor controlling this beneficial effect seems to be the Si contribution to the formation of metal deposits in the root and/or leaves apoplast and its role in their following remobilization when required. The enhancement of the content of long-distance transport molecules (such as citrate) due to Si addition should also contribute to the metal transport from root to shoot, which will diminish deficiency symptoms.
