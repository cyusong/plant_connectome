['14597662', 'Arabidopsis COP1 is a constitutive repressor of photomorphogenesis that interacts  with photomorphogenesis-promoting factors such as HY5 to promote their  proteasome-mediated degradation. SPA1 is a repressor of phytochrome A-mediated  responses to far-red light. Here we report that COP1 acts as part of a large  protein complex and interacts with SPA1 in a light-dependent manner. We further  demonstrate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of COP1 on HY5 in vitro and the  alteration of that activity by SPA1. Thus, the COP1-SPA1 interaction defines a  critical step in coordinating COP1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent  degradation of HY5 with PHYA signaling.', '2003 Nov 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1122903', 'Deng']
