The predicted future increase in tropospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels will have major effects on C<sub>3</sub> plants and their interactions with other organisms in the biosphere. In response to attack by chewing arthropod herbivores or nectrotrophic pathogens, many plants mount a rapid and intense increase in jasmonate-related phytohormones that results in a robust defense response; however, previous studies have shown that C<sub>3</sub> plants grown at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may have lower induced jasmonate levels, particularly in well nitrate-fertilized plants. Given the relationship between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, photorespiration, cellular reductant and redox status, nitrogen assimilation and phytohormones, we compared wound-induced responses of the C<sub>3</sub> plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. These plants were fertilized at two different rates (1 or 10 mM) with nitrate or ammonium and grown at ambient or elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. In response to artificial wounding, an increase in cellular oxidative status leads to a strong increase in jasmonate phytohormones. At ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, increased oxidative state of nitrate-fertilized plants leads to a robust 7-<i>iso</i>-jasmonyl-L-isoleucine increase; however, the strong fertilizer rate-associated increase is alleviated in plants grown at elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. As well, the changes in ascorbate in response to wounding and wound-induced salicylic acid levels may also contribute to the suppression of the jasmonate burst. Understanding the mechanism underlying the attenuation of the jasmonate burst at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> has important implications for fertilization strategies under future predicted climatic conditions.
