['25099865', "The enormous amount of environmental arsenic was a major factor in determining  the biochemistry of incipient life forms early in the Earth's history. The most  abundant chemical form in the reducing atmosphere was arsenite, which forced  organisms to evolve strategies to manage this chemical species. Following the  great oxygenation event, arsenite oxidized to arsenate and the action of arsenate  reductases became a central survival requirement. The identity of a biologically  relevant arsenate reductase in plants nonetheless continues to be debated. Here  we identify a quantitative trait locus that encodes a novel arsenate reductase  critical for arsenic tolerance in plants. Functional analyses indicate that  several non-additive polymorphisms affect protein structure and account for the  natural variation in arsenate reductase activity in Arabidopsis thaliana  accessions. This study shows that arsenate reductases are an essential component  for natural plant variation in As(V) tolerance.", '2014 Aug 7', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms5617', 'Leyva']
