['29233856', 'In chromatin, histone methylation affects the epigenetic regulation of multiple  processes in animals and plants and is modulated by the activities of histone  methyltransferases and histone demethylases. The jumonji domain-containing  histone demethylases have diverse functions and can be classified into several  subfamilies. In humans, the jumonji domain-containing Lysine (K)-Specific  Demethylase 5/Jumonji and ARID Domain Protein (KDM5/JARID) subfamily demethylases  are specific for histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and are important  drug targets for cancer treatment. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the KDM5/JARID  subfamily H3K4me3 demethylase JUMONJI14 (JMJ14) plays important roles in  flowering, gene silencing, and DNA methylation. Here, we report the crystal  structures of the JMJ14 catalytic domain in both substrate-free and bound forms.  The structures reveal that the jumonji and C5HC2 domains contribute to the  specific recognition of the H3R2 and H3Q5 to facilitate H3K4me3 substrate  specificity. The critical acidic residues are conserved in plants and animals  with the corresponding mutations impairing the enzyme activity of both JMJ14 and  human KDM5B, indicating a common substrate recognition mechanism for KDM5  subfamily demethylases shared by plants and animals and further informing efforts  to design targeted inhibitors of human KDM5.', '2018 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00666', 'ORCID:']
