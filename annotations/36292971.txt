GDSL-type esterase/lipase (GELP) enzymes have key functions in plants, such as developmental processes, anther and pollen development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Genes that encode GELP belong to a complex and large gene family, ranging from tens to more than hundreds of members per plant species. To facilitate functional transfer between them, we conducted a genome-wide classification of GELP in 46 plant species. First, we applied an iterative phylogenetic method using a selected set of representative angiosperm genomes (three monocots and five dicots) and identified 10 main clusters, subdivided into 44 orthogroups (OGs). An expert curation for gene structures, orthogroup composition, and functional annotation was made based on a literature review. Then, using the HMM profiles as seeds, we expanded the classification to 46 plant species. Our results revealed the variable evolutionary dynamics between OGs in which some expanded, mostly through tandem duplications, while others were maintained as single copies. Among these, dicot-specific clusters and specific amplifications in monocots and wheat were characterized. This approach, by combining manual curation and automatic identification, was effective in characterizing a large gene family, allowing the establishment of a classification framework for gene function transfer and a better understanding of the evolutionary history of GELP.
