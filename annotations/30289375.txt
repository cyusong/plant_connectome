Ectomycorrhizal fungi improve tree phosphorus nutrition through transporters specifically localized at soil-hyphae and symbiotic interfaces. In the model symbiosis between the fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum and the maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), several transporters possibly involved in phosphate fluxes were identified, including three H<sup>+</sup>:Pi transporters. Among these three, we recently unraveled the function of one of them, named HcPT2, in both pure culture and symbiotic interaction with P. pinaster. Here we investigated the transporter named HcPT1.2, by analyzing inorganic phosphate transport ability in a yeast complementation assay, assessing its expression in the fungus associated or not with the plant, and immunolocalizing the proteins in ectomycorrhizas. We also evaluated the effect of external Pi concentration on expression and localization of HcPT1.2. Our results revealed that HcPT1.2 is involved in Pi acquisition by H. cylindrosporum mycelium, irrespective of the external Pi concentrations.
