Hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) is a key reactive oxygen species (ROS) in signal transduction pathways leading to activation of plant defenses against biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we investigated the effects of H(2) O(2) pretreatment on aluminum (Al) induced antioxidant responses in root tips of two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes, Yangmai-5 (Al-sensitive) and Jian-864 (Al-tolerant). Al increased accumulation of H(2) O(2) and O(2) (•-) leading to more predominant lipid peroxidation, programmed cell death and root elongation inhibition in Yangmai-5 than in Jian-864. However, H(2) O(2) pretreatment alleviated Al-induced deleterious effects in both genotypes. Under Al stress, H(2) O(2) pretreatment increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and monodehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase as well as the levels of ascorbate and glutathione more significantly in Yangmai-5 than in Jian-864. Furthermore, H(2) O(2) pretreatment also increased the total antioxidant capacity evaluated as the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-radical scavenging activity and the ferric reducing/antioxidant power more significantly in Yangmai-5 than in Jian-864. Therefore, we conclude that H(2) O(2) pretreatment improves wheat Al acclimation during subsequent Al exposure by enhancing the antioxidant defense capacity, which prevents ROS accumulation, and that the enhancement is greater in the Al-sensitive genotype than in the Al-tolerant genotype.
