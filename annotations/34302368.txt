Various studies showed a decrease of drought stress specific parameters of plants after silicon (Si) fertilization. But all studies differed in soil Si concentration between the control and Si treatments. As amorphous silica (ASi) was recently found to cause a strong increase of water holding capacity and plant available water in soils, a combined effect of soil moisture and plant response due to Si addition was assumed. In this study, the influence of the soil Si content was excluded by using the same Si enriched soil for treatments of two rice lines, lsi1 mutant defective in Si uptake and its wild-type rice. Most plant parameters, such as nutrient contents, biomass, specific leaf area, specific root length, leaf water content and C allocation did not differ significantly between the genotypes neither under flooded conditions, nor under drought conditions. Only photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were slightly higher for the wild type in both drought and flooded treatments. Overall, our data showed that Si accumulation within the plant tissues has only a minor effect on plant performance under drought stress. Hence, existing studies should be reinterpreted in light of the fact that Si additions may increase soil water availability.

soil Si: !increases! water holding capacity 
Si uptake gene: !defective in! lsi1 mutant 
Si uptake gene: !normal in! wild-type rice 
Si accumulation: !has minor effect on! plant performance 
Si addition: !may increase! soil water availability
