['35845633', 'Seed longevity is modulated by multiple genetic factors in Arabidopsis thaliana.  A previous genome-wide association study using the Elevated Partial Pressure of  Oxygen (EPPO) aging assay pinpointed a genetic locus associated with this trait.  Reverse genetics identified the transcription factor DOF4.1 as a novel seed  longevity factor. dof4.1 loss-of-function plants generate seeds exhibiting higher  germination after accelerated aging assays. DOF4.1 is expressed during seed  development and RNAseq data show several putative factors that could contribute  to the dof4.1 seed longevity phenotype. dof4.1 has reduced seed permeability and  a higher levels of seed storage proteins mRNAs (cruciferins and napins) in  developing seeds, as compared to wild-type seeds. It has been reported that  mutant lines defective in cruciferins or napins present reduced seed longevity.  The improved longevity of dof4.1 is totally lost in the quadruple mutant dof4.1  cra crb crc, but not in a dof4.1 line depleted of napins, suggesting a prominent  role for cruciferins in this process. Moreover, a negative regulation of DOF4.1  expression by the transcription factor DOF1.8 is suggested by co-inoculation  assays in Nicotiana benthamiana. Indeed, DOF1.8 expression anticorrelates with  that of DOF4.1 during seed development. In summary, modulation of DOF4.1 levels  during seed development contributes to regulate seed longevity.', '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.915184', 'Gadea']
