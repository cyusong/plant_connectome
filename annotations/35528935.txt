The integration of biochar and deficit irrigation is increasingly being evaluated as a water-saving strategy to minimize crop yield losses under reduced irrigation in arid and semi-arid regions such as West Texas. A 2-year (2019 and 2020) open-field study evaluated the effect of two types of biochar amendments (hardwood and softwood) and three irrigation rates [100, 70, and 40% crop evapotranspiration (ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> ) replacement] on the physiology, plant growth, and yield of sweet corn in semi-arid West Texas. All experimental units were replicated four times in a split-plot design. The chlorophyll content (Chl <sub><i>SPAD</i></sub> ) in 40% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> dropped significantly compared to 100% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> and 70% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> during the reproductive phase. Although water stress under 40% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> decreased photosynthesis (<i>P</i> <sub><i>n</i></sub> ) to limit transpiration (E) by stomatal closure, it improved intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). The above-mentioned gas exchange parameters were comparable between 100% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> and 70% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> . Both biochar treatments increased Chl <sub><i>SPAD</i></sub> content over non-amended plots, however, their effect on gas exchange parameters was non-significant. All growth and yield-related parameters were comparable between 100% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> and 70% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> , but significantly greater than 40% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> , except water productivity (WP). Both deficit irrigation treatments improved WP over full irrigation in 2019, but in 2020, the WP gains were observed only under 70% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> . Hardwood biochar decreased soil bulk density and increased soil porosity, but it had a marginal effect on the water retention characteristics. These results suggest that 70% ET <sub><i>c</i></sub> can be used as an alternative to full irrigation to save water with a minimal yield penalty for sweet corn production in the West Texas region. The hardwood biochar application improved the vegetative biomass significantly but yield marginally during the first 2 years of application. A long-term study is required to test the effect of biochar under deficit irrigation beyond 2 years.
