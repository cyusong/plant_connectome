['29320165', 'Although RNA-binding proteins in plant phloem are believed to perform  long-distance systemic transport of RNA in the phloem conduit, the structure of  none of them is known. Arabidopsis thaliana phloem protein 16-1 (AtPP16-1) is  such a putative mRNA transporter whose structure and backbone dynamics have been  studied at pH 4.1 and 25  degrees C by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. Results obtained using basic optical spectroscopic tools show that  the protein is unstable with little secondary structure near the physiological pH  of the phloem sap. Fluorescence-monitored titrations reveal that AtPP16-1 binds  not only A. thaliana RNA (K(diss)  approximately  67 nM) but also sheared DNA and model  dodecamer DNA, though the affinity for DNA is  approximately 15-fold lower. In the solution  structure of the protein, secondary structural elements are formed by residues  3-9 (beta1), 56-62 (beta2), 133-135 (beta3), and 96-110 (alpha-helix). Most of the rest of the  chain segments are disordered. The N-terminally disordered regions (residues  10-55) form a small lobe, which conjoins the rest of the molecule via a deep and  large irregular cleft that could have functional implications. The average order  parameter extracted by model-free analysis of (15)N relaxation and (1)H-(15)N  heteronuclear NOE data is 0.66, suggesting less restricted backbone motion. The  average conformational entropy of the backbone NH vectors is -0.31 cal mol(-1)  K(-1). These results also suggest structural disorder in AtPP16-1.', '2018 Feb 13', 'Biochemistry', '10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01071', 'ORCID:']
