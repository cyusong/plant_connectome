Phosphorus is one of the essential macronutrients required by plant growth and development, but phosphate resources are finite and diminishing rapidly because of the huge need in global agriculture. In this study, 11 genes were found in the <i>Phosphate Transporter 1</i> (<i>PHT1</i>) family of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. Seven genes of the <i>PHT1</i> family were available by qRT-PCR. Most of them were expressed in roots, and almost all genes were induced by low-phosphate stress in the nodule. The expression of <i>MtPT6</i> was relatively high in nodules and induced by low-phosphate stress. The fusion expression of <i>MtPT6</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> gene in <i>M. truncatula</i> suggested that the expression of <i>MtPT6</i> was induced in roots and nodules by phosphate starvation. In roots, <i>MtPT6</i> was mainly expressed in vascular tissue and tips, and it was also expressed in cortex under low-phosphate stress; in nodules, it was mainly expressed in vascular bundles, cortical cells, and fixation zone cells. MtPT6 had a close relationship with other PHT1 family members according to amino acid alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Subcellular localization analysis in tobacco revealed that MtPT6 protein was localized to the plasma membrane. The heterologous expression of <i>MtPT6</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> knockout mutants of <i>pht1.1</i> and <i>pht1.4</i> made seedlings more susceptible to arsenate treatment, and the phosphate concentrations in <i>pht1.1</i> were higher in high phosphate condition by expressing <i>MtPT6</i>. We conclude that <i>MtPT6</i> is a typical phosphate transporter gene and can promote phosphate acquisition efficiency of plants.
