The recretohalophyte Karelinia caspia is of forage and medical value and can remediate saline soils. We here assess the contribution of primary/secondary metabolism to osmotic adjustment and ROS homeostasis in Karelinia caspia under salt stress using multi-omic approaches. Computerized phenomic assessments, tests for cellular osmotic changes and lipid peroxidation indicated that salt treatment had no detectable physical effect on K. caspia. Metabolomic analysis indicated that amino acids, saccharides, organic acids, polyamine, phenolic acids, and vitamins accumulated significantly with salt treatment. Transcriptomic assessment identified differentially expressed genes closely linked to the changes in above primary/secondary metabolites under salt stress. In particular, shifts in carbohydrate metabolism (TCA cycle, starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis) as well as arginine and proline metabolism were observed to maintain a low osmotic potential. Chlorogenic acid/vitamin E biosynthesis was also enhanced, which would aid in ROS scavenging in the response of K. caspia to salt. Overall, our findings define key changes in primary/secondary metabolism that are coordinated to modulate the osmotic balance and ROS homeostasis to contribute to the salt tolerance of K. caspia.
