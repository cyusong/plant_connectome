['16415206', 'A mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) shuttle that channels cytosolic  reducing equivalent to mitochondria for respiration through oxidoreduction of  G-3-P has been extensively studied in yeast and animal systems. Here, we report  evidence for the operation of such a shuttle in Arabidopsis thaliana. We studied  Arabidopsis mutants defective in a cytosolic G-3-P dehydrogenase, GPDHc1, which,  based on models described for other systems, functions as the cytosolic component  of a G-3-P shuttle. We found that the gpdhc1 T-DNA insertional mutants exhibited  increased NADH/NAD+ ratios compared with wild-type plants under standard growth  conditions, as well as impaired adjustment of NADH/NAD+ ratios under stress  simulated by abscisic acid treatment. The altered redox state of the NAD(H) pool  was correlated with shifts in the profiles of metabolites concerning  intracellular redox exchange. The impairment in maintaining cellular redox  homeostasis was manifest by a higher steady state level of reactive oxygen  species under standard growth conditions and by a significantly augmented  hydrogen peroxide production under stress. Loss of GPDHc1 affected mitochondrial  respiration, particularly through a diminished capacity of the alternative  oxidase respiration pathway. We propose a model that outlines potential  involvements of a mitochondrial G-3-P shuttle in plant cells for redox  homeostasis.', '2006 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039750', 'Zou']
