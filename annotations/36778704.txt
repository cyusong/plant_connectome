Addressing the challenges of climate change and durum wheat production is becoming an important driver for food and nutrition security in the Mediterranean area, where are located the major producing countries (Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey, and Syria). One of the emergent strategies, to cope with durum wheat adaptation, is the exploration and exploitation of the existing genetic variability in landrace populations. In this context, this review aims to highlight the important role of durum wheat landraces as a useful genetic resource to improve the sustainability of Mediterranean agroecosystems, with a focus on adaptation to environmental stresses. We described the most recent molecular techniques and statistical approaches suitable for the identification of beneficial genes/alleles related to the most important traits in landraces and the development of molecular markers for marker-assisted selection. Finally, we outline the state of the art about landraces genetic diversity and signature of selection, already identified from these accessions, for adaptability to the environment.
