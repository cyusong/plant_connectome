Metabolic regulation is one of the main mechanisms involved in the maintenance of cell osmotic potential under abiotic stress. To date, metabolite profiling approaches have been extensively used to characterize the molecular responses to abiotic stress in many plant species. However, studies revealing the specific metabolic responses of plants exposed to water-deficit stress remain limited. Here, we review the most recent developments that advance our understanding of the metabolic response to drought stress in Arabidopsis and rice. We provide an updated schematic overview of the specific metabolic signature of wild-type plants in response to drought.
