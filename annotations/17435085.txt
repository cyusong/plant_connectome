['17435085', 'E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) target proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome.  In SKP1/CDC53/F-box protein-type E3s, substrate specificity is conferred by the  interchangeable F-box protein subunit. The vast majority of the 694 F-box  proteins encoded by the Arabidopsis thaliana genome remain to be understood. We  characterize the VIER F-BOX PROTEINE (VFB; German for FOUR F-BOX PROTEINS) genes  from Arabidopsis that belong to subfamily C of the Arabidopsis F-box protein  superfamily. This subfamily also includes the F-box proteins TRANSPORT INHIBITOR  RESPONSE1 (TIR1)/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) proteins and EIN3 BINDING F-BOX  proteins, which regulate auxin and ethylene responses, respectively. We show that  loss of VFB function causes delayed plant growth and reduced lateral root  formation. We find that the expression of a number of auxin-responsive genes and  the activity of DR5:beta-glucuronidase, a reporter for auxin response, are  reduced in the vfb mutants. This finding correlates with an increase in the  abundance of an AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID repressor. However, we also find that  auxin responses are not affected in the vfb mutants and that a representative VFB  family member, VFB2, cannot functionally complement the tir1-1 mutant. We  therefore exclude the possibility that VFBs are functional orthologs of TIR1/AFB  proteins.', '2007 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.040675', 'Schwechheimer']
