TbSP1 is a secreted and surface-associated phospholipase A(2) previously found to be up-regulated in C- or N-deprived free-living mycelia from the ectomycorrhizal ascomycete Tuber borchii. As nutrient limitation is considered an important environmental factor favouring the transition to symbiotic status, TbSP1 was suggested to be involved in the formation of mycorrhizas. An in vitro symbiosis system between Cistus incanus and T. borchii was set up: TbSP1 mRNA levels in free-living mycelia and in mycorrhizas sampled in different districts of the plant-fungus interaction were examined. In the same samples, TbSP1 protein expression was analysed by immunoelectron microscopy. A substantially enhanced TbSP1 mRNA expression, compared with nutrient-limited but free-living mycelia, was detected in the presence of the plant and reached maximal levels in fully developed mycorrhizas. A similar expression trend was revealed by immunolocalization experiments. We have shown that TbSP1 appears to respond to two partially overlapping yet distinct stimuli: nutrient starvation and mycorrhiza formation.
