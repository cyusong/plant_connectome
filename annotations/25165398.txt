['25165398', 'Mitochondria are defining components of most eukaryotes. However, higher plant  mitochondria differ biochemically, morphologically, and dynamically from those in  other eukaryotes. FRIENDLY, a member of the CLUSTERED MITOCHONDRIA superfamily,  is conserved among eukaryotes and is required for correct distribution of  mitochondria within the cell. We sought to understand how disruption of FRIENDLY  function in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leads to mitochondrial clustering  and the effects of this aberrant chondriome on cell and whole-plant physiology.  We present evidence for a role of FRIENDLY in mediating intermitochondrial  association, which is a necessary prelude to mitochondrial fusion. We demonstrate  that disruption of mitochondrial association, motility, and chondriome structure  in friendly affects mitochondrial quality control and leads to mitochondrial  stress, cell death, and strong growth phenotypes.', '2014 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.243824', 'ORCID:']
