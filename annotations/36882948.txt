Cadmium (Cd) uptake from polluted soils inhibits plant growth and disturbs physiological processes, at least partly due to disturbances in the cellular redox environment. Although the sulfur-containing antioxidant glutathione is important in maintaining redox homeostasis, its role as an antioxidant can be overruled by its involvement in Cd chelation as a phytochelatin precursor. Following Cd exposure, plants rapidly invest in phytochelatin production, thereby disturbing the redox environment by transiently depleting glutathione concentrations. Consequently, a network of signalling responses is initiated, in which the phytohormone ethylene is an important player involved in the recovery of glutathione levels. Furthermore, these responses are intricately connected to organellar stress signalling and autophagy and contribute to cell fate determination. In general, this may pave the way for acclimation (e.g. restoration of glutathione levels and organellar homeostasis) and plant tolerance in case of mild stress conditions. This review addresses connections between these players and discusses the possible involvement of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide in plant acclimation to Cd exposure.
