Most plants, contrary to popular belief, do not waste over 30% of their photosynthate in a futile cycle called photorespiration. Rather, the photorespiratory pathway generates additional malate in the chloroplast that empowers many energy-intensive chemical reactions, such as those involved in nitrate assimilation. Thus, the balance between carbon fixation and photorespiration determines the plant carbon-nitrogen balance and protein concentrations. Plant protein concentrations, in turn, depend not only on the relative concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the chloroplast but also on the relative activities of magnesium and manganese, which are metals that associate with several key enzymes in the photorespiratory pathway and alter their function. Understanding the regulation of these processes is critical for sustaining food quality under rising CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres.
