['25160622', 'Chorismate mutase converts chorismate into prephenate for aromatic amino acid  biosynthesis. To understand the molecular basis of allosteric regulation in the  plant chorismate mutases, we analyzed the three Arabidopsis thaliana chorismate  mutase isoforms (AtCM1-3) and determined the x-ray crystal structures of AtCM1 in  complex with phenylalanine and tyrosine. Functional analyses show a wider range  of effector control in the Arabidopsis chorismate mutases than previously  reported. AtCM1 is activated by tryptophan with phenylalanine and tyrosine acting  as negative effectors; however, tryptophan, cysteine, and histidine activate  AtCM3. AtCM2 is a nonallosteric form. The crystal structure of AtCM1 in complex  with tyrosine and phenylalanine identifies differences in the effector sites of  the allosterically regulated yeast enzyme and the other two Arabidopsis isoforms.  Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the effector site reveals key features  leading to differential effector regulation in these enzymes. In AtCM1, mutations  of Gly-213 abolish allosteric regulation, as observed in AtCM2. A second effector  site position, Gly-149 in AtCM1 and Asp-132 in AtCM3, controls amino acid  effector specificity in AtCM1 and AtCM3. Comparisons of chorismate mutases from  multiple plants suggest that subtle differences in the effector site are  conserved in different lineages and may lead to specialized regulation of this  branch point enzyme.', '2014 Oct 10', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M114.591123', 'Jez']
