['17264065', 'A new type of protein was found in Arabidopsis thaliana, PCaP1, which is rich in  glutamate and lysine residues. The protein bound (45)Ca(2+) even in the presence  of a high concentration of Mg(2+). Real-time polymerase chain reaction and  histochemical analysis of promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusions revealed that PCaP1  was expressed in most organs. The PCaP1 protein was detected immunochemically in  these organs. Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with Cu(2+), sorbitol, or  flagellin oligopeptide enhanced the transcription. On the other hand, other  sugars, abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, dehydration, and low temperature had  little or no effect on PCaP1 transcript abundance. The transient expression of  PCaP1 fused to green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis cells and the subcellular  fractionation of tissue homogenate showed that PCaP1 protein is localized to the  plasma membrane, although PCaP1 has no predicted transmembrane domain. PCaP1 was  associated with the plasma membrane under natural conditions and was released  from the membrane at high concentrations of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) in vitro. These  results suggest that the hydrophilic protein PCaP1 binds Ca(2+) and other cations  and is stably associated with the plasma membrane.', '2007', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erl284', 'Maeshima']
