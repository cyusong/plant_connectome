Endocytosis regulates many important and diverse processes in eukaryotic life. EH domain containing proteins function as regulators of endocytosis through protein-protein interactions. Several interactors of mammalian EHDs were identified, including clathrin machinery components. The four human EHD proteins share high homology at the protein level and possess similar domains, but appear to be involved in different stages of intracellular trafficking. EHD1 regulates recycling through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). EHD2 has been found to inhibit internalization in mammalians when overexpressed.We have recently investigated the importance of EH domain containing proteins in plant endocytosis. We were able to show that both of the Arabidopsis EHD homologs, termed AtEHD1 and AtEHD2, play important roles in plant endocytosis. Knockdown of AtEHD1 delayed internalization, and overexpression of AtEHD2 inhibited endocytosis. Thus, the function of plant EHDs is highly homologous to that of mammalian EHDs.

EH domain containing proteins: !regulate! endocytosis
AtEHD1: !delays! internalization
AtEHD2: !inhibits! endocytosis
EHD1: !regulates! recycling through ERC
EHD2: !inhibits! internalization
