['17921316', 'Chloroplast development in cotyledons differs in a number of ways from that in  true leaves, but the cotyledon-specific program of chloroplast biogenesis has not  been clarified. The cyo1 mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana has albino cotyledons but  normal green true leaves. Chloroplasts develop abnormally in cyo1 mutant plants  grown in the light, but etioplasts are normal in mutants grown in the dark. We  isolated CYO1 by T-DNA tagging and verified that the mutant allele was  responsible for the albino cotyledon phenotype by complementation. CYO1 has a  C(4)-type zinc finger domain similar to that of Escherichia coli DnaJ. CYO1 is  expressed mainly in young plants under light conditions, and the CYO1 protein  localizes to the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts. Transcription of nuclear  photosynthetic genes is generally unaffected by the cyo1 mutation, but the level  of photosynthetic proteins is decreased in cyo1 mutants. Recombinant CYO1  accelerates disulfide bond reduction in the model substrate insulin and renatures  RNase A, indicating that CYO1 has protein disulfide isomerase activity. These  results suggest that CYO1 has a chaperone-like activity required for thylakoid  biogenesis in cotyledons.', '2007 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.051714', 'Takamiya']
