Decades of research have suggested that AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) is an essential membrane-associated auxin receptor, but recent findings directly contradict this view. Here we show that embryonic lethality observed in <i>abp1-1</i>, which has been a cornerstone of ABP1 studies, is caused by the deletion of the neighbouring <i>BELAYA SMERT</i> (<i>BSM</i>) gene, not by disruption of <i>ABP1.</i> On the basis of our results, we conclude that ABP1 is not essential for <i>Arabidopsis</i> development.

ABP1: !not essential for! Arabidopsis development
abp1-1: !caused by deletion of! BSM gene
