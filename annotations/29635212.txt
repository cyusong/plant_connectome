['29635212', 'In Arabidopsis, a central regulator of copper (Cu) homeostasis is the  transcription factor SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like7 (SPL7). Under Cu  deficiency, SPL7 induces the expression of miR398, which suppresses the  expression of the genes CSD1 and CSD2, which encode cytosolic and chloroplastic  isoforms of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, respectively. Consequently, the limited  Cu is preferentially assigned to plastocyanin, which is essential for  photosynthetic electron transport. Consistent with this function of miR398  related to photosynthesis, its expression is strongly induced in leaves. In this  study, however, we showed that SPL7 was transcribed mainly around the vasculature  in roots, where Cu levels were likely sensed. To test the possible long-distance  signaling of Cu availability from roots to shoots, we conducted a series of  grafting experiments using spl7 mutant and wild-type (WT) plants. Expression of  Cu-responsive microRNAs and the resulting suppression of CSD1 and CSD2 mRNAs were  observed in leaves only when the aerial part was from WT plants, in which a low  level of SPL7 was transcribed also in the vascular tissues. Although local  sensing of Cu was disturbed in the spl7 mutant, the Cu level was not affected in  the shoots. SPL7 is expressed in specific cell layers in both roots and shoots  and locally senses Cu availability, transmitting the information to surrounding  cells.', '2018 May-Jun', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2018.03.014', 'Shikanai']
