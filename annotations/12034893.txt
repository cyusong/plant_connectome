['12034893', 'Plant disease resistance (R) genes mediate specific pathogen recognition, leading  to a successful immune response. Downstream responses include ion fluxes, an  oxidative burst, transcriptional reprogramming, and, in many cases,  hypersensitive cell death at the infection site. We used a transgenic Arabidopsis  line carrying the bacterial avirulence gene avrRpm1 under the control of a  steroid-inducible promoter to select for mutations in genes required for  RPM1-mediated recognition and signal transduction. We identified an allelic  series of eight mutants that also were allelic to the previously identified pbs2  mutation. Positional cloning revealed this gene to be AtRAR1, the Arabidopsis  ortholog of barley RAR1, a known mediator of R function. AtRAR1 is required for  both full hypersensitive cell death and complete disease resistance mediated by  many, but not all, tested R genes. Double mutant analysis of Atrar1 in  combination with the R signal intermediate ndr1 suggests that AtRAR1 and NDR1 can  operate in both linear and parallel signaling events, depending on the R gene  function triggered. In Atrar1 null plants, the levels of RPM1-myc are reduced  severely, suggesting that AtRAR1 may regulate R protein stability or  accumulation.', '2002 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.001032', 'Dangl']
