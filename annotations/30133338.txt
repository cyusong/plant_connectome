We identified a protein spot showing downregulation in the presence of Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 and tannic acid supplementation as a septin subunit with the highest homology to the Aspergillus nidulans aspA gene, an ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc11 gene. To analyze the functional role of this septin component (CpSep1), we constructed its null mutant and obtained a total of eight CpSep1-null mutants from 137 transformants. All CpSep1-null mutants showed retarded growth, with fewer aerial mycelia and intense pigmentation on plates of potato dextrose agar supplemented with L-methionine and biotin. When the marginal hyphae were examined, hyperbranching was observed in contrast to the wild type. The inhibition of colonial growth was partially recovered when the CpSep1-null mutants were cultured in the presence of the osmostabilizing sorbitol. Conidia production of the CpSep1-null mutants was significantly increased by at least 10-fold more. Interestingly, the conidial morphology of the CpSep1-null mutants changed to circular in contrast to the typical rod-shaped spores of the wild type, indicating a role of septin in the spore morphology of Cryphonectria parasitica. However, no differences in the germination process were observed. Virulence assays using excised chestnut bark, stromal pustule formation on chestnut stems, and apple inoculation indicated that the CpSep1 gene is important in pathogenicity.
