Physiological and iTRAQ based proteomic analysis provided new insights into potassium deficiency stress response in alligator weed root. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) has a strong ability to adapt to potassium deficiency (LK) stress. Proteomic changes in response to this stress are largely unknown in alligator weed. In this study, we investigated physiological and molecular mechanisms under LK using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation to characterize proteome-level changes in this plant. First, root physiology, 2, 3, 5-Triphenyl-trazolium chloride (TTC) assay and peroxidase activity were significantly altered after 10 and 15 days of LK treatment. The comparative proteomic analysis suggested a total of 375 proteins were differential abundance proteins. The proteomic results were verified by western blot assays and quantitative real-time PCR. Correlation analysis of transcription and proteomics suggested protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, endocytosis, and spliceosome pathways were significantly enriched. The protein responsible for energy metabolism, signal sensing and transduction and protein degradation played crucial roles in this stress. Twelve ubiquitin pathway related proteins were identified in our study, among them 11 proteins were up-regulated. All protein ubiquitination of lysine using pan antibodies were also increased after LK treatment. Our study provide a valuable insights of molecular mechanism underlying LK stress response in alligator weed roots and afford a vital basis to further study potassium nutrition molecular breeding of other plant species.
