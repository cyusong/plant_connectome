Long-distance wound signalling in plants involves systemic propagation of calcium waves, but the exact process of initiation and transmission of these waves remains elusive. A new study proposes a mechanism whereby pressure changes are the trigger for this response.

Gene: !affects! Pressure changes 
Gene: !initiates! Calcium waves 
Gene: !transmits! Calcium waves
