A basic endopolygalacturonase (PG) isoform, produced early by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum when infecting soybean seedlings, was used to examine the signaling role of the enzyme in aequorin-expressing soybean cells. A cytosolic Ca2+ elevation was induced, with a rapid increase (phase 1) and a very slow decrease (phase 2) of Ca2+ concentration, indicating the involvement of Ca2+ ions in PG signaling. Within 1 h of PG-cell contact a remarkable level of cell death was recorded, significantly higher than the control cell culture turnover. The observed morphological and biochemical changes were indicative of the activation of programmed cell death; in particular, cytochrome c release in the cytoplasm and activation of both caspase 9-like and caspase 3-like proteases were found. When a polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) and the PG were simultaneously applied to cells, both the Ca2+ increase and cell death were annulled. The possible roles of prolonged sustained cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in inducing cell death and of the PG-PGIP interaction in preventing PG signaling are discussed.

PG: !induces! Ca2+ elevation 
Ca2+ elevation: !causes! cell death 
PGIP: !inhibits! PG signaling 
PG-PGIP interaction: !prevents! PG signaling
