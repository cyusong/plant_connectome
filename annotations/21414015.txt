Mutations in a mitochondrial or nuclear gene encoding respiratory chain complex I subunits lead to decreased or a total absence of complex I activity. Plant mutants with altered or lost complex I activity adapt their respiratory metabolism by inducing alternative pathways of the respiratory chain and changing energy metabolism. Apparently, complex I is a crucial component of the oxidation-reduction (redox) regulatory system in photosynthetic cells, and alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC) cannot fully compensate for its impairment. In most cases, dysfunction of complex I is associated with lowered or unchanged hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) concentrations, but increased superoxide (O(2)(-)) levels. Higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria in the mosaic (MSC16) cucumber mutant may be related to retrograde signalling. Different effects of complex I dysfunction on H(2)O(2) and O(2)(-) levels in described mutants might result from diverse regulation of processes involved in H(2)O(2) and O(2)(-) production. Often, dysfunction of complex I did not lead to oxidative stress, but increased the capacity of the antioxidative system and enhanced stress tolerance. The new cellular homeostasis in mutants with dysfunction of complex I allows growth and development, reflecting the plasticity of plant metabolism.
