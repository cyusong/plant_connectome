Among the diverse array of heat shock proteins across the three domains of life, mitochondria-targeted small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are evolved in the plant lineage. However, they remained mysterious and understudied. In this study, we reported a systematic study of a novel mitochondria-targeted nuclear sHSP from eggplant (<i>Solanum melongena</i> L.; SmsHSP24.1). Differential expression of <i>SmsHSP24.1</i> indicated its positive role exerted during stress conditions. <i>Escherichia coli</i>-BL21 cell line overexpressing the <i>SmsHSP24.1</i> showed excellent thermo-tolerance ability, tolerating up to 52°C. Spectrometry and electron microscopy revealed a multimeric structure of the protein which acted as a molecular chaperone at high temperatures. Overexpression of <i>SmsHSP24.1</i> significantly enhanced resistance against heat, drought, and salt stresses and showed rapid germination in constitutively overexpressed eggplant lines. RNA-seq analysis reveals an apparent upregulation of a set of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes of the glutathione (GHS) pathway and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Significant upregulation was also observed in auxin biosynthesis and cell-wall remodeling transcripts in overexpressed lines. qPCR, biochemical and physiological analysis further aligned with the finding of transcriptome analysis and suggested an essential role of <i>SmsHSP24.1</i> under various stress responses and positive physiological influence on the growth of eggplants. Therefore, this gene has immense potential in engineering stress-resilient crop plants.
