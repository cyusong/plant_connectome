In pollen and pollen tubes, immotile sperm cells are enclosed by an inner vegetative plasma membrane (IVPM), a single endomembrane originating from the vegetative-cell plasma membrane. It is widely believed that sperm cells must be removed from the IVPM prior to gamete associations and fusions; however, details of the timing and morphological changes upon IVPM dissociation remain elusive. Here, we report a rapid IVPM breakdown immediately before double fertilization in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The IVPM was stably observed in coiling pollen tubes when pollen tube discharge was prevented using <i>lorelei</i> mutant ovules. In contrast, a semi-<i>in vivo</i> fertilization assay in wild-type ovules demonstrated fragmented IVPM around sperm nuclei 1 min after pollen tube discharge. These observations revealed the dynamic alteration of released sperm cells and provided new insights into double fertilization in flowering plants. With a summary of recent findings on IVPM lipid composition, we discussed the possible physiological signals controlling IVPM breakdown.
