Rhizobium nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis occurs in two taxonomic lineages: legumes (Fabaceae) and the genus <i>Parasponia</i> (Cannabaceae). Both symbioses are initiated upon the perception of rhizobium-secreted lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs), called Nod factors. Studies in the model legumes <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> showed that rhizobium LCOs are perceived by a heteromeric receptor complex of distinct Lys motif (LysM)-type transmembrane receptors named NOD FACTOR RECEPTOR1 (LjNFR1) and LjNFR5 (<i>L. japonicus</i>) and LYSM DOMAIN CONTAINING RECEPTOR KINASE3 (MtLYK3)-NOD FACTOR PERCEPTION (MtNFP; <i>M. truncatula</i>). Recent phylogenomic comparative analyses indicated that the nodulation traits of legumes, <i>Parasponia</i> spp., as well as so-called actinorhizal plants that establish a symbiosis with diazotrophic <i>Frankia</i> spp. bacteria share an evolutionary origin about 110 million years ago. However, the evolutionary trajectory of LysM-type LCO receptors remains elusive. By conducting phylogenetic analysis, transcomplementation studies, and CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in <i>Parasponia andersonii</i>, we obtained insight into the origin of LCO receptors essential for nodulation. We identified four LysM-type receptors controlling nodulation in <i>P. andersonii</i>: <i>PanLYK1</i>, <i>PanLYK3</i>, <i>PanNFP1</i>, and <i>PanNFP2</i> These genes evolved from ancient duplication events predating and coinciding with the origin of nodulation. Phylogenetic and functional analyses associated the occurrence of a functional NFP2-orthologous receptor to LCO-driven nodulation. Legumes and <i>Parasponia</i> spp. use orthologous LysM-type receptors to perceive rhizobium LCOs, suggesting a shared evolutionary origin of LCO-driven nodulation. Furthermore, we found that both PanLYK1 and PanLYK3 are essential for intracellular arbuscule formation of mutualistic endomycorrhizal fungi. PanLYK3 also acts as a chitin oligomer receptor essential for innate immune signaling, demonstrating functional analogy to CHITIN ELECITOR RECEPTOR KINASE-type receptors.
