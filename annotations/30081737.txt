Abscisic acid (ABA) plays pivotal roles in plant growth and development and in responses to diverse stresses. It also modulates the growth of primary and lateral roots. Much evidence indicated that key cellular components auxin, ethylene, PLETHs, reactive oxygen species and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are involved in the regulation of ABA suppression of root elongation. In this review, we summary the molecular mechanism for ABA inhibiting primary root growth, focusing on the roles of these components in Arabidopsis.
