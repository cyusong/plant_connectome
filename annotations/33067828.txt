Legumes form a symbiosis with atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub> )-fixing soil rhizobia, resulting in new root organs called nodules that enable N<sub>2</sub> -fixation. Nodulation is a costly process that is tightly regulated by the host through autoregulation of nodulation (AON) and nitrate-dependent regulation of nodulation. Both pathways require legume-specific CLAVATA/ESR-related (CLE) peptides. Nitrogen-induced nodulation-suppressing CLE peptides have not previously been investigated in Medicago truncatula, for which only rhizobia-induced MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 have been characterised. Here, we report on novel peptides MtCLE34 and MtCLE35 in nodulation control. The nodulation-suppressing CLE peptides of five legume species were classified into three clades based on sequence homology and phylogeny. This approached identified MtCLE34 and MtCLE35 and four new CLE peptide orthologues of Pisum sativum. Whereas MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 are induced by rhizobia, MtCLE34 and MtCLE35 respond to both rhizobia and nitrate. MtCLE34 was identified as a pseudogene lacking a functional CLE-domain. MtCLE35 was found to inhibit nodulation in a SUNN- and RDN1-dependent manner via overexpression analysis. Together, our findings indicate that MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 have a specific role in AON, while MtCLE35 regulates nodule numbers in response to both rhizobia and nitrate. MtCLE34 likely had a similar role to MtCLE35, but its function was lost due to a premature nonsense mutation.
