['11115893', 'To assess the functional significance of adenosine salvage in plants, the cDNAs  and genes encoding two isoforms of adenosine kinase (ADK) were isolated from  Arabidopsis. The ADK1- and ADK2-coding sequences are very similar, sharing 92%  and 89% amino acid and nucleotide identity, respectively. Each cDNA was  overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the catalytic activity of each isoform was  determined. Both ADKs had similar catalytic properties with a K(m) and  V(max)/K(m) for adenosine of 0.3 to 0.5 microM and 5.4 to 22 L min(-1) mg(-1)  protein, respectively. The K(m) and V(max)/K(m) for the cytokinin riboside  N(6)(isopentenyl) adenosine are 3 to 5 microM and 0.021 to 0.14 L min(-1) mg(-1)  protein, respectively, suggesting that adenosine is the preferred substrate for  both ADK isoforms. In Arabidopsis plants, both ADK genes are expressed  constitutively, with the highest steady-state mRNA levels being found in stem and  root. ADK1 transcript levels were generally higher than those of ADK2. ADK enzyme  activity reflected relative ADK protein levels seen in immunoblots for leaves,  flowers, and stems but only poorly so for roots, siliques, and dry seeds. The  catalytic properties, tissue accumulation, and expression levels of these ADKs  suggest that they play a key metabolic role in the salvage synthesis of  adenylates and methyl recycling in Arabidopsis. They may also contribute to  cytokinin interconversion.', '2000 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.124.4.1775', 'von']
