['25188390', 'In plants, innate immune responses are initiated by plasma membrane-located  pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) upon recognition of elicitors, including  exogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous  damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Arabidopsis thaliana produces more  than 1000 secreted peptide candidates, but it has yet to be established whether  any of these act as elicitors. Here we identified an A. thaliana gene family  encoding precursors of PAMP-induced secreted peptides (prePIPs) through an  in-silico approach. The expression of some members of the family, including  prePIP1 and prePIP2, is induced by a variety of pathogens and elicitors.  Subcellular localization and proteolytic processing analyses demonstrated that  the prePIP1 product is secreted into extracellular spaces where it is cleaved at  the C-terminus. Overexpression of prePIP1 and prePIP2, or exogenous application  of PIP1 and PIP2 synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal conserved  regions in prePIP1 and prePIP2, enhanced immune responses and pathogen resistance  in A. thaliana. Genetic and biochemical analyses suggested that the receptor-like  kinase 7 (RLK7) functions as a receptor of PIP1. Once perceived by RLK7, PIP1  initiates overlapping and distinct immune signaling responses together with the  DAMP PEP1. PIP1 and PEP1 cooperate in amplifying the immune responses triggered  by the PAMP flagellin. Collectively, these studies provide significant insights  into immune modulation by Arabidopsis endogenous secreted peptides.', '2014 Sep', 'PLoS Pathog', '10.1371/journal.ppat.1004331', 'Zhang']
