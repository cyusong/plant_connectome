Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) stoichiometric ratios give valuable insight into ecosystem function. The purpose of the present study is to probe into the C, N, and P stoichiometric characteristics in various organs and their relationships with soil factors of the dominant deciduous conifer plant species (<i>Taxodium ascendens</i> and <i>Taxodium distichum</i>) during afforestation in the riparian zone of Three Gorges Reservoir. The results showed only a small change in the concentration of C in different plant organs and soils. <i>T. ascendens</i> contained mean N and P concentrations of 7.63 and 1.54 g/kg in fine roots, 5.10 and 0.56 g/kg in stems, and 15.48 and 2.30 g/kg in leaves, respectively. Whereas <i>T. distichum</i> had a mean N and P concentration of 7.08 and 1.37 g/kg in fine roots, 4.84 and 0.59 g/kg in stems, and 16.89 and 2.23 g/kg in leaves. The N:P ratios in all organs were below 14, indicating that N may have inhibited tree growth. The fine roots P and N:P of <i>T. distichum</i> were weak plasticity and weak homeostasis, and those of <i>T. ascendens</i> were plasticity and weak plasticity. Their stems and leaves adhere to strict homeostasis. N concentrations were significantly positively related to P concentrations in every tissue (except the stems of <i>T. ascendens</i>), and C concentrations were significantly positively associated with P concentrations in the stems and leaves of <i>T. ascendens</i> and <i>T. distichum</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Likewise, soil P and fine root P were positively associated (<i>p</i> < 0.01). This study contributes to the understanding of deciduous conifer plant stoichiometry. It demonstrates N, P, and N:P stoichiometric homeostasis in <i>T. ascendens</i> and <i>T. distichum</i>, which can withstand flooding and are suitable for vegetation restoration in the hydro-fluctuation zone.
