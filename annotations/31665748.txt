In plants, a large root system improves the uptake of water and nutrients, and is important for responding to drought stress. The poplar WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) transcription factor promotes adventitious rooting, but its regulation of root growth in response to drought stress remains elusive. In this study, we found that PagWOX11/12a from hybrid poplar 84K (Populus alba×Populus glandulosa) is expressed predominantly in the roots and is strongly induced by drought stress. Compared with non-transgenic 84K plants, transgenic poplar plants overexpressing PagWOX11/12a displayed increased root biomass and enhanced drought tolerance, while opposite phenotypes were observed for PagWOX11/12a dominant repression plants. PagWOX11/12a functions as a nuclear transcriptional activator with a transactivation domain at the C-terminus. In addition, PagERF35 was found to specifically bind to a dehydration-responsive element (DRE) within the PagWOX11/12a promoter and activate PagWOX11/12a gene expression. These results indicate that PagERF35 may activate PagWOX11/12a expression in response to drought stress by promoting root elongation and biomass, thereby increasing drought tolerance of poplar.
