Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is involved in stress signalling but its signalling function remains largely unknown in crop plants. Here, we report that the PI-PLC4 from rice (Oryza sativa cv), OsPLC4, plays a positive role in osmotic stress response. Two independent knockout mutants, plc4-1 and plc4-2, exhibited decreased seedling growth and survival rate whereas overexpression of OsPLC4 improved survival rate under high salinity and water deficiency, compared with wild type (WT). OsPLC4 hydrolyses PI, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub> ) to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) in vitro. Knockout of OsPLC4 attenuated salt-induced increase of phosphatidic acid (PA) whereas overexpression of OsPLC4 decreased the level of PI4P and PIP<sub>2</sub> under salt treatment. Applications of DAG or PA restored the growth defect of plc4-1 to WT but DAG kinase inhibitor 1 blocked the complementary effect of DAG in plc4-1 under salt stress. In addition, the loss of OsPLC4 compromised the increase of inositol triphosphate and free cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> ) and inhibited the induction of genes involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and osmotic stress response to salt stress. The results indicate that OsPLC4 modulates the activity of two signalling pathways, PA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> , to affect rice seedling response to osmotic stress.
