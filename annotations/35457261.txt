High light intensity as one of the stresses could lead to generation of large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants, resulting in severe plant growth retardation. The photorespiration metabolism plays an important role in producing and removing a variety of ROS, maintaining the dynamic balance of the redox reaction, and preventing photoinhibition. <i>Arabidopsis</i> hydroxypyruvate reductase 1 (HPR1) is a primary metabolic enzyme in the photorespiration cycle. However, the role of HPR1 in plants response to high light is not clear. Here, we found that the expression of <i>HPR1</i> could be induced by high light intensity. The growth and photosynthetic capacity of <i>hpr1</i> mutants are seriously affected under high light intensity. The absence of HPR1 suppresses the rates of photorepair of Photosystem II (PSII), aggravates the production of ROS, and accelerates photorespiration rates. Moreover, the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes in the <i>hpr1</i> mutants is significantly higher. These results indicate that HPR1 is involved in plant response to high light intensity and is essential for maintaining the dynamic balance of ROS and photorespiration.
