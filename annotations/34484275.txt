Deficit irrigation (DI) is an irrigation scheduling technique that is used in grapes to improve red color development; however, results are not always satisfactory in table grapes. The red color in grapes is mainly due to the plant pigment anthocyanin. In the present study, the anthocyanin biosynthesis in Scarlet Royal grapes (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) grown in the San Joaquin and Coachella Valleys, and subjected to two different DI strategies was investigated. The objective of this study was to identify potential regulatory factors that may lead to potential treatments to improve red color in table grapes, especially under warm climate conditions. In both locations, DI induced the expression of several genes involved in three major pathways that control the red color in table grapes: anthocyanin biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, and antioxidant system. DI at veraison induced anthocyanin accumulation and enhanced red color in berries at harvest time. However, anthocyanin accumulation was lower at the Coachella Valley compared to the San Joaquin Valley. The lower level of anthocyanin was associated with lower expression of critical genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, such as <i>flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase</i> (<i>UFGT</i>), myb-related regulatory gene (<i>R2R3-MYB)</i> (<i>MYBA1</i>), <i>basic helix-loop-helix</i> (bHLH) (<i>MYCA1</i>) and the <i>tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat (WDR or WD40) proteins</i> (<i>WDR1</i>). Further, gene expression analysis revealed the association of ABA biosynthesis gene <i>9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase</i> (<i>NCED1</i>), <i>1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase</i> (<i>ACO3</i>), and the gibberellic acid (GA) catabolic gene <i>GA2 oxidase</i> (<i>GA2ox1</i>) in the induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis. An increase in the <i>chalcone synthase</i> gene (<i>CHS2</i>) was observed in response to DI treatments in both sites. However, <i>CHS2</i> expression was higher in Coachella Valley after ending the DI treatment, suggesting the involvement of environmental stress in elevating its transcripts. This data was also supported by the lower level of antioxidant gene expression and enzyme activities in the Coachella Valley compared to the San Joaquin Valley. The present data suggested that the lack of grape red coloration could partially be due to the lower level of antioxidant activities resulting in accelerated anthocyanin degradation and impaired anthocyanin biosynthesis. It seems that under challenging warmer conditions, several factors are required to optimize anthocyanin accumulation via DI, including an active antioxidant system, proper light perception, and hormonal balance.
