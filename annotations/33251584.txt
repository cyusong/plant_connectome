The mechanism of heat stress response in plants has been studied, focusing on the function of transcription factors (TFs). Generally, TFs recruit coactivators, such as Mediator, are needed to assemble the transcriptional machinery. However, despite the close relationship with TFs, how coactivators are involved in transcriptional regulation under heat stress conditions is largely unclear. We found a severe thermosensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis mutants of MED14 and MED17. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that a quarter of the heat stress (HS)-inducible genes were commonly downregulated in these mutants. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that the recruitment of Mediator by HsfA1s, the master regulators of heat stress response, is an important step for the expression of HS-inducible genes. There was a differential requirement of Mediator among genes; TF genes have a high requirement whereas heat shock proteins (HSPs) have a low requirement. Furthermore, artificial activation of HsfA1d mimicking perturbation of protein homeostasis induced HSP gene expression without MED14 recruitment but not TF gene expression. Considering the essential role of MED14 in Mediator function, other coactivators may play major roles in HSP activation depending on the cellular conditions. Our findings highlight the importance of differential recruitment of Mediator for the precise control of HS responses in plants.
