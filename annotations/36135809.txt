Anthers express the most genes of any plant organ, and their development involves sequential redifferentiation of many cell types to perform distinctive roles from inception through pollen dispersal. Agricultural yield and plant breeding depend on understanding and consequently manipulating anthers, a compelling motivation for basic plant biology research to contribute. After stamen initiation, two theca form at the tip, and each forms an adaxial and abaxial lobe composed of pluripotent Layer 1-derived and Layer 2-derived cells. After signal perception or self-organization, germinal cells are specified from Layer 2-derived cells, and these secrete a protein ligand that triggers somatic differentiation of their neighbors. Historically, recovery of male-sterile mutants has been the starting point for studying anther biology. Many genes and some genetic pathways have well-defined functions in orchestrating subsequent cell fate and differentiation events. Today, new tools are providing more detailed information; for example, the developmental trajectory of germinal cells illustrates the power of single cell RNA-seq to dissect the complex journey of one cell type. We highlight ambiguities and gaps in available data to encourage attention on important unresolved issues.
