Nanoparticles (NPs) enhance soybean growth; however, their precise mechanism is not clearly understood. To develop a more effective method using NPs for the enhancement of soybean growth, fiber crosslinked with zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs was prepared. The solution of ZnO NPs with 200 nm promoted soybean growth at the concentration of 10 ppm, while fibers crosslinked with ZnO NPs promoted growth at a 1 ppm concentration. Soybeans grown on fiber cross-linked with ZnO NPs had higher Zn content in their roots than those grown in ZnO NPs solution. To study the positive mechanism of fiber crosslinked with ZnO NPs on soybean growth, a proteomic technique was used. Proteins categorized in photosynthesis and secondary metabolism accumulated more in soybeans grown on fiber crosslinked with ZnO NPs than in those grown in ZnO NPs solution. Furthermore, significantly accumulated proteins, which were NADPH oxidoreductase and tubulins, were confirmed using immunoblot analysis. The abundance of NADPH oxidoreductase increased in soybean by ZnO NPs application. These results suggest that fiber crosslinked with ZnO NPs enhances soybean growth through the increase of photosynthesis and secondary metabolism. Additionally, the accumulation of NADPH oxidoreductase might relate to the effect of auxin with fiber crosslinked with ZnO NPs on soybean growth.
