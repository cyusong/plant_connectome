The Brassicaceae is an important plant family. We built a user-friendly, web-based, comparative, and functional genomic database, The Brassicaceae Genome Resource (TBGR, http://www.tbgr.org.cn), based on 82 released genomes from 27 Brassicaceae species. The TBGR database contains a large number of important functional genes, including 4,096 glucosinolate genes, 6,625 auxin genes, 13,805 flowering genes, 36,632 resistance genes, 1,939 anthocyanin genes, and 1,231 m6A genes. A total of 1,174,049 specific guide sequences for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and 5,856,479 transposable elements were detected in Brassicaceae. TBGR also provides information on synteny, duplication, and orthologs for 27 Brassicaceae species. The TBGR database contains 1,183,851 gene annotations obtained using the TrEMBL, Swiss-Prot, Nr, GO, and Pfam databases. The BLAST, Synteny, Primer Design, Seq_fetch, and JBrowse tools are provided to help users perform comparative genomic analyses. All the genome assemblies, gene models, annotations, and bioinformatics results can be easily downloaded from the TBGR database. We plan to improve and continuously update the database with newly assembled genomes and comparative genomic studies. We expect the TBGR database to become a key resource for the study of the Brassicaceae.
