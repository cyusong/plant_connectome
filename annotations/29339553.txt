One of the major challenges in today's agriculture is to achieve enhanced plant growth and biomass even under adverse environmental conditions. Recent advancements in genetics and molecular biology have enabled the identification of a complex signaling network contributing toward plant growth and development on the one hand and abiotic stress response on the other hand. As an outcome of these studies, three major approaches have been identified as having the potential to improve biomass production in plants under abiotic stress conditions. These approaches deal with having changes in the following: (i) plant-microbe interactions; (ii) cell wall biosynthesis; and (iii) phytohormone levels. At the same time, employing functional genomics and genetics-based approaches, a very large number of genes have been identified that play a key role in abiotic stress tolerance. Our Minireview is an attempt to unveil the cross-talk that has just started to emerge between the transcriptional circuitries for biomass production and abiotic stress response. This knowledge may serve as a valuable resource to eventually custom design the crop plants for higher biomass production, in a more sustainable manner, in marginal lands under variable climatic conditions.
