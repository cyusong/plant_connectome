Bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) is an economically important virus that induces tumourigenic pathologies in horses and cows. Given that the BPV-1 L1 major coat protein can self-assemble into highly immunogenic higher-order structures, we transiently expressed it in Nicotiana benthamiana as a prelude to producing a candidate vaccine. It was found that plant codon optimization of L1 gave higher levels of expression than its non-optimized counterpart. Following protein extraction, we obtained high yields (183 mg/kg fresh weight leaf tissue) of relatively pure L1, which had self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs). We found that these VLPs elicited a highly specific and strong immune response, and therefore they may have utility as a potential vaccine. This is the first report demonstrating the viable production of a candidate BPV vaccine protein in plants.
