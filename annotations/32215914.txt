Litter decomposition plays a key role in nutrient cycling across ecosystems, yet to date, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the nonadditive decomposition effects in leaf litter mixing experiments. To fill that gap, we compiled 69 individual studies with the aim to perform two meta-analyses on nonadditive effects. We show that a significant synergistic effect (faster decomposition in mixtures than expected) occurs at a global scale, with an average increase of 3-5% in litter mixtures. In particular, low-quality litter in mixtures shows a significant synergistic effect, while additive effects are observed for high-quality species. Additionally, synergistic effects turn into antagonistic effects when soil fauna are absent or litter is in very late stages of decomposition (near-humus). In contrast to temperate and tropical areas, studies in boreal regions show significant antagonistic effects. Our two meta-analyses provide a systematic evaluation of nonadditive effects in mixed litter decomposition studies and show that litter quality alters the effects of litter mixing. Our results indicate that nutrient transfer, soil fauna and inhibitory secondary compounds can influence mixing effects. We also highlight that synergistic and antagonistic effects occur concurrently, and the final litter mixing effect results from the interplay between them.
