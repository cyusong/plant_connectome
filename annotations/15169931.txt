['15169931', 'Phosphatidic acid is a key intermediate for chloroplast membrane lipid  biosynthesis. De novo phosphatidic acid biosynthesis in plants occurs in two  steps: first the acylation of the sn-1 position of glycerol-3-phosphate giving  rise to lysophosphatidic acid; second, the acylation of the sn-2 position of  lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid. The second step is catalyzed by  a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT). Here we describe the  identification of the ATS2 gene of Arabidopsis encoding the plastidic isoform of  this enzyme. Introduction of the ATS2 cDNA into E. coli JC 201, which is  temperature-sensitive and carries a mutation in its LPAAT gene plsC, restored  this mutant to nearly wild type growth at high temperature. A green-fluorescent  protein fusion with ATS2 localized to the chloroplast. Disruption of the ATS2  gene of Arabidopsis by T-DNA insertion caused embryo lethality. The development  of the embryos was arrested at the globular stage concomitant with a transient  increase in ATS2 gene expression. Apparently, plastidic LPAAT is essential for  embryo development in Arabidopsis during the transition from the globular to the  heart stage when chloroplasts begin to form.', '2004 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pch064', 'Benning']
