The plant <i>Artemisia annua</i> is well known for its production of artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone that is an effective antimalarial compound. Although remarkable progress has been made toward understanding artemisinin biosynthesis, the effect of MADS-box family transcription factors on artemisinin biosynthesis is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified a MADS transcription factor, AaSEP4, that was predominantly expressed in trichome. AaSEP4 acts as a nuclear-localized transcriptional activator activating the expression of <i>AaGSW1 (GLANDULAR TRICHOME-SPECIFIC WRKY1)</i>. Dual-luciferase and Yeast one-hybrid assays revealed that AaSEP4 directly bound to the CArG motif in the promoter region of <i>AaGSW1</i>. Overexpression of <i>AaSEP4</i> in <i>A. annua</i> significantly induced the expression of <i>AaGSW1</i> and four artemisinin biosynthesis genes, including <i>amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS)</i>, <i>cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1)</i>, <i>double-bond reductase 2 (DBR2)</i> and <i>aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)</i>. Furthermore, the results of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the artemisinin content was significantly increased in the <i>AaSEP4-</i>overexpressed plants. In addition, RT-qPCR results showed that <i>AaSEP4</i> was induced by methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) treatment. Taken together, these results explicitly demonstrate that AaSEP4 is a positive regulator of artemisinin biosynthesis, which can be used in the development of high-artemisinin yielding <i>A. annua</i> varieties.
