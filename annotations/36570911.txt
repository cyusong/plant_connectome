Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a regulatory component related to plant signal transduction. To better understand the genome-wide gene expression response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress in pepper plants, a regulatory network of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress-gene expression in pepper leaves and roots was constructed in the present study. We collected the normal tissues of leaves and roots of pepper plants after 40 days of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and obtained the RNA-seq data of leaves and roots exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 0.5-24 h. By comparing the gene responses of pepper leaves and roots exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress for different time periods, we found that the response in roots reached the peak at 3 h, whereas the response in leaves reached the peak at 24 h after treatment, and the response degree in the roots was higher than that in the leaves. We used all datasets for K-means analysis and network analysis identified the clusters related to stress response and related genes. In addition, <i>CaEBS1</i>, <i>CaRAP2</i>, and <i>CabHLH029</i> were identified through a co-expression analysis and were found to be strongly related to several reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme genes; their homologous genes in Arabidopsis showed important functions in response to hypoxia or iron uptake. This study provides a theoretical basis for determining the dynamic response process of pepper plants to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress in leaves and roots, as well as for determining the critical time and the molecular mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress response in leaves and roots. The candidate transcription factors identified in this study can be used as a reference for further experimental verification.
