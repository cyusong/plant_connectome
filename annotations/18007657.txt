['18007657', 'In plants, histone H3 lysine methyltransferases are important in gene silencing  and developmental regulation; however, the roles of histone H4 methylation in  plant development remain unclear. Recent studies found a type II histone arginine  methyltransferase, AtPRTM5, which is involved in promoting growth and flowering.  Here, we purified a dimerized plant-specific histone H4 methyltransferase, plant  histone arginine methyltransferase 10 (PHRMT10), from cauliflower. Arabidopsis  thaliana protein arginine methyltransferase 10 (AtPRMT10)--the Arabidopsis  homologue of PHRMT10--was shown to be a type I PRMT, which preferentially  asymmetrically methylated histone H4R3 in vitro. Genetic disruption of AtPRMT10  resulted in late flowering by upregulating FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) transcript  levels. In addition, we show that AtPRMT10 functions genetically separate from  AtPRMT5, but that each acts to fine-tune expression of FLC. This work adds an  extra layer of complexity to flowering-time regulation and also sheds light on  the importance of asymmetric arginine methylation in plant development.', '2007 Dec', 'EMBO Rep', '10.1038/sj.embor.7401111', 'Cao']
