['11278690', 'A 350-kDa ClpP protease complex with 10 different subunits was identified in  chloroplast of Arabidopsis thaliana, using Blue-Native gel electrophoresis,  followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight and  nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The complex was copurified with the  thylakoid membranes, and all identified Clp subunits show chloroplast targeting  signals, supporting that this complex is indeed localized in the chloroplast. The  complex contains chloroplast-encoded pClpP and six nuclear-encoded proteins  nCpP1-6, as well as two unassigned Clp homologues (nClpP7, nClpP8). An additional  Clp protein was identified in this complex; it does not belong to any of the  known Clp genes families and is here assigned ClpS1. Expression and accumulation  of several of these Clp proteins have never been shown earlier. Sequence and  phylogenetic tree analysis suggests that nClpP5, nClpP2, and nClpP8 are not  catalytically active and form a new group of Clp higher plant proteins,  orthologous to the cyanobacterial ClpR protein, and are renamed ClpR1, -2, and  -3, respectively. We speculate that ClpR1, -2, and -3 are part of the heptameric  rings, whereas ClpS1 is a regulatory subunit positioned at the axial opening of  the ClpP/R core. Several truncations and errors in intron and exon prediction of  the annotated Clp genes were corrected using mass spectrometry data and by  matching genomic sequences with cDNA sequences. This strategy will be widely  applicable for the much needed verification of protein prediction from genomic  sequence. The extreme complexity of the chloroplast Clp complex is discussed.', '2001 May 11', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M010503200', 'van']
