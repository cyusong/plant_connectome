['18392779', 'The phosphatidylinositol phosphate signaling pathway is involved in many crucial  cellular functions. The myo-inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5PTases) (E.C.  3.1.3.56) comprise a large protein family that hydrolyze 5-phosphates from a  variety of phosphatidylinositol phosphate and inositol phosphate substrates. We  previously reported that the At5PTase11 enzyme (At1g47510), which is one of the  smallest predicted 5PTases found in any organism, encodes an active 5PTase whose  activity is restricted to tris- and bis-, but not mono-phosphorylated  phosphatidylinositol phosphate substrates containing a 5-phosphate. This is in  contrast to other unrestricted Arabidopsis 5PTases, which also hydrolyze tris-  and bis inositol phosphate molecules. To further explore the function of  At5PTase11, we have characterized two T-DNA mutants in the At5PTase11 gene, and  have complemented this mutant. Seed from 5ptase11 mutants germinate slower than  wildtype seed and mutant seedlings have decreased hypocotyl growth as compared to  wildtype seedlings when grown in the dark. This phenotype is the opposite of the  increased hypocotyl growth phenotype previously described for other 5ptase  mutants defective in inositol phosphate-specific 5PTase enzymes. By labeling the  endogenous myo-inositol pool in 5ptase11 mutants, we correlated these hypocotyl  growth changes with a small increase in the 5PTase11 substrate,  phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, and decreases in the potential products  of 5PTase11, phosphatidylinositol (3) phosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4)  phosphate. Surprisingly, we also found that dark-grown 5ptase11 mutants contain  increases in inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate and an inositol bisphosphate that is  not a substrate for recombinant 5PTase11. We present a model for regulation of  hypocotyl growth by specific molecules found in this pathway.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9327-3', 'Gillaspy']
