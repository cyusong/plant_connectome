['34002114', 'C-terminal peptidase (Ctp) cleaves the C-terminal extension of the D1 precursor  (pD1) to form mature D1. Among the three homologs CtpA, CtpB, and CtpC in  photosynthetic organisms only the first is capable of processing pD1 while the  roles of CtpB and CtpC remain elusive. Phylogenetic analysis of Ctps from  photosynthetic organisms revealed that CtpA has diverged early from CtpB and CtpC  during evolution implying distinct roles for the Ctps. Analysis of Arabidopsis  Ctp-deficient mutants revealed that pD1 processing was not affected in atctpb,  atctpc, or atctpbatctpc mutants, demonstrating that AtCtpA, not AtCtpB or AtCtpC,  is responsible for cleaving the pD1 C-terminal extension. Ectopic expression of  CtpAs from Synechococcus elongatus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Physcomitrella  patens in atctpa rescued the lethal phenotype of the mutant indicating that  SeCtpA, CrCtpA, and PpCtpA could process pD1 in Arabidopsis. Enzyme activity  assays showed that PpCtpA and CrCtpA could convert pD1 into mature D1 in vitro.  In contrast, expressing CtpB or CtpC from Arabidopsis, C. reinhardtii, or P.  patens in atctpa did not rescue its D1 maturation deficiency, and enzyme activity  assays also showed that neither CtpB nor CtpC could process pD1 in vitro. Taken  together, we conclude that the function of pD1 processing by CtpA is conserved in  photosynthetic organisms. It is possible that among other factors CtpA developed  this function to initiate the formation of the oxygenic D1/D2 type PSII complex  during evolution whereas CtpB or CtpC have other roles that are still unclear.', '2021', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2021.676036', 'Fu']
