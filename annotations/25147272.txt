['25147272', "The synthesis and composition of cell walls is dynamically adapted in response to  many developmental and environmental signals. In this respect, cell wall proteins  involved in controlling cell elongation are critical for cell development.  Transcriptome analysis identified a gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, which was named  proline-rich protein-like, AtPRPL1, based on sequence similarities from a  phylogenetic analysis. The most resemblance was found to AtPRP1 and AtPRP3 from  Arabidopsis, which are known to be involved in root hair growth and development.  In A. thaliana four proline-rich cell wall protein genes, playing a role in  building up the cross-connections between cell wall components, can be  distinguished. AtPRPL1 is a small gene that in promoter::GUS (beta-glucuronidase)  analysis has high expression in trichoblast cells and in the collet. Chemical or  mutational interference with root hair formation inhibited this expression.  Altered expression levels in knock-out or overexpression lines interfered with  normal root hair growth and etiolated hypocotyl development, but Fourier  transform-infrared (FT-IR) analysis did not identify consistent changes in cell  wall composition of root hairs and hypocotyl. Co-localization analysis of the  AtPRPL1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein and different red  fluorescent protein (RFP)-labelled markers confirmed the presence of AtPRPL1-GFP  in small vesicles moving over the endoplasmic reticulum. Together, these data  indicate that the AtPRPL1 protein is involved in the cell's elongation process.  How exactly this is achieved remains unclear at present.", '2014 Oct', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eru308', 'Vissenberg']
