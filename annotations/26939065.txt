['26939065', 'AtGRP3 is a glycine-rich protein (GRP) from Arabidopsis thaliana shown to  interact with the receptor-like kinase AtWAK1 in yeast, in vitro and in planta.  In this work, phenotypic analyses using transgenic plants were performed in order  to better characterize this GRP. Plants of two independent knockout alleles of  AtGRP3 develop longer roots suggesting its involvement in root size  determination. Confocal microscopy analysis showed an abnormal cell division and  elongation in grp3-1 knockout mutants. Moreover, we also show that grp3-1  exhibits an enhanced Aluminum (Al) tolerance, a feature also described in AtWAK1  overexpressing plants. Together, these results implicate AtGRP3 function root  size determination during development and in Al stress.', '2016', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0150583', 'Sachetto-Martins']
