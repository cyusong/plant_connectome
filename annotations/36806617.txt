Stem cell function in different meristems of Arabidopsis is mainly defined by WUSCHEL (WUS)/WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) family proteins. Sugars also have been demonstrated to play pivotal roles in stem cell function and development of plant. As a cytosolic fructose-1.6-bisphosphatase, FRUCTOSE INSENSITIVE1 (FINS1) has been demonstrated to regulate plant growth in response to fructose signaling. So far, it remains to be elucidated how stem cell function is regulated in response to fructose signaling. Our work showed that FINS1 interacts with WUS/WOX protein as a complex, which further binds to WUS/WOX promoter and regulates WUS/WOX expression in response to fructose signaling. FINS1 might act as a bifunctional factor that promotes WUS/WOX expression in the presence of low levels of fructose and represses WUS/WOX expression in the presence of high levels of fructose. Therefore, FINS1 regulates stem cell function in response to fructose signaling during the growth and development of Arabidopsis.
