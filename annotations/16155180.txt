['16155180', 'The two guard cells of a stoma are produced by a single symmetric division just  before terminal differentiation. Recessive mutations in the FOUR LIPS (FLP) gene  abnormally induce at least four guard cells in contact with one another. These  pattern defects result from a persistence of precursor cell identity that leads  to extra symmetric divisions at the end of the cell lineage. FLP is likely to be  required for the correct timing of the transition from cell cycling to terminal  differentiation. FLP encodes a two-repeat (R2R3) MYB protein whose expression  accumulates just before the symmetric division. A paralogous gene, MYB88,  overlaps with FLP function in generating normal stomatal patterning. Plants  homozygous for mutations in both genes exhibit more severe defects than flp  alone, and transformation of flp plants with a genomic MYB88 construct restores a  wild-type phenotype. Both genes compose a distinct and relatively basal clade of  atypical R2R3 MYB proteins that possess an unusual pattern of amino acid  substitutions in their putative DNA binding domains. Our results suggest that two  related transcription factors jointly restrict divisions late in the Arabidopsis  thaliana stomatal cell lineage.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.034116', 'Sack']
