Vesicle trafficking delivers proteins to intracellular and extracellular compartments, cellulose synthase to the plasma membrane, and non-cellulosic polysaccharides to the cell wall. The Arabidopsis genome potentially encodes 19 proteins with sequence similarities to ARFs (ADP-ribosylation factors) and its relatives such as ARLs (ARF-like proteins). ARFs are essential for vesicle coating and uncoating in all eukaryotic cells, while ARLs play more diverse roles. Nine proteins, six of them highly similar, are possible ARFs, three are putative ARL orthologues and the remainder were designated ARF-related proteins. The functions of the six highly similar, putative ARFs in whole plant development were probed by suppressing their expression with antisense. Antisense plants were severely stunted because cell production rate and final cell size were both reduced. Changed time-to-flowering, apical dominance, and fertility may reflect alterations to hormonal and other signalling pathways with which ARFs may interact. No gross changes in targeting or compartmentalization were seen in antisense plants containing GFP targeted to the ER and Golgi and changes in cell wall composition were limited to increases in some non-cellulosic polysaccharides and a relatively small decrease in cellulose. The reasons why these effects are less drastic than the effects on endomembranes and wall composition that are seen in short-term experiments with brefeldin A and with dominant negative ARF mutants are discussed.
