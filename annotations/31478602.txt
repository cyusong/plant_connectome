Photoperiod-dependent flowering in rice is regulated by HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), which acts as both an activator and repressor of flowering in a daylength-dependent manner. To investigate the use of microProteins as a tool to modify rice sensitivity to the photoperiod, we designed a synthetic Hd1 microProtein (Hd1miP) capable of interacting with Hd1 protein, and overexpressed it in rice. Transgenic OX-Hd1miP plants flowered significantly earlier than wild type plants when grown in non-inductive long day conditions. Our results show the potential of microProteins to serve as powerful tools for modulating crop traits and unraveling protein function.
