['15659625', 'The biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, the  two building blocks for isoprenoid biosynthesis, occurs by two independent  pathways in plants. The mevalonic pathway operates in the cytoplasm, and the  methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway operates in plastids. Plastidic  isoprenoids play essential roles in plant growth and development. Plants must  regulate the biosynthesis of isoprenoids to fulfill metabolic requirements in  specific tissues and developmental conditions. The regulatory events that  modulate the plant MEP pathway are not well understood. In this article, we  demonstrate that the CHLOROPLAST BIOGENESIS6 (CLB6) gene, previously shown to be  required for chloroplast development, encodes 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-butenyl  4-diphosphate reductase, the last-acting enzyme of the MEP pathway. Comparative  analysis of the expression levels of all MEP pathway gene transcripts and  proteins in the clb6-1 mutant background revealed that posttranscriptional  control modulates the levels of different proteins in this central pathway.  Posttranscriptional regulation was also found during seedling development and  during fosmidomycin inhibition of the pathway. Our results show that the first  enzyme of the pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, is feedback  regulated in response to the interruption of the flow of metabolites through the  MEP pathway.', '2005 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.028860', 'Leon']
