495 bZIP members with 12 subfamilies were identified in the five diploid cottons. Segmental duplication events in cotton ancestor might have led to primary expansion of the cotton bZIP members. The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor is one of the largest and most diverse families in plants. The evolutionary history of the bZIP family is still unclear in cotton. In this study, a total of 495 bZIP members were identified in five diploid Gossypium species, including 100 members in Gossypium arboreum, 104 members in Gossypium herbaceum, 95 members in Gossypium raimondii, 96 members in Gossypium longicalyx, and 100 members in Gossypium turneri. The bZIP members could be divided into 12 subfamilies with biased gene proportions, gene structures, conserved motifs, expansion rates, gene loss rates, and cis-regulatory elements. A total of 239 duplication events were identified in the five Gossypium species, and mainly occurred in their common ancestor. Furthermore, some GabZIPs and GhebZIPs could be regarded as important candidates in cotton breeding. The bZIP members had a conserved and divergent evolution in the five diploid Gossypium species. The current study laid an important foundation on the evolutionary history of the bZIP family in cotton.
