Aerial plant surfaces are coated by a cuticular wax layer to protect against environmental stresses, such as desiccation. In this study, we investigated the functional relationship between MYB94 and MYB96 transcription factors involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis. Both MYB94 and MYB96 transcripts were abundantly expressed in the aerial organs of Arabidopsis, and significantly induced at the same or similar time points under conditions of drought. MYB94 complemented the wax-deficient phenotype of the myb96 loss-of-function mutant under both well-watered and drought stress conditions. The magnitude of decrease in total wax load in the myb94 myb96 double mutant was almost equal to the sum of the reduced wax loads in the individual myb94 and myb96 mutants under both conditions. Leaves of the myb94 myb96 mutant lost water through the cuticle faster than those of myb94 or myb96 plants. Transcript levels of wax biosynthetic genes were decreased in the single mutants, and further reduced in the double mutant, relative to the wild type, under drought and ABA treatment conditions. MYB94 and MYB96 interact with the same regions containing MYB consensus motifs in the promoter regions of wax biosynthetic genes. The data collectively indicate that MYB94 and MYB96 exert an additive effect on cuticular wax biosynthesis, which may represent an efficient adaptive mechanism of response to drought in plants.
