A conserved cysteine residue (C266)-mediated homo-dimerization of SIE3 is required for the ubiquitination and degradation of SIP1 transcription factor in Lotus japonicas CTLH/CRA/RING-containing proteins have been shown to possess E3-ligase activities and are crucial for the regulation of numerous cellular signaling pathways. In our previous studies, SIE3 (SymRK-Interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase), a CTLH/CRA/RING-containing protein from Lotus japonicus, has been shown to associate with both Symbiosis Receptor Kinase (SymRK) and SIP1 (SymRK interacting protein 1) transcription factor, and ubiquitinate SymRK (Yuan et al. Plant Physiol 160 (1):106-117, 2012; Feng et al. Front Plant Sci 11: 795, 2020). Besides, we previously also demonstrated that the residue, cysteine-266 in the CRA (CT11-RanBPM) domain is required for homodimerization of SIE3 and cysteine-266 residue-mediated homodimerization is important for the symbiosic function of SIE3 (Feng et al. 2020). In this report, SIE3 was shown to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of SIP1. The cysteine-266 residue is essential for the E3-ligase activity and is highly conserved in the SIE3-like proteins. Our works refined the working model that homodimerization of SIE3 is required for ubiquitin-related degradation of SIP1 and found a conserved cysteine residue plays a key role in the activity of a plant dimeric E3 ligase.
