Many species of the genus <i>Kalanchoe</i> are important horticultural plants. They have evolved the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway to allow them to be better adapted to dry environments. Despite their importance, it is still debating whether <i>Kalanchoe</i> is monophyletic, and understanding the past diversification of this genus requires a tremendous amount of effort and work being devoted to the studies of morphological and molecular characters of this genus. However, molecular information, plastic sequence data, in particular, reported on <i>Kalanchoe</i> species is scarce, and this has posed a great challenge in trying to interpret the evolutionary history of this genus. In this study, plastomes of the five <i>Kalanchoe</i> species, including <i>Kalanchoe daigremontiana, Kalanchoe delagoensis, Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi, Kalanchoe longiflora</i>, and <i>Kalanchoe pinnata</i>, were sequenced and analyzed. The results indicate that the five plastomes are comparable in size, guanine-cytosine (GC) contents and the number of genes, which also demonstrate an insignificant difference in comparison with other species from the family Crassulaceae. About 224 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 144 long repeats were identified in the five plastomes, and most of these are distributed in the inverted repeat regions. In addition, highly divergent regions containing either single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or insertion or deletion (InDel) mutations are discovered, which could be potentially used for establishing phylogenetic relationships among members of the <i>Kalanchoe</i> genus in future studies. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses suggest that <i>Bryophyllum</i> should be placed into one single genus as <i>Kalanchoe</i>. Further genomic analyses also reveal that several genes are undergone positive selection. Among them, 11 genes are involved in important cellular processes, such as cell survival, electron transfer, and may have played indispensable roles in the adaptive evolution of <i>Kalanchoe</i> to dry environments.
