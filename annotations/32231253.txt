Potassium (K) is an essential nutrient, but levels of the free K ions (K<sup>+</sup>) in soil are often limiting, imposing a constant stress on plants. We have discovered a calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-dependent signalling network, consisting of two calcineurin B-like (CBL) Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors and a quartet of CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), which plays a key role in plant response to K<sup>+</sup> starvation. The mutant plants lacking two CBLs (CBL2 and CBL3) were severely stunted under low-K conditions. Interestingly, the cbl2 cbl3 mutant was normal in K<sup>+</sup> uptake but impaired in K<sup>+</sup> remobilization from vacuoles. Four CIPKs-CIPK3, 9, 23 and 26-were identified as partners of CBL2 and CBL3 that together regulate K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis through activating vacuolar K<sup>+</sup> efflux to the cytoplasm. The vacuolar two-pore K<sup>+</sup> (TPK) channels were directly activated by the vacuolar CBL-CIPK modules in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, presenting a mechanism for the activation of vacuolar K<sup>+</sup> remobilization that plays an important role in plant adaptation to K<sup>+</sup> deficiency.
