Chlorophylls and carotenoids are synthesized in the chloroplast and chromoplast, respectively. Even though the two pigments are generated from the same precursor, the genetic correlation between chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis has not yet been fully understood. We investigated the genetic correlation of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis during fruit ripening. Two recombinant inbred lines populations, "Long Sweet" × "AC2212" ("LA") RILs derived from a cross between <i>Capsicum annuum</i> "Long Sweet" with light-green and light-red fruit and <i>C. annuum</i> "AC2212" with dark-green and brown-fruit and "3501 (F)" × "3509 (C)" ("FC") RILs from <i>C. annuum</i> "3501" with dark-green and dark-red fruit and <i>C. annuum</i> "3509" with intermediate green and light-red fruit, were used. As the fruit ripened, three accessions produced high levels of xanthophyll. The dark-green immature fruit accumulated more total carotenoids than the light-green fruit. This trend corresponded to the expression pattern of <i>1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase</i> (<i>DXS</i>) and <i>CaGLK2</i> genes during fruit development. The expression levels of <i>DXS</i> and <i>CaGLK2</i> in the dark-green accession "3501" were significantly higher than those of "3509" and "Long Sweet" during the early stages of fruit development. Furthermore, the genotype analysis of the transcription factor controlling chloroplast development (<i>CaGLK2</i>) in LA RILs revealed that <i>CaGLK2</i> expression affected both carotenoid and chlorophyll contents. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage maps were constructed using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) for the two populations, and QTL analysis was performed for green fruit color intensity and carotenoid content. The QTL (<i>LA_BG-CST10</i>) for capsanthin content in LA RILs located at 24.4 to 100.4 Mbp on chromosome 10 was overlapped with the QTL (<i>FC15-Cap10</i>) for capsanthin content in FC RILs. Three QTLs for capsanthin content, American spice trade association (ASTA) value, and immature green fruit color intensity were also overlapped from 178.2 to 204 Mbp on chromosome 10. At the location, 151.6 to 165 Mbp on chromosome 8, QTLs (<i>FC15-tcar8, FC17-ASTA8.1, and FC17-ASTA8.2</i>) for total carotenoid content and ASTA value were discovered, and this region contained <i>2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase</i> (<i>MCT</i>), which is involved in the MEP pathway. This result is the first report to show the correlation between carotenoid and chlorophyll biosynthesis in pepper. This research will expand our understanding of the mechanism of the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition and the development of high pigment pepper varieties.
