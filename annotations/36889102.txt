Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>) are electron mediators involved in various metabolic pathways. NADP(H) are produced by NAD kinase (NADK) through the phosphorylation of NAD(H). The Arabidopsis NADK3 (AtNADK3) is reported to preferentially phosphorylate NADH to NADPH and is localized in the peroxisome. To elucidate the biological function of AtNADK3 in Arabidopsis, we compared metabolites of nadk1, nadk2 and nadk3 Arabidopsis T-DNA inserted mutants. Metabolome analysis revealed that glycine and serine, which are intermediate metabolites of photorespiration, both increased in the nadk3 mutants. Plants grown for 6 weeks under short-day conditions showed increased NAD(H), indicating a decrease in the phosphorylation ratio in the NAD(P)(H) equilibrium. Furthermore, high CO<sub>2</sub> (0.15%) treatment induced a decrease in glycine and serine in nadk3 mutants. The nadk3 showed a significant decrease in post-illumination CO<sub>2</sub> burst, suggesting that the photorespiratory flux was disrupted in the nadk3 mutant. In addition, an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> compensation points and a decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate were observed in the nadk3 mutants. These results indicate that the lack of AtNADK3 causes a disruption in the intracellular metabolism, such as in amino acid synthesis and photorespiration.
