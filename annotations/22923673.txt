The Arabidopsis thaliana leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) is required for the recognition of bacterial flagellin in innate immunity. Recently, FLS2 was proposed to act as a multispecific receptor recognizing unrelated exogenous and endogenous peptide ligands, including CLAVATA3 (CLV3), a key regulator of shoot meristem stem cell production. Here, we report experimental evidence demonstrating that FLS2 does not recognize CLV3 and that the shoot apical meristem is immune to bacteria independently of CLV3 perception.

FLS2: !recognizes! bacterial flagellin 
FLS2: !does not recognize! CLV3 
CLV3: !regulates! shoot meristem stem cell production 
FLS2: !immune to! bacteria
