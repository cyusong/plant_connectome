['17583510', 'Programmed cell death (PCD) is a common host response to microbial infection  [1-3]. In plants, PCD is associated with immunity to biotrophic pathogens, but it  can also promote disease upon infection by necrotrophic pathogens [4]. Therefore,  plant cell-suicide programs must be strictly controlled. Here we demonstrate that  the Arabidopsis thaliana Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1)-associated receptor  Kinase 1 (BAK1), which operates as a coreceptor of BRI1 in brassinolide  (BL)-dependent plant development, also regulates the containment of microbial  infection-induced cell death. BAK1-deficient plants develop spreading necrosis  upon infection. This is accompanied by production of reactive oxygen  intermediates and results in enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal  pathogens. The exogenous application of BL rescues growth defects of bak1 mutants  but fails to restore immunity to fungal infection. Moreover, BL-insensitive and  -deficient mutants do not exhibit spreading necrosis or enhanced susceptibility  to fungal infections. Together, these findings suggest that plant steroid-hormone  signaling is dispensable for the containment of infection-induced PCD. We propose  a novel, BL-independent function of BAK1 in plant cell-death control that is  distinct from its BL-dependent role in plant development.', '2007 Jul 3', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.046', 'Nurnberger']
