Catalase 2 (CAT2) plays an important role in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide released either during photorespiration or as a consequence of biotic and abiotic stress as well as in the initiation of senescence. To date, our understanding of the regulation of CAT2 gene expression is rather poor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that a wide region of the CAT2 promoter is nucleosome depleted, reflecting the ability to rapidly respond to changing environmental and stress conditions and, thus, adjusting the transcript levels of CAT2. The lowest nucleosome density was found in the region of -900 bp relative to the transcription initiation start (TIS) where two regulatory elements are located. The distance of the nucleosome depleted region to the TIS is quite unusual because the majority of nucleosome free regions are generally located in close vicinity to the 5' untranslated region. The analysis of transgenic 5' upstream deletion::gusA Arabidopsis lines showed that this region is important for the regulation of CAT2 promoter activity. To evaluate the function of the two motifs, the contribution of each element to CAT2 promoter activity was analyzed by site directed mutagenesis. The data revealed that the CAT2 promoter is regulated by the ACGT motif (Box2) rather than by the G-Box binding motif (Box1) in the vegetative phase of development. Furthermore, the presence of both Box1 and Box2 positively affected the abundance of activating histone modifications.
