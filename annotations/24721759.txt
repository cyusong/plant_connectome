The IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1 (IRT1) is the principal importer of soil iron in Arabidopsis thaliana. It has a complex intracellular trafficking behavior, including continuous cycling between plasma membrane and endosomes. SORTING NEXIN1 is required for the recycling of endosome-localized IRT1. In its absence, IRT1 is mistargeted for degradation, resulting in reduced plant iron-uptake efficiency. Consequently, IRT1 promoter activity gets limited to a specific portion of the root. We tested the influence of two hormones known to positively affect iron uptake on IRT1 spatial regulation. We found that ethylene treatment in wild-type background mimics the effects of the SNX-loss-of-function situation. Conversely, auxin splits the IRT1 expression zone and forces it toward the two extremities of the root. This shows that IRT1 expression along the root is modulated by ethylene-auxin interplay.
