The interspecific range of epigenetic variation and the degree to which differences between angiosperm species are related to geography, evolutionary history, ecological settings or species-specific traits, remain essentially unexplored. Genome-wide global DNA cytosine methylation is a tractable 'epiphenotypic' feature suitable for exploring these relationships. Global cytosine methylation was estimated in 279 species from two distant, ecologically disparate geographical regions: Mediterranean Spain and tropical México. At each region, four distinct plant communities were analyzed. Global methylation spanned a 10-fold range among species (4.8-42.2%). Interspecific differences were related to evolutionary trajectories, as denoted by a strong phylogenetic signal. Genomes of tropical species were on average less methylated than those of Mediterranean ones. Woody plants have genomes with lower methylation than perennial herbs, and genomes of widespread species were less methylated than those of species with restricted geographical distribution. The eight communities studied exhibited broad and overlapping interspecific variances in global cytosine methylation and only two of them differed in average methylation. Altogether, our broad taxonomic survey supported global methylation as a plant 'epiphenotypic' trait largely associated with species evolutionary history, genome size, range size and woodiness. Additional studies are required for better understanding the environmental components underlying local and geographical variation.
