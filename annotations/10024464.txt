['10024464', 'The complementary DNA (cDNA) coding for Arabidopsis thaliana cytidine deaminase 1  (AT-CDA1) was obtained from the amplified A. thaliana cDNA expression library,  provided by R. W. Davis (Stanford University, CA). AT-CDA1 cDNA was subcloned  into the expression vector pTrc99-A and the protein, expressed in Escherichia  coli following induction with isopropyl 1-thio-beta-d-galactopyranoside, showed  high cytidine deaminase activity. The nucleotide sequence showed a 903-bp open  reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 301 amino acids with a calculated  molecular mass of 32,582. The deduced amino acid sequence of AT-CDA1 showed no  transit peptide for targeting to the chloroplast or mitochondria indicating that  this form of cytidine deaminase is probably expressed in the cytosol. The  recombinant AT-CDA1 was purified to homogeneity by a heat treatment followed by  an ion-exchange chromatography. The final enzyme preparation was >98% pure as  judged by SDS-PAGE and showed a specific activity of 74 U/mg. The molecular mass  of AT-CDA1 estimated by gel filtration was 63 kDa, indicating, in contrast to the  other eukaryotic CDAs, that the enzyme is a dimer composed of two identical  subunits. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy analysis  indicated that the enzyme contains 1 mol of zinc atom per mole of subunit. The  kinetic properties of AT-CDA1 both toward the natural substrates and with analogs  indicated that the catalytic mechanism of the plant enzyme is probably very  similar to that of the human the E. coli enzymes.', '1999 Feb', 'Protein Expr Purif', '10.1006/prep.1998.0959', 'Vita']
