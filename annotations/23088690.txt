A striking characteristic of plant cells is that their organelles can move rapidly through the cell. This movement, commonly referred to as cytoplasmic streaming, has been observed for over 200 years, but we are only now beginning to decipher the mechanisms responsible for it. The identification of the myosin motor proteins responsible for these movements allows us to probe the regulatory events that coordinate organelle displacement with normal cell physiology. This review will highlight several recent developments that have provided new insight into the regulation of organelle movement, both at the cellular level and at the molecular level. [
