Melatonin (MLT) is a bioactive molecule involved in the physiological functioning of plants. Reports related to preharvest applications of melatonin on the postharvest performance of cut flowers are not available in the literature. This study evaluated the effects of different concentrations of exogenous MLT [0 mM (MT0), 0.5 mM (MT1), 0.7 mM (MT2), 1 mM (MT3)] applied preharvest on the physiological characteristics and postharvest performance of cut tuberose, a globally demanded cut flower. The results revealed that all treatments increased postharvest vase life by up to 4 d. The MT1, MT2, and MT3 treatments increased total soluble proteins (TSP) by 25%, 41%, and 17%, soluble sugars (SS) by 21%, 36%, and 33%, an+d postharvest catalase (CAT) activity by 52%, 66%, and 70%, respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) decreased in all preharvest treatments by up to 23% and 56%, respectively. Proline concentration decreased in all treatments, particularly MT3 (38%). These findings suggest that preharvest MLT treatment is a promising strategy for improving the postharvest quality of cut tuberose.
