Inland waters (lakes, reservoirs, streams, and rivers) are often substantial methane (CH(4)) sources in the terrestrial landscape. They are, however, not yet well integrated in global greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. Data from 474 freshwater ecosystems and the most recent global water area estimates indicate that freshwaters emit at least 103 teragrams of CH(4) year(-1), corresponding to 0.65 petagrams of C as carbon dioxide (CO(2)) equivalents year(-1), offsetting 25% of the estimated land carbon sink. Thus, the continental GHG sink may be considerably overestimated, and freshwaters need to be recognized as important in the global carbon cycle.
