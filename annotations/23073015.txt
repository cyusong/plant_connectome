The TIM17:23 complex on the mitochondrial inner membrane is responsible for import of the majority of mitochondrial proteins in plants. In Arabidopsis, Tim17 and Tim23 belong to a large gene family consisting of 16 members termed the Preprotein and Amino acid transporters (PRAT). Recently, two members of this protein family, Tim23-2 and the Complex I subunit B14.7, have been shown to assemble into both Complex I of the respiratory chain and the TIM17:23 complex (Wang et al., 2012), adding to other examples of links between respiratory and protein import complexes. These associations provide a mechanism to coordinate mitochondrial activity and biogenesis.
