Phenolic phytochemicals are known for antioxidant-mediated pharmacological effects in various diseases (diabetes, cancer, CVDs, obesity, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders). However, individual compounds may not exert the same biological potency as in combination with other phytochemicals. <i>Cyamopsis tetragonoloba</i> (Guar), an underutilized semi-arid legume which has been used as a traditional food in Rajasthan (India), is also a source of the important industrial product guar gum. However, studies on its biological activity, like antioxidant, are limited. We tested the effect of <i>C. tetragonoloba</i> seed extract to enhance the antioxidant activity of well-known dietary flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, myricetin, and catechin) and non-flavonoid phenolics (caffeic acid, ellagic acid, taxifolin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and chlorogenic acid) using DPPH radical scavenging assay. The most synergistic combination was further validated for its cytoprotective and anti-lipid peroxidative effects in <i>in vitro</i> cell culture system, at different concentrations of the extract. LC-MS analysis of purified guar extract was also performed. In most cases, we observed synergy at lower concentrations of the seed extract (0.5-1 mg/ml). The extract concentration of 0.5 mg/ml enhanced the antioxidant activity of Epigallocatechin gallate (20 µg/ml) by 2.07-folds, implicating its potential to act as an antioxidant activity enhancer. This synergistic seed extract-EGCG combination diminished the oxidative stress nearly by double-fold when compared with individual phytochemical treatments in <i>in vitro</i> cell culture. LC-MS analysis of the purified guar extract revealed some previously unreported metabolites, including catechin hydrate, myricetin-3-galactoside, gossypetin-8-glucoside, and puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) which possibly explains its antioxidant enhancer effect. The outcomes of this study could be used for development of effective nutraceutical/dietary supplements.
