Expansins are cell-wall loosening proteins involved in plant cell expansion and elongation. Objectives of this study were to identify expansins related to leaf elongation in a perennial grass species and determine the relationship between the expression of expansin genes and leaf elongation. A total of 20 expansin genes were identified in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), out of which nine genes belonged to the EXPA- and 11 to the EXPB subfamily. Two genotypes ("TF007" and "TF116") with different growth rates were used to determine the correlation between expansins and leaf growth. Among the 20 expansins, 16 were differentially expressed in the leaf growth zone in "TF007" and "TF116." The further analysis of gene expression in different leaf segments of "TF007" and "TF116" revealed that the expression level of FaEXPB16 was positively correlated with leaf elongation rate, and "TF007" had a higher leaf elongation rate than "TF116" due to the greater expression level of FaEXPB16. FaEXPA7 exhibited significantly higher expression level in leaves of the rapid-growing genotypes than the slow-growing genotypes, suggesting that FaEXPA7 acts as a positive regulator for leaf elongation. FaEXPA7 also exhibited its highest expression level in the cell division zone located in the leaf base. FaEXPB3, FaEXPB4-2, and FaEXPB11-2 showed a negative correlation with the leaf elongation rate in "TF007" and "TF116" and were highly expressed in leaves of the slow-growing genotypes. As promoting or repressing factors for leaf growth, these five expansins could be used as candidate genes in developing the rapid or slow-growing perennial grass species.
