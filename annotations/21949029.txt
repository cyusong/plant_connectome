Chloroplasts are actively anchored at the appropriate intracellular regions to maintain advantageous distribution patterns under specific environmental conditions. Redistribution of chloroplasts is accompanied by their de-anchoring and re-anchoring, respectively, from and to the cortical cytoplasm. In spinach mesophyll cells, high-intensity blue light and Ca(2+) treatment induced the disappearance of the meshwork-like array of actin filaments surrounding chloroplasts, which was suppressed by a calmodulin antagonist. Regulatory mechanisms of chloroplast anchoring were investigated using plasma membrane (PM) ghosts, on which the cortical cytoplasm underlying the PM was exposed. Addition of an actin-depolymerizing reagent or > 1 µM Ca(2+) induced detachment of a substantial number of chloroplasts from the PM ghosts concomitant with disordered actin organization. Calmodulin antagonists and anti-calmodulin antibodies negated the effects of Ca(2+). In addition, Ca(2+)-induced detachment of chloroplasts was no longer evident on the calmodulin-depleted PM ghosts. We propose that chloroplasts are anchored onto the cortical cytoplasm through interaction with the actin cytoskeleton, and that Ca(2+)-calmodulin-sensitized de-anchoring of chloroplasts is a critical early step in chloroplast redistribution induced by environmental stimuli.
