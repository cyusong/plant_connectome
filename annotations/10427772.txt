['10427772', 'A mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) of Arabidopsis thaliana was introduced into  carrot (Daucus carota L. cv. MS Yonsun) cells by Agrobacterium  tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Transgenic cell lines had high CS activity,  the highest value observed was 0.24 mumol (mg protein)-1 min-1 which was 1.9-fold  of that in wild-type cells. Transcript levels of DcCS were similar between  transgenic lines, but those of AtCS were increased as the CS activity of cells  was increased. Isoelectric focussing revealed that the CS polypeptide of the  transgenic lines had a pI value different from that of the wild-type cells,  although the molecular mass was the same. These results indicate that the CS  polypeptides of A. thaliana were expressed and processed to the mature form in  carrot cells. The growth rate and excretion was 2.2-2.8 and 2.8-4.0 fold greater  in the transgenic cells than in the wild type cells, respectively. Phosphate  uptake from Al-phosphate also increased in transgenic cells. It appears, the  overexpression of mitochondrial citrate synthase in carrot cells improves the  growth rate in Al-phosphate medium possibly as a result of increased citrate  excretion.', '1999 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029568', 'Shibata']
