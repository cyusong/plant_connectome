A paper by Wearn et al. (Reports, 13 July 2012, p. 228) yields new insights on extinction debt. However, it leaves out the area dependence of the relaxation process. We show that this is not warranted on theoretical or observational grounds and that it may lead to erroneous conservation recommendations.
