The plant root system is important for the uptake of water and nutrients and the anchoring of plants in the soil. Lateral roots (LRs) contribute considerably to root system architecture. Their post-embryonic formation is regulated by hormones and environmental cues. The hormone cytokinin influences LR formation and growth in Arabidopsis thaliana on different levels by disturbing cell division activity and pattern formation. This includes inhibition of the first formative cell division of pericycle founder cells and inhibition of the outgrowth of young LR primordia. Mutant analysis revealed that the cytokinin biosynthesis genes IPT3 and IPT5 and all three cytokinin receptor genes (AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1/AHK4) act redundantly during LR initiation. Mutation of AHK2 and AHK3 caused increased auxin sensitivity of LR formation, corroborating the functional relevance of auxin-cytokinin interaction during LR formation. In contrast, LR development of cytokinin receptor mutants in response to other hormones was mostly similar to that of the wild type, which is consistent with separate response pathways. A noticeable exception was an increased sensitivity of LR elongation to brassinolide in ahk2 ahk3 mutants indicating antagonistic action of cytokinin and brassinosteroid. It is proposed that the multilevel redundancy of the cytokinin system in modulating LR formation reflects its role in mediating environmental cues.
