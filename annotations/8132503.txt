['8132503', 'Cyclophilin (CyP), a protein with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (rotamase)  activity, is the specific cellular target of cyclosporin A. We have isolated cDNA  clones of two genes (designated ROC1 and ROC4) encoding CyP homologs from  Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). The protein products of these genes are distinct from  a previously identified Arabidopsis CyP. ROC1 is expressed in all tested plant  organs and encodes a protein which is highly similar to previously described  cytosolic CyP isoforms of other plants. In contrast, ROC4 is expressed only in  photosynthetic organs and encodes a protein which includes an amino-terminal  extension with properties of known chloroplast transit peptides. In vitro import  experiments using the putative precursor protein to ROC4 showed that the protein  is imported into chloroplasts where it is processed to the predicted mature size.  Rotamase assays and immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions indicate the  presence of a CyP isoform in the stroma of chloroplasts but not in the thylakoid  membranes or thylakoid lumen. Together, these data show that ROC4 is a novel CyP  isoform which is located in the stroma of chloroplasts. In vitro chloroplast  import of precursors of other chloroplast proteins was unaffected by  concentrations of cyclosporin A which completely inhibit rotamase activity of  chloroplast stromal CyP. Thus, this activity is not essential for protein import  into chloroplasts.', '1994 Mar 18', 'J Biol Chem', 'S0021-9258(17)37130-2', 'Gasser']
