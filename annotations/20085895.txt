['20085895', 'Plant metabolomics developed as a powerful tool to examine gene functions and to  gain deeper insight into the physiology of the plant cell. In this study, we  screened Arabidopsis lines overexpressing rice full-length (FL) cDNAs (rice FOX  Arabidopsis lines) using a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry  (GC-TOF/MS)-based technique to identify rice genes that caused metabolic changes.  This screening system allows fast and reliable identification of candidate lines  showing altered metabolite profiles. We performed metabolomic and transcriptomic  analysis of a rice FOX Arabidopsis line that harbored the FL cDNA of the rice  ortholog of the Lateral Organ Boundaries (LOB) Domain (LBD)/Asymmetric  Leaves2-like (ASL) gene of Arabidopsis, At-LBD37/ASL39. The investigated rice FOX  Arabidopsis line showed prominent changes in the levels of metabolites related to  nitrogen metabolism. The transcriptomic data as well as the results from the  metabolite analysis of the Arabidopsis At-LBD37/ASL39-overexpressor plants were  consistent with these findings. Furthermore, the metabolomic and transcriptomic  analysis of the Os-LBD37/ASL39-overexpressing rice plants indicated that  Os-LBD37/ASL39 is associated with processes related to nitrogen metabolism in  rice. Thus, the combination of a metabolomics-based screening method and a  gain-of-function approach is useful for rapid characterization of novel genes in  both Arabidopsis and rice.', '2010 Jan', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssp069', 'Saito']
