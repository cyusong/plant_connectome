Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the main signal molecules, which is involved in plant growth and development and can change regular physiological activity in biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, the role of NO in induced resistance with Pseudomonas fluorescent (CHA0) and basal resistance against Rhizoctonia solani in bean plant was investigated. Our results revealed that P. fluorescent and R. solani can increase NO production at 6h post inoculation (hpi). Also, using the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl D-penicillamine (SNAP) led to increase NO and bean plant resistance against R. solani. Utilizing the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethy-limidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), not only decreased basal resistance but also reduced induced resistance. In continue, the activity of antioxidant enzymes was studied in the former treatments. SNAP, CHA0 and R. solani increased the activity of peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) at 6, 12 and 24h post inoculation (hpi). In contrast, using cPTIO and R. solani simultaneously (cPTIO+R) showed reduction in activity of POX and APX at 6 hpi. The cPTIO+R treatment increased POX, APX and CAT activity at 12 and 24 hpi. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) monitoring in the leaf discs clarified that SNAP can increase H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production like CHA0 and R. solani. On the other hand, SNAP increased the resistance level of leaf discs against R. solani. Treating the leaf discs with cPTIO led to decrease resistance against the pathogen. These leaf discs showed reduction in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production at 6 hpi and suddenly enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation was observed at 24hpi. This study showed that CHA0 can increase NO level in bean plants. NO induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation and regulated redox state of the host plant. This interaction resulted in significant defense against the pathogen.
