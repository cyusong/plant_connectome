Leaf senescence is controlled developmentally and environmentally and is affected by numerous genes, including transcription factors. An Arabidopsis NAC domain transcription factor, ATAF2, is known to regulate biotic stress responses. Recently, we have demonstrated that ATAF2 upregulates ORE1, a key regulator of leaf senescence. Here, to investigate the function of ATAF2 in leaf senescence further, we generated and analyzed overexpressing transgenic and T-DNA inserted mutant lines. Transient expression analysis indicated that ATAF2 upregulates several NAC domain transcription factors that regulate senescence. Indeed, ATAF2 overexpression induced the expression of senescence-related genes, thereby accelerating leaf senescence, whereas the expression of such genes in ataf2 mutants was lower than that of wild-type plants. Furthermore, the ataf2 mutants exhibited significant delays in dark-induced leaf senescence. It was also found that ATAF2 induces the expression of transcription factors, which both promotes and represses leaf senescence. The present study demonstrates that ATAF2 promotes leaf senescence in response to developmental and environmental signals.
