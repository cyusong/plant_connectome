Metabolic theory predicts that many rates increase exponentially with temperature following an activation energy (E) of 0.32 eV for photosynthesis. Here, I evaluate this prediction for net photosynthesis and organ, individual, and ecosystem growth. Observed E for photosynthesis varied widely but was not statistically different from predictions, while E for organs was greater than predicted, and E for individuals and ecosystems only weakly characterized temperature responses. I review several hypotheses that may underlie these results. Understanding how multiple rate-limiting processes coalesce into a single E that characterizes metabolic responses to temperature, and how to best estimate E from unimodal data, remain important challenges.

Temperature: !influences! Scaling of physiological rates 
Metabolic theory: !predicts! Exponential increase with temperature 
Net photosynthesis: !varies widely! Activation energy 
Organ growth: !greater than! Predicted activation energy 
Individuals/Ecosystems: !weakly characterize! Temperature responses
