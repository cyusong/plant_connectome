Sessile plants are constantly exposed to myriads of unfavorable invading organisms with different lifestyles. To survive, plants have evolved plasma membrane-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) to initiate sophisticated downstream immune responses. Ubiquitination serves as one of the most important and prevalent posttranslational modifications (PTMs) to fine-tune plant immune responses. Over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made in delineating the critical roles of ubiquitination in plant immunity. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the understanding of ubiquitination in the modulation of plant immunity, with a particular focus on ubiquitination in the regulation of receptorsomes, and discuss how ubiquitination and other PTMs act in concert to ensure rapid, proper, and robust immune responses.
