['17890373', 'We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis thaliana MYB46 transcription factor is a  direct target of SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1), which is a  key transcriptional activator regulating the developmental program of secondary  wall biosynthesis. The MYB46 gene is expressed predominantly in fibers and  vessels in stems, and its encoded protein is targeted to the nucleus and can  activate transcription. MYB46 gene expression was shown to be regulated by SND1,  and transactivation analysis demonstrated that SND1 as well as its close homologs  were able to activate the MYB46 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays  and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that SND1 binds to the  MYB46 promoter. Dominant repression of MYB46 caused a drastic reduction in the  secondary wall thickening of fibers and vessels. Overexpression of MYB46 resulted  in an activation of the biosynthetic pathways of cellulose, xylan, and lignin and  concomitantly led to ectopic deposition of secondary walls in cells that are  normally nonsclerenchymatous. In addition, the expression of two secondary  wall-associated transcription factors, MYB85 and KNAT7, was highly upregulated by  MYB46 overexpression. These results demonstrate that MYB46 is a direct target of  SND1 and is another key player in the transcriptional network involved in the  regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.053678', 'Ye']
