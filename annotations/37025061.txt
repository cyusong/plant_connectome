Under conditions of sulfur deprivation OAS accumulates which is leading to the induction of a common set of six genes, called OAS cluster genes. These genes are induced not only under sulfur deprivation, but also under other conditions where OAS accumulates, such as shift to darkness and stress conditions leading to ROS or methyl-jasmonate accumulation. Using the OAS cluster genes as a query in ATTED-II, a co-expression network is derived spanning stably over several hundred conditions. This allowed not only to describe the downstream function of the OAS cluster genes but also to score for functions of the members of the co-regulated co-expression network and hence the effects of the OAS signal on the sulfate assimilation pathway and co-regulated pathways. Further, we summarized the existing knowledge on the regulation of the OAS cluster and the co-expressed genes. As it turned out, the known sulfate deprivation related transcription factor EIL3/SLIM1 exhibits a prominent role as most genes are subject to regulation by this TF. The bearing of other transcription factors in response to OAS awaits still further investigations.
