['12232227', 'The increased production of trienoic fatty acids, hexadecatrienoic (16:3) and  linolenic (18:3) acids, is a response connected with cold acclimation of higher  plants and is thought to protect plant cells against cold damage. Transgenic  tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv SR1) plants that contain increased levels of 16:3  and 18:3 fatty acids, and correspondingly decreased levels of their precursors,  hexadecadienoic and linoleic acids, were engineered by introduction of a  chloroplast [omega]-3 fatty acid desaturase gene (the fad7 gene) isolated from  Arabidopsis thaliana. When exposed to 1[deg]C for 7 d and then cultured at  25[deg]C, the suppression of leaf growth observed in the wild-type plants was  significantly alleviated in the transgenic plants with the fad7 gene. The  low-temperature- induced chlorosis was also much reduced in the plants  transformed with the fad7 gene. These results indicate that increased levels of  trienoic fatty acids in genetically engineered plants enhance cold tolerance.', '1994 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.2.601', 'Iba']
