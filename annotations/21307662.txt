The effects of root hypoxia on ethylene biosynthesis and perception have been documented in many vegetative organs, but not extensively in fruit. Therefore, in the present study, the effects of root hypoxia on ethylene biosynthesis and perception were investigated in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit at five stages of the maturation phase. Our results showed that root hypoxia do not affect ethylene biosynthesis in fruit, but stimulates its reception from other plant part, as indicated by the increase in the expression of ethylene receptors ETR 1 and 3.
