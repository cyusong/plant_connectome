['20559653', 'Two genes encoding sucrose synthase (SUS), namely SUS2 (At5g49190) and SUS3  (At4g02280), are strongly and differentially expressed in Arabidopsis seed.  Detailed biochemical analysis was carried out in developing seeds 9-21 days after  flowering (DAF) of wild type and two knockouts. SUS2 and SUS3 are not redundant  genes since single knockouts show a phenotype in developing seeds. The mutants  had 30-50% less SUS activity and therefore accumulated 40% more sucrose and 50%  less fructose at 15 DAF. This did not affect the hexose-P pool, but led to 30-70%  less starch in embryo and seed coat. Lipids were 55% higher in both mutants at  9-15 DAF. It seems that sucrolysis via SUS is not required for oil or protein  synthesis but rather for channeling carbon toward ADP-glucose and starch in  seeds. Metabolite profiling with GC-TOF revealed specific downstream changes in  primary metabolism as a consequence of signaling or regulatory fine-tuning. While  sucrose increased, hexoses and specific amino acids decreased reciprocally. There  was a developmental shift regarding an earlier timing of dry weight accumulation,  germinative maturity, oil deposition, sugar levels, transient starch buildup, and  protein storage. Nevertheless, final seed size and composition were unaltered due  to an earlier cessation of growth, thus giving rise to an apparent silent  phenotype of mature mutant seeds. We conclude that SUS is important for  metabolite homeostasis and timing of seed development, and propose that an  altered sucrose/hexose ratio can modify carbon partitioning and the pattern of  storage compounds in Arabidopsis.', '2010 Aug', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1207-9', 'Tiessen']
