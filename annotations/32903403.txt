Mineral elements play an extremely important role in human health, and are worthy of study in rice grain. Wild rice is an important gene pool for rice improvement including grain yield, disease, and pest resistance as well as mineral elements. In this study, we identified 33 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Fe, Zn, Se, Cd, Hg, and As contents in wild rice <i>Oryza longistaminata</i>. Of which, 29 QTLs were the first report, and 12 QTLs were overlapped to form five clusters as <i>qSe1/qCd1</i> on chromosome 1, <i>qCd4.2/qHg4</i> on chromosome 4, <i>qFe5.2/qZn5.2</i> on chromosome 5, <i>qFe9/qHg9.2/qAs9.2</i> on chromosome 9, and <i>qCd10/qHg10</i> on chromosome 10. Importantly, <i>qSe1/qCd1</i>, can significantly improve the Se content while reduce the Cd content, and <i>qFe5.2/qZn5.2</i> can significantly improve both the Fe and Zn contents, they were delimited to an interval about 53.8 Kb and 26.2 Kb, respectively. These QTLs detected from <i>Oryza longistaminata</i> not only establish the basis for subsequent gene cloning to decipher the genetic mechanism of mineral element accumulation, but also provide new genetic resource for rice quality improvement.
