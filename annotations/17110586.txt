A passive light microscope system has been developed, capable of reconstructing an extended-focus 3-D cell-level image of chlorophyll fluorescence and Phi(PSII) of intact attached leaves using a limited number of focal plane images of chlorophyll fluorescence. Using this system, the relationships between the depth of the mesophyll cells in spongy tissue and the intensity of the chlorophyll fluorescence and the Phi(PSII) were investigated in sunflower leaves exposed to 300 ppb ozone for 12 h at a PPFD of 300 micromol m(-2) s(-1) actinic light. After ozone exposure, fluorescence intensity (F) largely decreased in the cells just under the epidermal cells (within approximately 20 microm of the epidermal cells), but the sites where fluorescence intensity decreased had no relationship to the position of the stomata. By contrast, the distribution of Phi(PSII) showed no change after the ozone exposure. These findings suggest that ozone-induced inhibition occurs in the cells just under the epidermal cells by reducing the light absorption of the chloroplasts, while the operating quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry is maintained.

Ozone: !inhibits! Light absorption
Ozone: !maintains! Quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry
Fluorescence intensity: !decreases! Under epidermal cells
Stomata: !unrelated to! Fluorescence intensity decrease
