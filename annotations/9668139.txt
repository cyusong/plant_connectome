['9668139', 'Cytoplasmic male sterility in the common bean plant is associated with a dominant  mitochondrial mutation designated pvs-or f 239 (for Phaseolus vulgaris sterility  sequence open reading frame 239). The sequence is transcribed in both vegetative  and reproductive tissues, but the translation product, ORF239, is present only in  reproductive tissues. We present evidence to support a model of  post-translational regulation of ORF239 expression based on the following  observations. In organello translation experiments using purified mitochondria  from young seedlings demonstrated accumulation of ORF239 only when a protease  inhibitor was included. Proteolytic activity against ORF239 was observed in  mitochondrial extracts fractionating with the mitochondrial inner membrane. The  DNA sequence encoding a serine-type protease, similar to the lon protease gene of  Escherichia coli, was cloned from the Arabidopsis genome. The expression product  of this sequence demonstrated proteolytic activity against ORF239 in vitro, with  features resembling the activity detected in mitochondrial inner membrane  preparations. Antibodies generated against the overexpressed Lon homolog reduced  proteolytic activity against ORF239 when added to mitochondrial extracts. Our  data suggest that ORF239 was undetected in vegetative tissue due to rapid  turnover by at least one mitochondrial protease that acts against ORF239  post-translationally.', '1998 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.7.1217', 'Mackenzie']
