['26858286', 'Despite increasing reports that CCCH zinc finger proteins function in plant  development and stress responses, the functions and molecular aspects of many  CCCH zinc finger proteins remain uncharacterized. Here, we characterized the  biological and molecular functions of AtC3H17, a unique Arabidopsis gene encoding  a non-tandem CCCH zinc finger protein. AtC3H17 was ubiquitously expressed  throughout the life cycle of Arabidopsis plants and their organs. The rate and  ratio of seed germination of atc3h17 mutants were slightly slower and lower,  respectively, than those of the wild type (WT), whereas AtC3H17-overexpressing  transgenic plants (OXs) showed an enhanced germination rate. atc3h17 mutant  seedlings were smaller and lighter than WT seedlings while AtC3H17 OX seedlings  were larger and heavier. In regulation of flowering time, atc3h17 mutants showed  delayed flowering, whereas AtC3H17 OXs showed early flowering compared with the  WT. In addition, overexpression of AtC3H17 affected seed development, displaying  abnormalities compared with the WT. AtC3H17 protein was localized to the nucleus  and showed transcriptional activation activity in yeast and Arabidopsis  protoplasts. The N-terminal region of AtC3H17, containing a conserved EELR-like  motif, was necessary for transcriptional activation activity, and the two  conserved glutamate residues in the EELR-like motif played an important role in  transcriptional activation activity. Real-time PCR and transactivation analyses  showed that AtC3H17 might be involved in seed development via transcriptional  activation of OLEO1, OLEO2 and CRU3. Our results suggest that AtC3H17 has  pleiotropic effects on vegetative development such as seed germination and  seedling growth, flowering and seed development, and functions as a nuclear  transcriptional activator in Arabidopsis.', '2016 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcw013', 'Moon']
