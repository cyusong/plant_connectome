Plants are always exposed to the environment, polluted by multiple trace elements. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), an endogenous gaseous transmitter in plant cells, can help plant combat single elements with excess concentration. Until now, little has been known about the regulatory role of H<sub>2</sub>S in response to combined stress of multiple elements. Here we found that combined exposure of mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) triggered endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S signal in the roots of <i>Brasscia rapa</i>. However, neither Hg nor Se alone worked on it. In roots upon Hg + Se exposure, the defensive role of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S was associated to the decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, followed by alleviating cell death and recovering root growth. Such findings extend our knowledge of plant H<sub>2</sub>S in response to multiple stress conditions.

Hg + Se: !triggers! H<sub>2</sub>S
H<sub>2</sub>S: !decreases! ROS
ROS: !causes! cell death
H<sub>2</sub>S: !alleviates! cell death
H<sub>2</sub>S: !recovers! root growth
