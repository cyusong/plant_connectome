['24506331', 'The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins represent a large family of  RNA-binding proteins that have many roles in post-transcriptional RNA processes  within plant organelles. Among the PPR proteins that target plant mitochondria,  the restorer-of-fertility (Rf) proteins are characterized by their inhibitory  action on mitochondrion-localized cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes in  various crop species. Close homologs to known Rfs from radish, petunia, and rice  can be identified in most higher plant species and these proteins define the  recognized subgroup of Rf-like (RFL) PPR proteins. In this paper we describe the  function of the RFL9 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, and show that it is  associated with ribonucleolytic cleavages within the coding sequences of  rps3-rpl16 and orf240a mitochondrial transcripts in the Col-0 accession. RFL9  therefore represents an Rf-like PPR gene that has the potential to compromise the  function of an essential mitochondrial gene and whose function is also associated  with a mitochondrial orf sharing significant homology with a proven CMS-causing  orf. We observe that RFL9 is active in only a few Arabidopsis accessions  genetically close to Col-0, which supports the idea that the genetic fixation of  this gene represents a regional event in the recent evolution of Arabidopsis.  Additionally, RFL9 counts among the RFL genes that are probably controlled by  short regulatory RNAs, and our results provides a potential explanation for such  control, which in the case of RFL9 might have evolved to limit its detrimental  effect on rps3 expression.', '2014 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12463', 'Mireau']
