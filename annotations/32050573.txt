Salt stress inhibits normal plant growth and development by disrupting cellular water absorption and metabolism. Therefore, understanding plant salt tolerance mechanisms should provide a theoretical basis for developing salt-resistant varieties. Here, we cloned ThTrx5 from Tamarix hispida, a salt-resistant woody shrub, and generated ThTrx5-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines. Under NaCl stress, the germination rate of overexpressing ThTrx5 lines was significantly increased relative to that of the nontransgenic line; under salt stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione levels and root length and fresh weight values of transgenic ThTrx5 plants were significantly greater than corresponding values for wild-type plants. Moreover, with regard to the transcriptome, comparison of differential gene expression of transgenic versus nontransgenic lines at 0 h and 3 h of salt stress exposure revealed 500 and 194 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, that were mainly functionally linked to catalytic activity and binding process. Pull-down experiments showed that ThTrx bound 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1-like protein that influences stress response-associated redox, hormone signal transduction, and transcription factor functions. Therefore, this work provides important insights into ThTrx5 mechanisms that promote salt tolerance in plants.
