['21571950', 'Seed development ends with a maturation phase that imparts desiccation tolerance,  nutrient reserves, and dormancy degree. Here, we report the functional analysis  of an Arabidopsis thaliana C2H2 zinc finger protein INDETERMINATE DOMAIN1  (IDD1)/ENHYDROUS (ENY). Ectopic expression of IDD1/ENY (2x35S:ENY) disrupted seed  development, delaying endosperm depletion and testa senescence, resulting in an  abbreviated maturation program. Consequently, mature 2x35S:ENY seeds had  increased endosperm-specific fatty acids, starch retention, and defective  mucilage extrusion. Using RAB18 promoter ENY lines (RAB18:ENY) to confine  expression to maturation, when native ENY expression increased and peaked,  resulted in mature seed with lower abscisic acid (ABA) content and decreased  germination sensitivity to applied ABA. Furthermore, results of far-red and red  light treatments of 2x35S:ENY and RAB18:ENY germinating seeds, and of artificial  microRNA knockdown lines, suggest that ENY acts to promote germination. After  using RAB18:ENY seedlings to induce ENY during ABA application, key genes in  gibberellin (GA) metabolism and signaling were differentially regulated in a  manner suggesting negative feedback regulation. Furthermore, GA treatment  resulted in a skotomorphogenic-like phenotype in light-grown 2x35S:ENY and  RAB18:ENY seedlings. The physical interaction of ENY with DELLAs and an  ENY-triggered accumulation of DELLA transcripts during maturation support the  conclusion that ENY mediates GA effects to balance ABA-promoted maturation during  late seed development.', '2011 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.085134', 'Cutler']
