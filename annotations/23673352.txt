In Saccharomyces cerevisia, the key gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is secreted into the periplasm during prolonged glucose starvation and is internalized into Vid/endosomes following glucose re-feeding. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase does not contain signal sequences required for the classical secretory and endocytic pathways. Hence, the secretion and internalization are mediated via the non-classical pathways.
