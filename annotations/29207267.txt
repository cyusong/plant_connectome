Mitochondria are the energy-generating organelles that power eukaryotic cells. Originally descended from endosymbiotic bacteria, their genomes have shrunk during evolution. New analyses suggest that large, gene-rich mitochondrial genomes are more common than previously thought, with interesting implications for eukaryotic genome evolution.
