Potassium (K(+)) is the most abundant cation in the cytosol, and plant growth requires that large amounts of K(+) are transported from the soil to the growing organs. K(+) uptake and fluxes within the plant are mediated by several families of transporters and channels. Here, we describe the different families of K(+)-selective channels that have been identified in plants, the so-called Shaker, TPK and Kir-like channels, and what is known so far on their regulations and physiological functions in the plant.
