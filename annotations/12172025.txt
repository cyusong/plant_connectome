['12172025', 'Mutants able to germinate and perform early growth in medium containing a high  NaCl concentration were identified during the course of two independent  screenings and named salt resistant (sre) and salobreno (san). The sre and san  mutants also were able to germinate in high-osmoticum medium, indicating that  they are osmotolerant in a germination assay. Complementation analyses revealed  that sre1-1, sre1-2, san3-1, and san3-2 were alleles of the abscisic acid (ABA)  biosynthesis ABA2 gene. A map-based cloning strategy allowed the identification  of the ABA2 gene and molecular characterization of four new aba2 alleles. The  ABA2 gene product belongs to the family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases,  which are known to be NAD- or NADP-dependent oxidoreductases. Recombinant ABA2  protein produced in Escherichia coli exhibits a K(m) value for xanthoxin of 19  micro M and catalyzes in a NAD-dependent manner the conversion of xanthoxin to  abscisic aldehyde, as determined by HPLC-mass spectrometry. The ABA2 mRNA is  expressed constitutively in all plant organs examined and is not upregulated in  response to osmotic stress. The results of this work are discussed in the context  of previous genetic and biochemical evidence regarding ABA biosynthesis,  confirming the xanthoxin-->abscisic aldehyde-->ABA transition as the last steps  of the major ABA biosynthetic pathway.', '2002 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.002477', 'Rodriguez']
