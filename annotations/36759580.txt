Transformation in grass species has traditionally relied on immature embryos and has therefore been limited to a few major Poaceae crops. Other transformation explants, including leaf tissue, have been explored but with low success rates, which is one of the major factors hindering the broad application of genome editing for crop improvement. Recently, leaf transformation using morphogenic genes Wuschel2 (Wus2) and Babyboom (Bbm) has been successfully used for Cas9-mediated mutagenesis, but complex genome editing applications, requiring large numbers of regenerated plants to be screened, remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that enhanced Wus2/Bbm expression substantially improves leaf transformation in maize and sorghum, allowing the recovery of plants with Cas9-mediated gene dropouts and targeted gene insertion. Moreover, using a maize-optimized Wus2/Bbm construct, embryogenic callus and regenerated plantlets were successfully produced in eight species spanning four grass subfamilies, suggesting that this may lead to a universal family-wide method for transformation and genome editing across the Poaceae.
