C4 plants assimilate CO2 more efficiently than C3 plants because of their C4 cycle that concentrates CO2. However, the C4 cycle requires additional ATP molecules, which may be supplied by cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I. One CEF route, which depends on a chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex, is suggested to be crucial for C4 plants despite the low activity in C3 plants. The other route depends on proton gradient regulation 5 (PGR5) and PGR5-like photosynthetic phenotype 1 (PGRL1) and is considered a major CEF route to generate the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane in C3 plants. However, its contribution to C4 photosynthesis is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the contribution of the two CEF routes to the NADP-malic enzyme subtype of C4 photosynthesis in Flaveria bidentis. We observed that suppressing the NDH-dependent route drastically delayed growth and decreased the CO2 assimilation rate to approximately 30% of the wild-type rate. On the other hand, suppressing the PGR5/PGRL1-dependent route did not affect plant growth and resulted in a CO2 assimilation rate that was approximately 80% of the wild-type rate. Our data indicate that the NDH-dependent CEF substantially contributes to the NADP-malic enzyme subtype of C4 photosynthesis and that the PGR5/PGRL1-dependent route cannot complement the NDH-dependent route in F. bidentis. These findings support the fact that during C4 evolution, photosynthetic electron flow may have been optimized to provide the energy required for C4 photosynthesis.
