Mycotoxins produced by <i>Fusarium</i> species on cereals represent a major concern for food safety worldwide. Fusarium toxins that are currently under regulation for their content in food include trichothecenes, fumonisins, and zearalenone. Biological control of <i>Fusarium</i> spp. has been widely explored with the aim of limiting disease occurrence, but few efforts have focused so far on limiting toxin accumulation in grains. The bacterial genus <i>Streptomyces</i> is responsible for the production of numerous drug molecules and represents a huge resource for the discovery of new molecules. <i>Streptomyces</i> spp. are also efficient plant colonizers and able to employ different mechanisms of control against toxigenic fungi on cereals. This review describes the outcomes of research using <i>Streptomyces</i> strains and/or their derived molecules to limit toxin production and/or contamination of <i>Fusarium</i> species in cereals. Both the scientific and patent literature were analyzed, starting from the year 2000, and we highlight promising results as well as the current pitfalls and limitations of this approach.
