Stem strength is an important agronomic trait affecting plant lodging, and plays an essential role in the quality and yield of plants. Thickened secondary cell walls in stems provide mechanical strength that allows plants to stand upright, but the regulatory mechanism of secondary cell wall thickening and stem strength in cut flowers remains unclear. In this study, first, a total of 11 non-redundant Paeonia lactiflora R2R3-MYBs related to stem strength were identified and isolated from cut-flower herbaceous peony, among which PlMYB43, PlMYB83 and PlMYB103 were the most upregulated differentially expressed genes. Then, the expression characteristics revealed that these three R2R3-MYBs were specifically expressed in stems and acted as transcriptional activators. Next, biological function verification showed that these P. lactiflora R2R3-MYBs positively regulated stem strength, secondary cell wall thickness and lignin deposition. Furthermore, yeast-one-hybrid and dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that they could bind to the promoter of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase gene (PlCOMT2) and/or laccase gene (PlLAC4), two key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. In addition, the function of PlLAC4 in increasing lignin deposition was confirmed by virus-induced gene silencing and overexpression. Moreover, PlMYB83 could also act as a transcriptional activator of PlMYB43. The findings of the study propose a regulatory network of R2R3-MYBs modulating lignin biosynthesis and secondary cell wall thickening for improving stem lodging resistance, and provide a resource for molecular genetic engineering breeding of cut flowers.
