Proteins of plant cell walls serve as structural macromolecules and play important roles in morphogenesis and development but have not been reported to be the origins of peptide signals that activate genes for plant defense. We report here that the mRNA coding the tomato leaf polyprotein precursor of three hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide defense signals (called LeHypSys I, II, and III) is synthesized in phloem parenchyma cells in response to wounding, systemin, and methyl jasmonate, and the nascent protein is sequestered in the cell wall matrix. These findings indicate that the plant cell wall can play an active role in defense as a source of peptide signals for systemic wound signaling.
