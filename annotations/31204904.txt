The rhizobium-legume symbiotic system is crucial for nitrogen cycle balance in agriculture. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a gaseous signaling molecule, may regulate various physiological processes in plants. However, whether H<sub>2</sub>S has regulatory effect in this symbiotic system remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the possible role of H<sub>2</sub>S in the symbiosis between soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) and rhizobium (<i>Sinorhizobium fredii</i>). Our results demonstrated that an exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S donor (sodium hydrosulfide [NaHS]) treatment promoted soybean growth, nodulation, and nitrogenase (Nase) activity. Western blotting analysis revealed that the abundance of Nase component nifH was increased by NaHS treatment in nodules. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data showed that NaHS treatment upregulated the expressions of symbiosis-related genes <i>nodA</i>, <i>nodC</i>, and <i>nodD</i> of <i>S. fredii</i>. In addition, expression of soybean nodulation marker genes, including early nodulin 40 (<i>GmENOD40</i>), ERF required for nodulation (<i>GmERN</i>), nodulation signaling pathway 2b (<i>GmNSP2b</i>), and nodulation inception genes (<i>GmNIN1a</i>, <i>GmNIN2a</i>, and <i>GmNIN2b</i>), were upregulated. Moreover, the expressions of glutamate synthase (<i>GmGOGAT</i>), asparagine synthase (<i>GmAS</i>), nitrite reductase (<i>GmNiR</i>), ammonia transporter (<i>GmSAT1</i>), leghemoglobin (<i>GmLb</i>), and <i>nifH</i> involved in nitrogen metabolism were upregulated in NaHS-treated soybean roots and nodules. Together, our results suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S may act as a positive signaling molecule in the soybean-rhizobia symbiotic system and enhance the system's nitrogen fixation ability.
