['31370240', 'Arabidopsis roots accumulate a complex mixture of dolichols composed of three  families, (i.e., short-, medium- and long-chain dolichols), but until now none of  the cis-prenyltransferases (CPTs) predicted in the Arabidopsis genome has been  considered responsible for their synthesis. In this report, using homo- and  heterologous (yeast and tobacco) models, we have characterized the AtCPT1 gene  (At2g23410) which encodes a CPT responsible for the formation of long-chain  dolichols, Dol-18 to -23, with Dol-21 dominating, in Arabidopsis. The content of  these dolichols was significantly reduced in AtCPT1 T-DNA insertion mutant lines  and highly increased in AtCPT1-overexpressing plants. Similar to the majority of  eukaryotic CPTs, AtCPT1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Functional complementation tests using yeast rer2Delta or srt1Delta mutants devoid of  medium- or long-chain dolichols, respectively, confirmed that this enzyme  synthesizes long-chain dolichols, although the dolichol chains thus formed are  somewhat shorter than those synthesized in planta. Moreover, AtCPT1 acts as a  homomeric CPT and does not need LEW1 for its activity. AtCPT1 is the first plant  CPT producing long-chain polyisoprenoids that does not form a complex with the  NgBR/NUS1 homologue.', '2019 Jul 31', 'Molecules', '10.3390/molecules24152789', 'ORCID:']
