When genetically engineered stacks (also known as stacked or combined events) are produced by combining two or more single transgenic events by conventional breeding, the potential for interactions between the products of the events that impact food and feed safety can be evaluated and the need for further safety assessment can be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Gene: !affects! Food/Feed Safety 
Gene: !localizes to! Stacked Events 
Gene: !interacts with! Single Transgenic Events 
Gene: !enhances! Potential for Interactions 
Gene: !represses! Need for Further Safety Assessment
