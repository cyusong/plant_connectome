Maize can grow in cool temperate climates but is often exposed to spring chilling temperatures that can affect early seedling growth. Here, we used two sister double-haploid lines displaying a contrasted tolerance to chilling to identify major determinants of long-term chilling tolerance. The chilling-sensitive (CS) and the chilling-tolerant (CT) lines were grown at 14 °C day/10 °C night for 60 d. CS plants displayed a strong reduction in growth and aerial biomass compared with CT plants. Photosynthetic efficiency was affected with an increase in energy dissipation in both lines. Chilling tolerance in CT plants was associated with higher chlorophyll content, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and higher sucrose to starch ratio. Few changes in cell wall composition were observed in both genotypes. There was no obvious correlation between nucleotide sugar content and cell wall polysaccharide composition. Our findings suggest that the central starch-sucrose metabolism is one major determinant of the response to low temperature, and its modulation accounts for the ability of CT plants to cope with low temperature. This modulation seemed to be linked to a strong alteration in the biosynthesis of nucleotide sugars that, at a high level, could reflect the remobilization of carbon in response to chilling.
