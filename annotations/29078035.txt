By controlling gene expression, DNA methylation contributes to key regulatory processes during plant development. Genomic methylation patterns are dynamic and must be properly maintained and/or re-established upon DNA replication and active removal, and therefore require sophisticated control mechanisms. Here we identify direct interplay between the DNA repair factor DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) and the ROS1-mediated active DNA demethylation pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that DDB2 forms a complex with ROS1 and AGO4 and that they act at the ROS1 locus to modulate levels of DNA methylation and therefore ROS1 expression. We found that DDB2 represses enzymatic activity of ROS1. DNA demethylation intermediates generated by ROS1 are processed by the DNA 3'-phosphatase ZDP and the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease APE1L, and we also show that DDB2 interacts with both enzymes and stimulates their activities. Taken together, our results indicate that DDB2 acts as a critical regulator of ROS1-mediated active DNA demethylation.
