['25256212', 'Alkaline/neutral invertases (A/N-Invs) are now recognized as essential proteins  in plant life. They catalyze the irreversible breakdown of sucrose into glucose  and fructose and thus supply the cells with energy as well as signaling  molecules. In this study we report on a mechanism that affects the activity of  the cytosolic invertase AtCINV1 (At-A/N-InvG or AT1G35580). We demonstrate that  Ser547 at the extreme C-terminus of the AtCINV1 protein is a substrate of  calcium-dependent kinases (CPK3 and 21) and that phosphorylation creates a  high-affinity binding site for 14-3-3 proteins. The invertase as such has basal  activity, but we provide evidence that interaction with 14-3-3 proteins enhances  its activity. The analysis of three quadruple 14-3-3 mutants generated from six  T-DNA insertion mutants of the non-epsilon family shows both specificity as well  as redundancy for this function of 14-3-3 proteins. The strong reduction in  hexose levels in the roots of one 14-3-3 quadruple mutant plant is in line with  the activating function of 14-3-3 proteins. The physiological relevance of this  mechanism that affects A/N-invertase activity is underscored by the light-induced  activation and is another example of the central role of 14-3-3 proteins in  mediating dark/light signaling. The nature of the light-induced signal that  travels from the shoot to root and the question whether this signal is  transmitted via cytosolic Ca(++) changes that activate calcium-dependent kinases,  await further study.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12677', 'de']
