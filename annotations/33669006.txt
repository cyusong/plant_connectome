The world population is growing rapidly, and food shortage remains a critical issue. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is a statistical analytical method that uses both phenotypic and genotypic data. The purpose of QTL mapping is to determine the exact gene location for various complex traits. Increasing grain weight is a way to increase yield in rice. Genes related to grain size were mapped using the Samgang/Nagdong double haploid (SNDH) populations. Grain sizes were diversely distributed in SNDH 113 populations, and <i>OsBRKq1</i> was detected on chromosome 1 in an analysis of QTL mapping that used 1000 grain weight, grain length, and grain width. <i>OsBRKq1</i> exhibited high sequence similarity with the brassinosteroid leucine-rich repeat-receptor kinases of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Zea mays</i>. It was also predicted to have a similar function because of its high homology. <i>OsBRKq1</i> interacts with various grain-size control genes. Among the SNDH populations, the analysis of the relative expression level during the panicle formation stage of <i>OsBRKq1</i> in panicles of SNDH117, which has the largest grain size, and SNDH6, which has the smallest grain size, the relative expression level was significantly increased in SNDH117 panicles. SNDH populations have been advancing generations for 10 years; various genetic traits have been fixed and are currently being used as bridging parents. Therefore, the stable expression level of <i>OsBRKq1</i> was confirmed via QTL mapping. In the future, <i>OsBRKq1</i> can be effectively used to increase the yield of rice and solve food problems by increasing the size of seeds.
