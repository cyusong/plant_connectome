The seed, the reproductive unit of angiosperms, is physically protected by the seed coat. The seed coat develops from the ovule integuments after fertilization. The Arabidopsis ovule integuments are made of 5-6 cell layers of epidermal and sub-epidermal origin. The growth of the epidermal integument cell layers responds to an endosperm signal mediated by the AGAMOUS-LIKE 62 MADS box transcription factor with limited embryo contribution. By contrast, the sub-epidermal integument cell layers require the embryo to expand whereas the role of the endosperm is still unclear. Here, we analyzed the development of the sub-epidermal integument cell layers in agl62 mutant seeds, which undergo premature endosperm cellularization and arrest. Our data suggest that embryo and endosperm are both necessary to trigger the expansion of the sub-epidermal integument cell layers.

Endosperm: !mediates! AGAMOUS-LIKE 62 MADS box transcription factor
Embryo: !expands! sub-epidermal integument cell layers
Endosperm: !triggers! expansion of sub-epidermal integument cell layers
Embryo: !requires! Endosperm
