['21796445', 'Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) cleave N-glycans from proteins and/or  peptides by hydrolyzing the O-glycosidic linkage between the two  core-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. Although, two homologous genes  potentially encoding ENGases have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, their  respective substrate specificity, their subcellular and their organ specific  localization was hitherto unknown. In order to investigate the role of ENGases in  this model plant species, we transiently expressed the two A. thaliana genes in  Nicotiana benthamiana and determined the substrate specificities, as well as the  Km values, of the purified recombinant enzymes. The assumed predominantly  cytosolic localisation of both enzymes, here referred to as AtENGase85A and  AtENGase85B, was determined by confocal microscopy of plant leaves expressing the  respective GFP-fusion constructs. For the individual characterization of the two  enzymes expression patterns in planta, single knock-out plants were selected for  both genes. Although both enzymes are present in most organs, only AtENGase85A  (At5g05460) was expressed in stems and no ENGase activity was detected in  siliques. A double knock-out was generated by crossing but-like single knock-out  plants-no apparent phenotype was observed. In contrast, in this double knock-out,  free N-glycans carrying a single GlcNAc at the reducing end are completely absent  and their counterparts with two GlcNAc-visible only at a trace level in wild  type-accumulated dramatically.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-011-9808-7', 'Leonard']
