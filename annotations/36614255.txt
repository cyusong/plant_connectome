Rice breeders are now developing new varieties with semi-high or even high plant height to further increase the grain yield, and the problem of lodging has re-appeared. We identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), <i>qSCM4,</i> for resistance to lodging by using an F<sub>2</sub> segregant population and a recombinant self-incompatible line population from the cross between Shennong265 (SN265) and Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) after multiple years and multiple environments. Then, the residual heterozygous derived segregant population which consisted of 1781 individual plants, and the BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> segregant population which consisted of 3216 individual plants, were used to shorten the physical interval of <i>qSCM4</i> to 58.5 kb including 11 genes. DNA sequencing revealed the most likely candidate gene for <i>qSCM4</i> was <i>Os04g0615000</i>, which encoded a functional protein with structural domains of serine and cysteine. There were 13 DNA sequence changes in LTH compared to SN265 in this gene, including a fragment deletion, two base changes in the 3' UTR region, six base changes in the exons, and four base changes in the introns. A near-isogenic line carrying <i>qSCM4</i> showed that it improved the lodging resistance through increasing stem thickness by 25.3% and increasing stem folding resistance by 20.3%. Furthermore, it was also discovered that <i>qSCM4</i> enhanced the primary branch per panicle by 16.7%, secondary branch by per panicle 9.9%, and grain number per panicle by 14.7%. All the above results will give us a valuable genetic resource for concurrently boosting culm strength and lodging resistance, and they will also provide a basis for further research on the lodging resistance mechanism of rice.
