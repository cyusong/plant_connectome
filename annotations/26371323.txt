['26371323', 'Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is an essential part of  an ER-localized protein quality-control system for eliminating terminally  misfolded proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated that the ERAD machinery is  conserved among yeast, animals, and plants; however, it remains unknown if the  plant ERAD system involves plant-specific components. Here we report that the  Arabidopsis ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized brassinosteroid-insensitive 1  suppressor 7 (EBS7) gene encodes an ER membrane-localized ERAD component that is  highly conserved in land plants. Loss-of-function ebs7 mutations prevent ERAD of  brassinosteroid insensitive 1-9 (bri1-9) and bri1-5, two ER-retained mutant  variants of the cell-surface receptor for brassinosteroids (BRs). As a result,  the two mutant receptors accumulate in the ER and consequently leak to the plasma  membrane, resulting in the restoration of BR sensitivity and phenotypic  suppression of the bri1-9 and bri1-5 mutants. EBS7 accumulates under ER stress,  and its mutations lead to hypersensitivity to ER and salt stresses. EBS7  interacts with the ER membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase Arabidopsis thaliana  HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1a (AtHrd1a), one of the central components of the  Arabidopsis ERAD machinery, and an ebs7 mutation destabilizes AtHrd1a to reduce  polyubiquitination of bri1-9. Taken together, our results uncover a  plant-specific component of a plant ERAD pathway and also suggest its likely  biochemical function.', '2015 Sep 29', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1511724112', 'Li']
