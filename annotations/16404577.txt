Arabinoxylans (AX) and (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-glucans are major components of wheat endosperm cell walls. Their chemical heterogeneity has been described but little is known about the sequence of their deposition in cell walls during endosperm development. The time course and pattern of deposition of the (1-->3) and (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-glucans and AX in the endosperm cell walls of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Recital) during grain development was studied using specific antibodies. At approximately 45 degrees D (degree-days) after anthesis the developing walls contained (1-->3)-beta-glucans but not (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-glucans. In contrast, (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-glucans occurred widely in the walls of maternal tissues. At the end of the cellularization stage (72 degrees D), (1-->3)-beta-glucan epitopes disappeared and (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-glucans were found equally distributed in all thin walls of wheat endosperm. The AX were detected at the beginning of differentiation (245 degrees D) in wheat endosperm, but were missing in previous stages. However, epitopes related to AX were present in nucellar epidermis and cross cells surrounding endosperm at all stages but not detected in the maternal outer tissues. As soon as the differentiation was apparent, the cell walls exhibited a strong heterogeneity in the distribution of polysaccharides within the endosperm.
