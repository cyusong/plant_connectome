['12121623', 'Proper DNA methylation patterning requires the complementary processes of de novo  methylation (the initial methylation of unmethylated DNA sequences) and  maintenance methylation (the faithful replication of preexisting methylation).  Arabidopsis has two types of methyltransferases with demonstrated maintenance  activity: MET1, which maintains CpG methylation and is homologous to mammalian  DNMT1, and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), which maintains CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G)  methylation and is unique to the plant kingdom. Here we describe loss-of-function  mutations in the Arabidopsis DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE (DRM) genes and provide  evidence that they encode de novo methyltransferases. drm1 drm2 double mutants  retained preexisting CpG methylation at the endogenous FWA locus but blocked de  novo CpG methylation that is normally associated with FWA transgene silencing.  Furthermore, drm1 drm2 double mutants blocked de novo CpNpG and asymmetric  methylation and gene silencing of the endogenous SUPERMAN (SUP) gene, which is  normally triggered by an inverted SUP repeat. However, drm1 drm2 double mutants  did not show reactivation of previously established SUPERMAN epigenetic silenced  alleles. Thus, drm mutants prevent the establishment but not the maintenance of  gene silencing at FWA and SUP, suggesting that the DRMs encode the major de novo  methylation enzymes affecting these genes.', '2002 Jul 9', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00925-9', 'Jacobsen']
