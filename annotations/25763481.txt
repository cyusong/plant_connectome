The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role in numerous aspects of plant growth and environmental stress responses. Endogenous ABA levels are regulated by a balance between its biosynthetic and catabolic activities. This balance may occur at multiple levels and includes the expression of genes involved in these processes. ABA UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT), the major player in the ABA conjugation pathway, has been shown to have a marginal effect on free ABA levels. However, recent studies provide new insight into the importance of the ABA conjugation pathway in contributing to the control of ABA homeostasis. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutant analyses have revealed that UGT71B6, an ABA UGT, and its 2 closely related homologs, UGT71B7 and UGT71B8, play a crucial role in ABA homeostasis and in adaptation to various abiotic stresses.
