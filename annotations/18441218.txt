NADPH:protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) oxidoreductase (POR) A is the only known example thus far of a nucleus-encoded plastid protein that is imported to its final destination in a substrate-dependent, Pchlide-regulated manner. Previous work has shown that the cytosolic PORA precursor (pPORA) does not utilize the general import site but uses a distinct translocon designated the Pchlide-dependent translocon complex. Here we demonstrate that a pentapeptide motif, threonine-threonine-serine-proline-glycine (TTSPG) in pPORA's transit peptide (transA), is involved in Pchlide-dependent transport. Deletion of this motif from the COOH-terminal end of transA abolished both Pchlide binding and protein import. Incorporation of the TTSPG motif into normally non-Pchlide-responsive transit sequences conferred the pigment binding properties onto the engineered chimeric precursors but was insufficient to render protein import substrate dependent. An additional motif was identified in the NH(2)-terminal part of transA that was needed for binding of the precursor to the Pchlide-dependent translocon complex. Point mutations of the TTSPG motif identified glycine as the Pchlide binding site. By analogy to the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein of photosystem II, we propose that the peptidyl carbonyl oxygen of glycine may bind directly or via a water molecule to the central Mg atom of the pigment.
