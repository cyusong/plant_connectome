Breeding crops with resistance is an efficient way to control diseases. However, increased resistance often has a fitness penalty. Thus, simultaneously increasing disease resistance and yield potential is a challenge in crop breeding. In this study, we found that downregulation of microRNA-156 (miR-156) and overexpression of Ideal Plant Architecture1 (IPA1) and OsSPL7, two target genes of miR-156, enhanced disease resistance against bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), but reduced rice yield. We discovered that gibberellin signalling might be partially responsible for the disease resistance and developmental defects in IPA1 overexpressors. We then generated transgenic rice plants expressing IPA1 with the pathogen-inducible promoter of OsHEN1; these plants had both enhanced disease resistance and enhanced yield-related traits. Thus, we have identified miR-156-IPA1 as a novel regulator of the crosstalk between growth and defence, and we have established a new strategy for obtaining both high disease resistance and high yield.
