Abiotic stresses are emerging as a potential threat to sustainable agriculture worldwide. Soil salinity and drought will be the major limiting factors for rice productivity in years to come. The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway plays a key role in salinity tolerance by maintaining the cellular ion homeostasis, with SOS2, a S/T kinase, being a vital component. The present study investigated the role of the OsSOS2, a SOS2 homolog from rice, in improving salinity and drought tolerance. Transgenic plants with either overexpression (OE) or knockdown (KD) of OsSOS2 were raised in one of the high-yielding cultivars of rice-IR64. Using a combined approach based on physiological, biochemical, anatomical, microscopic, molecular, and agronomic assessment, the evidence presented in this study advocates the role of OsSOS2 in improving salinity and drought tolerance in rice. The OE plants were found to have favorable ion and redox homeostasis when grown in the presence of salinity, while the KD plants showed the reverse pattern. Several key stress-responsive genes were found to work in an orchestrated manner to contribute to this phenotype. Notably, the OE plants showed tolerance to stress at both the seedling and the reproductive stages, addressing the two most sensitive stages of the plant. Keeping in mind the importance of developing crops plants with tolerance to multiple stresses, the present study established the potential of OsSOS2 for biotechnological applications to improve salinity and drought stress tolerance in diverse cultivars of rice.
