['9651577', 'Plants have at least two major photosensory receptors: phytochrome (absorbing  primarily red/far-red light) and cryptochrome (absorbing blue/UV-A light);  considerable physiological and genetic evidence suggests some form of  communication or functional dependence between the receptors. Here, we  demonstrate in vitro, using purified recombinant photoreceptors, that Arabidopsis  CRY1 and CRY2 (cryptochrome) are substrates for phosphorylation by a phytochrome  A-associated kinase activity. Several mutations within the CRY1 C terminus lead  to reduced phosphorylation by phytochrome preparations in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid  interaction studies using expressed C-terminal fragments of CRY1 and phytochrome  A from Arabidopsis confirm a direct physical interaction between both  photoreceptors. In vivo labeling studies and specific mutant alleles of CRY1,  which interfere with the function of phytochrome, suggest the possible relevance  of these findings in vivo.', '1998 Jun', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80094-5', 'Cashmore']
