Members of the YABBY gene family play significant roles in lamina development in cotyledons, floral organs, and other lateral organs. The Orchidaceae family is one of the largest angiosperm groups. Some YABBYs have been reported in Orchidaceae. However, the function of YABBY genes in <i>Cymbidium</i> is currently unknown. In this study, 24 YABBY genes were identified in <i>Cymbidium ensifolium</i>, <i>C. goeringii</i>, and <i>C. sinense.</i> We analyzed the conserved domains and motifs, the phylogenetic relationships, chromosome distribution, collinear correlation, and <i>cis</i>-elements of these three species. We also analyzed expression patterns of <i>C. ensifolium</i> and <i>C. goeringii</i>. Phylogenetic relationships analysis indicated that 24 YABBY genes were clustered in four groups, INO, CRC/DL, YAB2, and YAB3/FIL. For most YABBY genes, the zinc finger domain was located near the N-terminus and the helix-loop-helix domain (YABBY domain) near the C-terminus. Chromosomal location analysis results suggested that only <i>C. goeringii</i> YABBY has tandem repeat genes. Almost all the YABBY genes displayed corresponding one-to-one relationships in the syntenic relationships analysis. <i>Cis</i>-elements analysis indicated that most elements were clustered in light-responsive elements, followed by MeJA-responsive elements. Expression patterns showed that YAB2 genes have high expression in floral organs. RT-qPCR analysis showed high expression of <i>CeYAB3</i> in lip, petal, and in the gynostemium. <i>CeCRC</i> and <i>CeYAB2.2</i> were highly expressed in gynostemium. These findings provide valuable information of YABBY genes in <i>Cymbidium</i> species and the function in Orchidaceae.
