An understanding of the cell biology underlying the burgeoning molecular genetic and genomic knowledge of oomycete pathogenicity is essential to gain the full context of how these pathogens cause disease on plants. An intense research focus on secreted Phytophthora effector proteins, especially those containing a conserved N-terminal RXLR motif, has meant that most cell biological studies into Phytophthora diseases have focussed on the effectors and their host target proteins. While these effector studies have provided novel insights into effector secretion and host defence mechanisms, there remain many unanswered questions about fundamental processes involved in spore biology, host penetration and haustorium formation and function.
