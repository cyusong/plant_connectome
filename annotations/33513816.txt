Mitochondrial homeostasis refers to the balance of mitochondrial number and quality in a cell. It is maintained by mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion/fission, and the clearance of unwanted/damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy represents a selective form of autophagy by sequestration of the potentially harmful mitochondrial materials into a double-membrane autophagosome, thus preventing the release of death inducers, which can trigger programmed cell death (PCD). Recent advances have also unveiled a close interconnection between mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, as well as PCD in both mammalian and plant cells. In this review, we will summarize and discuss recent findings on the interplay between mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, with a focus on the molecular evidence for mitophagy crosstalk with mitochondrial dynamics and PCD.
