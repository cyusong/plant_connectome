['10559438', 'Calcium (Ca(2)+) efflux from the cytosol modulates Ca(2+) concentrations in the  cytosol, loads Ca(2+) into intracellular compartments, and supplies Ca(2+) to  organelles to support biochemical functions. The Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter CAX1 (for  CALCIUM EXCHANGER 1) of Arabidopsis is thought to be a key mediator of these  processes. To clarify the regulation of CAX1, we examined CAX1 RNA expression in  response to various stimuli. CAX1 was highly expressed in response to exogenous  Ca(2+). Transgenic tobacco plants expressing CAX1 displayed symptoms of Ca(2+)  deficiencies, including hypersensitivity to ion imbalances, such as increased  magnesium and potassium concentrations, and to cold shock, but increasing the  Ca(2+) in the media abrogated these sensitivities. Tobacco plants expressing CAX1  also demonstrated increased Ca(2+) accumulation and altered activity of the  tonoplast-enriched Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter. These results emphasize that regulated  expression of Ca(2+)/H(+) antiport activity is critical for normal growth and  adaptation to certain stresses.', '1999 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.11.2113', 'Hirschi']
