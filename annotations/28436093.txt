Salinity is an ever increasing menace that affects agriculture worldwide. Crops such as rice are salt sensitive, but its degree of susceptibility varies widely between cultivars pointing to extensive genetic diversity that can be exploited to identify genes and proteins that are relevant in the response of rice to salt stress. We used a diversity panel of 306 rice accessions and collected phenotypic data after short (6 h), medium (7 d) and long (30 d) salinity treatment (50 mm NaCl). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was subsequently performed, which identified around 1200 candidate genes from many functional categories, but this was treatment period dependent. Further analysis showed the presence of cation transporters and transcription factors with a known role in salinity tolerance and those that hitherto were not known to be involved in salt stress. Localization analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed the presence of several hundred non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in coding regions and earmarked specific genomic regions with increased numbers of nsSNPs. It points to components of the ubiquitination pathway as important sources of genetic diversity that could underpin phenotypic variation in stress tolerance.
