Calcium is integral to the perception, communication and adjustment of cellular responses to environmental changes. However, the role of Ca(2+) in fine-tuning cellular responses of wild-type cyanobacteria under favourable growth conditions has not been examined. In this study, extracellular Ca(2+) has been altered, and changes in the whole transcriptome of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 have been evaluated under conditions replete of carbon and combined nitrogen. Ca(2+) induced differential expression of many genes driving primary cellular metabolism, with transcriptional regulation of carbon- and nitrogen-related processes responding with opposing trends. However, physiological effects of these transcriptional responses on biomass accumulation, biomass composition, and photosynthetic activity over the 24h period following Ca(2+) adjustment were found to be minor. It is well known that intracellular carbon:nitrogen balance is integral to optimal cell growth and that Ca(2+) plays an important role in the response of heterocystous cyanobacteria to combined-nitrogen deprivation. This work adds to the current knowledge by demonstrating a signalling role of Ca(2+) for making sensitive transcriptional adjustments required for optimal growth under non-limiting conditions.
