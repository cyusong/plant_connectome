Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been reported to be important for normal plant growth. To characterize the role of the enzyme further, we attempted to isolate Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants that do not express the gene, but we could not recover homozygous mutant plants. The progeny of VPS34/vps34 heterozygous plants, harboring a T-DNA insertion, showed a segregation ratio of 1:1:0 for wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant plants, indicating a gametophytic defect. Genetic transmission analysis showed that the abnormal segregation ratio was due to failure to transmit the mutant allele through the male gametophyte. Microscopic observation revealed that 2-fold higher proportions of pollen grains in heterozygous plants than wild-type plants were dead or showed reduced numbers of nuclei. Many mature pollen grains from the heterozygous plants contained large vacuoles even until the mature pollen stage, whereas pollen from wild-type plants contained many small vacuoles beginning from the vacuolated pollen stage, which indicated that vacuoles in many of the heterozygous mutant pollen did not undergo normal fission after the first mitotic division. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is essential for vacuole reorganization and nuclear division during pollen development.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase: !essential for! vacuole reorganization and nuclear division
VPS34/vps34 heterozygous plants: !show! segregation ratio of 1:1:0
Heterozygous plants: !have! 2-fold higher proportions of dead or reduced nuclei pollen grains
Wild-type plants: !contain! many small vacuoles beginning from the vacuolated pollen stage
Heterozygous mutant pollen: !contain! large vacuoles even until the mature pollen stage
