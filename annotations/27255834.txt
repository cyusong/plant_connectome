L-Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid-derived plant compounds such as flavonoids, coumarins and the cell wall polymer lignin. The cell walls of grasses possess higher proportions of syringyl (S)-rich lignins and high levels of esterified coumaric acid compared with those of dicotyledonous plants, and PAL from grasses can also possess tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) activity, the reason for which has remained unclear. Using phylogenetic, transcriptomic and in vitro biochemical analyses, we identified a single homotetrameric bifunctional ammonia-lyase (PTAL) among eight BdPAL enzymes in the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon. (13)C isotope labelling experiments along with BdPTAL1-downregulation in transgenic plants showed that the TAL activity of BdPTAL1 can provide nearly half of the total lignin deposited in Brachypodium, with a preference for S-lignin and wall-bound coumarate biosynthesis, indicating that PTAL function is linked to the characteristic features of grass cell walls. Furthermore, isotope dilution experiments suggest that the pathways to lignin from L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are distinct beyond the formation of 4-coumarate, supporting the organization of lignin synthesis enzymes in one or more metabolons.
