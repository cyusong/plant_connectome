['16214889', 'Steroid hormones are essential for development, and the precise control of their  homeostasis is a prerequisite for normal growth. UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs)  are considered to play an important regulatory role in the activity of steroids  in mammals and insects. This study provides an indication that a UGT accepting  plant steroids as substrates functions in brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis. The  UGT73C5 of Arabidopsis thaliana catalyses 23-O-glucosylation of the BRs  brassinolide (BL) and castasterone. Transgenic plants overexpressing UGT73C5  displayed BR-deficient phenotypes and contained reduced amounts of BRs. The  phenotype, which was already apparent in seedlings, could be rescued by  application of BR. In feeding experiments with BL, wild-type seedlings converted  BL to the 23-O-glucoside; in the transgenic lines silenced in UGT73C5 expression,  no 23-O-glucoside was detected, implying that this UGT is the only enzyme that  catalyzes BL-23-O-glucosylation in seedlings. Plant lines in which UGT73C5  expression was altered also displayed hypocotyl phenotypes previously described  for seedlings in which BR inactivation by hydroxylation was changed. These data  support the hypothesis that 23-O-glucosylation of BL is a function of UGT73C5 in  planta, and that glucosylation regulates BR activity.', '2005 Oct 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0504279102', 'Bowles']
