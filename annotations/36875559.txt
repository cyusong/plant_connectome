Research strategies that combine molecular data from multiple levels of genome expression (i.e., multi-omics data), often referred to as a systems biology strategy, has been advocated as a route to discovering gene functions. In this study we conducted an evaluation of this strategy by combining lipidomics, metabolite mass-spectral imaging and transcriptomics data from leaves and roots in response to mutations in two <i>AuTophaGy-related</i> (<i>ATG</i>) genes of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Autophagy is an essential cellular process that degrades and recycles macromolecules and organelles, and this process is blocked in the <i>atg7</i> and <i>atg9</i> mutants that were the focus of this study. Specifically, we quantified abundances of ~100 lipids and imaged the cellular locations of ~15 lipid molecular species and the relative abundance of ~26,000 transcripts from leaf and root tissues of WT, <i>atg7</i> and <i>atg9</i> mutant plants, grown either in normal (nitrogen-replete) and autophagy-inducing conditions (nitrogen-deficient). The multi-omics data enabled detailed molecular depiction of the effect of each mutation, and a comprehensive physiological model to explain the consequence of these genetic and environmental changes in autophagy is greatly facilitated by the <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the exact biochemical function of the ATG7 and ATG9 proteins.
