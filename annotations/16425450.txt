Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive, membrane-permeable free radical, which has recently emerged as an important antioxidant. Here we investigated the protective effect of NO against the toxicity and NH4+ accumulation in rice leaves caused by excess CuSO4 (10mmol L(-1)). It was found that free radical scavengers (sodium benzoate, thiourea, and reduced glutathione) reduced the toxicity and NH4+ accumulation in rice leaves caused by excess CuSO4. NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was also effective in reducing CuSO4-induced toxicity and NH4+ accumulation in rice leaves. The protective effect of SNP on the toxicity and NH4+ accumulation can be reversed by 2-(4-carboxy-2-phenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl- imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, a NO scavenger, suggesting that the protective effect of SNP is attributable to NO released. Results obtained in the present study suggest that reduction of CuSO4-induced toxicity and NH4+ accumulation by SNP is most likely mediated through its ability to scavenge active oxygen species.
