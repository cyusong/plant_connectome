Mulberry (Morus alba) is an important crop tree involved in sericulture and pharmaceuticals. To further understand the development and the environmental adaptability mechanism of mulberry, a cDNA of the gene MaACO1 encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase was isolated from mulberry. This was used to investigate stress-responsive expression in mulberry. Developmental expression of ACC oxidase in mulberry leaves and spatial expression in mulberry flowers were also investigated. Damage and low-temperature treatment promoted the expression of MaACO1 in mulberry. In leaves, expression of the MaACO1 gene increased in cotyledons and the lowest leaves with leaf development, but showed reduced levels in emerging leaves. In flowers, the pollinated stigma showed the highest expression level, followed by the unpollinated stigma, ovary, and immature flowers. These results suggest that high MaACO1 expression may be predominantly associated with tissue aging or senescence in mulberry.
