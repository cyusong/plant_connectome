Salicylic acid (SA) influences developmental senescence and is spatiotemporally controlled by various mechanisms, including biosynthesis, transport, and conjugate formation. Altered localization of Arabidopsis WHIRLY1 (WHY1), a repressor of leaf natural senescence, in the nucleus or chloroplast causes a perturbation in SA homeostasis, resulting in adverse plant senescence phenotypes. <i>WHY1</i> loss-of-function mutation resulted in SA peaking 5 d earlier compared to wild-type plants, which accumulated SA at 42 d after germination. SA accumulation coincided with an early leaf-senescence phenotype, which could be prevented by ectopic expression of the nuclear WHY1 isoform (nWHY1). However, expressing the plastid WHY1 isoform (pWHY1) greatly enhanced cellular SA levels. Transcriptome analysis in the <i>WHY1</i> loss-of-function mutant background following expression of either pWHY1 or nWHY1 indicated that hormone metabolism-related genes were most significantly altered. The pWHY1 isoform predominantly affected stress-related gene expression, whereas nWHY1 primarily controlled developmental gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR assays indicated that nWHY1 directly binds to the promoter region of <i>isochorismate synthase1</i> (<i>ICS1</i>), thus activating its expression at later developmental stages, but that it indirectly activates <i>S-adenosyl-</i> <i>l</i> <i>-Met-dependent methyltransferase1</i> (<i>BSMT1</i>) expression via ethylene response factor 109 (ERF109). Moreover, nWHY1 repressed expression of <i>Phe ammonia lyase</i>-encoding gene (<i>PAL1</i>) via R2R3-MYB member 15 (MYB15) during the early stages of development. Interestingly, rising SA levels exerted a feedback effect by inducing nWHY1 modification and pWHY1 accumulation. Thus, the alteration of WHY1 organelle isoforms and the feedback of SA are involved in a circularly integrated regulatory network during developmental or stress-induced senescence in Arabidopsis.
