['12039957', 'Following prenylation, the proteins are subject to two prenyl-dependent  modifications at their C-terminal end, which are required for their subcellular  targeting. First, the three C-terminal residues of the CAAX box prenylation  signaling motif are removed, which is followed by methylation of the free  carboxyl group of the prenyl cysteine moiety. An Arabidopsis homologue of the  yeast CAAX protease STE24 (AFC1) was cloned and expressed in rce1 Delta ste24  Delta mutant yeast to demonstrate functional complementation. The petunia  calmodulin CaM53 is a prenylated protein terminating in a CTIL CAAX box. Coupled  methylation proteolysis assays demonstrated the processing of CaM53 by AtSTE24.  In addition, AtSTE24 promoted plasma membrane association of the GFP-Rac fusion  protein, which terminates with a CLLM CAAX box. Interestingly, a plant homologue  of the second and major CAAX protease in yeast and animal cells, RCE1, was not  identified despite the availability of vast amounts of sequence data. Taken  together, these data suggest that AtSTE24 may process several prenylated proteins  in plant cells, unlike its yeast homologue, which processes only a-mating factor,  and its mammalian homologue, for which prenyl-CAAX substrates have not been  established. Transient expression of GFPAtSTE24 in leaf epidermal cells of  Nicotiana benthamiana showed that AtSTE24 is exclusively localized in the  endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that prenylated proteins in plants are first  targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum following their prenylation.', '2002 Aug 16', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M202916200', 'Yalovsky']
