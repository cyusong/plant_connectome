['19796364', 'PPI1 (proton pump interactor isoform 1) is a novel protein able to interact with  the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane  (PM) H(+)-ATPase. In vitro, PPI1 binds the PM H(+)-ATPase in a site different  from the known 14-3-3 binding site and stimulates its activity. In this study, we  analysed the intracellular localisation of PPI1. The intracellular distribution  was monitored in A. thaliana cultured cells by immunolocalisation using an  antiserum against the PPI1 N-terminus and in Vicia faba guard cells and epidermal  cells by transient expression of a GFP::PPI1 fusion. The results indicate that  the bulk of PPI1 is localised at the endoplasmic reticulum, from which it might  be recruited to the PM for interaction with the H(+)-ATPase in response to as yet  unidentified signals.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Biol (Stuttg)', '10.1111/j.1438-8677.2008.00181.x', 'De']
