['17933793', 'The patterning of epidermal cell types in Arabidopsis is a simple and useful  model for studying the molecular basis of cell specification in plants. The  distribution of different cell types in the Arabidopsis epidermis is regulated by  a lateral inhibition mechanism that relies on interactions between transcription  factors. However, it is unclear how temporal- or organ-specific differences in  epidermal patterning are achieved. Here we identify TRICHOMELESS1 (TCL1) as a new  and major single-repeat MYB-type transcription factor that negatively regulates  trichome formation in the inflorescence epidermis. A dominant mutant with  elevated expression of TCL1 has a glabrous (trichomeless) phenotype, whereas a  loss-of-function mutation in TCL1 uniquely confers ectopic trichome formation on  inflorescence stem and pedicels. Genetic analyses demonstrate that TCL1 and  CAPRICE work synergistically to regulate trichome patterning on these organs.  Interestingly, overexpression of TCL1 specifically suppresses the expression of  GLABRA1 (GL1), a crucial component in the trichome initiation complex, whereas  loss-of-function of TCL1 enhances GL1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation  results show that TCL1 can be recruited to the cis-acting regulatory elements of  GL1. These results provide the first molecular and genetic evidence that an R3  MYB may negatively regulate trichome cell specification in a novel manner by  directly suppressing the transcription of GL1.', '2007 Nov', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.009597', 'Chen']
