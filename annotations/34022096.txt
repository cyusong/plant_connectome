Cassava, an important food and energy crop, is relatively more resistant to drought stress than other crops. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this resistance remains elusive. Herein, we report that silencing a drought stress-responsive transcription factor MeRAV5 significantly reduced drought stress resistance, with higher levels of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) and less lignin during drought stress. Yeast two-hybrid, pull down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) showed that MeRAV5 physically interacted with peroxidase (MePOD) and lignin-related cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 15 (MeCAD15) in vitro and in vivo. MeRAV5 promoted the activities of both MePOD and MeCAD15 to affect H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and endogenous lignin accumulation respectively, which are important in drought stress resistance in cassava. When either MeCAD15 or MeRAV5 was silenced, or both were co-silenced, cassava showed lower lignin content and drought-sensitive phenotype, whereas exogenous lignin alkali treatment increased drought stress resistance and alleviated the drought-sensitive phenotype of these silenced cassava plants. This study documents that the modulation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and lignin by MeRAV5 is essential for drought stress resistance in cassava.
