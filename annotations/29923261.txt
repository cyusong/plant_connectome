['29923261', 'Plant somatic cells can be reprogrammed by in vitro tissue culture methods, and  massive genome-wide chromatin remodeling occurs, particularly during callus  formation. Since callus tissue resembles root primordium, conversion of tissue  identity is essentially required when leaf explants are used. Consistent with the  fact that the differentiation state is defined by chromatin structure, which  permits limited gene profiles, epigenetic changes underlie cellular reprogramming  for changes to tissue identity. Although a histone methylation process  suppressing leaf identity during leaf-to-callus transition has been demonstrated,  the epigenetic factor involved in activation of root identity remains elusive.  Here, we report that JUMONJI C DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 30 (JMJ30) stimulates  callus formation by promoting expression of a subset of LATERAL ORGAN  BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN (LBD) genes that establish root primordia. The JMJ30 protein  binds to promoters of the LBD16 and LBD29 genes along with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR  7 (ARF7) and ARF19 and activates LBD expression. Consistently, the  JMJ30-deficient mutant displays reduced callus formation with low LBD transcript  levels. The ARF-JMJ30 complex catalyzes the removal of methyl groups from  H3K9me3, especially at the LBD16 and LBD29 loci to activate their expression  during leaf-to-callus transition. Moreover, the ARF-JMJ30 complex further  recruits ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2), which promotes deposition of  H3K36me3 at the LBD16 and LBD29 promoters, and the tripartite complex ensures  stable LBD activation during callus formation. These results indicate that the  coordinated epigenetic modifications promote callus formation by establishing  root primordium identity.', '2018 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14002', 'Seo']
