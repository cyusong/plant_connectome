Plant viruses are an important class of pathogens that seriously affect plant growth and harm crop production. Viruses are simple in structure but complex in mutation and have thus always posed a continuous threat to agricultural development. Low resistance and eco-friendliness are important features of green pesticides. Plant immunity agents can enhance the resilience of the immune system by activating plants to regulate their metabolism. Therefore, plant immune agents are of great importance in pesticide science. In this paper, we review plant immunity agents, such as ningnanmycin, vanisulfane, dufulin, cytosinpeptidemycin, and oligosaccharins, and their antiviral molecular mechanisms and discuss the antiviral applications and development of plant immunity agents. Plant immunity agents can trigger defense responses and confer disease resistance to plants, and the development trends and application prospects of plant immunity agents in plant protection are analyzed in depth.
