Humans have been committed to space exploration and to find the next planet suitable for human survival. The construction of an ecosystem that adapts to the long-term survival of human beings in space stations or other planets would be the first step. The space plant cultivation system is the key component of an ecosystem, which will produce food, fiber, edible oil and oxygen for future space inhabitants. Many plant experiments have been carried out under a stimulated or real environment of altered gravity, including at microgravity (0 g), Moon gravity (0.17 g) and Mars gravity (0.38 g). How plants sense gravity and change under stress environment of altered gravity were summarized in this review. However, many challenges remain regarding human missions to the Moon or Mars. Our group conducted the first plant experiment under real Moon gravity (0.17 g) in 2019. One of the cotton seeds successfully germinated and produced a green seedling, which represents the first green leaf produced by mankind on the Moon.
