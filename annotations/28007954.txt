Jasmonates are phytohormones that modulate a wide spectrum of plant physiological processes, especially defense against herbivores and necrotrophs. The molecular mechanisms of jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling have been well characterized in model plants. In this review, we provide an in-depth analysis and overview of the origin and evolution of the jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the striking parallels between jasmonate and auxin signaling mechanisms, which reveals a common ancestry of these signaling mechanisms. Finally, we highlight the importance of studying jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling in lower plants.
