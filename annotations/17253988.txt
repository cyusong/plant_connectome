['17253988', 'The fluorouridine insensitive 1 (fur1) locus in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.  has previously been identified in a screen for growth resistance towards the  toxic compound fluorouridine. Mutation of this locus by ethylmethane sulfonate  (EMS) allows mutants to grow on this uridine analogue. We identified that the A.  thaliana equilibrative nucleoside transporter (AtENT3) was encoded by the fur1  locus. T-DNA insertional mutant plants for AtENT3 resemble the fur1 mutant  phenotype: i.e. they grow on fluorouridine, and seedlings as well as leaf discs  exhibit a markedly reduced uptake capacity for uridine and cytidine, but a less  pronounced reduced uptake for adenosine and guanosine. These results indicate  that AtENT3 is an important pyrimidine nucleoside transporter in Arabidopsis. In  addition, we identified the mutation in fur1 as a single base-pair exchange,  guanine --> adenine, leading to an amino acid exchange G --> R at position 281.  Furthermore, we showed that this mutation is indeed responsible for the observed  alterations in nucleoside transport in the fur1-1 line, because the introduction  of this mutation in AtENT3 promoted fluorouridine resistance in yeast cells  expressing this mutated protein. The biochemical characterization of AtENT3  expressed in Xenopus oocytes identified a proton-coupled concentrative mode of  nucleoside transport, although this carrier possesses structural features  characteristic for equilibrative nucleoside carriers.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02998.x', 'Mohlmann']
