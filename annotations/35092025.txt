Well-adapted root systems allow plants to grow under resource-limiting environmental conditions and are important determinants of yield in agricultural systems. Important staple crops such as rice and maize belong to the family of grasses, which develop a complex root system that consists of an embryonic root system that emerges from the seed, and a postembryonic nodal root system that emerges from basal regions of the shoot after germination. While early seedling establishment is dependent on the embryonic root system, the nodal root system, and its associated branches, gains in importance as the plant matures and will ultimately constitute the bulk of below-ground growth. In this review, we aim to give an overview of the different root types that develop in cereal grass root systems, explore the different physiological roles they play by defining their anatomical features, and outline the genetic networks that control their development. Through this deconstructed view of grass root system function, we provide a parts-list of elements that function together in an integrated root system to promote survival and crop productivity.
