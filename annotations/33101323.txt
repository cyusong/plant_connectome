Agricultural researchers are embracing remote sensing tools to phenotype and monitor agriculture crops. Specifically, large quantities of data are now being collected on small plot research studies using Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS, aka drones), ground systems, or other technologies but data processing and analysis lags behind. One major contributor to current data processing bottlenecks has been the lack of publicly available software tools tailored towards remote sensing of small plots and usability for researchers inexperienced in remote sensing. To address these needs we created plot shapefile maker (R/UAS::plotshpcreate): an open source R function which rapidly creates ESRI polygon shapefiles to the desired dimensions of individual agriculture research plots areas of interest and associates plot specific information. Plotshpcreate was developed to utilize inputs containing experimental design, field orientation, and plot dimensions for easily creating a multi-polygon shapefile of an entire small plot experiment. Output shapefiles are based on the user inputs geolocation of the research field ensuring accurate overlay of polygons often without manual user adjustment. The output shapefile is useful in GIS software to extract plot level data tracing back to the unique IDs of the experimental plots. Plotshpcreate is available on GitHub (https://github.com/andersst91/UAStools).
