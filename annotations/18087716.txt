We report the existence of a tip-high reactive oxygen species (ROS) gradient in growing Fucus serratus zygotes, using both 5-(and 6-) chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein and nitroblue tetrazolium staining to report ROS generation. Suppression of the ROS gradient inhibits polarized zygotic growth; conversely, exogenous ROS generation can redirect zygotic polarization following inhibition of endogenous ROS. Confocal imaging of fluo-4 dextran distributions suggests that the ROS gradient is interdependent on the tip-high [Ca(2+)](cyt) gradient which is known to be associated with polarized growth. Our data support a model in which localized production of ROS at the rhizoid tip stimulates formation of a localized tip-high [Ca(2+)](cyt) gradient. Such modulation of intracellular [Ca(2+)](cyt) signals by ROS is a common motif in many plant and algal systems and this study extends this mechanism to embryogenesis.
