['22345491', 'The transition from juvenility through maturation to senescence is a complex  process that involves the regulation of longevity. Here, we identify JUNGBRUNNEN1  (JUB1), a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced NAC transcription factor, as a  central longevity regulator in Arabidopsis thaliana. JUB1 overexpression strongly  delays senescence, dampens intracellular H(2)O(2) levels, and enhances tolerance  to various abiotic stresses, whereas in jub1-1 knockdown plants, precocious  senescence and lowered abiotic stress tolerance are observed. A JUB1 binding site  containing a RRYGCCGT core sequence is present in the promoter of DREB2A, which  plays an important role in abiotic stress responses. JUB1 transactivates DREB2A  expression in mesophyll cell protoplasts and transgenic plants and binds directly  to the DREB2A promoter. Transcriptome profiling of JUB1 overexpressors revealed  elevated expression of several reactive oxygen species-responsive genes,  including heat shock protein and glutathione S-transferase genes, whose  expression is further induced by H(2)O(2) treatment. Metabolite profiling  identified elevated Pro and trehalose levels in JUB1 overexpressors, in  accordance with their enhanced abiotic stress tolerance. We suggest that JUB1  constitutes a central regulator of a finely tuned control system that modulates  cellular H(2)O(2) level and primes the plants for upcoming stress through a gene  regulatory network that involves DREB2A.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.090894', 'Balazadeh']
