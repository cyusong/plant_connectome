How polytopic plasma membrane (PM) proteins reach their destination in plant cells remains elusive. Using transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells, we previously showed that the rice secretory carrier membrane protein 1 (SCAMP1), an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane domains (TMDs), is localized to the PM and trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we study the transport pathway and sorting signals of SCAMP1 by following its transient expression in tobacco BY-2 protoplasts and show that SCAMP1 reaches the PM via an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-TGN-PM pathway. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis of various green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions with SCAMP1 mutations further demonstrates that: (i) the cytosolic N-terminus of SCAMP1 contains an ER export signal; (ii) the transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2) and TMD3 of SCAMP1 are essential for Golgi export; (iii) SCAMP1 TMD1 is essential for TGN-to-PM targeting; (iv) the predicted topology of SCAMP1 and its various mutants remain identical as demonstrated by protease protection assay. Therefore, both the cytosolic N-terminus and TMD sequences of SCAMP1 play integral roles in mediating its transport to the PM via an ER-Golgi-TGN pathway.
