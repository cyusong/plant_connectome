Previous studies have shown that the serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) proteins in several plants play a key part in plant growth, development and stress responses. However, little is known about the functions of the SCPL genes in poplar. We identified 57 SCPL genes and divided into 3 subfamilies, which were unevenly distributed on 19 poplar chromosomes. Gene structure indicated that SCPL genes contain more introns, and motifs of each subfamily were relatively conserved. There were a total of 14 pairs of paralogs, with 6 pairs of these paralogs generated by segmental duplication and 1 generated by tandem duplication. In microsynteny analysis, large-scale duplication events played a key part in the expansion of Carboxypeptidase III genes. Expression of these genes was higher in mature leaf. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that majority of the SCPL genes were induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. PtSCPL27 and PtSCPL40 were located on the cytomembrane by conducting subcellular localization analysis. Our paper provides a theoretical basis for further functional research of PtSCPL genes and will benefit the molecular breeding for resistance to disease in poplar.
