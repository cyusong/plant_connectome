Haploid induction (HI) is an important tool in crop breeding. Phospholipase A1 (ZmPLA1)/NOT LIKE DAD (NLD)/MATRILINEAL (MTL) is a key gene controlling HI in maize; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, to dissect why loss of ZmPLA1 function could mediate HI we performed a comprehensive multiple omics analysis of zmpla1 mutant anthers by integrating transcriptome, metabolome, quantitative proteome, and protein modification data. Functional classes of significantly enriched or differentially abundant molecular entities were found to be associated with the oxidative stress response, suggesting that a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst plays a critical role in HI. In support of this, we further discovered that a simple chemical treatment of pollen with ROS reagents could lead to HI. Moreover, we identified ZmPOD65, which encodes a sperm-specific peroxidase, as a new gene controlling HI. Taken together, our study revealed a likely mechanism of HI, discovered a new gene controlling HI, and created a new method for HI in maize, indicating the importance of ROS balance in maintaining normal reproduction and providing a potential route to accelerate crop breeding.
