The rice prolamins consist of cysteine-rich 10 kDa (CysR10), 14 kDa (CysR14) and 16 kDa (CysR16) molecular species and a cysteine-poor 13 kDa (CysP13) polypeptide. These storage proteins form protein bodies (PBs) composed of single spherical intracisternal inclusions assembled within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that CysR10 and CysP13 were asymmetrically distributed within the PBs, with the former concentrated at the electron-dense center core region and the latter distributed mainly to the electron-lucent peripheral region. These results together with temporal expression data showed that the formation of prolamin-containing PB-I in the wild-type endosperm was initiated by the accumulation of CysR10 to form the center core. In mutants deficient for cysteine-rich prolamins, the typical PB-I structures containing the electron-dense center core were not observed, and instead were replaced by irregularly shaped, electron-lucent, hypertrophied PBs. Similar, deformed PBs were observed in a CysR10 RNA interference plant line. These results suggest that CysR10, through its formation of the central core and its possible interaction with other cysteine-rich prolamins, is required for tight packaging of the proteins into a compact spherical structure.
