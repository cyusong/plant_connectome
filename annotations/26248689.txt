Plant resistance genes (R많enes) harbor tremendous allelic diversity, constituting a robust immune system effective against microbial pathogens. Nevertheless, few functional R많enes have been identified for even the best-studied pathosystems. Does this limited repertoire reflect specificity, with most R많enes having been defeated by former pests, or do plants harbor a rich diversity of functional R많enes, the composite behavior of which is yet to be characterized? Here, we survey 332 NBS-LRR genes cloned from five resistant Oryza sativa (rice) cultivars for their ability to confer recognition of 12 rice blast isolates when transformed into susceptible cultivars. Our survey reveals that 48.5% of the 132 NBS-LRR loci tested contain functional rice blast R많enes, with most R많enes deriving from multi-copy clades containing especially diversified loci. Each R많ene recognized, on average, 2.42 of the 12 isolates screened. The abundant R많enes identified in resistant genomes provide extraordinary redundancy in the ability of host genotypes to recognize particular isolates. If the same is true for other pathogens, many extant NBS-LRR genes retain functionality. Our success at identifying rice blast R많enes also validates a highly efficient cloning and screening strategy.
