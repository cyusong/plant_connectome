Analysis of stress-associated miRNAs of Glycine max (L.) Merrill reveals wider ramifications of small RNA-mediated (conserved and legume-specific miRNAs) gene regulatory foot prints in molecular adaptive responses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are indispensable components of gene regulatory mechanism of plants. Soybean is a crop of immense commercial potential grown worldwide for its edible oil and soy meal. Intensive research efforts, using the next generation sequencing and bioinformatics techniques, have led to the identification and characterization of numerous small RNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), in soybean. Furthermore, studies have unequivocally demonstrated the significance of miRNAs during the developmental processes and various stresses in soybean. In this review, we summarize the current state of understanding of miRNA-based abiotic and biotic stress responses in soybean. In addition, the molecular insights gained from the stress-related soybean miRNAs have been compared to the miRNAs of other crops, especially legumes, and the core commonalities have been highlighted, though differences among them were not ignored. Nature of response of soybean-derived conserved miRNAs during various stresses was also analyzed to gain deeper insights regarding sRNAome-based defense responses. This review further provides way forward in legume small RNA transcriptomics based on the adaptive responses of soybean and other legume-derived miRNAs.
