Multiple ecological processes simultaneously govern community assembly, but it remains unclear how abiotic stressors regulate the relative importance of these processes among different biogeographic regions. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study on the responses of community assembly to varying environmental gradients, using the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of plant height (height), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) distributions on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Mongolian Plateau (MP). Our results showed that the prevalence of trait convergence across all grasslands in both TP and MP seem to be the result of abiotic filtering or weaker competitive exclusion etc. These trait-convergence assembly processes decrease the functional dispersion but increase the evenness of the trait frequency distribution. The mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis responses of grassland communities to abiotic stress varied between the TP and MP. On average, plant trait distribution was mainly driven by temperature on the TP, and low-temperature stress altered the community assembly rules. In contrast, water availability shaped plant trait frequency distributions on the MP, and drought stress mediated the balance between different assembly processes. Our results provide empirical evidence that divergent abiotic stressors regulate the grassland community assembly on the TP and MP. Together, our study speculates that different aspects of future climate change, such as climate warming and changing precipitation patterns, on community assembly are dependent on regional climatic regimes.

abiotic stressors: !regulate! community assembly
temperature: !shapes! trait distribution (TP)
low-temperature stress: !alters! assembly rules (TP)
water availability: !shapes! trait frequency distributions (MP)
drought stress: !mediates! balance between assembly processes (MP)
