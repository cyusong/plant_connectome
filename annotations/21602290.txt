['21602290', 'Higher plants use the sedimentation of amyloplasts in statocytes as statolith to  sense the direction of gravity during gravitropism. In Arabidopsis thaliana  inflorescence stem statocyte, amyloplasts are in complex movement; some show  jumping-like saltatory movement and some tend to sediment toward the gravity  direction. Here, we report that a RING-type E3 ligase SHOOT GRAVITROPISM9 (SGR9)  localized to amyloplasts modulates amyloplast dynamics. In the sgr9 mutant, which  exhibits reduced gravitropism, amyloplasts did not sediment but exhibited  increased saltatory movement. Amyloplasts sometimes formed a cluster that is  abnormally entangled with actin filaments (AFs) in sgr9. By contrast, in the fiz1  mutant, an ACT8 semidominant mutant that induces fragmentation of AFs,  amyloplasts, lost saltatory movement and sedimented with nearly statically. Both  treatment with Latrunculin B, an inhibitor of AF polymerization, and the fiz1  mutation rescued the gravitropic defect of sgr9. In addition, fiz1 decreased  saltatory movement and induced amyloplast sedimentation even in sgr9. Our results  suggest that amyloplasts are in equilibrium between sedimentation and saltatory  movement in wild-type endodermal cells. Furthermore, this equilibrium is the  result of the interaction between amyloplasts and AFs modulated by the SGR9. SGR9  may promote detachment of amyloplasts from AFs, allowing the amyloplasts to  sediment in the AFs-dependent equilibrium of amyloplast dynamics.', '2011 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.079442', 'Morita']
