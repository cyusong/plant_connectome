Plant lipid signals are crucial developmental modulators and stress response mediators. A family of acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) participates in the lipid trafficking of these signals. Isoform-specific functions can arise from differences in their subcellular distribution, tissue-specificity, stress-responsiveness, and ligand selectivity. In lipid-mediated cell signaling, plant ACBPs are not merely transporters but are also important regulators via their interaction with lipid-metabolic enzymes and precursor lipids. In this Insight, the regulatory roles of plant ACBPs in the synthesis of various signaling lipids, including phosphatidic acid, sterols, oxylipins, and sphingolipids, are reviewed. We focus on the functional significance of these lipid signals in plant development and stress responses with an overview of recent work using reverse genetics and transgenic Arabidopsis.
