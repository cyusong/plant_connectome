The mode of transmission of signals between plant cells is an important aspect of plant physiology. The main role in the generation of long-distance signals is played by changes in the membrane potential and cytoplasm calcium concentration, but the relationship between these responses evoked by the same stimuli in the same plant remains unknown. As one of the first plants that colonized land, the moss Physcomitrella patens is a suitable model organism for studying the evolution of signaling pathways in plants. Here, by the application of glutamate as a stimulus, we demonstrated that electrical but not calcium signals can be true carriers of information in long-distance signaling in Physcomitrella. The generation of electrical signals in a form of propagating transient depolarization seems to be dependent on the opening of calcium channels since the responses were reduced or totally blocked by calcium channel inhibitors. While the microelectrode measurements demonstrated the transmission of electric signals between leaf cells and juvenile cells (protonema), the fluorescence imaging of cytoplasmic calcium changes indicated that calcium response occurs only locally-at the site of glutamate application, and only in protonema cells. This study indicates different involvement of glutamate-induced electrical and calcium signals in cell-to-cell communication in these evolutionarily old terrestrial plants.
