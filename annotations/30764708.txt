['30764708', 'Subcellular localization of trafficking proteins in a single cell affects the  assembly of trafficking machinery between organelles and vesicles throughout the  targeting pathway. RabGTPase is one of the regulators to direct specific  targeting of cargo molecules depending on GDP/GTP bound status. We have recently  determined the crystal structures of GDP-bound inactive and both GTP- and  GppNHp-bound active forms of Arabidopsis RabA1a. It is notable that the switch  regions of RabA1a exhibit conformational changes derived by GDP or GTP binding.  However, it was not clear that where the GDP- or GTP-bound RabA1a is localized at  the subcellular level in a cell. Here we demonstrate that the distinct proportion  of subcellular localization of RabA1a depends on its site-specific mutation as  the GDP- or GTP-bound form. RabA1a proteins located at the plasma membrane,  endosomes, and cytosol. While the GDP-bound form of RabA1a(S27N) located more at  endosomes than the plasma membrane compared to the proportions of RabA1a  wild-type, and the GTP-bound RabA1a(Q72L) located mainly at the plasma membrane  in comparison to RabA1a wild-type and RabA1a(S27N). These distinct proportional  localizations of RabA1a enable a cognate interaction between inactive/active  RabA1 and effector molecules to direct specific targeting of its cargo molecules.', '2019', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.1080/15592324.2019.1581561', 'ORCID:']
