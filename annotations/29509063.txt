Venation patterning is a taxonomic attribute for classification of plants and it also plays a role in the interaction of plants with the environment. Despite its importance, the molecular physiology controlling this aspect of plant development is still poorly understood. Auxin plays a central role modulating the final vein network and patterning. This addendum discusses recent findings on the role of homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factors on the regulation of leaf venation patterning. Moreno-Piovano et al. reported that ectopic expression of a sunflower HD-Zip I gene, HaHB4, increased the asymmetry of leaf venation. Even more, this work showed that auxin transport in the leaf through LAX carriers controls venation patterning. Here, we provide evidence indicating that some Arabidopsis thaliana HD-Zip I genes play a role in the determination of the final leaf venation patterning. We propose that these genes contribute to regulate vein patterning, likely controlling auxin homeostasis.

Auxin: !modulates! Venation patterning
HaHB4: !increases! Asymmetry of leaf venation
LAX carriers: !controls! Venation patterning
HD-Zip I genes: !regulate! Vein patterning
HD-Zip I genes: !contribute to! Auxin homeostasis
