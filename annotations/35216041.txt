The CAPRICE (CPC)-like (CPL) genes belong to a single-repeat R3 MYB family, whose roles in physic nut (<i>Jatropha curcas</i> L.), an important energy plant, remain unclear. In this study, we identified a total of six CPL genes (<i>JcCPL1</i>-<i>6</i>) in physic nut. The JcCPL3, 4, and 6 proteins were localized mainly in the nucleus, while proteins JcCPL1, 2, and 5 were localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Ectopic overexpression of <i>JcCPL1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>4</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> resulted in an increase in root hair number and decrease in trichome number. Consistent with the phenotype of reduced anthocyanin in shoots, the expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were down-regulated in the shoots of these three transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> lines. Moreover, we observed that <i>OeJcCPL1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>4</i> plants attained earlier leaf senescence, especially at the late developmental stage. Consistent with this, the expression levels of several senescence-associated and photosynthesis-related genes were, respectively, up-regulated and down-regulated in leaves. Taken together, our results indicate functional divergence of the six CPL proteins in physic nut. These findings also provide insight into the underlying roles of CPL transcription factors in leaf senescence.
