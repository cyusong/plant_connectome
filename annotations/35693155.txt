Schistosomiasis is caused by the intestinal parasite <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>. Individuals are affected by schistosomiasis when they are exposed to aquatic environments contaminated with <i>Schistosoma cercariae</i> that emerged from the infected intermediate host mollusk of the genus <i>Biomphalaria</i>. The WHO recommends using molluscicidal products to reduce the snail population and disease transmission. The WHO encourages the search for alternative substances in schistosomiasis control. Natural products are seen as a promising alternative because they are abundant in countries where schistosomiasis is endemic and have many different substances in their extracts, impairing cases of resistance. Therefore, the nanoemulsion effect of a butanol-soluble fraction of <i>Sideroxylon obtusifolium</i> leaves was evaluated against three study points in the biological cycle of the disease, that is, adults and young <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i>, spawning by the host mollusk, and infectious larvae of the parasite. Extract-SOB (butanol fraction) and nano-SOB (nanoemulsion) demonstrated promising activity in adult <i>B. glabrata</i> population control with an LC<sub>50</sub> of 125.4 mg/L, an LC<sub>90</sub> of 178.1 mg/L, an LC<sub>50</sub> of 75.2 mg/L, and an LC<sub>90</sub> of 97 mg/L. Nano-SOB presented greater potency against young <i>B. glabrata</i>, with an LC<sub>90</sub> of 72.1 mg/L and an LC<sub>50</sub> of 58.3 mg/L. Still, relevant activity against <i>S. mansoni</i> cercariae was eliminated in 4 h (LC<sub>90</sub>: 34.6 mg/L). Nano-SOB reduced viable spawning by approximately 30% at 178.1 and 97 mg/L. Referring to most substances in this extract, quercetin-3-rhamnosyl-(1-6)-galactoside and hyperoside may cause low environmental toxicity and human toxicity according to <i>in silico</i> analysis. Thus, nano-SOB is a promising agent to combat <i>B. glabrata</i> population growth and schistosomiasis transmission.
