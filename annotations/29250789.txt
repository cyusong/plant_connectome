Multiple immune signaling pathways, coordinated by several subcellular compartments and interactions between these compartments, play important roles in a successful immune response. Pathogens use various strategies to either directly attack the plant's immune system or to indirectly manipulate the physiological status of the plant to inhibit an immune response. Microscopy-based approaches have allowed the direct visualization of membrane trafficking events, cytoskeleton reorganization, subcellular dynamics and inter-organellar communication during the immune response. Here, we discuss the contributions of organelles and the cytoskeleton to the plant's defense response against microbial pathogens, as well as the mechanisms used by pathogens to target these compartments to overcome the plant's defense barrier.
