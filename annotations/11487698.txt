['11487698', 'Shoot architecture and flowering time in angiosperms depend on the balanced  expression of a large number of flowering time and flower meristem identity  genes. Loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis EMBRYONIC FLOWER (EMF) genes  cause Arabidopsis to eliminate rosette shoot growth and transform the apical  meristem from indeterminate to determinate growth by producing a single terminal  flower on all nodes. We have identified the EMF1 gene by positional cloning. The  deduced polypeptide has no homology with any protein of known function except a  putative protein in the rice genome with which EMF1 shares common motifs that  include nuclear localization signals, P-loop, and LXXLL elements. Alteration of  EMF1 expression in transgenic plants caused progressive changes in flowering  time, shoot determinacy, and inflorescence architecture. EMF1 and its related  sequence may belong to a new class of proteins that function as transcriptional  regulators of phase transition during shoot development.', '2001 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010094', 'Sung']
