Extensive studies have been carried out on chloroplast gene expression and chloroplast development; however, the regulatory mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, we characterized Pigment-Defective Mutant4 (PDM4), a P-type PPR protein localized in chloroplast. The <i>pdm4</i> mutant showed seedling-lethal and albino phenotype under heterotrophic growth conditions. Transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that thylakoid structure was totally disrupted in <i>pdm4</i> mutant and eventually led to the breakdown of chloroplasts. The levels of several chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded proteins are strongly reduced in <i>pdm4</i> mutant. Besides, transcript profile analysis detected that, in <i>pdm4</i> mutant, the expression of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent genes was markedly affected, and deviant chloroplast rRNA processing was also observed. In addition, we found that PDM4 functions in the splicing of group II introns and may also be involved in the assembly of the 50S ribosomal particle. Our results demonstrate that PDM4 plays an important role in chloroplast gene expression and chloroplast development in Arabidopsis.
