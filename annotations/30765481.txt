Plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are involved in a number of biological processes including root nodule symbiosis. However, the role of nsLTPs in legume-rhizobium symbiosis remains poorly understood, and no rhizobia proteins that interact with nsLTPs have been reported to date. In this study, we used a bacteria two-hybrid system and identified the high temperature protein G (HtpG) from <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> that interacts with the nsLTP AsE246. The interaction between HtpG and AsE246 was confirmed by far-Western blotting and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Our results indicated that the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) domain of HtpG mediates the HtpG-AsE246 interaction. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HtpG was colocalized with AsE246 in infected nodule cells and symbiosome membranes. Expression of the <i>htpG</i> gene was relatively higher in young nodules and was highly expressed in the infection zones. Further investigation showed that <i>htpG</i> expression affects lipid abundance and profiles in root nodules and plays an essential role in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. Our findings provide further insights into the functional mechanisms behind the transport of symbiosome lipids via nsLTPs in root nodules.
