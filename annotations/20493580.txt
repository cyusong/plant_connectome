The formation of radical species was examined in roots of soybean seedlings exposed to aluminum (Al). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of root homogenates with the spin-trapping reagent 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO) indicated the presence of carbon-centered radicals in plants not exposed to Al. Plants exposed to 50 microM Al showed a similar spectrum, with increased signal intensity. These radicals were likely produced through a H-atom abstraction reaction by hydroxyl (*OH) radicals, the synthesis of which was initiated by the formation of superoxide (O2*-) anions. The increased production of the carbon-centered radicals may be responsible for the lipid peroxidation in Al-treated roots.
