Thirteen auxenic compounds were discovered in a screen of 10 000 compounds for auxin-like activity in Arabidopsis roots. One of the most potent substances was 2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-N-(4-H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)acetamide (WH7) which shares similar structure to the known auxenic herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). A selected set of 20 analogues of WH7 was used to provide detailed information about the structure-activity relationship based on their efficacy at inhibiting and stimulating root and shoot growth, respectively, and at induction of gene expression. It was shown that WH7 acts in a genetically defined auxin pathway. These small molecules will extend the arsenal of substances that can be used to define auxin perception site(s) and to dissect subsequent signalling events.
