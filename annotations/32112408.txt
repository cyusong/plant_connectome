DNA methylation is a widespread epigenetic mark that contributes to transcriptome reprogramming during plant-pathogen interactions. However, the distinct role of DNA methylation in establishing resistant and susceptible responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we developed and used a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) to characterize DNA methylome landscapes of soybean roots during the susceptible and resistant interactions with soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines). We also compared the methylomes of the NILs and their parents to identify introduced and stably inherited methylation variants. The genomes of the NILs were substantially differentially methylated under uninfected conditions. This difference was associated with differential gene expression that may prime the NIL responses to SCN infection. In response to SCN infection, the susceptible line exhibited reduced global methylation levels in both protein-coding genes and transposable elements, whereas the resistant line showed the opposite response, increased global methylation levels. Heritable and novel nonparental differentially methylated regions overlapping with genes associated with soybean response to SCN infection were identified and validated using transgenic hairy root system. Our analyses indicate that DNA methylation patterns associated with the susceptible and resistant interactions are highly specific and that novel and stably inherited methylation variants are of biological significance.
