Coupling anthesis date to the most suitable environmental conditions is critical for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) adaptation and yield potential. Development to anthesis is controlled by temperature and photoperiod. Response to photoperiod is chiefly modulated by Ppd-1 genes, but their effect on the quantitative response to photoperiod of (i) time to anthesis and (ii) pre-anthesis phases remains largely unknown. A photoperiod-sensitive spring cultivar, Paragon, and near-isogenic lines of it carrying different combinations of Ppd-1a insensitivity alleles were tested under a wide range of photoperiods, including switches in photoperiod at the onset of stem elongation. Using multimodel inference we found that Ppd-1a alleles reduced photoperiod sensitivity of (i) emergence to anthesis and (ii) emergence to onset of stem elongation, both in a less than additive manner, while threshold photoperiod and intrinsic earliness were unaffected. Sensitivity to current photoperiod from onset of stem elongation to flag leaf and from then to anthesis was milder than for previous phases and was not related to variability in Ppd-1. However, 'memory' effects of previously experienced photoperiod on the duration from onset of stem elongation to flag leaf were related to variability in Ppd-1. The characterization and quantification provided here of the effects on development of Ppd-1 allelic combinations should help increase accuracy of genotype-to-phenotype models in predicting wheat phenology.
