Plant immunity relies on nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) that detect microbial patterns released by pathogens, and activate localized cell death to prevent the spread of pathogens. Tsw is the only identified resistance (R) gene encoding an NLR, conferring resistance to tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV) in pepper species (Capsicum, Solanaceae). However, molecular and cellular mechanisms of Tsw-mediated resistance are still elusive. Here, we analysed the structural and cellular functional features of Tsw protein, and defined a hydrophobic module to improve NLR-mediated virus resistance. The plasma membrane associated N-terminal 137 amino acid in the coiled-coil (CC) domain of Tsw is the minimum fragment sufficient to trigger cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Transient and transgenic expression assays in plants indicated that the amino acids of the hydrophobic groove (134th-137th amino acid) in the CC domain is critical for its full function and can be modified for enhanced disease resistance. Based on the structural features of Tsw, a super-hydrophobic funnel-like mutant, TswY137W, was identified to confer higher resistance to TSWV in a SGT1 (Suppressor of G-two allele of Skp1)-dependent manner. The same point mutation in a tomato Tsw-like NLR protein also improved resistance to pathogens, suggesting a feasible way of structure-assisted improvement of NLRs.
