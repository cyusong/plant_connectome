Plant microRNAs are commonly encoded in transcripts containing a single microRNA precursor. Processing by DICER-LIKE 1 and associated factors results in the production of a small RNA, followed by its incorporation into an AGO-containing protein complex to guide silencing of an mRNA possessing a complementary target sequence. Certain microRNA loci contain more than one precursor stem-loop structure, thus encoding more than one microRNA in the same transcript. Here, we describe a unique case where the evolutionary conserved miR398a is encoded in the same transcript as the legume-specific miR2119. The dicistronic arrangement found in common bean was also observed in other legumes. In Phaseolus vulgaris, mature miR398 and miR2119 are repressed in response to water deficit, and we demonstrate that both are functional as they target the mRNAs for CSD1 and ADH1, respectively. Our results indicate that the repression of miR398 and miR2119 leads to coordinated up-regulation of CSD1 and ADH1 mRNAs in response to water deficit in common bean and possibly in other legumes. Furthermore, we show that miRNA directed CSD1 and ADH1 mRNAs up-regulation also occurs when common bean plants are exposed to flooding, suggesting that plant redox status and fermentation metabolism must be closely coordinated under different adverse conditions.
