The root system is particularly affected by unfavourable conditions because it is in direct contact with the soil environment. Casparian strips, a specialised structure deposited in anticlinal walls, are characterised by the impregnation of the primary wall pores with lignin and suberin. The Casparian strips in the endo- and exodermis of vascular plant roots appear to play an important role in preventing the non-selective apoplastic bypass of salts into the stele along the apoplast under salt stress. However, only a few investigations have examined the deposition and function of these apoplastic barriers in response to salt stress in higher plants.
