Sulphate uptake and its distribution within plants depend on the activity of different sulphate transporters (SULTR). In long-living deciduous plants such as trees, seasonal changes of spatial patterns add another layer of complexity to the question of how the interplay of different transporters adjusts S distribution within the plant to environmental changes. Poplar is an excellent model to address this question because its S metabolism is already well characterized. In the present study, the importance of SULTRs for seasonal sulphate storage and mobilization was examined in the wood of poplar (Populus tremula × P. alba) by analysing their gene expression in relation to sulphate contents in wood and xylem sap. According to these results, possible functions of the respective SULTRs for seasonal sulphate storage and mobilization in the wood are suggested. Together, the present results complement the previously published model for seasonal sulphate circulation between leaves and bark and provide information for future mechanistic modelling of whole tree sulphate fluxes.
