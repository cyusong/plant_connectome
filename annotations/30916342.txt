Flowers have fascinated humans for millennia, not only because of their beauty, but also because they give rise to fruits, from which most agricultural products are derived. In most angiosperms, the number and position of floral organs are morphologically and genetically defined, and their development is tightly controlled by complex regulatory networks to ensure reproductive success. How flower development is temporally initiated and spatially maintained has been widely researched. As the flower develops, the balance between proliferation and differentiation dynamically shifts towards organogenesis and termination of floral stem cell maintenance. In this review, we focus on recent findings that further reveal the intricate molecular mechanisms for precise timing of floral meristem termination.
