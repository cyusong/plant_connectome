Silicon (Si) is important for stable and high yields in rice (Oryza sativa), a typical Si hyperaccumulator. The high Si accumulation is achieved by co-operation of two Si transporters, LOW SILICON 1 (OsLsi1) and OsLsi2, which are polarly localized in cells of the root exodermis and endodermis. However, the mechanism underlying their polar localization is unknown. Here, we identified amino acid residues critical for the polar localization of OsLsi1. Deletion of both N- and C-terminal regions resulted in loss of its polar localization. Furthermore, deletion of the C-terminus inhibited its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Detailed site-directed mutagenesis analysis showed that Ile18 at the N-terminal region and Ile285 at the C-terminal region were essential for the polar localization of OsLsi1. Moreover, a cluster of positively charged residues at the C-terminal region is also required for polar localization. Phosphorylation and Lys modifications of OsLsi1 are unlikely to be involved in its polar localization. Finally, we showed that the polar localization of OsLsi1 is required for efficient uptake of Si. Our study not only identified critical residues required for polar localization of OsLsi1, but also provided experimental evidence for the importance of transporter polarity for efficient nutrient uptake.
