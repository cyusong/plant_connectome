['12805625', 'Ethanolic fermentation is classically associated with flooding tolerance when  plant cells switch from respiration to anaerobic fermentation. However, recent  studies have suggested that fermentation also has important functions in the  presence of oxygen, mainly in germinating pollen and during abiotic stress.  Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), which catalyzes the first step in this pathway, is  thought to be the main regulatory enzyme. Here, we characterize the PDC gene  family in Arabidopsis. PDC is encoded by four closely related genes. By using  real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we determined the expression  levels of each individual gene in different tissues, under normal growth  conditions, and when the plants were subjected to anoxia or other environmental  stress conditions. We show that PDC1 is the only gene induced under oxygen  limitation among the PDC1 gene family and that a pdc1 null mutant is comprised in  anoxia tolerance but not other environmental stresses. We also characterize the  expression of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family. None of the three  genes is induced by anoxia but ALDH2B7 reacts strongly to ABA application and  dehydration, suggesting that ALDH may play a role in aerobic detoxification of  acetaldehyde. We discuss the possible role of ethanolic fermentation as a robust  back-up energy production pathway under adverse conditions when mitochondrial  function is disturbed.', '2003 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.102.016907', 'Kuhlemeier']
