We studied changes induced by cold on electron transfer pathways (linked to NADH or NADPH oxidation) in endoplasmic reticulum of rapeseed hypocotyls (Brassica napus L.) from a freezing-sensitive variety (ISL) and freezing-tolerant variety (Tradition). Plantlets were grown at 22 degrees C then submitted to a cold shock of 13 or 35 days at 4 degrees C. We measured the content in NADH, NADPH, NAD and NADP of the hypocotyls and the redox power was estimated by the reduced versus oxidized nucleotide ratio. The contents in cytochromes b (5) and P-450, electron acceptors of NADH and NADPH respectively, were determined by differential spectrophotometry. Finally, activity of both NADH-cytochrome b (5) reductase (E.C.1.6.2.2) and NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase (E.C.1.6.2.4) was determined by reduction of exogenous cytochrome c. Results show that during cold shock, along with an increase of linolenic acid content, there was a general activation of the NADPH pathway which was observed more quickly in Tradition plantlets than in ISL ones. Due to transfer of electrons that can occur between NADPH reductase and cytochrome b (5), this could favor fatty acid desaturation in Tradition, explaining why linolenic acid accumulation was more pronounced in this variety. Besides, more cytochrome P-450 accumulated in ISL that could compete for electrons needed by the FAD3 desaturase, resulting in a relative slower enrichment in 18:3 fatty acid in these plantlets.
