['19513101', 'Apomixis, or asexual clonal reproduction through seeds, is of immense interest  due to its potential application in agriculture. One key element of apomixis is  apomeiosis, a deregulation of meiosis that results in a mitotic-like division. We  isolated and characterised a novel gene that is directly involved in controlling  entry into the second meiotic division. By combining a mutation in this gene with  two others that affect key meiotic processes, we created a genotype called MiMe  in which meiosis is totally replaced by mitosis. The obtained plants produce  functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to their mother. The  creation of the MiMe genotype and apomeiosis phenotype is an important step  towards understanding and engineering apomixis.', '2009 Jun 9', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.1000124', 'Mercier']
