Photosynthesis is the vital metabolism of the plant affected by abiotic stress such as high temperature and elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] levels, which ultimately affect the source-sink relationship. Triose phosphate, the primary precursor of carbohydrate (starch and sucrose) synthesis in the plant, depends on environmental cues. The synthesis of starch in the chloroplasts of leaves (during the day), the transport of photoassimilates (sucrose) from source to sink, the loading and unloading of photoassimilates, and the accumulation of starch in the sink tissue all require a highly regulated network and communication system within the plant. These processes might be affected by high-temperature stress and elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] conditions. Generally, elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] levels enhance plant growth, photosynthetic rate, starch synthesis, and accumulation, ultimately diluting the nutrient of sink tissues. On the contrary, high-temperature stress is detrimental to plant development affecting photosynthesis, starch synthesis, sucrose synthesis and transport, and photoassimilate accumulation in sink tissues. Moreover, these environmental conditions also negatively impact the quality attributes such as grain/tuber quality, cooking quality, nutritional status in the edible parts and organoleptic traits. In this review, we have attempted to provide an insight into the source-sink relationship and the sugar metabolites synthesized and utilized by the plant under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and high-temperature stress. This review will help future researchers comprehend the source-sink process for crop growth under changing climate scenarios.
