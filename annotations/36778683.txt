With the development and wider application of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, researchers increasingly apply them to threshold optimization of multi-level image segmentation. This paper explores the performance and effects of Capuchin Search Algorithm (CAPSA) in threshold optimization. To solve problems of uneven distribution in the initial population of Capuchin Search Algorithm, low levels of global search performance and premature falling into local optima, this paper proposes an improved Capuchin Search Algorithm (ICAPSA) through a multi-strategy approach. ICAPSA uses chaotic opposite-based learning strategy to initialize the positions of individual capuchins, and improve the quality of the initial population. In the iterative position updating process, Levy Flight disturbance strategy is introduced to balance the global optimization and local exploitation of the algorithm. Finally, taking Kapur as the objective function, this paper applies ICAPSA to multi-level thresholding in the plant images, and compares its segmentation effects with the original CAPSA, the Fuzzy Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (FABC), the Differential Coyote Optimization Algorithm (DCOA), the Modified Whale Optimization Algorithm (MWOA) and Improved Satin Bowerbird Optimization Algorithm (ISBO). Through comparison, it is found that ICAPSA demonstrates superior segmentation effect, both in the visual effects of image segmentation and in data comparison.
