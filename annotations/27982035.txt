Bacteria respond to their environment by regulating mRNA synthesis, often by altering the genomic sites at which RNA polymerase initiates transcription. Here, we investigate genome-wide changes in transcription start site (TSS) usage by Clostridium phytofermentans, a model bacterium for fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. We quantify expression of nearly 10,000 TSS at single base resolution by Capp-Switch sequencing, which combines capture of synthetically capped 5' mRNA fragments with template-switching reverse transcription. We find the locations and expression levels of TSS for hundreds of genes change during metabolism of different plant substrates. We show that TSS reveals riboswitches, non-coding RNA and novel transcription units. We identify sequence motifs associated with carbon source-specific TSS and use them for regulon discovery, implicating a LacI/GalR protein in control of pectin metabolism. We discuss how the high resolution and specificity of Capp-Switch enables study of condition-specific changes in transcription initiation in bacteria.
