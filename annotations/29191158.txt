Plant roots are highly plastic to high salinity. However, the molecular mechanism by which root developmental plasticity is regulated remains largely unknown. Previously we reported that miR172c-NNC1 module plays a key role in soybean-rhizobial symbiosis. The fact that the miR172c promoter contains several stress-related cis elements indicates that miR172c may have a role in root response to abiotic stress. Here we showed that miR172c is greatly induced by salt stress in soybean. Overexpression of miR172c and knockdown of miR172c activity resulted in substantially increased and reduced root sensitivity to salt stress, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the target gene NNC1 (Nodule Number Control 1) of miR172c was downregulated by salt stress. The transgenic roots overexpressing or knocking down NNC1 expression also exhibited the altered root sensitivity to salt stress. The study reveals the crucial role of miR172c-NNC1 module in root stress tolerance to salt stress in soybean.
