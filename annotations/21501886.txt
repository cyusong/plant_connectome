Oryza meyeriana is a wild species of rice with high resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), but the resistance mechanism is poorly understood. Protein gel blot analysis and immuno-gold electron microscopy showed that Xoo infection induced an association of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase (RCA) with the thylakoid membrane in O. meyeriana, which led to considerable decline in the initial activity and the activation state of Rubisco. In susceptible cultivated rice, RCA remained in the chloroplast stroma. RCA may play a role in resistance to Xoo in O. meyeriana that differs from its well-known role in activating Rubisco, perhaps by protecting the thylakoid membrane against damage from Xoo.
