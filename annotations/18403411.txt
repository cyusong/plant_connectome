['18403411', 'Maintenance of the stem cell population located at the apical meristems is  essential for repetitive organ initiation during the development of higher  plants. Here, we have characterized the roles of OBERON1 (OBE1) and its paralog  OBERON2 (OBE2), which encode plant homeodomain finger proteins, in the  maintenance and/or establishment of the meristems in Arabidopsis. Although the  obe1 and obe2 single mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type plants, the  obe1 obe2 double mutant displayed premature termination of the shoot meristem,  suggesting that OBE1 and OBE2 function redundantly. Further analyses revealed  that OBE1 and OBE2 allow the plant cells to acquire meristematic activity via the  WUSCHEL-CLAVATA pathway, which is required for the maintenance of the stem cell  population, and they function parallel to the SHOOT MERISTEMLESS gene, which is  required for preventing cell differentiation in the shoot meristem. In addition,  obe1 obe2 mutants failed to establish the root apical meristem, lacking both the  initial cells and the quiescent center. In situ hybridization revealed that  expression of PLETHORA and SCARECROW, which are required for stem cell  specification and maintenance in the root meristem, was lost from obe1 obe2  mutant embryos. Taken together, these data suggest that the OBE1 and OBE2 genes  are functionally redundant and crucial for the maintenance and/or establishment  of both the shoot and root meristems.', '2008 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.014993', 'Komeda']
