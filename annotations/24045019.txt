['24045019', 'Upon disturbance of their function by stress, mitochondria can signal to the  nucleus to steer the expression of responsive genes. This mitochondria-to-nucleus  communication is often referred to as mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR).  Although reactive oxygen species and calcium are likely candidate signaling  molecules for MRR, the protein signaling components in plants remain largely  unknown. Through meta-analysis of transcriptome data, we detected a set of genes  that are common and robust targets of MRR and used them as a bait to identify its  transcriptional regulators. In the upstream regions of these mitochondrial  dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes, we found a cis-regulatory element, the  mitochondrial dysfunction motif (MDM), which is necessary and sufficient for gene  expression under various mitochondrial perturbation conditions. Yeast one-hybrid  analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the  transmembrane domain-containing no apical meristem/Arabidopsis transcription  activation factor/cup-shaped cotyledon transcription factors (ANAC013, ANAC016,  ANAC017, ANAC053, and ANAC078) bound to the MDM cis-regulatory element. We  demonstrate that ANAC013 mediates MRR-induced expression of the MDS genes by  direct interaction with the MDM cis-regulatory element and triggers increased  oxidative stress tolerance. In conclusion, we characterized ANAC013 as a  regulator of MRR upon stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2013 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.117168', 'Van']
