Plants launch a concerted immune response to dampen potential infections upon sensing microbial pathogen and insect invasions. The transient and rapid elevation of the cytosolic calcium concentration [Ca2+]cyt is among the essential early cellular responses in plant immunity. The free Ca2+ concentration in the apoplast is far higher than that in the resting cytoplasm. Thus, the precise regulation of calcium channel activities upon infection is the key for an immediate and dynamic Ca2+ influx to trigger downstream signaling. Specific Ca2+ signatures in different branches of the plant immune system vary in timing, amplitude, duration, kinetics, and sources of Ca2+. Recent breakthroughs in the studies of diverse groups of classical calcium channels highlight the instrumental role of Ca2+ homeostasis in plant immunity and cell survival. Additionally, the identification of some immune receptors as noncanonical Ca2+-permeable channels opens a new view of how immune receptors initiate cell death and signaling. This review aims to provide an overview of different Ca2+-conducting channels in plant immunity and highlight their molecular and genetic mode-of-actions in facilitating immune signaling. We also discuss the regulatory mechanisms that control the stability and activity of these channels.
