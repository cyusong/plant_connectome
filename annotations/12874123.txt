['12874123', 'In the leaf epidermis, guard mother cells undergo a stereotyped symmetric  division to form the guard cells of stomata. We have identified a  temperature-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant, stomatal cytokinesis-defective 1-1  (scd1-1), which affects this specialized division. At the non-permissive  temperature, 22 degrees C, defective scd1-1 guard cells are binucleate, and the  formation of their ventral cell walls is incomplete. Cytokinesis was also  disrupted in other types of epidermal cells such as pavement cells. Further  phenotypic analysis of scd1-1 indicated a role for SCD1 in seedling growth, root  elongation and flower morphogenesis. More severe scd1 T-DNA insertion alleles  (scd1-2 and scd1-3) markedly affect polar cell expansion, most notably in  trichomes and root hairs. SCD1 is a unique gene in Arabidopsis that encodes a  protein related to animal proteins that regulate intracellular protein transport  and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Consistent with a  role for SCD1 in membrane trafficking, secretory vesicles were found to  accumulate in cytokinesis-defective scd1 cells. In addition the scd1 mutant  phenotype was enhanced by low doses of inhibitors of cell plate consolidation and  vesicle secretion. We propose that SCD1 functions in polarized vesicle  trafficking during plant cytokinesis and cell expansion.', '2003 Sep', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.00619', 'Bednarek']
