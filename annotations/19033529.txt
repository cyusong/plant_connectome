['19033529', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) has an important role for plant growth, development, and  stress adaptation. HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1) is a protein phosphatase type 2C  that plays a key role as a negative regulator of ABA signaling; however, the  molecular details of HAB1 action in this process are not known. A two-hybrid  screen revealed that SWI3B, an Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the yeast SWI3  subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes, is a prevalent interacting  partner of HAB1. The interaction mapped to the N-terminal half of SWI3B and  required an intact protein phosphatase catalytic domain. Bimolecular fluorescence  complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction of  HAB1 and SWI3B in the nucleus of plant cells. swi3b mutants showed a reduced  sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination and growth and reduced  expression of the ABA-responsive genes RAB18 and RD29B. Chromatin  immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the presence of HAB1 in the vicinity  of RD29B and RAB18 promoters was abolished by ABA, which suggests a direct  involvement of HAB1 in the regulation of ABA-induced transcription. Additionally,  our results uncover SWI3B as a novel positive regulator of ABA signaling and  suggest that HAB1 modulates ABA response through the regulation of a putative  SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056705', 'Rodriguez']
