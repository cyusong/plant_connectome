Cell-surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are plant immune proteins that trigger an orchestrated downstream signaling in response to molecules of microbial origin or host plant origin. Historically, PRRs have been associated with pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), whereas NLRs have been involved with effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, recent studies reveal that such binary distinction is far from being applicable to the real world. Although the perception of plant pathogens and the final mounting response are achieved by different means, central hubs involved in signaling are shared between PTI and ETI, blurring the zig-zag model of plant immunity. In this review, we not only summarize our current understanding of PRR- and NLR-mediated immunities in plants, but also highlight those signaling components that are evolutionarily conserved across the plant kingdom. Altogether, we attempt to offer an overview of how plants mediate and integrate the induction of the defense responses that comprise PTI and ETI, emphasizing the need for more evolutionary molecular plant-microbe interactions (EvoMPMI) studies that will pave the way to a better understanding of the emergence of the core molecular machinery involved in the so-called evolutionary arms race between plants and microbes.
