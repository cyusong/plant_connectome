Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production is seriously affected by the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne graminicola</i>, which has emerged as a menace in upland and irrigated rice cultivation systems. Previously, activation tagging in rice was utilized to identify candidate gene(s) conferring resistance against <i>M. graminicola</i>. T-DNA insertional mutants were developed in a rice landrace (acc. JBT 36/14), and four mutant lines showed nematode resistance. Whole-genome sequencing of JBT 36/14 was done along with the four nematode resistance mutant lines to identify the structural genetic variations that might be contributing to <i>M. graminicola</i> resistance. Sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform identified 482,234 genetic variations in JBT 36/14 including 448,989 SNPs and 33,245 InDels compared to reference indica genome. In addition, 293,238-553,648 unique SNPs and 32,395-65,572 unique InDels were found in the four mutant lines compared to their JBT 36/14 background, of which 93,224 SNPs and 8,170 InDels were common between all the mutant lines. Functional annotation of genes containing these structural variations showed that the majority of them were involved in metabolism and growth. Trait analysis revealed that most of these genes were involved in morphological traits, physiological traits and stress resistance. Additionally, several families of transcription factors, such as FAR1, bHLH, and NAC, and putative susceptibility (S) genes, showed the presence of SNPs and InDels. Our results indicate that subject to further genetic validations, these structural genetic variations may be involved in conferring nematode resistance to the rice mutant lines.
