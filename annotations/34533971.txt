<i>Agrobacterium salinitolerans</i> DG3-1 is an endophytic bacterium isolated from cotton root tissue. Our previous work has shown that it can inhibit the growth of Fusarium and Verticillium wilt pathogens as well as increase the chlorophyll content of cotton leaves. Here, we reported the complete genome sequence of strain DG3-1, which was analyzed by sequence reads generated from Nanopore PromethION and Illumina NovaSeq PE150 platforms. This genome sequence could be used to clarify the possible mechanism of DG3-1 at the gene level.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
