Sugarcane (<i>Saccharum</i> spp.) is an important cash crop for production of sugar and bioethanol. Red stripe caused by <i>Acidovorax avenae</i> subsp. <i>avenae</i> (<i>Aaa</i>) is a disease that occurs in numerous sugarcane-growing regions worldwide. In this study, 17 strains of <i>Aaa</i> were isolated from 13 symptomatic leaf samples in China. Nine of these strains produced white-cream colonies on nutrient agar medium while the other eight produced yellow colonies. In pairwise sequence comparisons of the 16S-23S rRNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS), the 17 strains had 98.4-100% nucleotide identity among each other and 98.2-99.5% identity with the reference strain of <i>Aaa</i> (ATCC 19860). Three RFLP patterns based on this ITS sequence were also found among the strains of <i>Aaa</i> obtained in this study. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on five housekeeping genes (<i>ugp</i>B, <i>pil</i>T, <i>lep</i>A, <i>trp</i>B, and <i>glt</i>A) revealed that the strains of <i>Aaa</i> from sugarcane in China and a strain of <i>Aaa</i> (30179) isolated from sorghum in Brazil formed a unique evolutionary subclade. Twenty-four additional strains of <i>Aaa</i> from sugarcane in Argentina and from other crops worldwide were distributed in two other and separate subclades, suggesting that strains of <i>A. avenae</i> from sugarcane are clonal populations with local specificities. Two strains of <i>Aaa</i> from China (CNGX08 forming white-cream colored colonies and CNGD05 forming yellow colonies) induced severe symptoms of red stripe in sugarcane varieties LC07-150 and ZZ8 but differed based on disease incidence in two separate inoculation experiments. Infected plants also exhibited increased salicylic acid (SA) content and transcript expression of gene <i>PR-1</i>, indicating that the SA-mediated signal pathway is involved in the response to infection by <i>Aaa</i>. Consequently, red stripe of sugarcane in China is caused by genetically different strains of <i>Aaa</i> and at least two morphological variants. The impact of these independent variations on epidemics of red stripe remains to be investigated.
