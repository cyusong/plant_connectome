Root-infecting vascular fungi cause wilt diseases and provoke devastating losses in hundreds of crops. It is currently unknown how these pathogens evolved and whether they can also infect nonvascular plants, which diverged from vascular plants over 450 million years ago. We established a pathosystem between the nonvascular plant Marchantia polymorpha (Mp) and the root-infecting vascular wilt fungus Fusarium oxysporum (Fo). On angiosperms, Fo exhibits exquisite adaptation to the plant xylem niche as well as host-specific pathogenicity, both of which are conferred by effectors encoded on lineage-specific chromosomes. Fo isolates displaying contrasting lifestyles on angiosperms - pathogenic vs endophytic - are able to infect Mp and cause tissue maceration and host cell killing. Using isogenic fungal mutants we define a set of conserved fungal pathogenicity factors, including mitogen activated protein kinases, transcriptional regulators and cell wall remodelling enzymes, that are required for infection of both vascular and nonvascular plants. Markedly, two host-specific effectors and a morphogenetic regulator, which contribute to vascular colonisation and virulence on tomato plants are dispensable on Mp. Collectively, these findings suggest that vascular wilt fungi employ conserved infection strategies on nonvascular and vascular plant lineages but also have specific mechanisms to access the vascular niche of angiosperms.
