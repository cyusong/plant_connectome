In the struggle to secure nutrient access and to outperform competitors, some plant species have evolved a biochemical arsenal with which they inhibit the growth or development of neighbouring plants. This process, known as allelopathy, exists in many of today's major crops, including rice. Rice synthesizes momilactones, diterpenoids that are released into the rhizosphere and inhibit the growth of numerous plant species. While the allelopathic potential of rice was recognized decades ago, many questions remain unresolved regarding the biosynthesis, exudation, and biological activity of momilactones. Here, we review current knowledge on momilactones, their role in allelopathy, and their potential to serve as a basis for sustainable weed management. We emphasize the gaps in our current understanding of when and how momilactones are produced and of how they act in plant cells, and outline what we consider the next steps in momilactone and rice allelopathy research.
