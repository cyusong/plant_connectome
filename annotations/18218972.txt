Regulation of carbon partitioning is essential for plant growth and development. To gain insight into genes controlling carbon allocation in leaves, we identified mutants that hyperaccumulate carbohydrates. tie-dyed2 (tdy2) is a recessive mutant of maize (Zea mays) with variegated, nonclonal, chlorotic leaf sectors containing excess starch and soluble sugars. Consistent with a defect in carbon export, we found that a by-product of functional chloroplasts, likely a sugar, induces tdy2 phenotypic expression. Based on the phenotypic similarities between tdy2 and two other maize mutants with leaf carbon accumulation defects, tdy1 and sucrose export defective1 (sxd1), we investigated whether Tdy2 functioned in the same pathway as Tdy1 or Sxd1. Cytological and genetic studies demonstrate that Tdy2 and Sxd1 function independently. However, in tdy1/+; tdy2/+ F(1) plants, we observed a moderate chlorotic sectored phenotype, suggesting that the two genes are dosage sensitive and have a related function. This type of genetic interaction is referred to as second site noncomplementation and has often, though not exclusively, been found in cases where the two encoded proteins physically interact. Moreover, tdy1; tdy2 double mutants display a synergistic interaction supporting this hypothesis. Additionally, we determined that cell walls of chlorotic leaf tissues in tdy mutants contain increased cellulose; thus, tdy mutants potentially represent enhanced feedstocks for biofuels production. From our phenotypic and genetic characterizations, we propose a model whereby TDY1 and TDY2 function together in a single genetic pathway, possibly in homo- and heteromeric complexes, to promote carbon export from leaves.
