Light and temperature change constantly under natural conditions and profoundly affect plant growth and development. Light and warmer temperatures promote flowering, higher light intensity inhibits hypocotyl and petiole elongation, and warmer temperatures promote hypocotyl and petiole elongation. Moreover, exogenous light and temperature signals must be integrated with endogenous signals to fine-tune phytohormone metabolism and plant morphology. Plants perceive and respond to light and ambient temperature using common sets of factors, such as photoreceptors and multiple light signal transduction components. These highly structured signaling networks are critical for plant survival and adaptation. This review discusses how plants respond to variable light and temperature conditions using common elements to coordinate their development. Future directions for research on light and temperature signaling pathways are also discussed.
