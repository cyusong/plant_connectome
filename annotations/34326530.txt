Stomata of most plants close to preserve water when the demand for CO<sub>2</sub> by photosynthesis is reduced. Stomatal responses are slow compared with photosynthesis, and this kinetic difference erodes assimilation and water-use efficiency under fluctuating light. Despite a deep knowledge of guard cells that regulate the stoma, efforts to enhance stomatal kinetics are limited by our understanding of its control by foliar CO<sub>2</sub>. Guided by mechanistic modelling that incorporates foliar CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion and mesophyll photosynthesis, here we uncover a central role for endomembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in guard cell responsiveness to fluctuating light and CO<sub>2</sub>. Modelling predicted and experiments demonstrated a delay in Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling that was enhanced by endomembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase mutants, altering stomatal conductance and reducing assimilation and water-use efficiency. Our findings illustrate the power of modelling to bridge the gap from the guard cell to whole-plant photosynthesis, and they demonstrate an unforeseen latency, or 'carbon memory', of guard cells that affects stomatal dynamics, photosynthesis and water-use efficiency.
