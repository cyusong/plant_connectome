['11058127', 'Members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases are involved in processes linked to  DNA replication, DNA recombination and gene silencing. RecQ homologues of various  animals have been described recently. Here, for the first time for plants, we  characterised cDNAs of all in all six different RecQ-like proteins that are  expressed to different extents in Arabidopsis thaliana. Surprisingly, three of  these proteins are small in size [AtRecQl1, AtRecQl2, AtRecQl3-606, 705 and 713  amino acids (aa), respectively], whereas the two bigger proteins result from a  duplication event during plant evolution [AtRecQl4A and AtRecQl4B-1150 and 1182  aa, respectively]. Another homologue (AtRecQsim, 858 aa) most probably arose by  insertion of an unrelated sequence within its helicase domain. The presence of  these homologues demonstrates the conservation of RecQ family functions in higher  eukaryotes. We also detected a small gene (AtWRNexo) encoding 285 aa which, being  devoid of any RecQ-like helicase domain, reveals a striking homology to the  exonuclease domain of human Werner protein, a prominent RecQ helicase of larger  size. By means of the two-hybrid assay we were able to detect an interaction  between AtWRNexo and AtRecQl2, indicating that activities that reside in a single  protein chain in mammals might in plants be complemented in trans.', '2000 Nov 1', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/28.21.4275', 'Puchta']
