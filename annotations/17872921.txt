Though numerous pieces of evidence point to major physiological roles for anion channels in plants, progress in the understanding of their biological functions is limited by the small number of genes identified so far. Seven chloride channel (CLC) members could be identified in the Arabidopsis genome, amongst which AtCLCe and AtCLCf are both more closely related to bacterial CLCs than the other plant CLCs. It is shown here that AtCLCe is targeted to the thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts and, in agreement with this subcellular localization, that the clce mutants display a phenotype related to photosynthesis activity. The AtCLCf protein is localized in Golgi membranes and functionally complements the yeast gef1 mutant disrupted in the single CLC gene encoding a Golgi-associated protein.
