The recently discovered non-mevalonate biosynthetic route to isoprenoid precursors is an essential metabolic pathway in plants, apicomplexan parasites, and many species of bacteria. The pathway relies on eight enzymes exploiting different cofactors and metal ions. Structural and mechanistic data now exist for most components of the pathway though there remain some gaps in our knowledge. The individual enzymes represent new, validated targets for broad spectrum antimicrobial drug and herbicide development. Detailed knowledge of the pathway may also be exploited to genetically modify microorganisms and plants to produce compounds of agricultural and medical interest.
