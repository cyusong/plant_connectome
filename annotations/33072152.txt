The flower color of many horticultural plants fades from red to white during the development stages, affecting ornamental value. We selected <i>Malus halliana</i>, a popular ornamental species, and analyzed the mechanisms of flower color fading using RNA sequencing. Forty-seven genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis and two genes related to anthocyanin transport were identified; the expression of most of these genes declined dramatically with flower color fading, consistent with the change in the anthocyanin content. A number of transcription factors that might participate in anthocyanin biosynthesis were selected and analyzed. A phylogenetic tree was used to identify the key transcription factor. Using this approach, we identified <i>MhMYB10</i> as directly regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. <i>MhMYB10</i> expression was strongly downregulated during flower development and was significantly positively related to the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and anthocyanin content in diverse varieties of <i>Malus</i>. To analyze the methylation level during flower development, the <i>MhMYB10</i> promoter sequence was divided into 12 regions. The methylation levels of the R2 and R8 increased significantly as flower color faded and were inversely related to <i>MhMYB10</i> expression and anthocyanin content. Therefore, we deduce that the increasing methylation activities of these two regions repressed <i>MhMYB10</i> expression.

MhMYB10: !regulates! anthocyanin biosynthesis
R2/R8: !inversely related to! MhMYB10 expression
R2/R8: !increase! methylation activities
methylation activities: !repress! MhMYB10 expression
