['10973494', 'Jasmonic acid (JA) and its precursor 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) act as plant  growth regulators and mediate responses to environmental cues. To investigate the  role of these oxylipins in anther and pollen development, we characterized a  T-DNA-tagged, male-sterile mutant of Arabidopsis, opr3. The opr3 mutant plants  are sterile but can be rendered fertile by exogenous JA but not by OPDA. Cloning  of the mutant locus indicates that it encodes an isozyme of 12-oxophytodienoate  reductase, designated OPR3. All of the defects in opr3 are alleviated by  transformation of the mutant with an OPR3 cDNA. Our results indicate that JA and  not OPDA is the signaling molecule that induces and coordinates the elongation of  the anther filament, the opening of the stomium at anthesis, and the production  of viable pollen. Just as importantly, our data demonstrate that OPR3 is the only  isoform of OPR capable of reducing the correct stereoisomer of OPDA to produce JA  required for male gametophyte development.', '2000 Sep 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.190264497', 'Browse']
