['17561001', 'The xenobiotic monochlorobimane is conjugated to glutathione in the cytosol of  Arabidopsis thaliana, transported to the vacuole, and hydrolyzed to cysteine  S-bimane [Grzam, A., Tennstedt, P., Clemens, S., Hell, R. and Meyer, A.J. (2006)  Vacuolar sequestration of glutathione S-conjugates outcompetes a possible  degradation of the glutathione moiety by phytochelatin synthase. FEBS Lett. 580,  6384-6390]. The work here identifies gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 4 (At4g29210,  GGT4) as the first step of vacuolar degradation of glutathione conjugates.  Hydrolysis of glutathione S-bimane is blocked in ggt4 null mutants of A.  thaliana. Accumulation of glutathione S-bimane in mutants and in wild-type plants  treated with the high affinity GGT inhibitor acivicin shows that GGT4 is required  to initiate the two step hydrolysis sequence. GGT4:green fluorescent protein  fusions were used to demonstrate that GGT4 is localized in the lumen of the  vacuole.', '2007 Jul 10', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.05.071', 'Meyer']
