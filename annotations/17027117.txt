We report here the accumulation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in Agrobacterium rhizogenes-induced hairy root cultures of Daucus carota. This phenolic acid finds application in food, pharmaceutical and polymer industries. Metabolic profiling of phenolics by HPLC/ESI-MS from these hairy roots showed a considerable amount of p-hydroxybenzoic acid accumulation both in cytosol and in the cell wall. Analyses of HCl and NaOH treated soluble phenolic fractions resulted in the elution of peaks with same retention time and similar UV-absorption spectra as observed with p-hydroxybenzoic acid standard. This suggests that p-hydroxybenzoic acid is present in the cytosol as free-form (unconjugated). A correlation has been drawn between the accumulation of soluble and wall-bound phenolic acids on a time-course basis. An apparent absence of any p-hydroxybenzoic acid-glucoside supports this observation, which in turn encourages the idea of its incorporation in the cell wall in an alkaline-labile form.
