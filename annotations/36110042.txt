Due to their sessile nature, plants cannot escape adverse environmental conditions and evolved mechanisms to cope with sudden environmental changes. The reaction to variations in abiotic factors, also summarized as acclimation response, affects all layers of cellular functions and involves rapid modification of enzymatic activities, the metabolome, proteome and transcriptome on different timescales. One trait of plants acclimating to high light (HL) is the rapid transcriptional activation of the flavonoid biosynthesis (FB) pathway resulting in the accumulation of photoprotective and antioxidative flavonoids, such as flavonols and anthocyanins, in the leaf tissue. Although enormous progress has been made in identifying enzymes and transcriptional regulators of FB by forward and reverse genetic approaches in the past, the signals and signalling pathways permitting the conditional activation of FB in HL are still debated. With this Tansley Insight, we summarize the current knowledge on the proposed signals and downstream factors involved in regulating FB and will discuss their contribution to, particularly, HL-induced accumulation of anthocyanins.
