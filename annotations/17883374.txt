['17883374', 'Previously, we demonstrated that a protein that binds phosphatidylinositol  4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] inhibits both light-induced stomatal opening  and ABA-induced stomatal closing. The latter effect is due to a reduction in free  PtdIns(4,5)P(2), decreasing production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and  phosphatidic acid by phospholipases C and D. However, it is less clear how  PtdIns(4,5)P(2) modulates stomatal opening. We found that in response to white  light irradiation, the PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-binding domain GFP:PLCdelta1PH  translocated from the cytosol into the plasma membrane. This suggests that the  level of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) increases at the plasma membrane upon illumination.  Exogenously administered PtdIns(4,5)P(2) substituted for light stimuli, inducing  stomatal opening and swelling of guard cell protoplasts. To identify  PtdIns(4,5)P(2) targets we performed patch-clamp experiments, and found that  anion channel activity was inhibited by PtdIns(4,5)P(2). Genetic analyses using  an Arabidopsis PIP5K4 mutant further supported the role of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in  stomatal opening. The reduced stomatal opening movements exhibited by a mutant of  Arabidopsis PIP5K4 (At3g56960) was countered by exogenous application of  PtdIns(4,5)P(2). The phenotype of reduced stomatal opening in the pip5k4 mutant  was recovered in lines complemented with the full-length PIP5K4. Together, these  data suggest that PIP5K4 produces PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in irradiated guard cells,  inhibiting anion channels to allow full stomatal opening.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03277.x', 'Lee']
