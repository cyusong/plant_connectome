Drought is one of the most destructive environmental factors limiting wheat production and food security globally. Peduncle length (PLE) is an important morphological trait to determine plant architecture, photosynthate transport, and yield formation, which is also considered a useful index for drought tolerance in wheat. However, the genetic basis of wheat PLE is not well studied at present. Here, a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PLE was performed using a panel of 282 wheat accessions with the Wheat 660K SNP array genotyping under rain-fed and irrigating field conditions. Totally, 1,301 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified using the threshold of p-value < 4.16 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, five of which were high-confidence. Furthermore, combining GWAS intervals, previously reported QTLs, expression levels, homologous genes, and selected sweep analysis, a total of 5 candidate genes were detected to associate with drought stress. Moreover, the expression levels of TraesCS2A02G082100 were significantly up-regulated under drought conditions and co-localized in the selected sweep region, suggesting it is a drought-responsive gene. Our results shed light on the genetic basis underlying wheat drought tolerance, which accelerates the marker-assistant selection and genetic improvement through genomic breeding in wheat.
