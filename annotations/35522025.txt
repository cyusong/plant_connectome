High temperature (HT) causes male sterility and decreases crop yields. Our previous works have demonstrated that sugar and auxin signaling pathways, Gossypium hirsutum Casein kinase I (GhCKI), and DNA methylation are all involved in HT-induced male sterility in cotton. However, the signaling mechanisms leading to distinct GhCKI expression patterns induced by HT between HT-tolerant and HT-sensitive cotton anthers remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a GhCKI promoter (ProGhCKI) region that functions in response to HT in anthers and found the transcription factor GhMYB4 binds to this region to act as an upstream positive regulator of GhCKI. In the tapetum of early-stage cotton anthers, upregulated expression of GhMYB4 under HT and overexpressed GhMYB4 under normal temperature both led to severe male sterility phenotypes, coupled with enhanced expression of GhCKI. We also found that GhMYB4 interacts with GhMYB66 to form a heterodimer to enhance its binding to ProGhCKI. However, GhMYB66 showed an expression pattern similar to GhMYB4 under HT but did not directly bind to ProGhCKI. Furthermore, HT reduced siRNA-mediated CHH DNA methylations in the GhMYB4 promoter, which enhanced the expression of GhMYB4 in tetrad stage anthers and promoted the formation of the GhMYB4/GhMYB66 heterodimer, which in turn elevated the transcription of GhCKI in the tapetum, leading to male sterility. Overall, we shed light on the GhMYB66-GhMYB4-GhCKI regulatory pathway in response to HT in cotton anthers.
