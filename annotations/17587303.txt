In eukaryotes, genes carrying premature termination codons (PTCs) are often associated with decreased mRNA levels compared with their counterparts without PTCs. PTC-harboring mRNA is rapidly degraded through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway to prevent the accumulation of potentially detrimental truncated proteins. In a native ecotype of Nicotiana attenuata collected from Arizona (AZ), the mRNA levels of a trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI) gene are substantially lower than in plants collected from Utah (UT). Cloning the AZ TPI gene revealed a 6 bp deletion mutation in exon 2 resulting in a PTC and decreased mRNA levels through NMD. Silencing UPF1, 2 and 3 in N. attenuata AZ plants by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) enhanced the levels of PTC-harboring TPI mRNA, demonstrating a conserved role for UPF genes in plants. Furthermore, using cell suspension cultures that express variants of the TPI construct, we demonstrate that both intron-containing and intronless genes are subject to NMD in plants; unlike PTCs in mammals, PTCs downstream of introns activate NMD in plants. However, when a PTC is only 4 bp upstream of an intron, the NMD surveillance mechanism is abrogated. We also demonstrate that, in an intronless TPI gene, a PTC located at the beginning or the end of the coding sequence triggers NMD less efficiently than do PTCs located at the middle of the coding sequence. Taken together, these results highlight the complexity of the NMD activation mechanisms in plants.

PTC: !activates! NMD
UPF genes: !regulate! NMD
intron-containing gene: !subject to! NMD
intronless gene: !subject to! NMD
PTC: !abrogates! NMD surveillance
PTC: !triggers! NMD
middle PTC: !triggers! NMD more efficiently
