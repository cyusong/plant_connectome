['12782738', 'The psbB-psbT-psbH-petB-petD operon of higher plant chloroplasts is a  heterogeneously composed transcriptional unit that undergoes complex RNA  processing events until the mature oligocistronic RNAs are formed. To identify  the nucleus-encoded factors required for the processing and expression of  psbB-psbT-psbH-petB-petD transcripts, we performed mutational analysis using  Arabidopsis. The allelic nuclear mutants hcf152-1 and hcf152-2 were identified  that are affected specifically in the accumulation of the plastidial cytochrome  b(6)f complex. In both mutants, reduced amounts of spliced petB RNAs (encoding  the cytochrome b(6) subunit) were detected, thus explaining the observed protein  deficiencies. Additionally, mutant hcf152-1 is affected in the accumulation of  transcripts cleaved between the genes psbH and petB. As a result of a close T-DNA  insertion, the HCF152 gene was cloned and its identity confirmed by  complementation of homozygous mutant plants. HCF152 encodes a pentatricopeptide  repeat (PPR) protein with 12 putative PPR motifs that is located inside the  chloroplast. The protein shows a significant structural, but not primary,  sequence similarity to the maize protein CRP1, which is involved in the  processing and translation of the chloroplast petD and petA RNAs. In addition, we  found that HCF152 is an RNA binding protein that binds certain areas of the petB  transcript. The protein possibly exists in the chloroplast as a homodimer and is  not associated with other proteins to form a high molecular mass complex.', '2003 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010397', 'Schuster']
