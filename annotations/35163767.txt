Salt stress is a major limiting factor in crop production and yield in many regions of the world. The objective of this study was to identify the genes responsible for salt tolerance in Thai rice populations. We performed a genome-wide association study with growth traits, relative water content, and cell membrane stability at the seedling stage, and predicted 25 putative genes. Eleven of them were located within previously reported salt-tolerant QTLs (ST-QTLs). <i>OsCRN</i>, located outside the ST-QTLs, was selected for gene characterization using the <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutant line with T-DNA insertion in the orthologous gene. Mutations in the <i>AtCRN</i> gene led to the enhancement of salt tolerance by increasing the ability to maintain photosynthetic pigment content and relative water content, while the complemented lines with ectopic expression of <i>OsCRN</i> showed more susceptibility to salt stress detected by photosynthesis performance. Moreover, the salt-tolerant rice varieties showed lower expression of this gene than the susceptible rice varieties under salt stress conditions. The study concludes that by acting as a negative regulator, OsCRN plays an important role in salt tolerance in rice.
