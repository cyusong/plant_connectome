Wild soybean species (<i>Glycine soja</i> Siebold & Zucc.) comprise a unique resource to widen the genetic base of cultivated soybean [<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr.] for various agronomic traits. An inter-specific mapping population derived from a cross of cultivar Williams 82 and PI 483460B, a wild soybean accession, was utilized for genetic characterization of root architecture traits. The objectives of this study were to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seedling shoot and root architecture traits, as well as to determine additive/epistatic interaction effects of identified QTLs. A total of 16,469 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) developed for the Illumina beadchip genotyping platform were used to construct a high resolution genetic linkage map. Among the 11 putative QTLs identified, two significant QTLs on chromosome 7 were determined to be associated with total root length (RL) and root surface area (RSA) with favorable alleles from the wild soybean parent. These seedling root traits, RL (BARC_020495_04641 ~ BARC_023101_03769) and RSA (SNP02285 ~ SNP18129_Magellan), could be potential targets for introgression into cultivated soybean background to improve both tap and lateral roots. The RL QTL region harbors four candidate genes with higher expression in root tissues: Phosphofructokinase (Glyma.07g126400), Snf7 protein (Glyma.07g127300), unknown functional gene (Glyma.07g127900), and Leucine Rich-Repeat protein (Glyma.07g127100). The novel alleles inherited from the wild soybean accession could be used as molecular markers to improve root system architecture and productivity in elite soybean lines.
