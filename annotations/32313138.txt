In photosynthetic organisms, the photosystem II (PSII) complex is the primary target of thermal damage. Plants have evolved a repair process to prevent the accumulation of damaged PSII. The repair of PSII largely involves de novo synthesis of proteins, particularly the D1 subunit protein encoded by the chloroplast gene psbA. Here we report that the allotropic expression of the psbA complementary DNA driven by a heat-responsive promoter in the nuclear genome sufficiently protects PSII from severe loss of D1 protein and dramatically enhances survival rates of the transgenic plants of Arabidopsis, tobacco and rice under heat stress. Unexpectedly, we found that the nuclear origin supplementation of the D1 protein significantly stimulates transgenic plant growth by enhancing net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates with increases in biomass and grain yield. These findings represent a breakthrough in bioengineering plants to achieve efficient photosynthesis and increase crop productivity under normal and heat-stress conditions.
