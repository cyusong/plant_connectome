['26912459', "G proteins are involved in almost all aspects of the cellular regulatory pathways  through their ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. The YchF subfamily,  interestingly, possesses the unique ability to bind both ATP and GTP, and is  possibly an ancestral form of G proteins based on phylogenetic studies and is  present in all kingdoms of life. However, the biological significance of such a  relaxed ligand specificity has long eluded researchers. Here, we have elucidated  the different conformational changes caused by the binding of a YchF homolog in  rice (OsYchF1) to ATP versus GTP by X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, by  comparing the 3D relationships of the ligand position and the various amino acid  residues at the binding sites in the crystal structures of the apo-bound and  ligand-bound versions, a mechanism for the protein's ability to bind both ligands  is revealed. Mutation of the noncanonical G4 motif of the OsYchF1 to the  canonical sequence for GTP specificity precludes the binding/hydrolysis of ATP  and prevents OsYchF1 from functioning as a negative regulator of plant-defense  responses, while retaining its ability to bind/hydrolyze GTP and its function as  a negative regulator of abiotic stress responses, demonstrating the specific role  of ATP-binding/hydrolysis in disease resistance. This discovery will have a  significant impact on our understanding of the structure-function relationships  of the YchF subfamily of G proteins in all kingdoms of life.", '2016 Mar 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1522966113', 'Lam']
