Pinus massoniana Lamb. is the timber species with the widest distribution and the largest afforestation area in China, providing a large amount of timber, turpentine and ecological products. Seasonal drought caused by climate warming severely constrains the quality and growth of P. massoniana forests. WRKY transcription factors play an important role in plant responses to abiotic stress. In this study, the molecular mechanisms by which P. massoniana responds to drought stress were analysed based on the P. massoniana WRKY (PmWRKY) family of genes. Forty-three PmWRKYs are divided into three major families, 7 sub-families, and the conserved motifs are essentially the same. Among these 43 PmWRKYs express under drought stress but with different expression patterns in response to stress. PmWRKYs respond to drought stress induced by exogenous hormones of SA, ABA, and MeJA. The expression of PmWRKY6, PmWRKY10, and PmWRKY30 up-regulate in different families and tissues under drought stress, while PmWRKY22 down-regulate. Transgenetic tobaccos of PmWRKY31 are with lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline (Pro) content than wild type (WT) tobaccos. In transgenic tobaccos of PmWRKY31, expression levels of related genes significantly improve, and drought tolerance enhance. This study analysed the molecular biological characteristics of PmWRKYs and investigated the expression patterns and functions of PmWRKYs in response to drought stress in P. massoniana. The results of this study provide a basis for in-depth research of the molecular functions of PmWRKYs in response to drought stress.
