<i>Pseudocercospora fuligena</i> is a fungus that causes black leaf mold, an important disease of tomato in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Despite its economic importance, genomic resources for this pathogen are scarce and no reference genome was available thus far. Here, we report a 50.6-Mb genome assembly for <i>P. fuligena,</i> consisting of 348 contigs with an N<sub>50</sub> value of 0.407 Mb. In total, 13,764 protein-coding genes were predicted with an estimated BUSCO completeness of 98%. Among the predicted genes there were 179 candidate effectors, 445 carbohydrate-active enzymes, and 30 secondary metabolite gene clusters. The resources presented in this study will allow genome-wide comparative analyses and population genomic studies of this pathogen, ultimately improving management strategies for black leaf mold of tomato.
