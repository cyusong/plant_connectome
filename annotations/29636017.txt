Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling affects many processes, some of which have different outcomes in the same cell. In Arabidopsis, activation of a MAPK cascade consisting of YODA, MKK4/5 and MPK3/6 inhibits early stages of stomatal developmental, but the ability to halt stomatal progression is lost at the later stage when guard mother cells (GMCs) transition to guard cells (GCs). Rather than downregulating cascade components, stomatal precursors must have a mechanism to prevent late stage inhibition because the same MKKs and MPKs mediate other physiological responses. We artificially activated the MAPK cascade using MKK7, another MKK that can modulate stomatal development, and found that inhibition of stomatal development is still possible in GMCs. This suggests that MKK4/5, but not MKK7, are specifically prevented from inhibiting stomatal development. To identify regions of MKKs responsible for cell-type specific regulation, we used a domain swap approach with MKK7 and a battery of in vitro and in vivo kinase assays. We found that N-terminal regions of MKK5 and MKK7 establish specific signal-to-output connections like they do in other organisms, but they do so in combination with previously undescribed modules in the C-terminus. One of these modules encoding the GMC-specific regulation of MKK5, when swapped with sequences from the equivalent region of MKK7, allows MKK5 to mediate robust inhibition of late stomatal development. Because MKK structure is conserved across species, the identification of new MKK specificity modules and signaling rules furthers our understanding of how eukaryotes create specificity in complex biological systems.
