Drought tolerance is important for grain crops, including rice (Oryza sativa); for example, rice cultivated under intermittent irrigation produces less methane gas compared to rice grown in anaerobic paddy field conditions, but these plants require greater drought tolerance. Moreover, the roles of rice circadian-clock genes in drought tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the mutation of LOV KELCH REPEAT PROTEIN 2 (OsLKP2) enhanced drought tolerance by increasing cuticular wax biosynthesis. Among ZEITLUPE family genes, OsLKP2 expression specifically increased under dehydration stress. OsLKP2 knockdown (oslkp2-1) and knockout (oslkp2-2) mutants exhibited enhanced drought tolerance. Cuticular waxes inhibit non-stomatal water loss. Under drought conditions, total wax loads on the leaf surface increased by approximately 10% in oslkp2-1 and oslkp2-2 compared to the wild type, and the transcript levels of cuticular wax biosynthesis genes were upregulated in the oslkp2 mutants. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsLKP2 interacts with GIGANTEA (OsGI) in the nucleus. The osgi mutants also showed enhanced tolerance to drought stress, with a high density of wax crystals on their leaf surface. These results demonstrate that the OsLKP2-OsGI interaction negatively regulates wax accumulation on leaf surfaces, thereby decreasing rice resilience to drought stress.
