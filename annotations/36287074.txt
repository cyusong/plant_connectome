Most vegetative axes remain quiescent as dormant axillary buds until metabolic and hormonal signals, driven by environmental changes, trigger bud outgrowth. While the resumption of growth activity is well documented, the establishment and maintenance of quiescence is comparatively poorly understood, despite its major importance in the adaptation of plants to the seasonal cycle or in the establishment of their shape. Here, using the rosebush Rosa hybrida 'Radrazz' as a plant model, we highlighted that the quiescent state was the consequence of an internal and active energy control of buds, under the influence of hormonal factors previously identified in the bud outgrowth process. We found that the quiescent state in the non-growing vegetative axis of dormant axillary buds displayed a low energy state along with a high expression of the ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 2 (AOX2) and the accumulation of the corresponding protein. Conversely, AOX2 expression and protein amount strongly decreased during bud burst as energy status shifted to a high state, allowing growth. Since AOX2 can deviate electrons from the cytochrome pathway in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, it could drastically reduce the formation of ATP, which would result in a low energy status unfavorable for growth activities. We provide evidence that the presence/absence of AOX2 in quiescent/growing vegetative axes of buds was under hormonal control and thus may constitute the mechanistic basis of both quiescence and sink strength manifestation, two important aspects of budbreak.
