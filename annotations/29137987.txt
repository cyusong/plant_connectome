['29137987', 'The endosperm is a transitory structure involved in proper embryo elongation. The  cell walls of mature seed endosperm are generally composed of a uniform  distribution of cellulose, unesterified homogalacturonans, and arabinans. Recent  studies suggest that changes in cell wall properties during endosperm development  could be related to embryo growth. The degree of methyl esterification of  homogalacturonans may be involved in this endosperm tissue remodelling. The  relevance of the degree of homogalacturonan methyl esterification during seed  development was determined by immunohistochemical analyses using a panel of  probes with specificity for homogalaturonans with different degrees of methyl  esterification. Low-esterified and un-esterified homogalacturonans were abundant  in endosperm cells during embryo bending and were also detected in mature  embryos. BIDXII (BDX) could be involved in seed development, because bdx-1  mutants had misshapen embryos. The methyl esterification pattern described for WT  seeds was different during bdx-1 seed development; un-esterified  homogalacturonans were scarcely present in the cell walls of endosperm in bending  embryos and mature seeds. Our results suggested that the degree of methyl  esterification of homogalacturonans in the endosperm cell wall may be involved in  proper embryo development.', '2018 Jan 1', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.077', 'Gamboa-deBuen']
