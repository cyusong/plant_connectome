Triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis is a principal metabolic pathway in most organisms, and TAG is the major form of carbon storage in many plant seeds. Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is the only acyltransferase enzyme that has been confirmed to contribute to TAG biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. However, dgat1 null mutants display only a 20 to 40% decrease in seed oil content. To determine whether other enzymes contribute to TAG synthesis, candidate genes were expressed in TAG-deficient yeast, candidate mutants were crossed with the dgat1-1 mutant, and target genes were suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi). An in vivo role for phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (PDAT1; At5g13640) in TAG synthesis was revealed in this study. After failing to obtain double homozygous plants from crossing dgat1-1 and pdat1-2, further investigation showed that the dgat1-1 pdat1-2 double mutation resulted in sterile pollen that lacked visible oil bodies. RNAi silencing of PDAT1 in a dgat1-1 background or DGAT1 in pdat1-1 background resulted in 70 to 80% decreases in oil content per seed and in disruptions of embryo development. These results establish in vivo involvement of PDAT1 in TAG biosynthesis, rule out major contributions by other candidate enzymes, and indicate that PDAT1 and DGAT1 have overlapping functions that are essential for normal pollen and seed development of Arabidopsis.
