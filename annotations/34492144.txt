The cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) pigment gland is a distinctive structure that functions as the main deposit organ of gossypol and its derivatives. It is also an ideal system in which to study cell differentiation and organogenesis. However, only a few genes that determine the process of gland formation have been reported, including GoPGF, CGP1, and CGFs; the molecular mechanisms underlying gland initiation are still largely unclear. Here, we report the discovery of the novel stem pigment gland-forming gene GoSPGF by map-based cloning; annotated as a GRAS transcription factor, this gene is responsible for the glandless trait specifically on the stem. In the stem glandless mutant T582, a point mutation (C to A) was found to create a premature stop codon and truncate the protein. Similarly, virus-induced gene silencing of GoSPGF resulted in glandless stems and dramatically reduced gossypol content. Comparative transcriptomic data showed that loss of GoSPGF significantly suppressed expression of many genes involved in gossypol biosynthesis and altered expression of genes involved in gibberellic acid signaling/biosynthesis. Overall, these findings provide more insight into the networks regulating glandular structure differentiation and formation in cotton, which will be helpful for understanding other plants bearing special gland structures such as tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana), artemisia annua, mint (Mentha spp.), and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis).
