A recent study by Zlinszky et al., <sup>1</sup> uses high-resolution terrestrial laser scanning to investigate the variability of overnight movement of leaves and branches in vascular plants. This study finds among others that the investigated plants show periodic movements of around one centimetre in amplitude and 2-6 hour periodicity. Sub-circadian process dynamics of plants were so far not in focus of research, but here we compare the findings with other published cases of short-term periodicity in leaf turgor, sap flow and especially trunk diameter. Several authors have noted overnight variations in these parameters within periods of several hours and in absence of environmental changes with similar dynamics. We revisit the unknown questions of short-term plant movement and make a suggestion for future research.
