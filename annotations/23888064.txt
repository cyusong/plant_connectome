['23888064', 'Critical responses to developmental or environmental stimuli are mediated by  different transcription factors, including members of the ERF, bZIP, MYB, MYC,  and WRKY families. Of these, MYB genes play roles in many developmental  processes. The overexpression of one MYB gene, MYBH, significantly increased  hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in the light, and the  expression of this gene increased markedly in the dark. The MYBH protein contains  a conserved motif, R/KLFGV, which was implicated in transcriptional repression.  Interestingly, the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol blocked the  increase in hypocotyl elongation in seedlings that overexpressed MYBH. Moreover,  the function of MYBH was dependent on phytochrome-interacting factor (PIF)  proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that hypocotyl elongation is  regulated by a delicate and efficient mechanism in which MYBH expression is  triggered by challenging environmental conditions such as darkness, leading to an  increase in PIF accumulation and subsequent enhanced auxin biosynthesis. These  results indicate that MYBH is one of the molecular components that regulate  hypocotyl elongation in response to darkness.', '2013 Sep', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ert223', 'Lee']
