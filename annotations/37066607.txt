Chilling can decrease stomatal sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) in some legumes, although hormonal mechanisms involved are unclear. After evaluating leaf gas exchange of 16 European soybean genotypes at 14°C, 6 genotypes representing the range of response were selected. Further experiments combined low (L, 14°C) and high (H, 24°C) temperature exposure from sowing until the unifoliate leaf was visible and L or H temperature until full leaf expansion, to impose four temperature treatments: LL, LH, HL, and HH. Prolonged chilling (LL) substantially decreased leaf water content but increased leaf ethylene evolution and foliar concentrations of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, ABA and jasmonic acid. Across genotypes, photosynthesis linearly increased with stomatal conductance (Gs), with photosynthesis of HH plants threefold higher than LL plants at the same Gs. In all treatments except LL, Gs declined with foliar ABA accumulation. Foliar ABA sprays substantially decreased Gs of HH plants, but did not significantly affect LL plants. Thus low temperature compromised stomatal sensitivity to endogenous and exogenous ABA. Applying the ethylene antagonist 1 methyl-cyclopropene partially reverted excessive stomatal opening of LL plants. Thus, chilling-induced ethylene accumulation may mediate stomatal insensitivity to ABA, offering chemical opportunities for improving seedling survival in cold environments.
