Intronic transposable elements (TEs) comprise a large proportion in eukaryotic genomes, but how they regulate the host genes remains to be explored. Our forward genetic screen disclosed the plant-specific RNA polymerases IV and V in suppressing intronic TE-mediated cryptic transcription initiation of a chimeric transcripts at FLC (FLC<sup>TE</sup> ). Initiation of FLC<sup>TE</sup> transcription is blocked by the locally formed intronic heterochromatin, which is directly associated with RNA Pol V to inhibit the entry of RNA Pol II and the occupancy of H3K4 methylation. Genome-wide Pol II Ser5p native elongation transcription sequencing revealed that a significant number of intronic heterochromatin-containing genes undergo this mechanism. This study sheds light on deeply understanding the function of intronic heterochromatin on host genes expression in eukaryotic genome.
