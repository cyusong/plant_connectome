['14615601', 'In flowering plants, pollen formation depends on the differentiation and  interaction of two cell types in the anther: the reproductive cells, called  microsporocytes, and somatic cells that form the tapetum. The microsporocytes  generate microspores, whereas the tapetal cells support the development of  microspores into mature pollen grains. Despite their importance to plant  reproduction, little is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms that  regulate the differentiation and interaction of these highly specialized cells in  the anther. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel  tapetum determinant1 (TPD1) gene that is required for the specialization of  tapetal cells in the Arabidopsis anther. Analysis of the male-sterile mutant,  tpd1, showed that functional interruption of TPD1 caused the precursors of  tapetal cells to differentiate and develop into microsporocytes instead of  tapetum. As a results, extra microsporocytes were formed and tapetum was absent  in developing tpd1 anthers. Molecular cloning of TPD1 revealed that it encodes a  small protein of 176 amino acids. In addition, tpd1 was phenotypically similar to  excess microsporocytes1/extra sporogenous cells (ems1/exs) single and tpd1  ems1/exs double mutants. These data suggest that the TPD1 product plays an  important role in the differentiation of tapetal cells, possibly in coordination  with the EMS1/EXS gene product, a Leu-rich repeat receptor protein kinase.', '2003 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.016618', 'Ye']
