Phosphoinositides play an important role in various membrane trafficking events in eukaryotes. One of them, however, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2], has not been studied widely in plants. Using a combination of fluorescent reporter proteins and the PI(3,5)P2-specific inhibitor YM202636, here we demonstrated that in Arabidopsis thaliana, PI(3,5)P2 affects various membrane trafficking events, mostly in the post-Golgi routes. We found that YM201636 treatment effectively reduced PI(3,5)P2 concentration not only in the wild type but also in FAB1A-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. In particular, reduced PI(3,5)P2 levels caused abnormal membrane dynamics of plasma membrane proteins, AUX1 and BOR1, with different trafficking patterns. Secretion and morphological characteristics of late endosomes and vacuoles were also affected by the decreased PI(3,5)P2 production. These pleiotropic defects in the post-Golgi trafficking events were caused by the inhibition of PI(3,5)P2 production. This effect is probably mediated by the inhibition of maturation of FAB1-positive late endosomes, thereby impairing late endosome function. In conclusion, our results imply that in Arabidopsis, late endosomes are involved in multiple post-Golgi membrane trafficking routes including not only vacuolar trafficking and endocytosis but also secretion.
