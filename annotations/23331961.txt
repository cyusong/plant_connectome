['23331961', 'The present study identified a family of six A. thaliana genes that share five  limited regions of sequence similarity with LAZY1, a gene in Oryza sativa (rice)  shown to participate in the early gravity signaling for shoot gravitropism. A  T-DNA insertion into the Arabidopsis gene (At5g14090) most similar to LAZY1  increased the inflorescence branch angle to 81 degrees  from the wild type value of 42 degrees .  RNA interference lines and molecular rescue experiments confirmed the linkage  between the branch-angle phenotype and the gene consequently named AtLAZY1.  Time-resolved gravitropism measurements of atlazy1 hypocotyls and primary  inflorescence stems showed a significantly reduced bending rate during the first  hour of response. The subcellular localization of AtLAZY1 protein was  investigated to determine if the nuclear localization predicted from the gene  sequence was observable and important to its function in shoot gravity responses.  AtLAZY1 fused to green fluorescent protein largely rescued the branch-angle  phenotype of atlazy1, and was observed by confocal microscopy at the cell  periphery and within the nucleus. Mutation of the nuclear localization signal  prevented detectable levels of AtLAZY1 in the nucleus without affecting the  ability of the gene to rescue the atlazy1 branch-angle phenotype. These results  indicate that AtLAZY1 functions in gravity signaling during shoot gravitropism,  being a functional ortholog of rice LAZY1. The nuclear pool of the protein  appears to be unnecessary for this function, which instead relies on a pool that  appears to reside at the cell periphery.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12118', 'Iino']
