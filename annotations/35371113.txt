Fusarium wilt caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>vasinfectum</i> (FOV) is one of the most destructive diseases in cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.) production, and use of resistant cultivars is the most cost-effective method managing the disease. To understand the genetic basis of cotton resistance to FOV race 7 (FOV7), this study evaluated a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 110 lines of <i>G. barbadense</i> from a cross between susceptible Xinhai 14 and resistant 06-146 in eight tests and constructed a high-density genetic linkage map with resequencing-based 933,845 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers covering a total genetic distance of 2483.17 cM. Nine quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for FOV7 resistance were identified, including <i>qFOV7-D03-1</i> on chromosome D03 in two tests. Through a comparative analysis of gene expression and DNA sequence for predicted genes within the QTL region between the two parents and selected lines inoculated with FOV7, <i>GB_D03G0217</i> encoding for a calmodulin (CaM)-like (CML) protein was identified as a candidate gene. A further analysis confirmed that the expression of <i>GB_D03G0217</i> was suppressed, leading to increased disease severity in plants of the resistant parent with virus induced gene silencing (VIGS).
