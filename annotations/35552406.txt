['35552406', 'Jasmonate (JA) is an important hormone involved in regulating diverse responses  to environmental factors as well as growth and development, and its signalling is  influenced by other hormones such as ethylene (ET). However, our understanding of  the regulatory relationship between the JA and ET signalling pathways is limited.  In this study, we isolated an Arabidopsis JA-hypersensitive mutant, jah3  (jasmonate hypersensitive3)-1. Map-based cloning revealed that the JAH3 gene  corresponds to At4g16535. JAH3 encodes a protein of unknown function whose amino  acid sequence has similarity to leukocyte receptor cluster-like protein. The  mutation in jah3-1 is caused by a single nucleotide change from A to T at  position 220 of 759 bp. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated a second allele, jah3-2,  that encodes a truncated protein. Both of these loss-of-function alleles resulted  in hypersensitivity to JA, ET-induced root growth inhibition, and accelerated  dark-induced senescence. Double mutant analyses employing coronatine insensitive  1 (coi1) and ethylene insensitive 3 (ein3) mutants (jah3 coi1 and jah3 ein3)  demonstrated that the hypersensitive phenotypes of the jah3 mutants are mediated  by JA and ET signalling components COI1 and EIN3. Therefore, we propose that JAH3  is a negative regulator of both JA and ET signalling.', '2022 Aug 11', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erac208', 'ORCID:']
