Here, we report a chromosome-level genome assembly of <i>Talaromyces rugulosus</i> (syn. <i>Penicillium rugulosum</i>) W13939 (six chromosomes; contig N50: 5.90 Mb), generated using a combination of PacBio long-read and Illumina paired-end data. <i>T. rugulosus</i> is not only a potent enzyme producer, but also a mycoparasite of <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>, which is a notorious plant pathogen and mycotoxin producer, making it a promising biocontrol agent. The <i>T. rugulosus</i> genome is rich in genes encoding proteases, carbohydrate-active enzymes, fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes, lectin, and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, reflecting its mycoparasitic life style and mycotoxigenic capability. This high-quality assembly of the <i>T. rugulosus</i> genome will be a valuable resource to assist us in the understanding of the molecular basis of mycoparasitism and facilitate the agricultural and biotechnological applications of <i>Talaromyces</i> spp.
