The protection of canola (Brassica napus) crops against blackleg disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans, is largely mediated by race-specific resistance genes (R-genes). While many R-genes effective against blackleg disease have been identified in Brassica species, information of the precise genomic locations of the genes is limited. In this study, the Rlm2 gene for resistance to blackleg, located on chromosome A10 of the B. napus cultivar 'Glacier', was targeted for fine mapping. Molecular markers tightly linked to the gene were developed for use in mapping the resistance locus and defining the physical interval in B. napus. Rlm2 was localised to a 5.8 cM interval corresponding to approximately 873 kb of the B. napus chromosome A10. The recently-cloned B. napus R-gene, LepR3, occupies the same region of A10 as Rlm2 and analysis of the putative B. napus and B. rapa genes in the homologous region identified several additional candidate defense-related genes that may control Rlm2 function.
