An effective strategy for re-establishing K+ and Na+ homeostasis is a challenge for the improvement of plant performance in saline soil. Specifically, attempts to understand the mechanisms of Na+ extrusion from plant cells, the control of Na+ loading in the xylem and the partitioning of the accumulated Na+ between different plant organs are ongoing. Our goal was to provide insight into how an external nitrogen source affects Na+ accumulation in Sorghum bicolor under saline conditions. The NH4+ supply improved the salt tolerance of the plant by restricting Na+ accumulation and improving the K+/Na+ homeostasis in shoots, which was consistent with the high activity and expression of Na+/H+ antiporters and proton pumps in the plasma membrane and vacuoles in the roots, resulting in low Na+ loading in the xylem. Conversely, although NO3--grown plants had exclusion and sequestration mechanisms for Na+, these responses were not sufficient to reduce Na+ accumulation. In conclusion, NH4+ acts as an efficient signal to activate co-ordinately responses involved in the regulation of Na+ homeostasis in sorghum plants under salt stress, which leads to salt tolerance.
