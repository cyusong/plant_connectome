Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is globally used as a fodder plant due its high nutritional value and soil improving qualities. In response to mowing, red clover exhibits specific morphological traits to compensate the loss of biomass. The morphological reaction is well described, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and its role for plants grown in the field are unclear. Here, we characterize the global transcriptional response to mowing of red clover by comparing plants grown under greenhouse conditions with plants growing on agriculturally used fields. Unexpectedly, we found that biotic and abiotic stress related changes of plants grown in the field overlay their regrowth related transcriptional changes and characterized transcription related protein families involved in these processes. Further, we can show that gibberellins, among other phytohormones, also contribute to the developmental processes related to regrowth after biomass-loss. Our findings show that massive biomass loss triggers less transcriptional changes in field grown plants than their struggle with biotic and abiotic stresses and that gibberellins also play a role in the developmental program related to regrowth after mowing in red clover. Our results provide first insights into the physiological and developmental processes of mowing on red clover and may serve as a base for red clover yield improvement.
