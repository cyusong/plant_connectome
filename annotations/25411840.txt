['25411840', 'Epigenetic mechanisms suppress the transcription of transposons and DNA repeats;  however, this suppression can be transiently released under prolonged heat  stress. Here we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana imprinted gene SDC, which is  silent during vegetative growth due to DNA methylation, is activated by heat and  contributes to recovery from stress. SDC activation seems to involve epigenetic  mechanisms but not canonical heat-shock perception and signaling. The  heat-mediated transcriptional induction of SDC occurs particularly in young  developing leaves and is proportional to the level of stress. However, this  occurs only above a certain window of absolute temperatures and, thus, resembles  a thermal-sensing mechanism. In addition, the re-silencing kinetics during  recovery can be entrained by repeated heat stress cycles, suggesting that  epigenetic regulation in plants may conserve memory of stress experience. We  further demonstrate that SDC contributes to the recovery of plant biomass after  stress. We propose that transcriptional gene silencing, known to be involved in  gene imprinting, is also co-opted in the specific tuning of SDC expression upon  heat stress and subsequent recovery. It is therefore possible that dynamic  properties of the epigenetic landscape associated with silenced or imprinted  genes may contribute to regulation of their expression in response to  environmental challenges.', '2014 Nov', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1004806', 'Paszkowski']
