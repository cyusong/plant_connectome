['18826430', 'Nitrate is an essential nutrient, and is involved in many adaptive responses of  plants, such as localized proliferation of roots, flowering or stomatal  movements. How such nitrate-specific mechanisms are regulated at the molecular  level is poorly understood. Although the Arabidopsis ANR1 transcription factor  appears to control stimulation of lateral root elongation in response to nitrate,  no regulators of nitrate assimilation have so far been identified in higher  plants. Legume-specific symbiotic nitrogen fixation is under the control of the  putative transcription factor, NIN, in Lotus japonicus. Recently, the algal  homologue NIT2 was found to regulate nitrate assimilation. Here we report that  Arabidopsis thaliana NIN-like protein 7 (NLP7) knockout mutants constitutively  show several features of nitrogen-starved plants, and that they are tolerant to  drought stress. We show that nlp7 mutants are impaired in transduction of the  nitrate signal, and that the NLP7 expression pattern is consistent with a  function of NLP7 in the sensing of nitrogen. Translational fusions with GFP  showed a nuclear localization for the NLP7 putative transcription factor. We  propose NLP7 as an important element of the nitrate signal transduction pathway  and as a new regulatory protein specific for nitrogen assimilation in  non-nodulating plants.', '2009 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03695.x', 'Krapp']
