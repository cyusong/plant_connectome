Forward genetic analysis, widely used to find new gene functions, benefits from the availability of mutants. At present, based on Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation technology, many transfer (T)-DNA transformants have been created. However, cloning their T-DNA insertion sites, which enables identification of the mutated genes, is still challenging. In this study, we improved adapter ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (A-PCR), which mainly utilizes the Thermal Asymmetric interlaced reaction and Degenerate sequence-recognizing restriction Endonucleases (TADE). Using the new method TADE-mediated A-PCR (TADEA-PCR), we successfully cloned 22 of all the 24 junction sites in 10 Arabidopsis thaliana L. transformants that contained 12 T-DNA insertions in total, giving a success rate of 91.7%. In most cases, the two junction sites resulting from a single T-DNA insertion were simultaneously cloned. In addition, TADEA-PCR was able to clone more than two junction sites present in one transformant containing several T-DNA insertions. Overall, TADEA-PCR is a powerful technique for cloning T-DNA insertion sites.
