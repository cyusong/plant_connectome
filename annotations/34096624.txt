Efficient phosphate (Pi) uptake and utilisation are essential for promoting crop yield. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood in complex crop species such as hexaploid wheat. Here we report that TaPHT1;9-4B and its transcriptional regulator TaMYB4-7D function in Pi acquisition, translocation and plant growth in bread wheat. TaPHT1;9-4B, a high-affinity Pi transporter highly upregulated in roots by Pi deficiency, was identified using quantitative proteomics. Disruption of TaPHT1;9-4B function by BSMV-VIGS or CRISPR editing impaired wheat tolerance to Pi deprivation, whereas transgenic expression of TaPHT1;9-4B in rice improved Pi uptake and plant growth. Using yeast-one-hybrid assay, we isolated TaMYB4-7D, a R2R3 MYB transcription factor that could activate TaPHT1;9-4B expression by binding to its promoter. Silencing TaMYB4-7D decreased TaPHT1;9-4B expression, Pi uptake and plant growth. Four promoter haplotypes were identified for TaPHT1;9-4B, with Hap3 showing significant positive associations with TaPHT1;9-4B transcript level, growth performance and phosphorus (P) content in wheat plants. A functional marker was therefore developed for tagging Hap3. Collectively, our data shed new light on the molecular mechanism controlling Pi acquisition and utilisation in bread wheat. TaPHT1;9-4B and TaMYB4-7D may aid further research towards the development of P efficient crop cultivars.
