['15086802', 'A clone for a novel Arabidopsisthaliana calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein of 25  kDa (AtCaMBP25) has been isolated by using a radiolabelled CaM probe to screen a  cDNA expression library derived from A. thaliana cell suspension cultures  challenged with osmotic stress. The deduced amino acid sequence of AtCaMBP25  contains putative nuclear localization sequences and shares significant degree of  similarity with hypothetical plant proteins only. Fusion of the AtCaMBP25 coding  sequence to reporter genes targets the hybrid protein to the nucleus. Bacterially  expressed AtCaMBP25 binds, in a calcium-dependent manner, to a canonical CaM but  not to a less conserved isoform of the calcium sensor. AtCaMBP25 is encoded by a  single-copy gene, whose expression is induced in Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to  dehydration, low temperature or high salinity. Transgenic plants overexpressing  AtCaMBP25 exhibits an increased sensitivity to both ionic (NaCl) and non-ionic  (mannitol) osmotic stress during seed germination and seedling growth. By  contrast, transgenic lines expressing antisense AtCaMBP25 are significantly more  tolerant to mannitol and NaCl stresses than the wild type. Thus, the AtCaMBP25  gene functions as a negative effector of osmotic stress tolerance and likely  participates in stress signal transduction pathways.', '2004 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02062.x', 'Ranty']
