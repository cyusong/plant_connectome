Corn is an attractive host for vaccine production and oral delivery. The present review provides the current outlook and perspectives for this field. Among seed-crops, corn represents a key source of biomass for food, fuel production, and other applications. Since the beginning of the development of plant-based vaccines, corn was explored for the production and delivery of vaccines. About a dozen of pathogens have been studied under this technology with distinct degrees of development. A vaccine prototype against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was evaluated in a phase I clinical trial and several candidates targeting bacterial and viral diseases are under preclinical evaluation. The present review provides an updated outlook on this topic highlighting the employed expression strategies; perspectives for the field are also provided.
