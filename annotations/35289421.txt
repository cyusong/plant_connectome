Despite the adaptive and taxonomic relevance of the natural diversity for trichome patterning and morphology, the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these traits remain mostly unknown, particularly in organs other than leaves. In this study, we address the ecological, genetic and molecular bases of the natural variation for trichome patterning and branching in multiple organs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To this end, we characterized a collection of 191 accessions and carried out environmental and genome-wide association (GWA) analyses. Trichome amount in different organs correlated negatively with precipitation in distinct seasons, thus suggesting a precise fit between trichome patterning and climate throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. In addition, GWA analyses showed small overlapping between the genes associated with different organs, indicating partly independent genetic bases for vegetative and reproductive phases. These analyses identified a complex locus on chromosome 2, where two adjacent MYB genes (ETC2 and TCL1) displayed differential effects on trichome patterning in several organs. Furthermore, analyses of transgenic lines carrying different natural alleles demonstrated that TCL1 accounts for the variation for trichome patterning in all organs, and for stem trichome branching. By contrast, two other MYB genes (TRY and GL1), mainly showed effects on trichome patterning or branching, respectively.
