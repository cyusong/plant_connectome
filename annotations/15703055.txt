['15703055', 'We report the characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, ups1, isolated  on the basis of reduced expression of phosphoribosylanthranilate transferase, a  tryptophan biosynthetic enzyme. ups1 also exhibits defects in a wide range of  defence responses. After infection with Pseudomonas syringae or Botrytis cinerea,  the expression of genes regulated by both the salicylic acid and jasmonic  acid/ethylene pathways is reduced in ups1 compared with wild type. Camalexin  accumulation in ups1 is greatly reduced after infection with these two pathogens,  as well as after amino acid starvation or oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen  species (ROS)-mediated gene expression is also compromised in ups1 indicating  that this mutant is defective in signalling pathways activated in response to  both biotic and abiotic stress. The fact that all three major defence signalling  pathways are disrupted in ups1, together with the oxidative stress phenotype,  leads us to suggest that UPS1 is involved in ROS signal transduction.', '2005 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02327.x', 'Last']
