Resistance of Chinese sprangletop (<i>Leptochloa chinensis</i> (L.) Nees) to the herbicide cyhalofop-butyl has recently become a severe problem in rice cultivation. However, the molecular mechanisms of target-site resistance (TSR) in cyhalofop-butyl<i>-</i>resistant <i>L. chinensis</i> as well as the underlying non-target-site resistance (NTSR) have not yet been well-characterized. This study aimed to investigate cyhalofop-butyl resistance mechanisms using one susceptible population (LC-S) and two resistant populations (LC-1701 and LC-1704) of <i>L. chinensis.</i> We analyzed two gene copies encoding the entire carboxyltransferase (CT) domain of chloroplastic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) from each population. Two non-synonymous substitutions were detected in the resistant <i>L. chinensis</i> populations (Trp<sup>2027</sup>-Cys in the <i>ACCase</i>1 of LC-1701 and Leu<sup>1818</sup>-Phe in the <i>ACCase</i>2 of LC-1704), which were absent in LC-S. As Trp<sup>2027</sup>-Cys confers resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, the potential relationship between the novel Leu<sup>1818</sup>-Phe mutation and cyhalofop-butyl resistance in LC-1704 was further explored by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection. Metabolic inhibition assays indicated that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) and glutathione <i>S</i>-transferases (GSTs) contributed to cyhalofop-butyl resistance in specific resistant populations. RNA sequencing showed that the P450 genes <i>CYP71Z18</i>, <i>CYP71C4</i>, <i>CYP71C1</i>, <i>CYP81Q32</i>, and <i>CYP76B6</i> and the GST genes <i>GSTF11</i>, <i>GSTF1</i>, and <i>GSTU6</i> were upregulated in at least one resistant population, which indicated their putative roles in cyhalofop-butyl resistance of <i>L. chinensis</i>. Correlation analyses revealed that the constitutive or inducible expression patterns of <i>CYP71C4</i>, <i>CYP71C1</i>, <i>GSTF1</i>, and <i>GSTU6</i> in <i>L. chinensis</i> were strongly associated with the resistant phenotype. For this reason, attention should be directed towards these genes to elucidate metabolic resistance to cyhalofop-butyl in <i>L. chinensis</i>. The findings of this study improve the understanding of mechanisms responsible for resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in grass-weed species at the molecular level, thus aiding in the development of weed management strategies that delay the emergence of resistance to this class of pest control products.
