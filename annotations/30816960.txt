Drought is a major abiotic stress that negatively influences crop yield. Breeding strategies for improved drought resistance require an improved knowledge of plant drought responses. We therefore applied drought to barley recombinant inbred lines and their parental genotypes shortly before tillering. A large-scale proteomic analysis of leaf and root tissue revealed proteins that respond to drought in a genotype-specific manner. Of these, Rubisco activase in chloroplast, luminal binding protein in endoplasmic reticulum, phosphoglycerate mutase, glutathione S-transferase, heat shock proteins and enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis showed strong genotype×environment interactions. These data were subjected to genetic linkage analysis and the identification of proteomic QTLs that have potential value in marker-assisted breeding programs.
