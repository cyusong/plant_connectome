Molecular targets play important roles in agrochemical discovery. Numerous pesticides target the key proteins in pathogens, insect, or plants. Investigating ligand-binding pockets and/or active sites in the proteins' structures is usually the first step in designing new green pesticides. Thus, molecular target structures are extremely important for the discovery and development of such pesticides. In this manuscript, we present a review of the molecular target structures, including those of antiviral, fungicidal, bactericidal, insecticidal, herbicidal, and plant growth-regulator targets, currently used in agrochemical research. The data will be helpful in pesticide design and the discovery of new green pesticides.
