During arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, cells within the root cortex develop a matrix-filled apoplastic compartment in which differentiated AM fungal hyphae called arbuscules reside. Development of the compartment occurs rapidly, coincident with intracellular penetration and rapid branching of the fungal hypha, and it requires much of the plant cell's secretory machinery to generate the periarbuscular membrane that delimits the compartment. Despite recent advances, our understanding of the development of the periarbuscular membrane and the transfer of molecules across the symbiotic interface is limited. Here, using electron microscopy and tomography, we reveal that the periarbuscular matrix contains two types of membrane-bound compartments. We propose that one of these arises as a consequence of biogenesis of the periarbuscular membrane and may facilitate movement of molecules between symbiotic partners. Additionally, we show that the arbuscule contains massive arrays of membrane tubules located between the protoplast and the cell wall. We speculate that these tubules may provide the absorptive capacity needed for nutrient assimilation and possibly water absorption to enable rapid hyphal expansion.
