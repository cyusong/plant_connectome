Domain of unknown function (DUF) proteins constitute a great deal of families of functionally uncharacterized proteins in eukaryotes. The DUF966 gene family is found in monocotyledons, dicotyledons, mosses, and other species. However, little is known about the functions of DUF966 genes in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.). In this study, we identified and characterized the TaDUF966 gene family members in wheat by <i>in silico</i> analysis. A total of 28 TaDUF966 proteins were identified in wheat. Phylogenetic analysis divided these proteins into two groups (Groups I and II). Proteins in each group showed a highly conserved DUF966 domain and conserved motif distribution, implying their functional conservation. Analysis of gene expression profiling data showed that some TaDUF966 genes were induced by salt stress. We further confirmed the role of TaDUF966-9B in salt stress using virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay. Compared with the empty vector control, the TaDUF966-9B knockdown plants exhibited severe leaf curling at 10 days post-inoculation with BSMV under salt stress, suggesting that TaDUF966 genes play a vital role in salt stress tolerance in wheat. Taken together, these results expand our knowledge of the evolution of the DUF966 gene family in wheat and promote the potential application of these genes in wheat genetic improvement.
