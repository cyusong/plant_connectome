Leaves are the primary organs for photosynthesis, and as such have a pivotal role for plant growth and development. Leaf development is a multifactorial and dynamic process involving many genes that regulate size, shape, and differentiation. The processes that mainly drive leaf development are cell proliferation and cell expansion, and numerous genes have been identified that, when ectopically expressed or down-regulated, increase cell number and/or cell size during leaf growth. Many of the genes regulating cell proliferation are functionally interconnected and can be grouped into regulatory modules. Here, we review our current understanding of six important gene regulatory modules affecting cell proliferation during Arabidopsis leaf growth: ubiquitin receptor DA1-ENHANCER OF DA1 (EOD1), GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR (GRF)-GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR (GIF), SWITCH/SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING (SWI/SNF), gibberellin (GA)-DELLA, KLU, and PEAPOD (PPD). Furthermore, we discuss how post-mitotic cell expansion and these six modules regulating cell proliferation make up the final leaf size.
