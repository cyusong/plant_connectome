A sustainable agriculture and the great increase in consumers of organic products in the last years make the use of natural products one of the main challenges of modern agriculture. This is the reason that the use of products based on seaweed extracts has increased exponentially, specifically brown seaweeds, including Ascophyllum nodosum and Ecklonia maxima. In this study, the chemical composition of 20 commercial seaweed extract products used as biostimulants and their antifungal activity against two common postharvest pathogens (Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium digitatum) from fruits were evaluated. Data were processed using chemometric techniques based on linear and non-linear models. The results showed that the algae species and the percentage of seaweed had a significant effect on the final composition of the products. In addition, great disparity was observed between formulations with similar labeling and antifungal effect of most of the analyzed products against some of the tested pathogens. These findings indicate the need for further research.
