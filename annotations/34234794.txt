Achieving food security for an ever-increasing human population requires faster development of improved varieties. To this end, assessment of genetic gain for key traits is important to inform breeding processes. Despite the improvements made to increase production and productivity of cassava in Uganda at research level, there has been limited effort to quantify associated genetic gains. Accordingly, a study was conducted in Uganda to assess whether or not genetic improvement was evident in selected cassava traits using cassava varieties that were released from 1940 to 2019. Thirty-two varieties developed during this period, were evaluated simultaneously in three major cassava production zones; central (Namulonge), eastern (Serere), and northern (Loro). Best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of the genotypic value for each clone were obtained across environments and regressed on order of release year to estimate annual genetic gains. We observed that genetic trends were mostly quadratic. On average, cassava mosaic disease (CMD) resistance increased by 1.9% per year, while annual genetic improvements in harvest index (0.0%) and fresh root yield (-5 kg per ha or -0.03% per ha) were non-substantial. For cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) resistance breeding which was only initiated in 2003, average annual genetic gains for CBSD foliar and CBSD root necrosis resistances were 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively. It's evident that cassava breeding has largely focused on protecting yield against diseases. This underpins the need for simultaneous improvement of cassava for disease resistance and high yield for the crop to meet its current and futuristic demands for food and industry.
