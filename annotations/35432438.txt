Triploid breeding based on unilateral sexual polyploidization is an effective approach for genetic improvement of <i>Populus</i>, which can integrate heterosis and ploidy vigor in an elite variety. However, the phenotypic divergence of unselected allotriploids with the same cross-combination remains poorly understood, and the contributions of ploidy, gender, and genotype effects on phenotypic variation are still unclear. In this study, wood and fiber traits, including basic density (BD), lignin content (LC), fiber length (FL), fiber width (FW), and fiber length/width (FL/W), were measured based on a 10-year-old clonal trial, including full-sib diploid and triploid hybrids of (<i>Populus pseudo-simonii</i> × <i>P. nigra</i> 'Zheyin3#') × <i>P.</i> × <i>beijingensis</i>, and contributions of ploidy, gender, and genotype effects on the variation of these traits, were disaggregated to enhance our understanding of triploid breeding. We found a significant phenotypic variation for all measured traits among genotypes. All the wood and fiber traits studied here underwent strong clonal responses with high repeatabilities (0.55-0.76). The Pearson's correlation analyses based on the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) revealed that BD was significantly positively correlated with FL (<i>r</i> = 0.65, <i>p</i> = 0.030), suggesting that BD could be improved together with FL during triploid breeding. The FL of the triploids was significantly larger than that of the diploids (<i>p</i> < 0.001), suggesting that ploidy strongly affected the variation of FL traits. The difference between females and males was not significant for any measured trait, implying that gender might not be a major factor for variation in these traits. Further analyses of variance components showed that genotype dominantly contributed to the variation of BD, LC, and FW traits (with 54, 62, and 53% contributions, respectively) and ploidy contributed strongly to variation in FL and FL/W (77 and 50%, respectively). The genetic coefficient of variation (CV<sub>G</sub>) of triploids for each trait was low, suggesting that it is necessary to produce many triploids for selection or to use different <i>Populus</i> species as parents. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic effects of ploidy, gender, and genotype on wood and fiber traits within a full-sib poplar family, enhancing the understanding of the triploid breeding program of <i>Populus</i>.
