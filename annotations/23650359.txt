['23650359', 'WRKY transcription factors are key players in the plant immune response, but less  is known about their involvement in antiviral defense than about their roles in  defense against bacterial or fungi pathogens. Here, we report that Arabidopsis  thaliana WRKY DNA-binding protein 8 (WRKY8) has a role in mediating the  long-distance movement of crucifer-infecting tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-cg). The  expression of WRKY8 was inhibited by TMV-cg infection, and mutation of WRKY8  accelerated the accumulation of TMV-cg in systemically infected leaves.  Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of ABA insensitive 4  (ABI4) was reduced and the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase 6 (ACS6) and ethylene response factor 104 (ERF104) was enhanced in the  systemically infected leaves of wrky8. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated  that WRKY8 could bind selectively to putative W-boxes of the ABI4, ACS6, and  ERF104 promoters. Furthermore, TMV-cg infection enhanced WRKY8 binding to the  ABI4 promoter but reduced the binding of WRKY8 to the ACS6 and ERF104 promoters,  indicating that regulation of ABI4, ACS6, and ERF104 by WRKY8 is at least  partially dependent on TMV-cg. Exogenous applications of abscisic acid (ABA)  reduced the systemic accumulation of TMV-cg. Mutations in ABA deficient 1, ABA  deficient 2, ABA deficient 3, or abi4 accelerated systemic TMV-cg accumulation.  In contrast, exogenous application of aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  enhanced the systemic accumulation of TMV-cg, but mutations in acs6, erf104, or  an octuple acs mutant inhibited systemic TMV-cg accumulation. Our results  demonstrate that WRKY8 is involved in the defense response against TMV-cg through  the direct regulation of the expression of ABI4, ACS6, and ERF104 and may mediate  the crosstalk between ABA and ethylene signaling during the TMV-cg-Arabidopsis  interaction.', '2013 May 21', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1221347110', 'Yu']
