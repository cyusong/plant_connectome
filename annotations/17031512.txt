['17031512', 'The disaccharide trehalose has dramatic effects on plant metabolism, growth and  development. Arabidopsis seedlings grown on trehalose-containing medium without  sucrose display increased expression of the starch synthesis gene ApL3,  hyper-accumulation of starch in the cotyledons and inhibition of root growth.  Here we show that the ABI4 transcription factor mediates the effects of trehalose  on starch metabolism and growth, independently of abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis  and hexokinase (HXK1) signaling. Surprisingly, although the abi4 mutation  partially rescued trehalose inhibition of root elongation, ApL3 expression levels  were still enhanced. Gene expression analysis suggests that trehalose affects  both starch synthesis and starch breakdown. The expression of genes involved in  starch breakdown, such as SEX1 and the beta-amylase gene BMY8/BAM3, was strongly  down-regulated in WT plants grown on trehalose but not in abi4 mutants. Addition  of trehalose to liquid-grown WT seedlings also significantly reduced SEX1  expression after 6 h. Bypassing the need for starch breakdown by growth in  continuous light or addition of sucrose rescued root growth on trehalose medium  similar to the abi4 mutation. These results suggest that inhibition of starch  mobilization rather than increased synthesis is involved in growth inhibition by  exogenous trehalose. Trehalose also significantly enhanced ABI4 expression but  reduced its sucrose induction, providing a possible molecular mechanism for the  trehalose effect on plant gene expression and growth.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-006-9082-2', 'Leyman']
