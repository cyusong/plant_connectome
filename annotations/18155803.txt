The halophytes Plantago maritima, Aster tripolium, Artemisia santonicum, Puccinellia limosa, Festuca pseudovina and Lepidium crassifolium from two different saline soils of the Hungarian steppe were examined for colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The salt aster (A. tripolium) and the sea plantain (P. maritima) were examined more thoroughly by recording root colonization parameters, the salt content in the soil and monthly precipitations in 2001 and 2002. Mycorrhizal colonization was maximal in late spring to early summer and had a second peak later in the autumn. Arbuscule formation and overall mycorrhizal colonization appeared to be inversely correlated with the intensity of rainfall at the investigated sites. The results suggest that, in addition to seasonality, drought may play an important role in governing mycorrhizal activity in saline habitats. In greenhouse experiments, conditions in which AMF could overcome the inhibitory effects of sodium chloride on establishing plant-mycorrhizal symbiosis were not met.
