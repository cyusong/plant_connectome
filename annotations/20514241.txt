The biogenesis of the plant mitochondrial respiratory chain needs the coordinated synthesis and assembly of the products of more than 100 genes located in the nucleus and within the organelle. One of the factors that regulate the expression of nuclear genes is the availability of carbohydrates. This regulation operates at the transcriptional level through elements present in the promoter regions of respiratory chain component genes. Recent studies of the promoters of two Arabidopsis genes that encode subunit 5b of cytochrome c oxidase suggest that these genes use different molecular mechanisms to respond to carbohydrates. A model is postulated in which one of the genes retained ancient expression characteristics while the other one incorporated novel response elements that allowed a progressive divergence of regulatory mechanisms.
