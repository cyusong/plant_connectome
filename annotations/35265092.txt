Root system architecture (RSA) is an important agronomic trait with vital roles in plant productivity under water stress conditions. A deep and branched root system may help plants to avoid water stress by enabling them to acquire more water and nutrient resources. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the genetics and molecular control mechanisms of RSA is still relatively limited. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome response of root tips to water stress in two well-known genotypes of rice: IR64, a high-yielding lowland genotype, which represents a drought-susceptible and shallow-rooting genotype; and Azucena, a traditional, upland, drought-tolerant and deep-rooting genotype. We collected samples from three zones (Z) of root tip: two consecutive 5 mm sections (Z1 and Z2) and the following next 10 mm section (Z3), which mainly includes meristematic and maturation regions. Our results showed that Z1 of Azucena was enriched for genes involved in cell cycle and division and root growth and development whereas in IR64 root, responses to oxidative stress were strongly enriched. While the expansion of the lateral root system was used as a strategy by both genotypes when facing water shortage, it was more pronounced in Azucena. Our results also suggested that by enhancing meristematic cell wall thickening for insulation purposes as a means of confronting stress, the sensitive IR64 genotype may have reduced its capacity for root elongation to extract water from deeper layers of the soil. Furthermore, several members of gene families such as <i>NAC</i>, <i>AP2/ERF</i>, <i>AUX/IAA</i>, <i>EXPANSIN</i>, <i>WRKY</i>, and <i>MYB</i> emerged as main players in RSA and drought adaptation. We also found that <i>HSP</i> and <i>HSF</i> gene families participated in oxidative stress inhibition in IR64 root tip. Meta-quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed that 288 differentially expressed genes were colocalized with RSA QTLs previously reported under drought and normal conditions. This finding warrants further research into their possible roles in drought adaptation. Overall, our analyses presented several major molecular differences between Azucena and IR64, which may partly explain their differential root growth responses to water stress. It appears that Azucena avoided water stress through enhancing growth and root exploration to access water, whereas IR64 might mainly rely on cell insulation to maintain water and antioxidant system to withstand stress. We identified a large number of novel RSA and drought associated candidate genes, which should encourage further exploration of their potential to enhance drought adaptation in rice.
