['31245760', 'All members of the DUF579 family characterized so far have been described to  affect the integrity of the hemicellulosic cell wall component xylan: GXMs are  glucuronoxylan methyltransferases catalyzing 4-O-methylation of glucuronic acid  on xylan; IRX15 and IRX15L, although their enzymatic activity is unknown, are  required for xylan biosynthesis and/or xylan deposition. Here we show that the  DUF579 family members, AGM1 and AGM2, are required for 4-O-methylation of  glucuronic acid of a different plant cell wall component, the highly glycosylated  arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs).', '2019 Feb', 'Plant Direct', '10.1002/pld3.117', 'Dupree']

GXMs: !catalyze! 4-O-methylation of glucuronic acid on xylan
IRX15/IRX15L: !required for! xylan biosynthesis/deposition
AGM1/AGM2: !required for! 4-O-methylation of glucuronic acid of AGPs
