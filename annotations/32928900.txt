Salinity is an environmental stress that causes decline in crop yield. <i>Avicennia officinalis</i> and other mangroves have adaptations such as ultrafiltration at the roots aided by apoplastic cell wall barriers to thrive in saline conditions. We studied a cytochrome P450 gene from <i>A. officinalis</i>, <i>AoCYP94B1</i>, and its putative ortholog in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>AtCYP94B1</i>, which are involved in apoplastic barrier formation. Both genes were induced by 30 min of salt treatment in the roots. Heterologous expression of <i>AoCYP94B1</i> in the <i>atcyp94b1</i> Arabidopsis mutant and wild-type rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) conferred increased NaCl tolerance to seedlings by enhancing root suberin deposition. Histochemical staining and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification of suberin precursors confirmed the role of CYP94B1 in suberin biosynthesis. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and yeast one-hybrid and luciferase assays, we identified AtWRKY33 as the upstream regulator of <i>AtCYP94B1</i> in Arabidopsis. In addition, <i>atwrky33</i> mutants exhibited reduced suberin and salt-sensitive phenotypes, which were rescued by expressing <i>35S::AtCYP94B1</i> in the <i>atwrky33</i> background. This further confirmed that AtWRKY33-mediated regulation of <i>AtCYP94B1</i> is part of the salt tolerance mechanism. Our findings may help efforts aimed at generating salt-tolerant crops.
