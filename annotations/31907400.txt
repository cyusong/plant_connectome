Faster onset of photoprotection could potentially increase biomass accumulation. Indeed, this has been realized in tobacco VPZ lines by overexpression of three photoprotective proteins in parallel. To explore the range of application of this approach, we generated Arabidopsis VPZ lines. These lines triggered photoprotection more rapidly, but growth rate and biomass accumulation were impaired under fluctuating light. This implies that the strategy might interfere with other mechanisms controlling excitation energy distribution, or with source-sink relationships or plastid signalling.
