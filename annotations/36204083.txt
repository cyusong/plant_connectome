Drought and heat, in the context of climate change, are expected to increase in many agricultural areas across the globe. Among current abiotic stresses, they are the most limiting factors that influence crop growth and productivity. Maize is one of most widely produced crops of the world, being the first in grain production with a yield that exceeded 1.1 billion tons in 2021. Despite its wide distribution in semi-arid regions, it is highly vulnerable to climate change, which triggers important losses in its productivity. This article explores how maize yield may persevere through climate change by focusing on the stomatal regulation of gas exchange. The emerging picture unravels that maize copes with drought stress by reducing stomatal size and stomatal pore area, and increasing stomatal density, which, in turn, reduces transpiration and photosynthetic rate. When drought and heat co-occur, heat enhances stomatal response to drought stress. To avoid plant heat damage, the decline in stomatal aperture could trigger the expansion of the distance of action, from the longitudinal leaf veins, of ZmSHR1, which might act to positively regulate ZmSPCHs/ZmICE1 heterodimers, increasing the stomatal density. Only when drought is not very severe, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels reduce yield losses. The knowledge of the upcoming climate changes together with the prediction of the developmental and physiological stomatal responses will allow not only to anticipate maize yield in the next years, but also to contribute to the correct decision-making in the management of this important crop.
