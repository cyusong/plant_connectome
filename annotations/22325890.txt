['22325890', 'GT factors are a family of plant-specific transcription factors with conserved  trihelix DNA-binding domains that bind GT elements. By screening a cDNA  expression library with (35)S-labeled recombinant calmodulin (CaM), we identified  AtGT2L, a classic member of GT-2 subfamily, as a Ca(2+)-dependent CaM-binding  protein. AtGT2L specifically targets the nucleus and possesses both  transcriptional activation and DNA-binding abilities, implicating its function as  a nuclear transcription factor. The CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) of AtGT2L is  embedded in its C-terminal DNA-binding domain, but the in vitro DNA-binding  ability of AtGT2L was not affected by its interaction with CaM. Site-directed  mutagenesis experiments further revealed that Met(506) and Leu(507) in the CaMBD  are critical for both CaM- and DNA-binding abilities of AtGT2L. Northern blot  analysis showed that AtGT2L mRNA levels are higher in old rosette leaves, cauline  leaves and flowers than in other organs. In addition, the expression of AtGT2L  was responsive to cold, NaCl and abscisic acid treatments. Furthermore, both  basal and chilling/NaCl-induced expressions of the cold- and salt-inducible  marker genes RD29A and ERD10 were higher in plants overexpressing AtGT2L than  those in wild-type plants. Thus, our data indicate that AtGT2L is a  Ca(2+)/CaM-binding nuclear transcription factor involved in plant responses to  cold and salt stresses.', '2012 Apr', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.11.013', 'Poovaiah']
