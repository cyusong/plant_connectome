The phenomenon of pistil abortion widely occurs in Japanese apricot and has seriously affected the yield in production. We used a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) approaches to identify the differentially expressed proteome between perfect and imperfect flower buds in Japanese apricot. More than 400 highly reproducible protein spots (P<0.05) were detected and 27 protein spots showed a greater than two-fold difference in their expression values. The proteins identified were classified into eight functional classifications and ten process categories, according to the Gene Ontology (GO). Acetyl-CoA produced by ATP citrate lyase (ACL) as a structural substance during formation of the cell wall could regulate pistil abortion in Japanese apricot. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) and caffeoyl-CoA-O-methyl transferase (CCoAOMT) could promote cell wall formation in perfect flower buds of Japanese apricot, greatly contributing to pistil development. Spermidine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (SHT) may be involved in the O-methylation of spermidine conjugates and could contribute to abnormal floral development. The identification of such differentially expressed proteins provides new targets for future studies that will assess their physiological roles and significance in pistil abortion.
