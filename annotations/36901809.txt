Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential heavy metal with high toxicity to plants. Plants have acquired specialized mechanisms to sense, transport, and detoxify Cd. Recent studies have identified many transporters involved in Cd uptake, transport, and detoxification. However, the complex transcriptional regulatory networks involved in Cd response remain to be elucidated. Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge regarding transcriptional regulatory networks and post-translational regulation of the transcription factors involved in Cd response. An increasing number of reports indicate that epigenetic regulation and long non-coding and small RNAs are important in Cd-induced transcriptional responses. Several kinases play important roles in Cd signaling that activate transcriptional cascades. We also discuss the perspectives to reduce grain Cd content and improve crop tolerance to Cd stress, which provides a theoretical reference for food safety and the future research of plant varieties with low Cd accumulation.
