Sense of smell is mediated by diverse families of olfactory sensing receptors, conveying important dietary information, fundamental for growth and survival. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the sensory olfactory pathways in the regulation of feeding behavior of carnivorous rainbow trout (RT, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>), from first feeding until 8 months. Compared to a commercial diet, RT fed with a total plant-based diet showed drastically altered growth performance associated with feed intake from an early stage. Exhaustive examination of an RT genome database identified three vomeronasal type 1 receptor-like (ORA), 10 vomeronasal type 2 receptor-like (OLFC) and 14 main olfactory receptor (MOR) genes, all highly expressed in sensory organs, indicating their potential functionality. Gene expression after feeding demonstrated the importance in olfactory sensing perception of some OLFC (<i>olfcg6</i>) and MOR (<i>mor103</i>, -<i>107</i>, -<i>112</i>, -<i>113</i>, -<i>133</i>) receptor family genes in RT. The gene <i>ora1a</i> showed evidence of involvement in olfactory sensing perception for fish fed with a commercial-like diet, while <i>ora5b</i>, <i>mor118</i>, <i>mor124</i> and <i>olfch1</i> showed evidence of involvement in fish fed with a plant-based diet. Results indicated an impact of a plant-based diet on the regulation of olfactory sensing pathways as well as influence on monoaminergic neurotransmission in brain areas related to olfactory-driven behaviors. The overall findings suggest that feeding behavior is mediated through olfactory sensing detection and olfactory-driven behavior pathways in RT.
