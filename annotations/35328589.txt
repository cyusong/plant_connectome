Grain size is a quantitative trait that is controlled by multiple genes. It is not only a yield trait, but also an important appearance quality of rice. In addition, grain size is easy to be selected in evolution, which is also a significant trait for studying rice evolution. In recent years, many quantitative trait loci (QTL)/genes for rice grain size were isolated by map-based cloning or genome-wide association studies, which revealed the genetic and molecular mechanism of grain size regulation in part. Here, we summarized the QTL/genes cloned for grain size and the regulation mechanism with a view to provide the theoretical basis for improving rice yield and breeding superior varieties.
