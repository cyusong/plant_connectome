Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) are calcium (Ca2+) sensors involved in plant growth and development as well as adaptation to environmental stresses; however, their roles in plant responses to cold are not well understood. To reveal the role of MsCML10 from alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in regulating cold tolerance, we examined transgenic alfalfa and Medicago truncatula overexpressing MsCML10, MsCML10-RNAi alfalfa, and a M. truncatula cml10-1 mutant and identified MsCML10-interacting proteins. MsCML10 and MtCML10 transcripts were induced by cold treatment. Upregulation or downregulation of MsCML10 resulted in increased or decreased cold tolerance, respectively, while cml10-1 showed decreased cold tolerance that was complemented by expressing MsCML10, suggesting that MsCML10 regulates cold tolerance. MsCML10 interacted with glutathione S-transferase (MsGSTU8) and fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase (MsFBA6), and the interaction depended on the presence of Ca2+. The altered activities of Glutathione S-transferase and FBA and levels of ROS and sugars were associated with MsCML10 transcript levels. We propose that MsCML10 decodes the cold-induced Ca2+ signal and regulates cold tolerance through activating MsGSTU8 and MsFBA6, leading to improved maintenance of ROS homeostasis and increased accumulation of sugars for osmoregulation, respectively.
