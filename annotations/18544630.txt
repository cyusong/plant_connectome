['18544630', 'Xyloglucans are the main hemicellulosic polysaccharides found in the primary cell  walls of dicots and nongraminaceous monocots, where they are thought to interact  with cellulose to form a three-dimensional network that functions as the  principal load-bearing structure of the primary cell wall. To determine whether  two Arabidopsis thaliana genes that encode xylosyltransferases, XXT1 and XXT2,  are involved in xyloglucan biosynthesis in vivo and to determine how the plant  cell wall is affected by the lack of expression of XXT1, XXT2, or both, we  isolated and characterized xxt1 and xxt2 single and xxt1 xxt2 double T-DNA  insertion mutants. Although the xxt1 and xxt2 mutants did not have a gross  morphological phenotype, they did have a slight decrease in xyloglucan content  and showed slightly altered distribution patterns for xyloglucan epitopes. More  interestingly, the xxt1 xxt2 double mutant had aberrant root hairs and lacked  detectable xyloglucan. The reduction of xyloglucan in the xxt2 mutant and the  lack of detectable xyloglucan in the xxt1 xxt2 double mutant resulted in  significant changes in the mechanical properties of these plants. We conclude  that XXT1 and XXT2 encode xylosyltransferases that are required for xyloglucan  biosynthesis. Moreover, the lack of detectable xyloglucan in the xxt1 xxt2 double  mutant challenges conventional models of the plant primary cell wall.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.059873', 'Keegstra']
