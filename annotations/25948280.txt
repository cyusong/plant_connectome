['25948280', 'Cyclin-dependent protein kinases are involved in many crucial cellular processes  and aspects of plant growth and development, but their precise roles in abiotic  stress responses are largely unknown. Here, Arabidopsis thaliana CYCLIN-DEPENDENT  KINASE G2 (CDKG2) was shown to act as a negative regulator of the salinity stress  response, as well as being involved in the control of flowering time. GUS  expression experiments based on a pCDKG2::GUS transgene suggested that CDKG2 was  expressed throughout plant development, with especially high expression levels  recorded in the seed and in the flower. The loss-of-function of CDKG2 led to an  increased tolerance of salinity stress and the up-regulation of the known  stress-responsive genes SOS1, SOS2, SOS3, NHX3, RD29B, ABI2, ABI3, MYB15 and  P5CS1. Flowering was accelerated in the cdkg2 mutants via the repression of FLC  and the consequent up-regulation of FT, SOC1, AP1 and LFY. Transgenic lines  constitutively expressing CDKG2 showed greater sensitivity to salinity stress and  were delayed in flowering. Furthermore, the CDKG2 genotype affected the response  of flowering time to salinity stress. Our data connect CDKG2 to undescribed  functions related to salt stress tolerance and flowering time through the  regulation of specific target genes.', '2015 Jun', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-015-0324-z', 'Wang']
