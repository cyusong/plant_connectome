['19121106', 'AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 are two Arabidopsis metal transporters sharing about 50%  sequence identity with mouse NRAMP1. The NRAMP1/Slc11A1 metal ion transporter  plays a crucial role in the innate immunity of animal macrophages targeted by  intracellular bacterial pathogens. AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 localize to the vacuolar  membrane. We found that AtNRAMP3 is upregulated in leaves challenged with the  bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Erwinia chrysanthemi, whereas  AtNRAMP4 expression is not modified. Using single and double nramp3 and nramp4  mutants, as well as lines ectopically expressing either of these genes, we show  that AtNRAMP3 and, to a lesser extent, AtNRAMP4 are involved in Arabidopsis  thaliana resistance against the bacterial pathogen E. chrysanthemi. The  susceptibility of the double nramp3 nramp4 mutant is associated with the reduced  accumulation of reactive oxygen species and ferritin (AtFER1), an iron storage  protein known to participate in A. thaliana defense. Interestingly, roots from  infected plants accumulated transcripts of AtNRAMP3 as well as the  iron-deficiency markers IRT1 and FRO2. This finding suggests the existence of a  shoot-to-root signal reminiscent of an iron-deficiency signal activated by  pathogen infection. Our data indicate that the functions of NRAMP proteins in  innate immunity have been conserved between animals and plants.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03775.x', 'Expert']
