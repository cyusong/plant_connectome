['30080609', 'BET5 is a component of trafficking protein particle (TRAPP) which has been  studied extensively in non-plant organisms where they are involved in membrane  trafficking within Golgi and between Golgi and early endosomes. Recent analysis  of TRAPP in different classes of organisms indicates that TRAPP function might  exhibit differences among organisms. A single copy of the BET5 gene named AtBET5  was found in the Arabidopsis genome based on sequence similarity. Developmental  phenotype and the underlying mechanisms have been characterized upon  transcriptional knock-down lines generated by both T-DNA insertion and RNAi.  Pollen grains of the T-DNA insertional line present reduced fertility and pilate  exine instead of tectate exine. Perturbation of the AtBET5 expression by RNAi  leads to apical meristematic organization defects and reduced fertility as well.  The reduced fertility was due to the pollination barrier caused by an altered  composition and structure of pollen walls. Auxin response in root tip cells is  altered and there is a severe disruption in polar localization of PIN1-GFP, but  to a less extent of PIN2-GFP in the root tips, which causes the apical  meristematic organization defects and might also be responsible for the secretion  of sporopollenin precursor or polar targeting of sporopollenin precursor  transporters.', '2018 Sep', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.05.033', 'Lu']
