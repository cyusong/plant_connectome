Elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (eC<sub>a</sub> ) may benefit plants during drought by reducing stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ) but any 'water savings effect' could be neutralized by concurrent stimulation of leaf area. We investigated whether eC<sub>a</sub> enhanced water savings, thereby ameliorating the impact of drought on carbon and water relations in trees. We report leaf-level gas exchange and whole-plant and soil water relations during a short-term dry-down in two Eucalyptus species with contrasting drought tolerance. Plants had previously been established for 9 to 11 months in steady-state conditions of ambient atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (aC<sub>a</sub> ) and eC<sub>a</sub> , with half of each treatment group exposed to sustained drought for 5 to 7 months. The lower stomatal conductance under eC<sub>a</sub> did not lead to soil moisture savings during the dry-down due to the counteractive effect of increased whole-plant leaf area. Nonetheless, eC<sub>a</sub> -grown plants maintained higher photosynthetic rates and leaf water potentials, making them less stressed during the dry-down, despite being larger. These effects were more pronounced in the xeric species than the mesic species, and in previously water-stressed plants. Our findings indicate that eC<sub>a</sub> may enhance plant performance during drought despite a lack of soil water savings, especially in species with more conservative growth and water-use strategies.
