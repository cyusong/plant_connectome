Dissipation mechanisms of excess photon energy under water stress were studied in ndhB-inactivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) mutants, which are impaired in NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-dependent cyclic electron flow around PSI. Relative leaf water content and net CO(2) assimilation decreased to 30% and almost zero, respectively, after 11-day water stress in the mutant and wild type plants. Similar reductions in PSII activity (by ca. 75%), and increases in malondialdehyde (by ca. 45%), an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were observed in both the plant groups when subjected to water stress. The stressed mutant and wild type plants showed similar P700 redox kinetics, but only the stressed mutant demonstrated an enhanced operation of the antimycin A-sensitive, ferredoxin-dependent cyclic electron flow around PSI, as indicated by a transient increase in chlorophyll fluorescence after turning off of actinic light. Further, the stressed mutant showed higher oxidation of alpha-tocopherol to alpha-tocopherol quinone, as compared with that in the stressed wild type. Thus, a deficiency in NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-dependent cyclic electron flow around PSI does not lead to oxidative damage because the mutant compensates for this deficiency by activating alternative dissipating routes of excess photon energy, such as up-regulation of ferredoxin-dependent cyclic electron flow around PSI and increased accumulation of alpha-tocopherol quinone.
