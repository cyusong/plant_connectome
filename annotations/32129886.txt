Cytokinins control critical aspects of plant development and environmental responses. Perception of cytokinin ultimately leads to the activation of proteins belonging to the type-B Response Regulator family of cytokinin response activators. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ARR1 is one of the most abundantly expressed type-B Response Regulators. We investigated the link between cytokinin signaling, protein synthesis, plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance. We show that the increased cytokinin signaling in ARR1 gain-of-function transgenic lines is associated with increased rates of protein synthesis, which lead to growth inhibition and hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Cytokinin-induced growth inhibition and osmotic stress hypersensitivity were rescued by treatments with ABA, a hormone known to inhibit protein synthesis. We also demonstrate that cytokinin-induced protein synthesis requires isoforms of the ribosomal protein L4 encoded by the cytokinin-inducible genes RPL4A and RPL4D, and that RPL4 loss-of-function increases osmotic stress tolerance and decreases sensitivity to cytokinin-induced growth inhibition. These findings reveal that an increase in protein synthesis negatively impacts growth and osmotic stress tolerance and explain some of the adverse effects of elevated cytokinin action on plant development and stress physiology.
