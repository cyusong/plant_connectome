FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) is a blue-light receptor whose function is related to flowering promotion under long-day conditions in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. However, information about the physiological role of FKF1 in day-neutral plants and even the physiological role other than photoperiodic flowering is lacking. Thus, the FKF1 homolog SlFKF1 was investigated in tomato, a day-neutral plant and a useful model for plants with fleshy fruit. It was confirmed that SlFKF1 belongs to the FKF1 group by phylogenetic tree analysis. The high sequence identity with <i>A. thaliana</i> FKF1, the conserved amino acids essential for function, and the similarity in the diurnal change in expression suggested that SlFKF1 may have similar functions to <i>A. thaliana</i> FKF1. CONSTANS (CO) is a transcription factor regulated by FKF1 and is responsible for the transcription of genes downstream of <i>CO</i>. <i>cis</i>-Regulatory elements targeted by CO were found in the promoter region of <i>SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT)</i> and <i>RIN</i>, which are involved in the regulation of flowering and fruit ripening, respectively. The blue-light effects on <i>SlFKF1</i> expression, flowering, and fruit lycopene concentration have been observed in this study and previous studies. It was confirmed in RNA interference lines that the low expression of <i>SlFKF1</i> is associated with late flowering with increased leaflets and low lycopene concentrations. This study sheds light on the various physiological roles of FKF1 in plants.
