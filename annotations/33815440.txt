Kernel length, kernel width, and kernel thickness are important traits affecting grain yield and product quality. Here, the genetic architecture of the three kernel size traits was dissected in an association panel of 309 maize inbred lines using four statistical methods. Forty-two significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; <i>p</i> < 1.72E-05) and 70 genes for the three traits were identified under five environments. One and eight SNPs were co-detected in two environments and by at least two methods, respectively, and they explained 5.87-9.59% of the phenotypic variation. Comparing the transcriptomes of two inbred lines with contrasting seed size, three and eight genes identified in the association panel showed significantly differential expression between the two genotypes at 15 and 39 days after pollination, respectively. Ten and 17 genes identified by a genome-wide association study were significantly differentially expressed between the two development stages in the two genotypes. Combining environment-/method-stable SNPs and differential expression analysis, ribosomal protein L7, jasmonate-regulated gene 21, serine/threonine-protein kinase RUNKEL, AP2-EREBP-transcription factor 16, and Zm00001d035222 (cell wall protein IFF6-like) were important candidate genes for maize kernel size and development.
