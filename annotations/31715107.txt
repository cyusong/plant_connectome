Plasmodesmata (PD) are essential for intercellular trafficking of molecules required for plant life, from small molecules like sugars and ions to macromolecules including proteins and RNA molecules that act as signals to regulate plant development and defense. As obligate intracellular pathogens, plant viruses have evolved to manipulate this communication system to facilitate the initial cell-to-cell and eventual systemic spread in their plant hosts. There has been considerable interest in how viruses manipulate the PD that connect the protoplasts of neighboring cells, and viruses have yielded invaluable tools for probing the structure and function of PD. With recent advances in biochemistry and imaging, we have gained new insights into the composition and structure of PD in the presence and absence of viruses. Here, we first discuss viral strategies for manipulating PD for their intercellular movement and examine how this has shed light on our understanding of native PD function. We then address the controversial role of the cytoskeleton in trafficking to and through PD. Finally, we address how viruses could alter PD structure and consider possible mechanisms of the phenomenon described as 'gating'. This discussion supports the significance of virus research in elucidating the properties of PD, these persistently enigmatic plant organelles.
