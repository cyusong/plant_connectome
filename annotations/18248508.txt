['18248508', 'Arabidopsis thaliana contains two salicylic acid (SA) glucosyltransferase enzymes  designated UGT74F1 and UGT74F2. UGT74F1 forms only SA 2-O-beta-D-glucose (SAG),  while UGT74F2 forms both SAG and the SA glucose ester (SGE). In an attempt to  determine the in vivo role of each SA glucosyltransferase (SAGT), the metabolism  of SA in ugt74f1 and ugt74f2 mutants was examined and compared with that of the  wild-type. The three major metabolites formed in wild-type Arabidopsis included  SAG, SGE, and 2,5-dihydroxbenzoic acid 2-O-beta-D-glucose (DHB2G). This is the  first description of DHB2G as a major metabolite of SA in plants. The major  metabolites of SA formed in ugt74f1 mutants were SGE, SAG and  2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 5-O-beta-D-glucose (DHB5G). DHB5G was not formed in the  wild-type plants. SAG and DHB2G were the main metabolites of SA in ugt74f2  mutants. The ugt74f2 mutant was unable to form SGE. Only SGE could be detected  during in vitro SAGT assays of untreated wild-type and ugt74f1 mutants. This  activity was because of constitutive UGT74F2 activity. Both SGE and SAG could be  formed during in vitro assays of SA-pretreated wild-type and ugt74f1 leaves.  Neither SAG nor SGE could be detected during the in vitro SAGT assays of  untreated ugt74f2 leaves. Only SAG was formed during the in vitro SAGT assays of  SA-pretreated ugt74f2 leaves. The SAG formation was a result of the UGT74F1  activity. This work demonstrates that changes in the activity of either SAGT  enzyme can have a dramatic effect on the metabolism of exogenously supplied SA in  Arabidopsis.', '2008 Apr', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.01041.x', 'Delaney']
