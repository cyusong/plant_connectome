Cotton fiber is an important natural resource for textile industry and an excellent model for cell biology study. Application of glabrous mutant cotton and high-throughput sequencing facilitates the identification of key genes and pathways for fiber development and cell differentiation and elongation. LncRNA is a type of ncRNA with more than 200 nt in length and functions in the ways of chromatin modification, transcriptional and post-transcriptional modification, and so on. However, the detailed lncRNA and associated mechanisms for fiber initiation are still unclear in cotton. In this study, we used a novel glabrous mutant ZM24fl, which is endowed with higher somatic embryogenesis, and functions as an ideal receptor for cotton genetic transformation. Combined with the high-throughput sequencing, fatty acid pathway and some transcription factors such as MYB, ERF and bHLH families were identified the important roles in fiber initiation; furthermore, 3,288 lncRNAs were identified, and some differentially expressed lncRNAs were also analyzed. From the comparisons of ZM24_0 DPA vs ZM24_-2 DPA and fl_0 DPA vs ZM24_0 DPA, one common lncRNA MSTRG 2723.1 was found that function upstream of fatty acid metabolism, MBY25-mediating pathway, and pectin metabolism to regulate fiber initiation. In addition, other lncRNAs MSTRG 3390.1, MSTRG 48719.1, and MSTRG 31176.1 were also showed potential important roles in fiber development; and the co-expression analysis between lncRNAs and targets showed the distinct models of different lncRNAs and complicated interaction between lncRNAs in fiber development of cotton. From the above results, a key lncRNA MSTRG 2723.1 was identified that might mediate some key genes transcription of fatty acid metabolism, MYB25-mediating pathway, and pectin metabolism to regulate fiber initiation of ZM24 cultivar. Co-expression analysis implied that some other important lncRNAs (e.g., MSTRG 3390.1, MSTRG 48719.1, and MSTRG 31176.1) were also showed the different regulatory model and interaction between them, which proposes some valuable clues for the lncRNAs associated mechanisms in fiber development.
