157 known and 55 novel miRNAs were found in sweet cherry fruit. MiRNA target genes involved in fruit ripening and the differentially expressed miRNAs under CO<sub>2</sub> treatment were identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs and play important functions in many biological processes, including fruit ripening and senescence. In the current study, the high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics methods were implemented to decipher the miRNAs landscape in sweet cherry fruit. A total of 157 known miRNAs belonging to 50 families and 55 putative novel miRNAs were found. Target genes of the miRNAs were predicted and genes involved in fruit ripening were found, including F-box proteins and TFs such as SPL, TCP, NAC, MYB, ARF and AP2/ERF. And these target genes were further confirmed by degradome sequencing. A regulatory network model was constructed to uncover the miRNAs and their targets involved in fruit ripening and senescence. Importantly, elevated carbon dioxide can significantly postpone the ripening and senescence of sweet cherry fruit and the differentially expressed miRNAs exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> were identified. These miRNAs included miR482j, miR6275, miR164, miR166, miR171, miR393, miR858, miR3627a, miR6284, miR6289 and miR7122b, and some of their functions were linked to fruit ripening. This study was the first report to profile miRNAs in sweet cherry fruit and it would provide more information for further study of miRNA roles in the ripening processes and their regulation mechanism underlying the effects of high carbon dioxide treatment on fruit ripening.
