We measured leaf water relations and leaf structural traits of 20 species from three communities growing along a topographical gradient. Our aim was to assess variation in seasonal responses in leaf water status and leaf tissue physiology between sites and among species in response to summer water deficit. Species from a ridge-top heath community showed the greatest reductions in pre-dawn leaf water potentials (Psi(leaf)) and stomatal conductance during summer; species from a valley-floor woodland and a midslope mallee community showed less reductions in these parameters. Heath species also displayed greater seasonal reduction in turgor-loss point (Psi(TLP)) than species from woodland or mallee communities. In general, species that had larger reductions in Psi(leaf) during summer showed significant shifts in either their osmotic potential at full turgor (Psi(pi 100); osmotic adjustment) or in tissue elasticity (epsilon(max)). Psi(pi 100) and epsilon(max) were negatively correlated, during both spring and summer, suggesting a trade-off between these different mechanisms to cope with water stress. Specific leaf area varied greatly among species, and was significantly correlated with seasonal changes in Psi(TLP) and pre-dawn Psi(leaf). These correlations suggest that leaf structure is a prerequisite for cellular mechanisms to be effective in adjusting to water deficit.
