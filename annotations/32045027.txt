Flooding causes oxygen deprivation in soils. Plants adapt to low soil oxygen availability by changes in root morphology, anatomy, and architecture to maintain root system functioning. Essential traits include aerenchyma formation, a barrier to radial oxygen loss, and outgrowth of adventitious roots into the soil or the floodwater. We highlight recent findings of mechanisms of constitutive aerenchyma formation and of changes in root architecture. Moreover, we use modelling of internal aeration to demonstrate the beneficial effect of increasing cortex-to-stele ratio on sustaining root growth in waterlogged soils. We know the genes for some of the beneficial traits, and the next step is to manipulate these genes in breeding in order to enhance the flood tolerance of our crops.
