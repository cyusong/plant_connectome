MEM1 participates in ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation pathway, and acts functionally as ROS3 to counteract the effects of RdDM pathway.mem1mutation leads to large numbers of hyper-DMRs inArabidopsisgenome. In higher plants, DNA methylation performs important functions in silencing transcribed genes and transposable elements (TEs). Active DNA demethylation mediated by REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1) is able to antagonize the action of DNA methylation caused by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, which plays critical roles in keeping DNA methylation at a proper level. In this study, a new mutant named mem1 (for methylation elevated mutant 1) was isolated from a genetic screen of T-DNA insertional mutant population for lines with elevated DNA methylation at a particular locus through Chop-PCR method. MEM1 possesses a Zf-C3HC domain, and is localized in nucleus as well as highly expressed in cotyledons. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data showed that knockout mutation of MEM1 leads to 4519 CG, 1793 CHG and 12739 CHH hyper-DMRs (for differentially methylated regions). Further analysis indicated that there are 2751, 2216 and 2042 overlapped CG hyper-DMRs between mem1-1and three mutants, i.e. ros1-4, rdd and ros3-2, respectively; 797, 2514, and 6766 overlapped CHH hyper-DMRs were observed between mem1-1 and three such mutants, respectively; mem1 nrpd1-3 and mem1 rdm1 double mutants showed nearly complete or partial loss of hypermethylation at 4 tested loci, suggesting that MEM1 performs similar functions as DNA glycosylase/lyases in counteracting excessive DNA methylation, and MEM1 plays important roles as REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 3 (ROS3) in erasing CHH methylation caused by the RdDM pathway. Together, these data demonstrate the involvement of MEM1 in ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation pathway and functional connections between MEM1 and ROS3.
