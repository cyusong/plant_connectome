Floral transition is an important process in plant development, which is regulated by at least four flowering pathways: the photoperiod, vernalization, autonomous, and gibberellin (GA)-dependent pathways. The DnaJ-like zinc finger domain-containing protein ORANGE (OR) was originally cloned from the cauliflower or mutant, which has distinct phenotypes of the carotenoid-accumulating curd, the elongated petioles, and the delayed-flowering time. OR has been demonstrated to interact with phytoene synthase for carotenoid biosynthesis in plastids and with eukaryotic release factor 1-2 (eRF1-2) in the nucleus for the first two phenotypes, respectively. In this study, we showed that overexpression of OR in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in a delayed-flowering phenotype resembling the cauliflower or mutant. Our results indicated that OR negatively regulates the expression of the flowering integrator genes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1). Both GA<sub>3</sub> and vernalization treatments could not rescue the delayed-flowering phenotype of the OR-overexpressing seedlings, suggesting the repression of floral transition by OR does not depend on SOC1-mediated vernalization or GA-dependent pathways. Moreover, our analysis revealed that transcripts of OR and FT fluctuated in opposite directions diurnally, and the overexpression of OR repressed the accumulation of CONSTANS (CO), FT, and SOC1 transcripts in a 16 h/8 h light/dark long-day cycle. Our results indicated the possibility that OR represses flowering through the CO-FT-SOC1-mediated photoperiodic flowering pathway.
