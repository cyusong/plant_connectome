Variegated plants provide a valuable tool for studying chloroplast biogenesis by allowing direct comparison between green and white/yellow sectors within the same leaf. While variegated plants are abundant in nature, the mechanism of leaf variegation remains largely unknown. Current studies are limited to a few mutants in model plant species, and are complicated by the potential for cross-contamination during dissection of leaf tissue into contrasting sectors. To overcome these obstacles, an alternative approach was explored using tissue-culture techniques to regenerate plantlets from unique sectors. Stable green and pale yellow plants were developed from a naturally variegated Epipremnum aureum 'Golden Pothos'. By comparing the gene expression between green and pale yellow plants using suppression subtractive hybridization in conjunction with homologous sequence search, nine down-regulated and 18 up-regulated genes were identified in pale yellow plants. Transcript abundance for EaZIP (Epipremnum aureum leucine zipper), a nuclear gene homologue of tobacco NTZIP and Arabidopsis CHL27, was reduced more than 4000-fold in qRT-PCR analysis. EaZIP encodes the Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase, one of the key enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. Examination of EaZIP expression in naturally variegated 'Golden Pothos' confirmed that EaZIP transcript levels were correlated with leaf chlorophyll contents, suggesting that this gene plays a major role in the loss of chlorophyll in the pale yellow sectors of E. aureum 'Golden Pothos'. This study further suggests that tissue-culture regeneration of plantlets from different coloured sectors of variegated leaves can be used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of variegation.
