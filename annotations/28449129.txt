Arundo donax has been identified as an important biomass and biofuel crop. Yet, there has been little research on photosynthetic and metabolic traits, which sustain the high productivity of A. donax under drought conditions. This study determined phenotypic differences between two A. donax ecotypes coming from stands with contrasting adaptation to dry climate. We hypothesized that the Bulgarian (BG) ecotype, adapted to drier conditions, exhibits greater drought tolerance than the Italian (IT) ecotype, adapted to a more mesic environment. Under well-watered conditions the BG ecotype was characterized by higher photosynthesis, mesophyll conductance, intrinsic water use efficiency, PSII efficiency, isoprene emission rate and carotenoids, whereas the IT ecotype showed higher levels of hydroxycinnamates. Photosynthesis of water-stressed plants was mainly limited by diffusional resistance to CO2 in BG, and by biochemistry in IT. Recovery of photosynthesis was more rapid and complete in BG than in IT, which may indicate better stability of the photosynthetic apparatus associated to enhanced induction of volatile and non-volatile isoprenoids and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study shows that a large phenotypic plasticity among A. donax ecotypes exists, and may be exploited to compensate for the low genetic variability of this species when selecting plant productivity in constrained environments.
