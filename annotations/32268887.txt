Podosphaera aphanis, a predominately biotrophic fungal pathogen, causes significant yield losses of strawberry. China is the largest strawberry producer in the world, and selecting for powdery mildew-resistant cultivars is desirable. However, the resistance mechanism against P. aphanis in the octoploid strawberry remains unclear. To understand possible mechanisms of disease resistance, we inoculated strawberry leaves with P. aphanis, and examined the expression profiles of candidate genes and the biochemical phenotypes in strawberry leaves of two groups. The unigenes obtained from ddH<sub>2</sub>O- and SA-pretreated leaves resulted in a total of 48,020 and 45,896 genes, respectively. KEGG enrichment showed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were enriched to a noticeable extent. DEG analysis showed that key TFs genes associated with the SA signaling pathway could play important role in the strawberry-P. aphanis interaction. In particular, FaWRKY70, FaJAZ1 and FaMYC2-like, involved in regulating the antagonistic effect of SA and JA signaling pathway, leading to increased expression of SA-responsive genes (in particular PR1, PR2, PR3, and PR5) compared to a decline in expression of JA-responsive genes (FaJAR1, FaAOS, and FaLOX2). Furthermore, SA pretreatment induced accumulation of PAs by activating the MBW complex and inhibit powdery mildew growth. This study describes the role of the proanthocyanidins (PAs), pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, SA, and transcription factors in regulatory model against P. aphanis, which coincided with an early activation of defense, leading to the accumulation of PAs and the PR proteins.
