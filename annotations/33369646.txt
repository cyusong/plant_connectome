Post-embryonic organogenesis has uniquely equipped plants to become developmentally responsive to their environment, affording opportunities to remodel organism growth and architecture to an extent not possible in other higher order eukaryotes. It is this developmental plasticity that makes the field of plant-microbe interactions an exceptionally fascinating venue in which to study symbiosis. This review article describes the various ways in which mutualistic microbes alter the growth, development, and architecture of the roots of their plant hosts. We first summarize general knowledge of root development, and then examine how association of plants with beneficial microbes affects these processes. Working our way inwards from the epidermis to the pericycle, this review dissects the cell biology and molecular mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions in a tissue-specific manner. We examine the ways in which microbes gain entry into the root, and modify this specialized organ for symbiont accommodation, with a particular emphasis on the colonization of root cortical cells. We present significant advances in our understanding of root-microbe interactions, and conclude our discussion by identifying questions pertinent to root endosymbiosis that at present remain unresolved.
