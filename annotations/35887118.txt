Poor grain filling of inferior spikelets, especially in some large-panicle rice varieties, is becoming a major limitation in breaking the ceiling of rice production. In our previous studies, we proved that post-anthesis moderate soil drying (MD) was an effective way to promote starch synthesis and inferior grain filling. As one of the most important regulatory processes in response to environmental cues and at different developmental stages, the function of alternative splicing (AS) has not yet been revealed in regulating grain filling under MD conditions. In this study, AS events at the most active grain-filling stage were identified in inferior spikelets under well-watered control (CK) and MD treatments. Of 16,089 AS events, 1840 AS events involving 1392 genes occurred differentially between the CK and MD treatments, many of which function on spliceosome, ncRNA metabolic process, starch, and sucrose metabolism, and other functions. Some of the splicing factors and starch synthesis-related genes, such as SR protein, hnRNP protein, <i>Os</i>AG<i>PL2</i>, <i>OsAPS2</i>, <i>OsSSIVa, OsSSIVb</i>, <i>OsGBSSII</i>, and <i>OsISA1</i> showed differential AS changes under MD treatment. The expression of miR439f and miR444b was reduced due to an AS event which occurred in the intron where miRNAs were located in the MD-treated inferior spikelets. On the contrary, <i>Os</i>AG<i>PL2</i>, an AGPase encoding gene, was alternatively spliced, resulting in different transcripts with or without the miR393b binding site, suggesting a potential mechanism for miRNA-mediated gene regulation on grain filling of inferior spikelets in response to MD treatment. This study provides some new insights into the function of AS on the MD-promoted grain filling of inferior spikelets, and potential application in agriculture to increase rice yields by genetic approaches.
