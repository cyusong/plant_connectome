Net blotches caused by <i>Pyrenophora teres</i> are important foliar fungal diseases of barley and result in significant yield losses of up to 40%. The two types of net blotch, net-form net blotch and spot-form net blotch, are caused by <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>teres</i> (<i>Ptt</i>) and <i>P. teres</i> f. <i>maculata</i> (<i>Ptm</i>), respectively. This study is the first to use a cross between <i>Ptt</i> and <i>Ptm</i> to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with virulence and leaf symptoms. A genetic map consisting of 1,965 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers was constructed using 351 progenies of the <i>Ptt/Ptm</i> cross. Eight barley cultivars showing differential reactions to the parental isolates were used to phenotype the hybrid progeny isolates. Five QTL associated with virulence and four QTL associated with leaf symptoms were identified across five linkage groups. Phenotypic variation explained by these QTL ranged from 6 to 16%. Further phenotyping of selected progeny isolates on 12 more barley cultivars revealed that three progeny isolates are moderately to highly virulent across these cultivars. The results of this study suggest that accumulation of QTL in hybrid isolates can result in enhanced virulence.
