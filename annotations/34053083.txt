Characterising the processes that control auxin dynamics is essential to understanding how auxin regulates plant development. Over recent years, several studies have investigated auxin diffusion through plasmodesmata, characterising this cell-to-cell diffusion and demonstrating that it affects auxin distributions. Furthermore, studies have shown that plasmodesmatal auxin diffusion affects developmental processes, including phototropism, lateral root emergence and leaf hyponasty. This short Tansley Insight review describes how these studies have contributed to our understanding of auxin dynamics and discusses potential future directions in this area.
