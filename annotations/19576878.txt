['19576878', 'Plant floral transition is a major developmental switch regulated by an  integrated network of pathways. Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS K (FLK), a protein  with three KH RNA-binding domains, operates in the autonomous flowering-promotive  pathway by decreasing the transcript levels of the key flowering repressor  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Here we report that PEPPER (PEP), an FLK paralog  previously shown to affect vegetative and pistil development, antagonizes FLK by  positively regulating FLC. Lack of PEP function rescues the flk late-flowering  phenotype with a concomitant decrease in FLC RNA levels. Loss of HUA2, another  FLC activator encoding an RNA-binding protein, further rescues flk, being flk  hua2 pep triple mutants virtually wild-type regarding flowering time.  Consistently, PEP overexpression determines high levels of FLC transcripts and  flowering delay. Genetic and molecular analyses indicate that FLK and PEP act  independently of FCA, another important FLC repressor in the autonomous pathway.  In addition, we present data suggesting that PEP may affect FLC expression at  both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Overall, our results  uncover PEP as a new factor for FLC upregulation, underscoring the importance of  RNA-binding activities during developmental timing of flowering.', '2009 Sep 15', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.06.035', 'Vera']
