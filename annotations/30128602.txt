Gentian plants ( Gentiana triflora ) severely restrict apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) invasion to the gametes (pollens and ovules) and block seed transmission to progeny plants. Early flowering of horticultural plants can be induced by infection of ALSV vector expressing Flowering Locus T (FT) gene. In the present study, flowering of gentian plants was induced by infection with an ALSV vector expressing a gentian FT gene and the patterns of seed transmission of ALSV in gentian were compared with those in apple and Nicotiana benthamiana. Infection of gentian progeny plants with ALSV was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ALSV was not transmitted to the progeny gentian plants, whereas small proportions of apple and N. benthamiana progeny plants are infected with ALSV. The in situ hybridization analyses indicated that ALSVs are not present in gentian pollen and ovules, but detected in most of gametes in apple and N. benthamiana. Collectively, these results suggest that seed transmission of ALSV is blocked in gentian plants through the unknown barriers present in their gametes. On the other hand, apple and N. benthamiana seem to minimize ALSV seed transmission by inhibiting viral propagation in embryos.
