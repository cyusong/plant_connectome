Changes in plant auxin levels can be perceived and converted into cellular responses by auxin signal transduction. AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins are auxin transcriptional inhibitors that play important roles in regulating auxin signal transduction. The stability of Aux/IAA proteins is important for transcription initiation and downstream auxin-related gene expression. Here, we report that the Aux/IAA protein IAA17 interacts with the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase METHYL METHANESULFONATE-SENSITIVE 21 (AtMMS21) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). AtMMS21 regulated the SUMOylation of IAA17 at the K41 site. Notably, root length was suppressed in plants overexpressing IAA17, whereas the roots of K41-mutated IAA17 transgenic plants were not significantly different from wild-type roots. Biochemical data indicated that K41-mutated IAA17 or IAA17 in the AtMMS21 knockout mutant was more likely to be degraded compared with nonmutated IAA17 in wild-type plants. In conclusion, our data revealed a role for SUMOylation in the maintenance of IAA17 protein stability, which contributes to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of auxin signaling.
