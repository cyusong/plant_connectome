<i>Triphysaria</i> is a facultative parasitic plant in the Orobanchaceae that parasitizes the roots of a wide range of host plants including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, <i>Medicago</i>, rice and maize. The important exception to this broad host range is that <i>Triphysaria</i> rarely parasitize other <i>Triphysaria</i>. We explored self and kin recognition in <i>Triphysaria versicolor</i> and showed that exudates collected from roots of host species, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, induced haustorium development when applied to the roots of <i>Triphysaria</i> seedlings <i>in vitro</i> while those collected from <i>Triphysaria</i> did not. In mixed exudate experiments, <i>Triphysaria</i> exudates did not inhibit the haustorium-inducing activity of those from host roots. Interestingly, when roots of <i>Triphysari</i>a seedlings were treated with either horseradish peroxidase or fungal laccase, the extracts showed haustorium-inducing factor (HIF) activity, suggesting that <i>Triphysaria</i> roots contain the proper substrates for producing HIFs. Transgenic Triphysaria roots overexpressing a fungal laccase gene <i>TvLCC1</i> showed an increased responsiveness to a known HIF, 2,6-dimethoxy benzoquinone (DMBQ), in developing haustoria. Our results indicate kin recognition in <i>Triphysaria</i> is associated with the lack of active HIFs in root exudates. Treatment of <i>Triphysaria</i> roots with enzymatic oxidases activates or releases molecules that are HIFs. This study shows that exogenously applied oxidases can activate HIFs in <i>Triphysaria</i> roots that had no previous HIF activity. Further studies are necessary to determine if differential oxidase activities in host and parasite roots account for the kin recognition in haustorium development.
