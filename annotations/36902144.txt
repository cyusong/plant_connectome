Drought is a major environmental threat that limits crop growth, development, and productivity worldwide. Improving drought resistance with genetic engineering methods is necessary to tackle global climate change. It is well known that NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) transcription factors play a critical role in coping with drought stress in plants. In this study, we identified an NAC transcription factor ZmNAC20, which regulates drought stress response in maize. <i>ZmNAC20</i> expression was rapidly upregulated by drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Under drought conditions, the <i>ZmNAC20</i>-overexpressing plants had higher relative water content and survival rate than the wild-type maize inbred B104, suggesting that overexpression of <i>ZmNAC20</i> improved drought resistance in maize. The detached leaves of <i>ZmNAC20</i>-overexpressing plants lost less water than those of wild-type B104 after dehydration. Overexpression of <i>ZmNAC20</i> promoted stomatal closure in response to ABA. ZmNAC20 was localized in the nucleus and regulated the expression of many genes involved in drought stress response using RNA-Seq analysis. The study indicated that ZmNAC20 improved drought resistance by promoting stomatal closure and activating the expression of stress-responsible genes in maize. Our findings provide a valuable gene and new clues on improving crop drought resistance.
