In nature, plants interact with numerous beneficial or pathogenic soil-borne microorganisms. Plants have developed various defense strategies to expel pathogenic microbes, some of which function soon after pathogen infection. We used <i>Medicago truncatula</i> and its oomycete pathogen <i>Aphanomyces euteiches</i> to elucidate early responses of the infected root. <i>A. euteiches</i> causes root rot disease in legumes and is a limiting factor in legume production. Transcript profiling of seedlings and adult plant roots inoculated with <i>A. euteiches</i> zoospores for 2 h revealed specific upregulation of a gene encoding a putative sesquiterpene synthase (<i>M. truncatula</i> TERPENE SYNTHASE 10 [MtTPS10]) in both developmental stages. <i>MtTPS10</i> was specifically expressed in roots upon oomycete infection. Heterologous expression of <i>MtTPS10</i> in yeast led to production of a blend of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene alcohols, with NMR identifying a major peak corresponding to himalachol. Moreover, plants carrying a tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) retrotransposon <i>Tnt1</i> insertion in <i>MtTPS10</i> lacked the emission of sesquiterpenes upon <i>A. euteiches</i> infection, supporting the assumption that the identified gene encodes a multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase. <i>Mttps10</i> plants and plants with reduced <i>MtTPS10</i> transcript levels created by expression of an <i>MtTPS10</i>-artificial microRNA in roots were more susceptible to <i>A. euteiches</i> infection than were the corresponding wild-type plants and roots transformed with the empty vector, respectively. Sesquiterpenes produced by expression of <i>MtTPS10</i> in yeast also inhibited mycelial growth and <i>A. euteiches</i> zoospore germination. These data suggest that sesquiterpene production in roots by MtTPS10 plays a previously unrecognized role in the defense response of <i>M. truncatula</i> against <i>A. euteiches</i>.
