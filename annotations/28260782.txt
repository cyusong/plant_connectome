O-acetylation, a ubiquitous modification of cell wall polymers, has striking impacts on plant growth and biomass utilization and needs to be tightly controlled. However, the mechanisms that underpin the control of cell wall acetylation remain elusive. Here, we show a rice brittle leaf sheath1 (bs1) mutant, which contains a lesion in a Golgi-localized GDSL esterase that deacetylates the prominent hemicellulose xylan. Cell wall composition, detailed xylan structure characterization and enzyme kinetics and activity assays on acetylated sugars and xylooligosaccharides demonstrate that BS1 is an esterase that cleaves acetyl moieties from the xylan backbone at O-2 and O-3 positions of xylopyranosyl residues. BS1 thus plays an important role in the maintenance of proper acetylation level on the xylan backbone, which is crucial for secondary wall formation and patterning. Our findings outline a mechanism for how plants modulate wall acetylation and endow a plethora of uncharacterized GDSL esterases with surmisable activities.
