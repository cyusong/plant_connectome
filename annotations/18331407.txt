We studied how mitochondria-nuclear interactions may give rise to cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in stem mustard exhibiting abnormal microsporogenesis. In this system, expression of SPL-like, the counterpart of the Arabidopsis nuclear gene SPOROCYTELESS, is specifically lost in buds of CMS plants. When mitochondrial-specific inhibitors were applied to wild-type fertile stem mustard plants, expression of SPL-like was repressed to some extent. As a consequence, the shape and vigor of pollen grains were severely affected, whereas the fertility of pistils remained unaltered. Thereby, we suggest that a probable pathway responsible for CMS in stem mustard involves mitochondrial retrograde regulation, with SPL-like as a target nuclear gene for a mitochondrial signal.
