['20478994', 'Natural cis-antisense siRNAs (cis-nat-siRNAs) are a recently characterized class  of small regulatory RNAs that are widespread in eukaryotes. Despite their  abundance, the importance of their regulatory activity is largely unknown. The  only functional role for eukaryotic cis-nat-siRNAs that has been described to  date is in environmental stress responses in plants. Here we demonstrate that  cis-nat-siRNA-based regulation plays key roles in Arabidopsis reproductive  function, as it facilitates gametophyte formation and double fertilization, a  developmental process of enormous agricultural value. We show that male  gametophytic kokopelli (kpl) mutants display frequent single-fertilization  events, and that KPL and a inversely transcribed gene, ARIADNE14 (ARI14), which  encodes a putative ubiquitin E3 ligase, generate a sperm-specific nat-siRNA pair.  In the absence of KPL, ARI14 RNA levels in sperm are increased and fertilization  is impaired. Furthermore, ARI14 transcripts accumulate in several siRNA  biogenesis pathway mutants, and overexpression of ARI14 in sperm phenocopies the  reduced seed set of the kokopelli mutants. These results extend the regulatory  capacity of cis-nat-siRNAs to development by identifying a role for  cis-nat-siRNAs in controlling sperm function during double fertilization.', '2010 May 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1882810', 'McCormick']
