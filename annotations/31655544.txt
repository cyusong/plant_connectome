The identification and characterisation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is an important step towards identifying functional sequences underpinning important crop traits and for developing accurate markers for selective breeding strategies. In this study, a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach detected QTL conditioning desirable fruit quality traits in papaya. For this, a linkage map was constructed comprising 219 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci across 10 linkage groups and covering 509 centiMorgan (cM). In total, 21 QTLs were identified for seven key fruit quality traits, including flesh sweetness, fruit weight, fruit length, fruit width skin freckle, flesh thickness and fruit firmness. Several QTL for flesh sweetness, fruit weight, length, width and firmness were stable across harvest years and individually explained up to 19.8% of the phenotypic variance of a particular trait. Where possible, candidate genes were proposed and explored further for their application to marker-assisted breeding. This study has extended knowledge on the inheritance and genetic control for key papaya physiological and fruit quality traits. Candidate genes together with associated SNP markers represent a valuable resource for the future of strategic selective breeding of elite Australian papaya cultivars.
