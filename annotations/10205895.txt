['10205895', "The yeast HAL2 gene encodes a lithium- and sodium-sensitive phosphatase that  hydrolyses 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (PAP). Salt toxicity in yeast results  from Hal2 inhibition and accumulation of PAP, which inhibits sulphate  assimilation and RNA processing. We have investigated whether the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana contains sodium-sensitive PAP phosphatases. The Arabidopsis  HAL2-like gene family is composed of three members: AtAHL and AtSAL2,  characterized in the present work, and the previously identified AtSAL1. The  AtAHL and AtSAL2 cDNAs complement the auxotrophy for methionine of the yeast hal2  mutant and the recombinant proteins catalyse the conversion of PAP to AMP in a  Mg(2+)-dependent reaction sensitive to inhibition by Ca2+ and Li+. The PAP  phosphatase activity of AtAHL is sensitive to physiological concentrations of  Na+, whereas the activities of AtSAL1 and AtSAL2 are not. Another important  difference is that AtAHL is very specific for PAP while AtSAL1 and AtSAL2 also  act as inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatases. AtAHL constitutes a novel type of  sodium-sensitive PAP phosphatase which could act co-ordinately with plant  sulphotransferases and serve as target of salt toxicity in plants.", '1999 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00385.x', 'Rodriguez']
