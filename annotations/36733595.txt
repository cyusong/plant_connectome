As the largest plant receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) superfamily, the 21 leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) family are involved in plant 22 growth, development, and stress responses. However, the functions of LRR-RLKs in 23 wheat immunity remain unknown. In the current study, 929 LRR-RLKs were identified in <i>Triticum aestivum</i> 25 genome database using the BLAST and hidden Markov models (HMM) approach and 26 divided into 14 clades. Chromosomal localization and synteny analysis revealed that 27 <i>TaLRR-RLKs</i> were randomly distributed on all chromosomes with 921 collinear 28 events. Through the cis-acting elements analysis, we observed that <i>TaLRR-RLKs</i> 29 participated in hormone response, light response, development, metabolism, and 30 response to environmental stress. The transcript level of 14 random selected 31 <i>TaLRR-RLKs</i> from each subfamily was regulated by plant hormone treatment and 32 Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) infection. The function of <i>TaLRR-RLKs</i> in 33 wheat resistance to CWMV infection was further investigated by virus-induced gene 34 silencing assay. Additionally, the accumulation of MeJA response genes, as well as 35 CWMV RNA were not changed in the <i>TaLRR-RLK</i> silencing plants under MeJA 36 treatment. Our results demonstrated that TaLRR-RLKs play an important role in 38 wheat resistance to viral infection <i>via</i> hormone signals and lay the groundwork for the 39 functional study of TaLRR-RLKs in wheat.
