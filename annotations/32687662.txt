The pollen and pistil RALF peptides, along with multiple receptor-like kinases and leucine-rich repeat extensins, regulate pollen tube growth and the final burst within the ovule, where sperm cells are released for fertilisation to occur. This review introduces some new questions that arose about the regulation of this complex process.

RALF peptides: !regulate! pollen tube growth
receptor-like kinases: !regulate! pollen tube growth
leucine-rich repeat extensins: !regulate! pollen tube growth
pollen and pistil RALF peptides: !release! sperm cells
