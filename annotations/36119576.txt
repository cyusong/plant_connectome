Growth traits, such as fresh weight, diameter, and leaf area, are pivotal indicators of growth status and the basis for the quality evaluation of lettuce. The time-consuming, laborious and inefficient method of manually measuring the traits of lettuce is still the mainstream. In this study, a three-stage multi-branch self-correcting trait estimation network (TMSCNet) for RGB and depth images of lettuce was proposed. The TMSCNet consisted of five models, of which two master models were used to preliminarily estimate the fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), height (H), diameter (D), and leaf area (LA) of lettuce, and three auxiliary models realized the automatic correction of the preliminary estimation results. To compare the performance, typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) widely adopted in botany research were used. The results showed that the estimated values of the TMSCNet fitted the measurements well, with coefficient of determination (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>) values of 0.9514, 0.9696, 0.9129, 0.8481, and 0.9495, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values of 15.63, 11.80, 11.40, 10.18, and 14.65% and normalized mean squared error (NMSE) value of 0.0826, which was superior to compared methods. Compared with previous studies on the estimation of lettuce traits, the performance of the TMSCNet was still better. The proposed method not only fully considered the correlation between different traits and designed a novel self-correcting structure based on this but also studied more lettuce traits than previous studies. The results indicated that the TMSCNet is an effective method to estimate the lettuce traits and will be extended to the high-throughput situation.
