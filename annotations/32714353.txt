Nitro-fatty acids (NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs) are novel molecules resulting from the interaction of unsaturated fatty acids and nitric oxide (NO) or NO-related molecules. In plants, it has recently been described that NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs trigger an antioxidant and a defence response against stressful situations. Among the properties of NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs highlight the ability to release NO therefore modulating specific protein targets through post-translational modifications (NO-PTMs). Thus, based on the capacity of NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs to act as physiological NO donors and using high-accuracy mass-spectrometric approaches, herein, we show that endogenous nitro-linolenic acid (NO<sub>2</sub>-Ln) can modulate <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The incubation of NO<sub>2</sub>-Ln with GSH was analyzed by LC-MS/MS and the <i>in vitro</i> synthesis of GSNO was noted. The <i>in vivo</i> confirmation of this behavior was carried out by incubating <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled NO<sub>2</sub>-Ln throughout the roots, and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled GSNO (GS<sup>15</sup>NO) was detected in the leaves. With the aim to go in depth in the relation of NO<sub>2</sub>-FA and GSNO in plants, <i>Arabidopsis</i> alkenal reductase mutants (<i>aer</i> mutants) which modulate NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs levels were used. Our results constitute the first evidence of the modulation of a key NO biological reservoir in plants (GSNO) by these novel NO<sub>2</sub>-FAs, increasing knowledge about <i>S</i>-nitrosothiols and GSNO-signaling pathways in plants.
