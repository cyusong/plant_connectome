Verticillium longisporum is a soil-borne vascular pathogen found primarily on oilseed rape in Northern Europe. Infection of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana can be achieved under laboratory conditions. In the article related to this addendum, we have shown that Arabidopsis dde2-2 mutants that are compromised in their ability to synthesize the defense hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) are slightly more susceptible than wild-type. Contrary to the expectation that hormone biosynthesis mutants and their respective receptor mutants should have the same phenotype, we found that plants that lack the JA-Ile receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) are more tolerant to the disease. This addendum addressed the question whether the increased JA-Ile levels found in coi1 are responsible for its tolerance phenotype. Based on the evidence that the JA-Ile-deficient dde2-2 coi1-t double mutant is as tolerant as coi1-t, we conclude that increased JA-Ile levels do not protect Arabidopsis against the fungus in the absence of COI1.
