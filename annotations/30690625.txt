CO2-responsive CCT protein (CRCT) is suggested to be a positive regulator of starch biosynthesis in the leaf sheaths of rice, regulating the expression levels of starch biosynthesis-related genes. In this study, the effects of CRCT expression levels on the expression of starch biosynthesis-related enzymes and the quality of starch were studied. Using native-PAGE/activity staining and immunoblotting, we found that the protein levels of starch synthase I, branching enzyme I, branching enzyme IIa, isoamylase 1 and phosphorylase 1 were largely correlated with the CRCT expression levels in the leaf sheaths of CRCT transgenic lines. In contrast, the CRCT expression levels largely did not affect the expression levels and/or activities of starch biosynthesis-related enzymes in the leaf blades and endosperm tissues. The analysis of the chain-length distribution of starch in the leaf sheaths showed that short chains with a degree of polymerization from 5 to 14 were increased in the overexpression lines but decreased in the knockdown lines. The amylose content of starch in the leaf sheath was greatly increased in the overexpression lines. In contrast, the molecular weight of the amylopectin of starch in the leaf sheath of overexpression lines did not change compared with those of the non-transgenic rice. These results suggest that CRCT can control the quality and the quantity of starch in the leaf sheath by regulating the expression of particular starch biosynthesis-related enzymes.
