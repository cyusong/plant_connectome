Among abiotic stresses, soil salinity is a major threat to agriculture. To address and control the effects of high salinity on plants, it is important to understand their responses to salt stress that disturbs the homeostatic equilibrium at cellular and molecular levels. To deal and control effects of high salinity on plants, it is important to understand their responses to salt stress that disturbs the homeostatic equilibrium at cellular and molecular levels. In this regard, halophytes (salt tolerant plants) can provide superior models for the study of salt stress defense parameters compared to glycophytes (salt sensitive species). TsHKT1;2 one of the 3 copies of HKT1 in the Arabidopsis relative halophyte, Thellungiella salsuginea acts as a potassium transporter, even under salt stress. TsHKT1;2 includes a conserved Asp (D) residue in the 2(nd) pore-loop domain. Most other HKT1 sequences, including AtHKT1, contain Asn (N) in this position. We found that athkt1-1 plants complemented by TsHKT1;2 under native AtHKT1 promoter were more tolerant to salt stress, while substitution of Asp (D207) by Asn (N) significantly reduced resistance to salinity. We suggest that the presence of Asn or Asp is the essential feature that defines and establishes cation selectivity in dicot HKT1-type transporters.
