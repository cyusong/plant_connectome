['17674032', 'Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are a class of enzymes that  mediate the construction and restructure of the cellulose/xyloglucan framework by  splitting and reconnecting xyloglucan molecule cross-linking among cellulose  microfibrils. Remodification of cellulose microfibrils within cell-wall matrices  is realized to be one of the most critical steps in the regulation of cells  expansion in plants. Thirty-three XTH genes have been found in Arabidopsis  thaliana but their roles remain unclear. AtXTH21 (At2g18800), an Arabidopsis XTH  gene that mainly expresses in root and flower, exhibits different expression  profiles from other XTH members under hormone treatment. We examined  loss-of-function mutants using T-DNA insertion lines and overexpression lines and  found that the AtXTH21 gene played a principal role in the growth of the primary  roots by altering the deposition of cellulose and the elongation of cell wall.', '2007 Nov', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-007-0591-2', 'Lu']
