Plant expansins are structural cell wall-loosening proteins implicated in several developmental processes and responses to environmental constraints and pathogen infection. To date, there is limited information about the biological function of expansins-like B (EXLBs), one of the smallest and less-studied subfamilies of plant expansins. In the present study, we conducted a functional analysis of the wild Arachis AdEXLB8 gene in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants to clarify its putative role in mediating defense responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. First, its cell wall localization was confirmed in plants expressing an AdEXLB8:eGFP fusion protein, while nanomechanical assays indicated cell wall reorganization and reassembly due to AdEXLB8 overexpression without compromising the phenotype. We further demonstrated that AdEXLB8 increased tolerance not only to isolated abiotic (drought) and biotic (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Meloidogyne incognita) stresses but also to their combination. The jasmonate and abscisic acid signaling pathways were clearly favored in transgenic plants, showing an activated antioxidative defense system. In addition to modifications in the biomechanical properties of the cell wall, we propose that AdEXLB8 overexpression interferes with phytohormone dynamics leading to a defense primed state, which culminates in plant defense responses against isolated and combined abiotic and biotic stresses.
