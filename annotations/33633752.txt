The genus <i>Brassica</i> includes oil crops, vegetables, condiments, fodder crops, and ornamental plants. <i>Brassica</i> species underwent a whole genome triplication event after speciation between ancestral species of <i>Brassica</i> and closely related genera including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Diploid species such as <i>Brassica rapa</i> and <i>Brassica oleracea</i> have three copies of genes orthologous to each <i>A. thaliana</i> gene, although deletion in one or two of the three homologs has occurred in some genes. The floral transition is one of the crucial events in a plant's life history, and time of flowering is an important agricultural trait. There is a variation in flowering time within species of the genus <i>Brassica</i>, and this variation is largely dependent on a difference in vernalization requirements. In <i>Brassica</i>, like in <i>A. thaliana</i>, the key gene of vernalization is <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). In <i>Brassica</i> species, the vernalization response including the repression of <i>FLC</i> expression by cold treatment and the enrichment of the repressive histone modification tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the <i>FLC</i> locus is similar to <i>A. thaliana</i>. <i>B. rapa</i> and <i>B. oleracea</i> each have four paralogs of <i>FLC</i>, and the allotetraploid species, <i>Brassica napus</i>, has nine paralogs. The increased number of paralogs makes the role of <i>FLC</i> in vernalization more complicated; in a single plant, paralogs vary in the expression level of <i>FLC</i> before and after vernalization. There is also variation in <i>FLC</i> expression levels between accessions. In this review, we focus on the regulatory circuits of the vernalization response of <i>FLC</i> expression in the genus <i>Brassica</i>.
