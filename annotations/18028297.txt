The oomycete Phytophthora parasitica is a soilborne pathogen infecting numerous plants. The infection process includes an initial biotrophic stage, followed by a necrotrophic stage. The aim here was to identify genes that are involved in the late stages of infection. Using the host tomato and a transformed strain of P. parasitica expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), the various infection steps from recognition of the host to the colonization of plant tissues were studied. This late stage was selected to generate 4000 ESTs (expressed sequence tags), among which approx. 80% were from the pathogen. Comparison with an EST data set created previously from in vitro growth of P. parasitica allowed the identification of several genes, the expression of which might be regulated during late stages of infection. Changes in gene expression of several candidate genes predicted from in silico analysis were validated by quantitative RT-PCR experiments. These results give insights into the molecular bases of the necrotrophic stage of an oomycete pathogen.
