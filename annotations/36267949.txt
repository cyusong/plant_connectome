Horticultural plants such as vegetables, fruits, and ornamental plants are crucial to human life and socioeconomic development. Gibberellins (GAs), a class of diterpenoid compounds, control numerous developmental processes of plants. The roles of GAs in regulating growth and development of horticultural plants, and in regulating significant progress have been clarified. These findings have significant implications for promoting the quality and quantity of the products of horticultural plants. Here we review recent progress in determining the roles of GAs (including biosynthesis and signaling) in regulating plant stature, axillary meristem outgrowth, compound leaf development, flowering time, and parthenocarpy. These findings will provide a solid foundation for further improving the quality and quantity of horticultural plants products.
