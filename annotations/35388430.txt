Iron (Fe) uptake and translocation in plants are fine-tuned by complex mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. In Arabidopsis thaliana, local regulation of Fe homeostasis at the root level has been extensively studied and is better understood than the systemic shoot-to-root regulation. While the root system is solely a sink tissue that depends on photosynthates translocated from source tissues, the shoot system is a more complex tissue, where sink and source tissues occur synchronously. In this study, and to gain better insight into the Fe deficiency responses in leaves, we overexpressed Zinc/Iron-regulated transporter-like Protein (ZIP5), an Fe/Zn transporter, in phloem-loading cells (proSUC2::AtZIP5) and determined the timing of Fe deficiency responses in sink (young leaves and roots) and source tissues (leaves). Transgenic lines overexpressing ZIP5 in companion cells displayed increased sensitivity to Fe deficiency in root growth assays. Moreover, young leaves and roots (sink tissues) displayed either delayed or dampened transcriptional responses to Fe deficiency compared to wild-type (WT) plants. We also took advantage of the Arabidopsis mutant nas4x-1 to explore Fe transcriptional responses in the opposite scenario, where Fe is retained in the vasculature but in an unavailable and precipitated form. In contrast to proSUC2::AtZIP5 plants, nas4x-1 young leaves and roots displayed a robust and constitutive Fe deficiency response, while mature leaves showed a delayed and dampened Fe deficiency response compared to WT plants. Altogether, our data provide evidence suggesting that Fe sensing within leaves can also occur locally in a leaf-specific manner.
