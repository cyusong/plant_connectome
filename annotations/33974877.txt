Mitophagy is a selective garbage disposal pathway that rids cells of excess or damaged mitochondria. In this issue, Ma et al. uncover a role for Friendly in driving depolarisation-induced mitophagy in plants and highlight a physiological role for mitophagy during plant development.

Friendly: !drives! Mitophagy
Mitophagy: !rids cells of! Excess/Damaged mitochondria
Mitophagy: !has physiological role in! Plant development
