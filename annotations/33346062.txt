More than half of the calories consumed by humans are provided by three major cereal crops (rice, maize, and wheat). Orphan crops are usually well adapted to low-input agricultural conditions, and they not only play vital roles in local areas but can also contribute to food and nutritional needs worldwide. Interestingly, many wild relatives of orphan crops are important weeds of major crops. Although orphan crops and their wild relatives have received little attentions from researchers for many years, genomic studies have recently been performed on these plants. Here, we provide an overview of genomic studies on orphan crops, with a focus on orphan cereals and their wild relatives. The genomes of at least 12 orphan cereals and/or their wild relatives have been sequenced. In addition to genomic benefits for orphan crop breeding, we discuss the potential ways for mutual utilization of genomic data from major crops, orphan crops, and their wild relatives (including weeds) and provide perspectives on genetic improvement of both orphan and major crops (including de novo domestication of orphan crops) in the coming genomic era.

Orphan crops: !contribute to! Food and nutritional needs
Major crops: !have wild relatives! Important weeds
Orphan cereals: !have genomes sequenced! At least 12
Genomic data: !can be utilized! For mutual benefit
Genetic improvement: !possible for! Both orphan and major crops
