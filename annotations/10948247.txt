['10948247', 'The Arabidopsis MADS box transcription factor APETALA1 (AP1) was identified as a  substrate for farnesyltransferase and shown to be farnesylated efficiently both  in vitro and in vivo. AP1 regulates the transition from inflorescence shoot to  floral meristems and the development of sepals and petals. AP1 fused to green  fluorescent protein (GFP) retained transcription factor activity and directed the  expected terminal flower phenotype when ectopically expressed in transgenic  Arabidopsis. However, ap1mS, a farnesyl cysteine-acceptor mutant of AP1, as well  as the GFP-ap1mS fusion protein failed to direct the development of compound  terminal flowers but instead induced novel phenotypes when ectopically expressed  in Arabidopsis. Similarly, compound terminal flowers did not develop in era1-2  transformants that ectopically expressed AP1. Together, the results demonstrate  that AP1 is a target of farnesyltransferase and suggest that farnesylation alters  the function and perhaps specificity of the transcription factor.', '2000 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.8.1257', 'Gruissem']
