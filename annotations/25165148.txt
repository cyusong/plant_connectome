Jasmonate (JA) and ethylene (ET) are considered to be two essential plant hormones helping plants to tolerate infections by necrotrophic fungi. Phenotypic observations and marker gene expression analysis suggest that JA and ET act synergistically and interdependently in these defence responses. However, JA and ET also interact in an antagonistic way. JA represses ET-induced apical hook formation, while ET inhibits JA-controlled wounding responses. Although these physiological observations have been reported for more than a decade, only recently have the underlying molecular mechanisms been uncovered. Here, I review the recent advances in the understanding of these two hormone interactions and further discuss the biological significance of these apparently opposite interactions between these two hormones in orchestrating plant growth and development.
