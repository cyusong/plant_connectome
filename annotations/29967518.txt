In Supplementary Table 1 originally published with this Brief Communication, the authors gave an incorrect GPS easterly coordinate for tree number 12 (Makulu Makete Big baobab); the coordinate '2° 34.584' S, 25° 52.261' E' should have read '22° 34.584' S, 28° 52.261' E'. This has now been amended in the online Supplementary Information file for this Brief Communication.
