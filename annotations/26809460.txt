Salt stress is an important environmental condition limiting the agricultural production. The reprogram of protein expression is one of the strategies of plants to cope with salt stress. We have previously analyzed the photosynthesis, antioxidant and oxidative phosphorylation involved in the carbon metabolism and the redox metabolism in rice seedlings under salt stress. Here, we focused on the proteins involved in nitrogen metabolic response. As it was reported that the nitrite uptake was enhanced in Arabidopsis PII knock-out mutants, the down-regulation of P-II nitrogen sensing protein in rice probably contributes to the accumulation of amino acids under stress. In addition, the protein synthesis is limited by the decrease of related proteins, and more amino acids could be used as the compatible solute. Hence, our study indicates that the rearrangement of nitrogen metabolism under salt stress could accumulate more amino acids as the compatible solute rather than the components of proteins. This study provides information for an improved understanding of nitrogen metabolic response to salt stress in rice.
