Citrus canker is a destructive disease caused by <i>Xanthomonas citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i>, which affects all commercial sweet orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i> [L.] Osbeck) cultivars. Salicylic acid (SA) and systemic-acquired resistance (SAR) have been demonstrated to have a crucial role in mediating plant defense responses against this phytopathogen. To induce SAR, SA is converted to methyl salicylate (MeSA) by an SA-dependent methyltransferase (SAMT) and translocated systemically to prime noninfected distal tissues. Here, we generated sweet orange transgenic plants (based on cvs. Hamlin and Valencia) overexpressing the <i>SAMT</i> gene from <i>Citrus</i> (<i>CsSAMT</i>) and evaluated their resistance to citrus canker. We obtained four independent transgenic lines and confirmed their significantly higher MeSA volatilization compared to wild-type controls. Plants overexpressing <i>CsSAMT</i> showed reduced symptoms of citrus canker and bacterial populations in all transgenic lines without compromising plant development. One representative transgenic line (V44SAMT) was used to evaluate resistance response in primary and secondary sites. Without inoculation, V44SAMT modulated <i>CsSAMT</i>, <i>CsNPR1</i>, <i>CsNPR3</i>, and <i>CsWRKY22</i> expression, indicating that this plant is in a primed defense status. The results demonstrate that MeSA signaling prompts the plant to respond more efficiently to pathogen attacks and induces immune responses in transgenic plants at both primary and secondary infection sites.
