Rumex palustris (polygonceae) responds to complete submergence with enhanced elongation of its youngest petioles. This process requires the presence of gibberellin (GA) and is associated with an increase in the concentration of GA1 in elongating petioles. We have examined how GA biosynthesis was regulated in submerged plants. Therefore, cDNAs encoding GA-biosynthetic enzymes GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase, and the GA-deactivating enzyme GA 2-oxidase were cloned from R. palustris and the kinetics of transcription of the corresponding genes was determined during a 24 h submergence period. The submergence-induced elongation response could be separated into several phases: (1) during the first phase of 4 h, petiole elongation was insensitive to GA; (2) from 4 to 6 h onward growth was limited by GA; and (3) from 15 h onward underwater elongation was dependent, but not limited by GA. Submergence induced an increase of GA1 concentration, as well as enhanced transcript levels of RpGA3ox1. Exogenous abscisic acid repressed the transcript levels of RpGA20ox1 and RpGA3ox1 and thus inhibited the submergence-induced increase in GA1. Abscisic acid had no effect on the tissue responsiveness to GA.
