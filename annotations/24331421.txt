During the Desmodesmus armatus cell cycle, 8-celled coenobia of 276-4d strain accumulated a much lower amounts of cadmium than unicells of B1-76 strain. Cadmium reduced growth and photosynthesis in the cells of strain B1-76, but not those of 276-4d strain. Cells of 276-4d strain revealed a higher activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms, in particular the activity and protein content of Fe-SOD. Cu/Zn-SOD was earlier and much stronger induced by cadmium in 276-4d than in B1-76 strain, whereas Fe- and Mn-SOD activity and Fe-SOD synthesis were induced only in 276-4d strain. Cadmium did not affect the heat shock protein 70 synthesis in B1-76 strain, but significantly stimulated this process in 276-4d strain. The level of glutathione increased 30-fold during cell development of Cd-exposed 276-4d strain, while in B1-76 it increased about 12 timed. Matured cells of both strains exposed to cadmium produced comparable amounts of phytochelatins and other thiol peptides, but their production in young cells of B1-76 strain was much higher than in 276-4d strain. In conclusion, a complex of internal detoxification mechanisms appeared to be more efficient in cells of 276-4d strain than B1-76 one.
