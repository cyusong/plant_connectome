Awns, bristle-like structures extending from grass lemmas, provide protection against predators, contribute to photosynthesis and aid in grain dispersal. In wheat, selection of awns with minimal extension, termed awnletted, has occurred during domestication by way of loci that dominantly inhibit awn development, such as Tipped1 (B1), Tipped2 (B2), and Hooded (Hd). Here we identify and characterize the B1 gene. B1 was identified using bulked segregant RNA-sequencing of an F<sub>2</sub> durum wheat population and through deletion mapping of awned bread wheat mutants. Functional characterization was accomplished by gene overexpression while haplotype analyses assessed B1 polymorphisms and genetic variation. Located on chromosome 5A, B1 is a C2H2 zinc finger encoding gene with ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs. Constitutive overexpression of B1 in awned wheat produced an awnletted phenotype with pleiotropic effects on plant height and fertility. Transcriptome analysis of B1 overexpression plants suggests a role as transcriptional repressor, putatively targeting pathways involved in cell proliferation. Haplotype analysis revealed a conserved B1 coding region with proximal polymorphisms and supported the contention that B1 is mainly responsible for awnletted wheats globally. B1, predominantly responsible for awn inhibition in wheat, encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein with EAR motifs which putatively functions as a transcriptional repressor.
