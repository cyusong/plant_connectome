['35864185', 'Gene expression in plant mitochondria is mainly regulated by nuclear-encoded  proteins on a post-transcriptional level. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins  play a major role by participating in mRNA stability, splicing, RNA editing, and  translation initiation. PPR proteins were also shown to be part of the  mitochondrial ribosome (rPPR proteins), which may act as regulators of gene  expression in plants. In this study, we focus on a mitochondrial-located P-type  PPR protein-DWEORG1-from Arabidopsis thaliana. Its abundance in mitochondria is  high, and it has a similar expression pattern as rPPR proteins. Mutant dweorg1  plants exhibit a slow-growth phenotype. Using ribosome profiling, a decrease in  translation efficiency for cox2, rps4, rpl5, and ccmF(N2) was observed in dweorg1  mutants, correlating with a reduced accumulation of the Cox2 protein in these  plants. In addition, the mitochondrial rRNA levels are significantly reduced in  dweorg1 compared with the wild type. DWEORG1 co-migrates with the ribosomal  proteins Rps4 and Rpl16 in sucrose gradients, suggesting an association of  DWEORG1 with the mitoribosome. Collectively, this data suggests that DWEORG1  encodes a novel rPPR protein that is needed for the translation of cox2, rps4,  rpl5, and ccmF(N2) and provides a stabilizing function for mitochondrial  ribosomes.', '2022 Jul 21', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-022-16812-0', 'Kempken']
