Rice is known for its superior adaptation to ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ) as a nitrogen source. Compared to many other cereals, it displays lower NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux in roots and higher nitrogen-use efficiency on NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> . A critical role for GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (VTC1) in controlling root NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> fluxes was previously documented in Arabidopsis, but the molecular pathways involved in regulating VTC1-dependent NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux remain unclear. Here, we report that ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (OsEIL1) acts as a key transcription factor regulating OsVTC1-3-dependent NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux and protein N-glycosylation in rice grown under NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition. We show that OsEIL1 in rice plays a contrasting role to Arabidopsis-homologous ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (AtEIN3) and maintains rice growth under NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> by stabilizing protein N-glycosylation and reducing root NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux. OsEIL1 constrains NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux by activation of OsVTC1-3, but not OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-8. OsEIL1 binds directly to the promoter EIN3-binding site (EBS) of OsVTC1-3 in vitro and in vivo and acts to increase the transcription of OsVTC1-3. Our work demonstrates an important link between excessive root NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux and OsVTC1-3-mediated protein N-glycosylation in rice grown under NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition and identifies OsEIL1 as a direct genetic regulator of OsVTC1-3 expression.
