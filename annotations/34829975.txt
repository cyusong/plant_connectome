Autophagy is an important pathway of degrading excess and abnormal proteins and organelles through their engulfment into autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with the vacuole. Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) are essential for the formation of autophagosomes. To date, about 35 ATGs have been identified in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, which are involved in the occurrence and regulation of autophagy. Among these, 17 proteins are related to resistance against plant pathogens. The transcription coactivator non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1) is involved in innate immunity and acquired resistance in plants, which regulates most salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes. This paper mainly summarizes the role of ATGs and NPR1 in plant immunity and the advancement of research on ATGs in NPR1 metabolism, providing a new idea for exploring the relationship between ATGs and NPR1.
