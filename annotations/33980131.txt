The increased level of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) in brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, such as <i>det2</i> and <i>cyp85a1</i> ×<i> cyp85a2</i>, suggests that ABA synthesis is inhibited by endogenous BRs in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Expression of the ABA biosynthesis gene <i>ABA-deficient 2</i> (<i>ABA2</i>) was negatively regulated by exogenously applied BR but up-regulated by the application of brassinazole and in <i>det2</i> and <i>cyp85a1</i> ×<i> cyp85a2</i>. In addition, <i>ABA2</i> expression decreased in <i>bzr1-1D</i>, showing that ABA biosynthesis is inhibited by BR signaling via BZR1, intermediated by <i>ABA2</i>, in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Four <i>cis</i>-element sequences (E-boxes 1-4) in the putative promoter region of <i>ABA2</i> were identified as BZR1 binding sites. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immune precipitation analysis demonstrated that BZR1 directly binds to overlapped E-boxes (E-box 3/4) in the promoter region of <i>ABA2</i>. The level of endogenous ABA was decreased in <i>bzr1-1D</i> compared to wild-type, indicating that binding of BZR1 to the <i>ABA2</i> promoter inhibits ABA synthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Compared to wild-type, <i>aba2-1</i> exhibited severely reduced growth and development. The abnormalities in <i>aba2-1</i> were rescued by the application of ABA, suggesting that <i>ABA2</i> expression and ABA synthesis are necessary for the normal growth and development of <i>A. thaliana</i>. Finally, <i>bzr1-KO</i> × <i>aba2-1</i> exhibited inhibitory growth of primary roots compared to <i>bzr1-KO</i>, verifying that <i>ABA2</i> is a downstream target of BZR1 in the plant. Taken together, the level of endogenous ABA is down-regulated by BR signaling via BZR1, controlling the growth of <i>A. thaliana</i>.
