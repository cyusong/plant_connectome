In eukaryotes, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) targets aberrant and selected non-aberrant mRNAs for destruction. A recent screen for mRNAs showing increased abundance in Arabidopsis NMD-deficient mutants revealed that most are associated with the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense pathway. mRNAs with conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (CpuORFs or CuORFs) are hugely overrepresented among the smaller class of NMD-regulated transcripts not associated with SA. Here we show that the common phenotypes observed in Arabidopsis NMD mutants are SA-dependent, whereas the upregulation of CpuORF-containing transcripts in NMD mutants is independent of SA. We speculate that CpuORFs could allow the conditional targeting of mRNAs for destruction using the NMD pathway.
