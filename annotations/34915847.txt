Maize kernel is exposed to several fungal species, most notably Fusarium verticillioides, which can contaminate maize kernels with fumonisins. In an effort to increase genetic gains and avoid the laborious tasks of conventional breeding, the use of marker-assisted selection or genomic selection programs was proposed. To this end, in the present study a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) was performed on 339 RILs of a Multiparental Advanced Generation InterCross (MAGIC) population that had previously been used to locate Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) for resistance to Fusarium Ear Rot (FER). Six QTLs for fumonisin content were detected in the bins 3.08, 4.07, 4.10, 7.03-7.04, 9.04-9.05 and 10.04-10.5. Five of the six QTLs collocate in regions where QTLs for FER were also found. However, the genetic variation for fumonisin content in kernel is conditioned by many other QTLs of small effect that could show QTL x environment interaction effects. Although a genomic selection approach to directly reduce fumonisin content in the kernel could be suitable, improving resistance to fumonisin content by genomic selection for FER would be more advisable.
