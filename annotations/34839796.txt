Protein tyrosine phosphatases play essential roles in plant growth and development and in plant responses to biotic or abiotic stresses. We recently demonstrated that an atypical dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase in plants, AtPFA-DSP3 (DSP3), negatively regulates plant salt tolerance. Here, we report that a homolog of DSP3, AtPFA-DSP5 (DSP5), affects the response of plants to high-salt conditions. A loss-of-function mutant of DSP5 showed reduced sensitivity to salt treatment at the seed germination and vegetative stages of development while a gain-of-function mutant of DSP5 showed increased sensitivity to salt stress. The salt responses of <i>dsp3dsp5</i> double-mutant plants were similar to those of <i>dsp3</i> and <i>dsp5</i> single-mutant plants. Gel overlay and firefly luciferase complementation assays showed that DSP5 interacts with MPK3 and MPK6 <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These results indicate that DSP5 is a novel negative regulator of salt responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i> that interacts directly with MPK3 and MPK6.
