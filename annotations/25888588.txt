['25888588', 'During state transitions, plants regulate energy distribution between  photosystems I and II through reversible phosphorylation and lateral migration of  the major light-harvesting complex LHCII. Dephosphorylation of LHCII and the  transition from state 2 to state 1 requires a thylakoid membrane-associated  phosphatase named TAP38 or PPH1. TAP38/PPH1 specifically targets LHCII but not  the core subunits of photosystem II, whereas the underlying molecular mechanism  of their mutual recognition is currently unclear. Here, we present the structures  of Arabidopsis thaliana TAP38/PPH1 in the substrate-free and substrate-bound  states. The protein contains a type 2C serine/threonine protein phosphatase  (PP2C) core domain, a Mn(2+) (or Mg(2+)) binuclear center and two additional  motifs contributing to substrate recognition. A 15-mer phosphorylated N-terminal  peptide of Lhcb1 binds to TAP38/PPH1 on two surface clefts enclosed by the  additional motifs. The first segment of the phosphopeptide is clamped by a pair  of tooth-like arginine residues at Cleft 1 site. The binding adopts the  lock-and-key mechanism with slight rearrangement of the substrate binding  residues on TAP38/PPH1. Meanwhile, a more evident substrate-induced fitting  occurs on Cleft 2 harboring the extended part of the phosphopeptide. The results  unravel the bases for the specific recognition between TAP38/PPH1 and  phosphorylated Lhcb1, a crucial step in state transitions.', '2015 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00102', 'ORCID:']
