Plant cells have acquired chloroplasts (plastids) with a unique genome (ptDNA), which developed during the evolution of endosymbiosis. The gene content and genome structure of ptDNAs in land plants are considerably stable, although those of algal ptDNAs are highly varied. Plant cells seem, therefore, to be intolerant of any structural or organizational changes in the ptDNA. Genome rearrangement functions as a driver of genomic evolutionary divergence. Here, we aimed to create various types of rearrangements in the ptDNA of Arabidopsis genomes using plastid-targeted forms of restriction endonucleases (pREs). Arabidopsis plants expressing each of the three specific pREs, i.e., pTaqI, pHinP1I, and pMseI, were generated; they showed the leaf variegation phenotypes associated with impaired chloroplast development. We confirmed that these pREs caused double-stranded breaks (DSB) at their recognition sites in ptDNAs. Genome-wide analysis of ptDNAs revealed that the transgenic lines exhibited a large number of rearrangements such as inversions and deletions/duplications, which were dominantly repaired by microhomology-mediated recombination and microhomology-mediated end-joining, and less by non-homologous end-joining. Notably, pHinP1I, which recognized a small number of sites in ptDNA, induced drastic structural changes, including regional copy number variations throughout ptDNAs. In contrast, the transient expression of either pTaqI or pMseI, whose recognition site numbers were relatively larger, resulted in small-scale changes at the whole genome level. These results indicated that DSB frequencies and their distribution are major determinants in shaping ptDNAs.
