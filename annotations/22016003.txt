Majerová et al. (Plant Mol Biol, 2011) have recently reported that a considerable fraction of cytosines at tobacco telomeres is methylated. Although the data presented in this report indicate that tobacco telomeric sequences undergo certain levels of DNA methylation, it is not clear whether the methylated sequences are at telomeres, at internal chromosomal loci or at both.
