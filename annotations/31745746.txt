MIR159/319 have conserved evolution and diversified function after WGT in Brassica campestris, both of them can lead pollen vitality and germination abnormality, Bra-MIR319c also can function in flower development. MiR159 and miR319 are extensively studied highly conserved microRNAs which play roles in vegetative development, reproduction, and hormone regulation. In this study, the effects of whole-genome triplication (WGT) on the evolution of the MIR159/319 family and the functional diversification of the genes were comprehensively investigated in Brassica campestris. We identified 11 MIR159/319 genes in B. campestris, which produced five mature sequences. After analyzing the precursor sequences and phylogenetic tree, we found that Bra-MIR159/319 have evolutionary conservatism. Furthermore, Bra-MIR159/319 show functional diversification after WGT, as indicated by their expression patterns and the cis-element in their promoter. GUS signal showed that Bra-MIR159a and Bra-MIR319c can be expressed in anther but in different development stages. In B. campestris, overexpressed MIR159a and MIR319c contribute to late anther development and promote pollen abortion. Moreover, Bra-MIR319c can partially assume the function of MIR319a in flower development.
