Plant vigor is a complex trait for which the underlying molecular control mechanisms remain unclear. Vigorous plants tend to derive from larger seeds and have greater early canopy cover, often with bigger leaves. In this study, we delimited the size of a major vigor quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chickpea chromosome 4-104.4 kb, using recombinant association analysis in 15 different heterogeneous inbred families, derived from a Rupali/Genesis836 recombinant inbred line population. The phenotypic and molecular genetic analysis provided evidence for a role of the gene <i>Ca4_TIFY4B</i>, in determining leaf and seed size in chickpea. A non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the high-vigor parent was located inside the core motif TIFYCG, resulting in a residue change T[I/S]FYCG. Complexes formed by orthologs of Ca4_TIFY4B (PEAPOD in <i>Arabidopsis</i>), Novel Interactor of JAZ (CaNINJA), and other protein partners are reported to act as repressors regulating the transcription of downstream genes that control plant organ size. When tested in a yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assay, this residue change suppressed the interaction between Ca4_TIFY4B and CaNINJA. This is the first report of a naturally occurring variant of the TIFY family in plants. A robust gene-derived molecular marker is available for selection in chickpea for seed and plant organ size, i.e., key component traits of vigor.
