Pyrethrins, synthesized in the perennial plant <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>, are a class of terpene mixtures with high insecticidal activity and low human toxicity, which are widely used in plant-derived pesticides. Numerous studies have identified multiple pyrethrins biosynthesis enzymes, which can be enhanced by exogenous hormones such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA). However, the mechanism by which hormone signaling regulates pyrethrins biosynthesis and the potential involvement of certain transcription factors (TFs) remain unclear. In this study, we found that the expression level of a TF in <i>T. cinerariifolium</i> was significantly increased after treatment with plant hormones (MeJA, abscisic acid). Subsequent analysis identified this TF as a member of the basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) family and was thus named <i>TcbZIP60</i>. TcbZIP60 was localized in the nucleus, suggesting that it is involved in the transcription process. The expression profiles of <i>TcbZIP60</i> were similar to those of pyrethrins synthesis genes in different flower organs and at different flowering stages. Furthermore, TcbZIP60 could directly bind to the E-box/G-box motifs in the promoters of the pyrethrins synthesis genes <i>TcCHS</i> and <i>TcAOC</i> to activate their expression. Transient overexpression of <i>TcbZIP60</i> increased the expression levels of pyrethrins biosynthesis genes, leading to the significant accumulation of pyrethrins. Silencing of <i>TcbZIP60</i> significantly downregulated pyrethrins accumulation and the expression of related genes. Overall, our results reveal a novel TF, TcbZIP60, that regulates both the terpenoid and jasmonic acid pathways of pyrethrins biosynthesis in <i>T. cinerariifolium</i>.
