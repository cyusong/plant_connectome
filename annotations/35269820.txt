['35269820', "Pseudouridine (Psi), the isomer of uridine (U), is the most abundant type of RNA  modification, which is crucial for gene regulation in various cellular processes.  Pseudouridine synthases (PUSs) are the key enzymes for the U-to-Psi conversion.  However, little is known about the genome-wide features and biological function  of plant PUSs. In this study, we identified 20 AtPUSs and 22 ZmPUSs from  Arabidopsis and maize (Zea mays), respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis  indicated that both AtPUSs and ZmPUSs could be clustered into six known  subfamilies: RluA, RsuA, TruA, TruB, PUS10, and TruD. RluA subfamily is the  largest subfamily in both Arabidopsis and maize. It's noteworthy that except the  canonical XXHRLD-type RluAs, another three conserved RluA variants, including  XXNRLD-, XXHQID-, and XXHRLG-type were also identified in those key nodes of  vascular plants. Subcellular localization analysis of representative AtPUSs and  ZmPUSs in each subfamily revealed that PUS proteins were localized in different  organelles including nucleus, cytoplasm and chloroplasts. Transcriptional  expression analysis indicated that AtPUSs and ZmPUSs were differentially  expressed in various tissues and diversely responsive to abiotic stresses,  especially suggesting their potential roles in response to heat and salt  stresses. All these results would facilitate the functional identification of  these pseudouridylation in the future.", '2022 Feb 28', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms23052680', 'ORCID:']
