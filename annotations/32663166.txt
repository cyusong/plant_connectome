Spatiotemporally regulated callose deposition is an essential, genetically programmed phenomenon that promotes pollen development and functionality. Severe male infertility is associated with deficient callose biosynthesis, highlighting the significance of intact callose deposition in male gametogenesis. The molecular mechanism that regulates the crucial role of callose in production of functional male gametophytes remains completely unexplored. Here, we provide evidence that the gradual upregulation of a previously uncharacterized cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) pollen-specific SKS-like protein (PSP231), specifically at the post pollen-mitosis stage, activates callose biosynthesis to promote pollen maturation. Aberrant <i>PSP231</i> expression levels caused by either silencing or overexpression resulted in late pollen developmental abnormalities and male infertility phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of fine-tuned <i>PSP231</i> expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed that PSP231 plays a central role in triggering and fine-tuning the callose synthesis and deposition required for pollen development. Specifically, PSP231 protein sequesters the cellular pool of RNA-binding protein GhRBPL1 to destabilize <i>GhWRKY15</i> mRNAs, turning off GhWRKY15-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>GhCalS4</i>/<i>GhCalS8</i> and thus activating callose biosynthesis in pollen. This study showed that PSP231 is a key molecular switch that activates the molecular circuit controlling callose deposition toward pollen maturation and functionality and thereby safeguards agricultural crops against male infertility.
