Plant development is highly dependent on the ability to perceive and cope with environmental changes. In this context, PIF proteins are key players in the cellular hub controlling responses to fluctuating light and temperature conditions. Reports in various plant species show that manipulation of the PIF4 level affects important agronomical traits. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), SlPIF1a and SlPIF3 regulate fruit nutraceutical composition. However, the wider role of this protein family, and the potential of their manipulation for the improvement of other traits, has not been explored. Here we report the effects of constitutive silencing of tomato <i>SlPIF4</i> on whole-plant physiology and development. Ripening anticipation and higher carotenoid levels observed in <i>SlPIF4</i>-silenced fruits revealed a redundant role of SlPIF4 in the accumulation of nutraceutical compounds. Furthermore, silencing triggered a significant reduction in plant size, flowering, fruit yield, and fruit size. This phenotype was most likely caused by reduced auxin levels and altered carbon partitioning. Impaired thermomorphogenesis and delayed leaf senescence were also observed in silenced plants, highlighting the functional conservation of PIF4 homologs in angiosperms. Overall, this work improves our understanding of the role of PIF proteins-and light signaling-in metabolic and developmental processes that affect yield and composition of fleshy fruits.
