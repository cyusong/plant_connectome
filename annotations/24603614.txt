Plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms to overcome their sessile nature. One remarkable strategy is the inter-plant communication mediated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Quantity and quality of plant VOCs are intricately regulated by biotic and abiotic stresses, and the alterations facilitate plant community to optimize their growth, development, and endogenous physiology to environmental fluctuations. Here, we report that Arabidopsis thaliana plants that experience high salinity emit VOCs and trigger induction of high salt resistance in neighboring plants. VOC emission of emitter plants is likely correlative to the plant damages to high salt, and VOC-fumigated receiver plants acquire high salt tolerance. The VOC-induced stress tolerance is independent of conventional abscisic acid (ABA) and salt stress signaling pathways. Together, this study demonstrates that salt-induced Arabidopsis VOCs are relevant in priming stress tolerance in neighboring plants. In addition, it also provides insight into how VOCs elicit stress responses in plant community.
