Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important nutrients for crop growth and yield formation, as it is an important constituent in a large amount of proteins, cell walls, and membranes related to photosynthesis. Recently, increasing studies have suggested the important roles of photosynthetic induction and stomatal movement under fluctuating light in regulating plant carbon assimilation and water use efficiency. How leaf N content affects photosynthetic induction remains uncertain. Here, we observed a significantly faster photosynthetic induction with the increasing supply of N under fluctuating light conditions. Photosynthetic induction was mainly limited by biochemical processes but not stomatal opening after a stepwise increase in irradiance across different N supplies. Higher N supply enhanced photosynthetic efficiency under constant and fluctuating light conditions but reduced leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub> ). This study is mainly focused on clarifying the crucial limitation of photosynthetic induction under different N treatments, which may facilitate the improvement of photosynthetic efficiency under complicated environments in the future.
