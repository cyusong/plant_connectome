['21799034', 'In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), transit peptides for chloroplast-destined  preproteins can be phosphorylated by the protein kinases STY8, STY17, and STY46.  In this study, we have investigated the in vitro properties of these  plant-specific kinases. Characterization of the mechanistic functioning of STY8  led to the identification of an essential threonine in the activation segment,  which is phosphorylated by an intramolecular mechanism. STY8 is inhibited by  specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, although it lacked the ability to  phosphorylate tyrosine residues in vitro. In vivo analysis of sty8, sty17, and  sty46 Arabidopsis knockout/knockdown mutants revealed a distinct function of the  three kinases in the greening process and in the efficient differentiation of  chloroplasts. Mutant plants displayed not only a delayed accumulation of  chlorophyll but also a reduction of nucleus-encoded chloroplast proteins and a  retarded establishment of photosynthetic capacity during the first 6 h of  deetiolation, supporting a role of cytosolic STY kinases in chloroplast  differentiation.', '2011 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.182774', 'Schwenkert']
