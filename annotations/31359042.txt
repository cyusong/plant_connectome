Although the importance of chloroplast RNA splicing and ribosome maturation (CRM) domain-containing proteins has been established for chloroplast RNA metabolism and plant development, the functional role of CRM proteins in mitochondria remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of a mitochondria-targeted CRM protein (At3g27550), named CFM9, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Confocal analysis revealed that CFM9 is localized in mitochondria. The cfm9 mutant exhibited delayed seed germination, retarded growth and shorter height compared with the wild type under normal conditions. The growth-defect phenotypes were more manifested upon high salinity, dehydration or ABA application. Complementation lines expressing CFM9 in the mutant background fully recovered the wild-type phenotypes. Notably, the mutant had abnormal mitochondria, increased hydrogen peroxide and reduced respiration activity, implying that CFM9 is indispensable for normal mitochondrial function. More important, the splicing of many intron-containing genes in mitochondria was defective in the mutant, suggesting that CFM9 plays a crucial role in the splicing of mitochondrial introns. Collectively, our results provide clear evidence emphasizing that CFM9 is an essential factor in the splicing of mitochondrial introns, which is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and function and the growth and development of Arabidopsis.
