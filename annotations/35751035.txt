Japanese apricot (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc.) is popular for both ornamental and processing value, fruit color affects the processing quality, and red pigmentation is the most obvious phenotype associated with fruit color variation in Japanese apricot, mutations in structural genes in the anthocyanin pathway can disrupt the red pigmentation, while the formation mechanism of the red color trait in Japanese apricot is still unclear.  RESULTS: One SNP marker (PmuSNP_27) located within PmUFGT3 gene coding region was found highly polymorphic among 44 different fruit skin color cultivars and relative to anthocyanin biosynthesis in Japanese apricot. Meantime, critical mutations were identified in two alleles of PmUFGT3 in the green-skinned type is inactivated by seven nonsense mutations in the coding region, which leads to seven amino acid substitution, resulting in an inactive UFGT enzyme. Overexpression of the PmUFGT3 allele from red-skinned Japanese apricot in green-skinned fruit lines resulted in greater anthocyanin accumulation in fruit skin. Expression of same allele in an Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant deficient in anthocyanidin activity the accumulation of anthocyanins. In addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we created a single-base substitution mutation (G to T) of PmUFGT3 isolated from green-skinned cultivar, which caused an E to D amino acid substitution and restored the function of the inactive allele of PmUFGT3 from a green-skinned individual. This study confirms the function of PmUFGT3, and provides insight into the mechanism underlying fruit color determination in Japanese apricot, and possible approaches towards genetic engineering of fruit color.
