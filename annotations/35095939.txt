Wood formation of trees is a complex and costly developmental process, whose regulatory network is involved in the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. To detect such interactions in wood development, we developed a high-throughput screening system with 517 Gal4-AD-wood-associated transcription factors (TFs) library from <i>Populus alba</i> × <i>P. glandulosa</i> cv "84K." This system can be used for screening the upstream regulators and interacting proteins of targets by mating-based yeast-one hybrid (Y1H) and yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) method, respectively. Multiple regulatory modules of lignin biosynthesis were identified based on this <i>Populus</i> system. Five TFs interacted with the 500-bp promoter fragment of <i>PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE 2</i> (<i>PAL2</i>), the first rate-limiting enzyme gene in the lignin biosynthesis pathway, and 10 TFs interacted with <i>Pa</i>MYB4/LTF1, a key regulator of lignin biosynthesis. Some of these interactions were further validated by EMSA and BiFC assays. The TF-<i>PaPAL2</i> promoter interaction and TF-<i>Pa</i>MYB4 interaction revealed a complex mechanism governing the regulation of lignin synthesis in wood cells. Our high-throughput Y1H/Y2H screening system may be an efficient tool for studying regulatory network of wood formation in tree species.
