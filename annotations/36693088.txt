The phytopathogen <i>Pantoea agglomerans</i> belongs to the Bacteria, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacterales, Erwiniaceae in species classification. It causes disease symptoms in many plants such as corn, banana, and walnut. This study aimed to report the complete genome of <i>P. agglomerans</i> CHTF15, which represents the first whole-genome sequence of an isolate from diseased walnut leaves. The total length of the assembled genome was 4,820,607 bp, with an average GC content of 55.3%, including a circular chromosome and three circular plasmids, two of which were previously unreported sequences and one was announced previously. The CHTF15 genome helps understand the pathogenic mechanism of this important plant pathogen and provides an important theoretical basis for disease epidemic and field control.
