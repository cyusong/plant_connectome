The transition from vegetative to reproductive phases is the most fundamental and tightly controlled switch in the life of flowering plants. The short-day plant Chenopodium rubrum is a fast cycling annual plant lacking a juvenile phase. It can be induced to flowering at the seedling stage by exposure to a single period of darkness. This floral induction may then be cancelled by a short pulse of red light at midnight called night break (NB), which also inhibits the floral activator FLOWERING LOCUS T LIKE 1 (CrFTL1). We performed a comparative transcriptomic study between C. rubrum seedlings treated by NB and ones growing through uninterrupted night, and found about six hundred differentially expressed genes, including the B-BOX DOMAIN (BBX) genes. We focused on the CrBBX19 and BOLTING TIME CONTROL 1 (BTC1) genes, homologous to the upstream regulators of the BvFT2, a floral inducer in sugar beet. The transcription patterns of the two genes were compatible with their putative role as a sensor of the dark period length optimal for flowering (CrBBX19), and a signal of lights-on (CrBTC1), but the participation of other genes cannot be excluded. The expression profiles of CrBBX19 and the homolog of the core endogenous clock gene LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) were highly similar, which suggested their co-regulation.
