Fiber length, fiber strength, and fiber micronaire are the main fiber quality parameters in cotton. Thus, mining the elite and stable loci/alleles related to fiber quality traits and elucidating the relationship between the two may accelerate genetic improvement of fiber quality in cotton. Here, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was performed for fiber quality parameters based on phenotypic data, and 56,010 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using 242 upland cotton accessions under 12 field environments were obtained. Phenotypic analysis exhibited that fiber length (FL) had a positive correlation with fiber strength (FS) and had a negative correlation with fiber micronaire (Mic). Genetic analysis also indicated that FL, FS, and Mic had high heritability of more than 80%. A total of 67 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified through GWAS analysis, including 31 for FL, 21 for FS, and 22 for Mic. Of them, three pairs homologous QTLs were detected between A and D subgenomes, and seven co-located QTLs with two fiber quality parameters were found. Compared with the reported QTLs, 34 co-located with previous studies, and 33 were newly revealed. Integrated with transcriptome analysis, we selected 256, 244, and 149 candidate genes for FL, FS, and Mic, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that most of the genes located in QTLs interval of the three fiber quality traits were involved in sugar biosynthesis, sugar metabolism, microtubule, and cytoskeleton organization, which played crucial roles in fiber development. Through correlation analysis between haplotypes and phenotypes, three genes (<i>GH_A05G1494, GH_D11G3097</i>, and <i>GH_A05G1082</i>) predominately expressed in fiber development stages were indicated to be potentially responsible for FL, FS, and Mic, respectively. The <i>GH_A05G1494</i> encoded a protein containing SGS-domain, which is related to tubulin-binding and ubiquitin-protein ligase binding. The <i>GH_D11G3097</i> encoded 20S proteasome beta subunit G1, and was involved in the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process. The <i>GH_A05G1082</i> encoded RAN binding protein 1 with a molecular function of GTPase activator activity. These results provide new insights and candidate loci/genes for the improvement of fiber quality in cotton.
