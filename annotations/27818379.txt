['27818379', 'Chloroplast development is an essential process for plant growth that is  regulated by numerous proteins. Plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP) is a  large complex that regulates plastid gene transcription and chloroplast  development. However, many proteins in this complex remain to be identified.  Here, through large-scale screening of Arabidopsis mutants by Chl fluorescence  imaging, we identified a novel protein, DELAYED GREENING 238 (DG238), which is  involved in regulating chloroplast development and plastid gene expression. Loss  of DG238 retards plant growth, delays young leaf greening, affects chloroplast  development and lowers photosynthetic efficiency. Moreover, blue-native PAGE  (BN-PAGE) and Western blot analysis indicated that PSII and PSI protein levels  are reduced in dg238 mutants. DG238 is mainly expressed in young tissues and is  regulated by light signals. Subcellular localization analysis showed that DG238  is a nuclear-encoded chloroplast nucleoid protein. More interestingly, DG238 was  co-expressed with FLN1, which encodes an essential subunit of the PEP complex.  Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation  (Co-IP) assays showed that DG238 can also interact with FLN1. Taken together,  these results suggest that DG238 may function as a component of the PEP complex  that is important for the early stage of chloroplast development and helps  regulate PEP-dependent plastid gene expression.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcw172', 'Jin']
