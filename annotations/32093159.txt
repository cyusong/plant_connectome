Late 19th-century cytologists observed tiny oil drops in shoot parenchyma and seeds, but it was discovered only in 1972 that they were bound by a half unit-membrane. Later, it was found that lipid bodies (LBs) arise from the endoplasmic reticulum. Seeds are known to be packed with static LBs, coated with the LB-specific protein OLEOSIN. As shown here, apices of <i>Populus</i> <i>tremula</i> x <i>P. tremuloides</i> also express <i>OLEOSIN</i> genes and produce potentially mobile LBs. In developing buds, <i>PtOLEOSIN (PtOLE)</i> genes were upregulated, especially <i>PtOLE6,</i> concomitant with LB accumulation. To investigate LB mobility and destinations, we transformed <i>Arabidopsis</i> with <i>PtOLE6-eGFP</i>. We found that PtOLE6-eGFP fusion protein co-localized with Nile Red-stained LBs in all cell types. Moreover, PtOLE6-eGFP-tagged LBs targeted plasmodesmata, identified by the callose marker aniline blue. Pharmacological experiments with brefeldin, cytochalasin D, and oryzalin showed that LB-trafficking requires F-actin, implying involvement of myosin motors. In a triple myosin-XI knockout (<i>xi-k/1/2</i>), transformed with <i>PtOLE6-eGFP</i>, trafficking of PtOLE6-eGFP-tagged LBs was severely impaired, confirming that they move on F-actin, motorized by myosin XIs. The data reveal that LBs and OLEOSINs both function in proliferating apices and buds, and that directional trafficking of LBs to plasmodesmata requires the actomyosin system.
