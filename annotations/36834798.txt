One of the most important phytohormones is salicylic acid (SA), which is essential for the regulation of plant growth, development, ripening, and defense responses. The role of SA in plant-pathogen interactions has attracted a lot of attention. Aside from defense responses, SA is also important in responding to abiotic stimuli. It has been proposed to have great potential for improving the stress resistance of major agricultural crops. On the other hand, SA utilization is dependent on the dosage of the applied SA, the technique of application, and the status of the plants (e.g., developmental stage and acclimation). Here, we reviewed the impact of SA on saline stress responses and the associated molecular pathways, as well as recent studies toward understanding the hubs and crosstalk between SA-induced tolerances to biotic and saline stress. We propose that elucidating the mechanism of the SA-specific response to various stresses, as well as SA-induced rhizosphere-specific microbiome modeling, may provide more insights and support in coping with plant saline stress.
