The regulation of endogenous levels of ascorbic acid in soybean by far-red absorbing form of phytochrome (Pfr) and by cryptic red light signal (CRS) was studied. Cryptic red light signal is produced by red light pre-irradiation of a photoreceptor other than far-red absorbing form of phytochrome (Pfr) and CRS amplifies the action of phytochrome. The endogenous level of ascorbic acid levels enhanced by phytochrome was amplified by CRS. The lifetime of CRS was from 0 to 2 h and the peak of enhancement of ascorbic acid due to CRS was between 16 to 24 h of dark incubation after the end of the treatment. CRS was found to be ineffective on UV-B enhanced endogenous levels of ascorbic acid.
