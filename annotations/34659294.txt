Phospholipase D (PLD) and its hydrolysis product phosphatidic acid play an important role in the regulation of several cellular processes, including root growth, pollen tube elongation, and microtubule reorganization. Here, we systematically identified and analyzed the membership, characterization, and evolutionary relationship of PLDs in five species of cotton. The results of the transcriptomic analysis suggested that the evaluated <i>PLD</i> genes showed high expression levels in anther tissue and during the fiber initiation and elongation periods. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed differential expression of <i>GhPLD</i> genes in the anthers of <i>photoperiod sensitive male sterility mutant 5</i> (<i>psm5</i>). Previous research on multiple stable quantitative trait loci also suggests the role of <i>PLD</i> genes in the fiber development. Further analyses showed that GhPLD2 protein is localized to the plasma membrane. The virus-induced gene silencing of <i>GhPLD2</i> in cotton seedlings repressed its expression by 40-70%, which led to a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, 22% anther indehiscence, and disrupted fiber initiation and elongation. Thus, we inferred that GhPLD2 may promote ROS production, which, in turn, may regulate anther dehiscence and fiber development.
