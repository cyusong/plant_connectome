Myeloblastosis (MYB)-related transcription factors comprise a large subfamily of the MYB family. They play significant roles in plant development and in stress responses. However, MYB-related proteins have not been comprehensively investigated in rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.). In the present study, a genome-wide analysis of MYB-related transcription factors was performed in rapeseed. We identified 251 <i>Brassica napus MYB</i> (BnMYB)-related members, which were divided phylogenetically into five clades. Evolutionary analysis suggested that whole genome duplication and segmental duplication events have played a significant role in the expansion of <i>BnMYB-related</i> gene family. Selective pressure of <i>BnMYB-related</i> genes was estimated using the <i>Ka/Ks</i> ratio, which indicated that <i>BnMYB-related</i> genes underwent strong purifying selection during evolution. <i>In silico</i> analysis showed that various development-associated, phytohormone-responsive, and stress-related <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory elements were enriched in the promoter regions of <i>BnMYB-related</i> genes. Furthermore, <i>MYB-related</i> genes with tissue or organ-specific, stress-responsive expression patterns were identified in <i>B. napus</i> based on temporospatial and abiotic stress expression profiles. Among the stress-responsive <i>MYB-related</i> genes, <i>BnMRD107</i> was strongly induced by drought stress, and was therefore selected for functional study. Rapeseed seedlings overexpressing <i>BnMRD107</i> showed improved resistance to osmotic stress. Our findings not only lay a foundation for further functional characterization of <i>BnMYB-related</i> genes, but also provide valuable clues to determine candidate genes for future genetic improvement of <i>B. napus</i>.
