Physiological races of powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii) cause different symptoms in eight melon lines. Infection by races 1, 2, and 5 was examined in different melon lines. After a compatible reaction, conidia germination, haustorium initiation from the germ tube, germ tube branching, and sporulation occurred within 12, 24, 48, and 120 h, respectively, and the conidia matured within 240 h. In contrast, type i and ii inhibition were identified through incompatible reactions. The germ tube and haustorium were initiated from conidia, but no germ tube branching occurred in the lines with type i resistance within 48-240 h. In type ii resistance, germ tube branching was observed within 120 h, but no sporulation was observed within 240 h. The number of fluorescing epidermal cells was higher within 24 h in type i, and within 48-120 h in type ii resistance lines than in susceptible lines. Callose accumulation around the haustorium was detected in type ii resistance lines within 48-120 h. This suggests that the rapid hypersensitive response (HR) within 24 h has an important role in the type i response, while HR and callose accumulation in the type ii response occur slowly between 48 and 120 h. Of the resistant lines, PMR 45 and WMR 29 showed a type i incompatible response; the PI 414723 response was entirely type ii; and PMR 5, PI 124112, and MR-1 showed different responses depending on the race. Therefore, the two types of incompatible responses were intermixed in the same germplasm.
