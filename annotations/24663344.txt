['24663344', 'The chloroplasts of land plants contain internal membrane systems, the  thylakoids, which are arranged in stacks called grana. Because grana have not  been found in Cyanobacteria, the evolutionary origin of genes controlling the  structural and functional diversification of thylakoidal membranes in land plants  remains unclear. The angulata10-1 (anu10-1) mutant, which exhibits pale-green  rosettes, reduced growth, and deficient leaf lateral expansion, resulting in the  presence of prominent marginal teeth, was isolated. Palisade cells in anu10-1 are  larger and less packed than in the wild type, giving rise to large intercellular  spaces. The ANU10 gene encodes a protein of unknown function that localizes to  both chloroplasts and amyloplasts. In chloroplasts, ANU10 associates with  thylakoidal membranes. Mutant anu10-1 chloroplasts accumulate H2O2, and have  reduced levels of chlorophyll and carotenoids. Moreover, these chloroplasts are  small and abnormally shaped, thylakoidal membranes are less abundant, and their  grana are absent due to impaired thylakoid stacking in the anu10-1 mutant.  Because the trimeric light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) has been reported to be  required for thylakoid stacking, its levels were determined in anu10-1 thylakoids  and they were found to be reduced. Together, the data point to a requirement for  ANU10 for chloroplast and mesophyll development.', '2014 Jun', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eru131', 'Micol']
