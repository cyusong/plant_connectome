['15998742', 'Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects plants and induces the formation of tumors  called "crown galls" by integrating the transferred-DNA (T-DNA) region of the  Ti-plasmid into the plant nuclear genome. Tumors are formed because the T-DNA  encodes enzymes that modify the synthesis of two plant growth hormones, auxin and  cytokinin (CK). Here, we show that a CK biosynthesis enzyme, Tmr, which is  encoded by the Agrobacterium T-DNA region, is targeted to and functions in  plastids of infected plant cells, despite having no typical plastid-targeting  sequence. Evidence is provided that Tmr is an adenosine  phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT) that creates a new CK biosynthesis bypass  by using 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBDP) as a substrate.  Unlike in the conventional CK biosynthesis pathway in plants, trans-zeatin-type  CKs are produced directly without the requirement for P450 monooxygenase-mediated  hydroxylation. Consistent with the plastid localization of Tmr, HMBDP is an  intermediate in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, a plastid-localized  biosynthesis route for universal isoprenoid precursors. These results demonstrate  that A. tumefaciens modifies CK biosynthesis by sending a key enzyme into  plastids of the host plant to promote tumorigenesis.', '2005 Jul 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0500793102', 'Yamaguchi']
