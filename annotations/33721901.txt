Inorganic phosphate (Pi) and nitrogen (N) are essential nutrients for plant growth. We found that a five-fold oversupply of nitrate rescues Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants from Pi-starvation stress. Analyses of transgenic plants that overexpressed GFP-AUTOPHAGY8 showed that an oversupply of nitrate induced autophagy flux under Pi-depleted conditions. Expression of DIN6 and DIN10, the carbon (C) starvation-responsive genes, was upregulated when nitrate was oversupplied under Pi starvation, which suggested that the plants recognized the oversupply of nitrate as C starvation stress because of the reduction in the C/N ratio. Indeed, formation of Rubisco-containing bodies (RCBs), which contain chloroplast stroma and are induced by C starvation, was enhanced when nitrate was oversupplied under Pi starvation. Moreover, autophagy-deficient mutants did not release Pi (unlike wild-type plants), exhibited no RCB accumulation inside vacuoles, and were hypersensitive to Pi starvation, indicating that RCB-mediated chlorophagy is involved in Pi starvation tolerance. Thus, our results showed that the Arabidopsis response to Pi starvation is closely linked with N and C availability and that autophagy is a key factor that controls plant growth under Pi starvation.
