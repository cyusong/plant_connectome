['31036599', 'The maintenance of genome integrity over cell divisions is critical for plant  development and the correct transmission of genetic information to the progeny. A  key factor involved in this process is the STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE OF CHROMOSOME5  (SMC5) and SMC6 (SMC5/6) complex, related to the cohesin and condensin complexes  that control sister chromatid alignment and chromosome condensation,  respectively. Here, we characterize NON-SMC ELEMENT4 (NSE4) paralogs of the  SMC5/6 complex in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). NSE4A is expressed in  meristems and accumulates during DNA damage repair. Partial loss-of-function  nse4a mutants are viable but hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by zebularine.  In addition, nse4a mutants produce abnormal seeds, with noncellularized endosperm  and embryos that maximally develop to the heart or torpedo stage. This phenotype  resembles the defects in cohesin and condensin mutants and suggests a role for  all three SMC complexes in differentiation during seed development. By contrast,  NSE4B is expressed in only a few cell types, and loss-of-function mutants do not  have any obvious abnormal phenotype. In summary, our study shows that the NSE4A  subunit of the SMC5-SMC6 complex is essential for DNA damage repair in somatic  tissues and plays a role in plant reproduction.', '2019 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00043', 'ORCID:']
