Key aspects of leaf mitochondrial metabolism in the light remain unresolved. For example, there is debate about the relative importance of exporting reducing equivalents from mitochondria for the peroxisomal steps of photorespiration versus oxidation of NADH to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we address this and explore energetic coupling between organelles in the light using a diel flux balance analysis model. The model included more than 600 reactions of central metabolism with full stoichiometric accounting of energy production and consumption. Different scenarios of energy availability (light intensity) and demand (source leaf versus a growing leaf) were considered, and the model was constrained by the nonlinear relationship between light and CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate. The analysis demonstrated that the chloroplast can theoretically generate sufficient ATP to satisfy the energy requirements of the rest of the cell in addition to its own. However, this requires unrealistic high light use efficiency and, in practice, the availability of chloroplast-derived ATP is limited by chloroplast energy dissipation systems, such as nonphotochemical quenching, and the capacity of the chloroplast ATP export shuttles. Given these limitations, substantial mitochondrial ATP synthesis is required to fulfill cytosolic ATP requirements, with only minimal, or zero, export of mitochondrial reducing equivalents. The analysis also revealed the importance of exporting reducing equivalents from chloroplasts to sustain photorespiration. Hence, the chloroplast malate valve and triose phosphate-3-phosphoglycerate shuttle are predicted to have important metabolic roles, in addition to their more commonly discussed contribution to the avoidance of photooxidative stress.
