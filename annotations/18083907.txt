With the advent of engineered minichromosome technology in plants, an understanding of the properties of small chromosomes is desirable. Twenty-two minichromosomes of related origin but varying in size are described that provide a unique resource to study such behavior. Fourteen minichromosomes from this set could pair with each other in meiotic prophase at frequencies between 25 and 100%, but for the smaller chromosomes, the sister chromatids precociously separated in anaphase I. The other eight minichromosomes did not pair with themselves, and the sister chromatids divided equationally at meiosis I. In plants containing one minichromosome, the sister chromatids also separated at meiosis I. In anaphase II, the minichromosomes progressed to one pole or the other. The maize (Zea mays) Shugoshin protein, which has been hypothesized to protect centromere cohesion in meiosis I, is still present at anaphase I on minichromosomes that divide equationally. Also, there were no differences in the level of phosphorylation of Ser-10 of histone H3, a correlate of cohesion, in the minichromosomes in which sister chromatids separated during anaphase I compared with the normal chromosomes. These analyses suggest that meiotic centromeric cohesion is compromised in minichromosomes depending on their size and cannot be maintained by the mechanisms used by normal-sized chromosomes.
