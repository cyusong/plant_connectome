When grown under cool temperature, winter annuals upregulate photosynthetic capacity as well as freezing tolerance. Here, the role of three cold-induced C-repeat-binding factor (CBF1-3) transcription factors in photosynthetic upregulation and freezing tolerance was examined in two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes originating from Italy (IT) or Sweden (SW), and their corresponding CBF1-3-deficient mutant lines it:cbf123 and sw:cbf123. Photosynthetic, morphological and freezing-tolerance phenotypes, as well as gene expression profiles, were characterized in plants grown from the seedling stage under different combinations of light level and temperature. Under high light and cool (HLC) growth temperature, a greater role of CBF1-3 in IT versus SW was evident from both phenotypic and transcriptomic data, especially with respect to photosynthetic upregulation and freezing tolerance of whole plants. Overall, features of SW were consistent with a different approach to HLC acclimation than seen in IT, and an ability of SW to reach the new homeostasis through the involvement of transcriptional controls other than CBF1-3. These results provide tools and direction for further mechanistic analysis of the transcriptional control of approaches to cold acclimation suitable for either persistence through brief cold spells or for maximisation of productivity in environments with continuous low temperatures.
