Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) is a key regulator of plant architecture. However, knowledge of downstream genes applicable for improving rice plant architecture is very limited. We identified the plant architecture regulatory gene NARROW LEAF 11 (NAL11), which encodes a heat-shock protein (HSP) containing a DnaJ domain. A promising rare allele of NAL11 (NAL11<sup>-923del-1552</sup> ) positively selected in Aus cultivars was identified; this allele exhibited increased expression and generated relatively few tillers, thick stems, and large panicles, components of the ideal plant architecture (IPA). NAL11 is involved in regulating the cell cycle and cell proliferation. NAL11 loss-of-function mutants present impaired chloroplast development and gibberellin (GA) defects. Biochemical analyses show that IPA1 directly binds to elements in the missing fragment of the NAL11<sup>-923del-1552</sup> promoter and negatively regulates NAL11 expression. Genetic analyses support the hypothesis that NAL11 acts downstream of IPA1 to regulate IPA by modulating GA homeostasis, and NAL11 may be an essential complement for IPA1. Our work revealed that avoidance of the inhibition of NAL11<sup>-923del-1552</sup> caused by IPA1 represents a positive strategy for rescuing GA defects accompanied by the upregulation of IPA1 in breeding high-yield rice.
