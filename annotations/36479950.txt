Crop photosynthesis (A) and productivity are often limited by a combination of nutrient stresses, such that changes in the availability of one nutrient may affect the availability of another nutrient, in turn influencing A. In this study, we examined the synergistic effects of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on leaf A in a nutrient amendment experiment, in which P and K were added individually or in combination to Brassica napus grown under P and K co-limitation. The data revealed that the addition of P gradually removed the dominant limiting factor (i.e. the limited availability of P) and improved leaf A. Strikingly, the addition of K synergistically improved the overall uptake of P, mainly by boosting plant growth, and compensated for the physiological demand for P by prioritizing investment in metabolic pools of P (P-containing metabolites and inorganic phosphate, Pi). The enlarged pool of metabolically active P was partially associated with the upregulation of Pi regeneration through release from triose phosphates rather than replacement of P-containing lipids. This process mitigated P restrictions on A by maintaining the ATP/NADPH and NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratios and increasing the content and activity of Rubisco. Our findings demonstrate that sufficient K increased Pi-limited A by enhancing metabolic P fractions and Rubisco activity. Thus, ionic synergism may be exploited to mitigate nutrient-limiting factors to improve crop productivity.
