['32725756', 'Phytophthora species are destructive plant pathogens that cause significant crop  losses worldwide. To understand plant susceptibility to oomycete pathogens and to  explore novel disease resistance strategies, we employed the Arabidopsis  thaliana-Phytophthora parasitica model pathosystem and screened for A. thaliana  T-DNA insertion mutant lines resistant to P. parasitica. This led to the  identification of the resistant mutant 267-31, which carries two T-DNA insertion  sites in the promoter region of the ethylene-responsive factor 19 gene (ERF019).  Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays showed that the  expression of ERF019 was induced during P. parasitica infection in the wild type,  which was suppressed in the 267-31 mutant. Additional erf019 mutants were  generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and were confirmed to have increased  resistance to P. parasitica. In contrast, ERF019 overexpression lines were more  susceptible. Transient overexpression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that  the nuclear localization of ERF019 is crucial for its susceptible function.  RT-qPCR analyses showed that the expression of marker genes for multiple defence  pathways was significantly up-regulated in the mutant compared with the wild type  during infection. Flg22-induced hydrogen peroxide accumulation and reactive  oxygen species burst were impaired in ERF019 overexpression lines, and  flg22-induced MAPK activation was enhanced in erf019 mutants. Moreover, transient  overexpression of ERF019 strongly suppressed INF-triggered cell death in  N. benthamiana. These results reveal the importance of ERF019 in mediating plant  susceptibility to P. parasitica through suppression of pathogen-associated  molecular pattern-triggered immunity.', '2020 Sep', 'Mol Plant Pathol', '10.1111/mpp.12971', 'ORCID:']
