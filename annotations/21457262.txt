• The growth of a plant organ to its characteristic size is regulated by an elaborate developmental program involving both internal and external signals. Here, we identify a novel Arabidopsis gene, ORGAN SIZE RELATED1 (OSR1), that is involved in regulation of organ growth and overall organ size. • A combination of genetic, cytological and molecular approaches was used to characterize the expression profile, subcellular localization and roles of OSR1 during organ growth. • Ectopic expression of OSR1 in Arabidopsis resulted in enlarged organs, as a consequence of increases in both cell number and cell size. OSR1 shares a conserved OSR domain with ARGOS and ARGOS-LIKE (ARL), which is sufficient for their functions in promoting organ growth. OSR1 is a plant hormone-responsive gene and appears to act redundantly with ARGOS and ARL during organ growth. The OSR proteins are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. • Our results suggest that three co-evolved members of the OSR family may act coordinately to orchestrate growth signals and cell proliferation and expansion, thereby affecting organ growth and final organ size.
