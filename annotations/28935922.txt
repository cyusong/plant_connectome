['28935922', 'Inhibition of cell division is an active response to DNA damage that enables  cells to maintain genome integrity. However, how DNA damage arrests the plant  cell cycle is largely unknown. Here, we show that the repressor-type R1R2R3-Myb  transcription factors (Rep-MYBs), which suppress G2/M-specific genes, are  required to inhibit cell division in response to DNA damage. Knockout mutants are  resistant to agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks and replication stress.  Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) can phosphorylate Rep-MYBs in vitro and are  involved in their proteasomal degradation. DNA damage reduces CDK activities and  causes accumulation of Rep-MYBs and cytological changes consistent with cell  cycle arrest. Our results suggest that CDK suppressors such as CDK inhibitors are  not sufficient to arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA damage but that  Rep-MYB-dependent repression of G2/M-specific genes is crucial, indicating an  essential function for Rep-MYBs in the DNA damage response.Inhibition of cell  division maintains genome integrity in response to DNA damage. Here Chen et al.  propose that DNA damage causes cell cycle arrest in the Arabidopsis root via  Rep-MYB transcription factor-mediated repression of G2/M-specific gene expression  in response to reduced cyclin-dependent kinase activity.', '2017 Sep 21', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-017-00676-4', 'Umeda']
