['32960882', 'Higher plants can continuously form new organs by the sustained activity of  pluripotent stem cells. These stem cells are embedded in meristems, where they  produce descendants, which undergo cell proliferation and differentiation  programs in a spatiotemporally-controlled manner. Under certain conditions,  pluripotency can be reestablished in descending cells and this reversion in cell  fate appears to be actively suppressed by the existing stem cell pool. Mutation  of the putative carboxypeptidase ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM1 (AMP1) in Arabidopsis  causes defects in the suppression of pluripotency in cells normally programmed  for differentiation, giving rise to unique hypertrophic phenotypes during  embryogenesis as well as in the shoot apical meristem. A role of AMP1 in the  miRNA-dependent control of translation has recently been established, however,  how this activity is connected to its developmental functions is not resolved.  Here we identify members of the cytochrome P450 clade CYP78A to act in parallel  with AMP1 to control cell fate in Arabidopsis. Mutation of CYP78A5 and its close  homolog CYP78A7 in a cyp78a5,7 double mutant caused suspensor-to-embryo  conversion and ectopic stem cell pool formation in the shoot meristem, phenotypes  characteristic for amp1. The tissues affected in the mutants showed pronounced  expression levels of AMP1 and CYP78A5 in wild type. A comparison of mutant  transcriptomic responses revealed an intriguing degree of overlap and highlighted  alterations in protein lipidation processes. Moreover, we also found elevated  protein levels of selected miRNA targets in cyp78a5,7. Based on comprehensive  genetic interaction studies we propose a model in which both enzyme classes act  on a common downstream process to sustain cell fate decisions in the early embryo  and the shoot apical meristem.', '2020 Sep', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1009043', 'ORCID:']
