Hydrogen peroxide-responsive pathways in roots of alkaligrass analyzed by proteomic studies and PutGLP enhance the plant tolerance to saline-, alkali- and cadmium-induced oxidative stresses. Oxidative stress adaptation is critical for plants in response to various stress environments. The halophyte alkaligrass (Puccinellia tenuiflora) is an outstanding pasture with strong tolerance to salt and alkali stresses. In this study, iTRAQ- and 2DE-based proteomics approaches, as well as qRT-PCR and molecular genetics, were employed to investigate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive mechanisms in alkaligrass roots. The evaluation of membrane integrity and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging systems, as well as abundance patterns of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive proteins/genes indicated that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated kinase signaling pathways, ROS homeostasis, osmotic modulation, and transcriptional regulation were pivotal for oxidative adaptation in alkaligrass roots. Overexpressing a P. tenuiflora germin-like protein (PutGLP) gene in Arabidopsis seedlings revealed that the apoplastic PutGLP with activities of oxalate oxidase and superoxide dismutase was predominantly expressed in roots and played important roles in ROS scavenging in response to salinity-, alkali-, and CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stresses. The results provide insights into the fine-tuned redox-responsive networks in halophyte roots.
