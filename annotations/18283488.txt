Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a key role in plant growth and development as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses. They are classified according to their sequence homology into four major groups (A-D). A large amount of information about MAPKs in groups A and B is available but few data of the C group have been reported. In this study, a C1 subgroup MAP kinase cDNA, PsMPK2, was isolated from Pisum sativum. PsMPK2 is expressed in vegetative (root and leaf) and reproductive (stamen, pistil and fruit) organs. Expression of PsMPK2 in Arabidopsis thaliana shows that mechanical injury and other stress signals as abscisic acid, jasmonic acid and hydrogen peroxide increase its kinase activity, extending previous results indicating that C1 subgroup MAPKs may be involved in the response to stress.
