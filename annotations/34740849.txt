The signaling pathway of the gaseous hormone ethylene is involved in plant reproduction, growth, development, and stress responses. During reproduction, the two synergid cells of the angiosperm female gametophyte both undergo programmed cell death (PCD)/degeneration but in a different manner: PCD/degeneration of one synergid facilitates pollen tube rupture and thereby the release of sperm cells, while PCD/degeneration of the other synergid blocks supernumerary pollen tubes. Ethylene signaling was postulated to participate in some of the synergid cell functions, such as pollen tube attraction and the induction of PCD/degeneration. However, ethylene-mediated induction of synergid PCD/degeneration and the role of ethylene itself have not been firmly established. Here, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out the five ethylene-biosynthesis 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO) genes and created Arabidopsis mutants free of ethylene production. The ethylene-free mutant plants showed normal triple responses when treated with ethylene rather than 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, but had increased lateral root density and enlarged petal sizes, which are typical phenotypes of mutants defective in ethylene signaling. Using these ethylene-free plants, we further demonstrated that production of ethylene is not necessarily required to trigger PCD/degeneration of the two synergid cells, but certain components of ethylene signaling including transcription factors ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) and EIN3-LIKE 1 (EIL1) are necessary for the death of the persistent synergid cell.
