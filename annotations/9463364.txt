['9463364', 'Dynamin, a GTP-binding protein found in rat brain, plays a role in endocytosis.  Suborganellar fractionation studies of Arabidopsis leaf tissue revealed that a  dynamin-like protein, ADL1, is localized in the thylakoid membranes of  chloroplasts. This notion was supported further by in vivo targeting experiments  using an ADL1-green fluorescent fusion protein and immunogold labeling with the  anti-ADL1 antibody. Transgenic plants harboring various deletion mutant genes of  ADL1 had a yellow leaf phenotype where the cells had very few chloroplasts. In  addition, the remaining chloroplasts appeared morphologically not fully  developed. The detailed structure of the chloroplasts revealed by electron  microscopy showed a greatly reduced amount of thylakoid membranes. Also, the  level of thylakoid membrane proteins such as the light-harvesting complex II and  CP29 was greatly reduced in these transgenic plants. When we examined the  expression of the ADL1 deletion mutant genes, these genes were highly expressed  at the transcriptional level. However, the mutant ADL1s were not detectable at  the protein level by Western blot analysis. Moreover, the endogenous ADL1 protein  level was greatly reduced in these transgenic plants, probably due to a  post-transcriptional silencing effect of the transgenes. We propose, therefore,  that ADLl is involved in the biogenesis of thylakoid membranes.', '1998 Feb 16', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/17.4.859', 'Hwang']
