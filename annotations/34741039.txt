Many toxic secondary metabolites produced by phytopathogens can subvert host immunity, and some of them are recognized as pathogenicity factors. Fusarium head blight and Verticillium wilt are destructive plant diseases worldwide. Using toxins produced by the causal fungi Fusarium graminearum and Verticillium dahliae as screening agents, here we show that the Arabidopsis P4 ATPases AtALA1 and AtALA7 are responsible for cellular detoxification of mycotoxins. Through AtALA1-/AtALA7-mediated vesicle transport, toxins are sequestered in vacuoles for degradation. Overexpression of AtALA1 and AtALA7 significantly increases the resistance of transgenic plants to F. graminearum and V. dahliae, respectively. Notably, the concentration of deoxynivalenol, a mycotoxin harmful to the health of humans and animals, was decreased in transgenic Arabidopsis siliques and maize seeds. This vesicle-mediated cell detoxification process provides a strategy to increase plant resistance against different toxin-associated diseases and to reduce the mycotoxin contamination in food and feed.
