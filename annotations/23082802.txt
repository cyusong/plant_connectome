['23082802', 'Transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) is a fraction of protein/DNA complexes  with RNA polymerase activity in the plastid. However, the function of most TAC  proteins remains unknown. Here, we isolated two allelic mutants of the gene for a  TAC component, TAC7, and performed functional analysis in plastid gene expression  and chloroplast development in Arabidopsis. tac7-1 is a mutant with a premature  translation termination isolated from a population treated with ethyl methane  sulfonate, and tac7-2 is a transfer-DNA tagging mutant. Both of them showed an  albino phenotype when grown under normal light conditions, and a few appressed  membranes were observed inside the defective chloroplasts. These data indicate  that TAC7 is important for thylakoid biogenesis. The TAC7 gene encodes an  uncharacterized 161 amino acids polypeptide localized in chloroplast. The  transcriptional levels of plastid-encoded polymerase (PEP)-dependent genes were  downregulated in tac7-2, suggesting that PEP activity was decreased in the  mutant. Yeast two-hybrid assay shows that TAC7 can interact with the four TAC  components including FLN1, TAC10, TAC12 and TAC14 which are involved in redox  state changes, phosphorylation processes and phytochrome-dependent light  signaling, respectively, These data indicate that TAC7 plays an important role  for TAC to regulate PEP-dependent chloroplast gene expression and chloroplast  development.', '2013 Jul', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01718.x', 'Yang']
