Flowering is a dynamic and synchronized process, the timing of which is finely tuned by various environmental signals. A T-DNA insertion mutant in Arabidopsis HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN-RELATED (AtHSPR) exhibited late-flowering phenotypes under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions compared to the wild-type, while over-expression of AtHSPR promoted flowering. Exogenous application of gibberellin (GA) partially rescued the late-flowering mutant phenotype under both LD and SD conditions, suggesting that AtHSPR is involved in GA biosynthesis and/or the GA signaling that promotes flowering. Under SD or low-light conditions, the Athspr mutant exhibited late flowering together with reduced pollen viability and seed set, defective phenotypes that were partially rescued by GA treatment. qRT-PCR assays confirmed that GA biosynthetic genes were down-regulated, that GA catabolic genes were up-regulated, and that the levels of bioactive GA and its intermediates were decreased in Athspr under both SD and low-light/LD, further suggesting that AtHSPR could be involved in the GA pathway under SD and low-light conditions. Furthermore, AtHSPR interacted in vitro with OFP1 and KNAT5, which are transcriptional repressors of GA20ox1 in GA biosynthesis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that AtHSPR plays a positive role in GA- and light intensity-mediated regulation of flowering and seed set.
