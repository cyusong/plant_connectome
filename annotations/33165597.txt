Necrotrophic fungi cause devastating diseases in both horticultural and agronomic crops, but our understanding of plant defense responses against these pathogens is still limited. In this study, we demonstrated that WRKY75 positively regulates jasmonate (JA)-mediated plant defense against necrotrophic fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola, and also affects the sensitivity of plants to JA-inhibited seed germination and root growth. Quantitative analysis indicated that several JA-associated genes, such as OCTADECANOID-RESPONSIVE ARABIDOPSIS (ORA59) and PLANT DEFENSIN 1.2A (PDF1.2), were significantly reduced in expression in wrky75 mutants, and enhanced in WRKY75 overexpressing transgenic plants. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that WRKY75 directly binds to the promoter of ORA59 and represses itstranscription. In vivo and in vitro experiments suggested that WRKY75 interacts with several JASMONATE ZIM-domain proteins, repressors of the JA signaling pathway. We determined that JASMONATE-ZIM-DOMAIN PROTEIN 8 (JAZ8) represses the transcriptional function of WRKY75, thereby attenuating the expression of its regulation. Overexpression of JAZ8 repressed plant defense responses to B. cinerea. Our study provides evidence that WRKY75 functions as a critical component of the JA-mediated signaling pathway to positively regulate Arabidopsis defense responses to necrotrophic pathogens.
