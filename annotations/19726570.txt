['19726570', 'The stamen, which consists of an anther and a filament, is the male reproductive  organ in a flower. The specification of stamen identity in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) is controlled by a combination of the B genes APETALA3  (AP3) and PISTILLATA, the C gene AGAMOUS (AG), and the E genes SEPALLATA1 (SEP1)  to SEP4. The "floral organ-building" gene SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) plays a  central role in regulating anther cell differentiation. However, much less is  known about how "floral organ identity" and floral organ-building genes interact  to control floral organ development. In this study, we report that ectopic  expression of SPL/NZZ not only affects flower development in the wild-type  background but also leads to the transformation of petal-like organs into  stamen-like organs in flowers of ap2-1, a weak ap2 mutant allele. Moreover, our  loss-of-function analysis indicates that the spl/nzz mutant enhances the  phenotype of the ag weak allele ag-4. Furthermore, ectopic expression and  overexpression of SPL/NZZ altered expression of AG, SEP3, and AP2 in rosette  leaves and flowers, while ectopic expression of SPL/NZZ resulted in ectopic  expression of AG and SEP3 in the outer whorls of flowers. Our results indicate  that the SPL/NZZ gene is engaged in controlling stamen identity via interacting  with genes required for stamen identity in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.145896', 'Zhao']
