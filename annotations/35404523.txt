Excessive nitrogen fertilizer application is harmful to the environment and reduces the quality of cereal crops. Maintaining crop yields under low nitrogen (LN) conditions and improving quality are important goals for cereal crop breeding. Although the effects of nitrogen assimilation on crop nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) have been intensively studied, natural variations of the key assimilation genes underlying grain development and quality are largely unclear. Here, we identified an NUE-associated gene, OsGS1;1, encoding glutamine synthase, through genome-wide association analysis, followed by validation experiments and functional analysis. Fifteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the OsGS1;1 region led to alternative splicing that generated two functional transcripts: OsGS1;1a and OsGS1;1b. The elite haplotype of OsGS1;1 showed high OsGS1;1b activity, which improved NUE, affected grain development, and reduced amylose content. The results show that OsGS1;1, which is induced under LN conditions, affects grain formation by regulating sugar metabolism and may provide a new avenue for the breeding of high-yield and high-quality rice (Oryza sativa).
