VIP1 (VIRE2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1) is a bZIP transcription factor in Arabidopsis thaliana. VIP1 and its close homologs (i.e., Arabidopsis group I bZIP proteins) are present in the cytoplasm under steady conditions, but are transiently localized to the nucleus when cells are exposed to hypo-osmotic conditions, which mimic mechanical stimuli such as touch. Recently we have reported that overexpression of a repression domain-fused form of VIP1 represses the expression of some touch-responsive genes, changes structures and/or local auxin responses of the root cap cells, and enhances the touch-induced root waving. This raises the possibility that VIP1 suppresses touch-induced responses. VIP1 should be useful to further characterize touch responses of plants. Here we discuss 2 seemingly interesting perspectives about VIP1: (1) What factors are involved in regulating the nuclear localization of VIP1?; (2) What can be done to further characterize the physiological functions of VIP1 and other Arabidopsis group I bZIP proteins?
