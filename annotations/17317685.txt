Petunia plants that exhibit a white-flowering phenotype as a consequence of chalcone synthase transgene-induced silencing occasionally give rise to revertant branches that produce flowers with wild-type pigmentation. Transcription run-on assays confirmed that the production of white flowers is caused by post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and indicated that transgene transcription is repressed in the revertant plants, providing evidence that induction of PTGS depends on the transcription rate. Transcriptional repression of the transgene was associated with cytosine methylation at CpG, CpNpG and CpNpN sites, and the expression was restored by treatment with either 5-azacytidine or trichostatin A. These results demonstrate that epigenetic changes occurred in the PTGS line, and these changes interfere with the initiation of transgene transcription, leading to a reversion of the PTGS phenotype.
