['33284325', 'Plant tetrapyrroles, including heme and bilins, are synthesized in plastids. Heme  oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of heme to the linear  tetrapyrrole biliverdin as the initial step in bilin biosynthesis. Besides the  canonical alpha-helical HO that is conserved from prokaryotes to human, a subfamily  of non-canonical dimeric beta-barrel HO has been found in bacteria. In this work, we  discovered that the Arabidopsis locus AT3G03890 encodes a dimeric beta-barrel  protein that is structurally related to the putative non-canonical HO and is  located in chloroplasts. The recombinant protein was able to bind and degrade  heme in a manner different from known HO proteins. Crystal structure of the  heme-protein complex reveals that the heme-binding site is in the interdimer  interface and the heme iron is coordinated by a fixed water molecule. Our results  identify a new protein that may function additionally in the tetrapyrrole  biosynthetic pathway.', '2020 Dec 7', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BCJ20200712', 'Liu']
