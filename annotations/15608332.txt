In higher plants, the Ndh complex reduces plastoquinones and is involved in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I, supplying extra-ATP for photosynthesis, particularly under environmental stress conditions. Based on plastid genome sequences, the Ndh complex would contain 11 subunits (NDH-A to -K), but homologies with bacterial complex indicate the probable existence of additional subunits. To identify missing subunits, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) NDH-H was His tagged at its N terminus using plastid transformation. A functional Ndh subcomplex was purified by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography and its subunit composition analyzed by mass spectrometry. Five plastid encoded subunits (NDH-A, -H, -I, -J, and -K) were identified as well as three new subunits (NDH-M, -N, and -O) homologous to cyanobacterial and higher plant proteins. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants missing one of these new subunits lack a functional Ndh complex, and NDH-M and NDH-N are not detected in a tobacco transformant lacking the Ndh complex. We discuss the involvement of these three nuclear-encoded subunits in the functional integrity of the plastidial complex.
