Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) OsNLA1 has been proposed to play a crucial role in regulating phosphate (Pi) acquisition in roots, similar to that of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtNLA. However, unlike <i>AtNLA</i>, <i>OsNLA1</i> is not a target of miR827, a Pi starvation-induced microRNA. It is, therefore, of interest to know whether the expression of <i>OsNLA1</i> depends on Pi supply and how it is regulated. In this study, we provide evidence that OsNLA1 controls Pi acquisition by directing the degradation of several OsPHT1 Pi transporters (i.e. OsPT1/2/4/7/8/12). We further show that OsNLA1 has an additional function in reproduction and uncover the mechanism of its expression regulation. Analysis of mRNA levels, promoter-GUS activity, and protoplast transient expression showed that the expression of <i>OsNLA1.1</i>, the most abundant transcript variant, is up-regulated in response to increasing Pi supply. The <i>OsNLA1</i> promoter region was found to contain an upstream open reading frame that is required for Pi-responsive expression regulation. <i>OsNLA1</i> promoter activity was observed in roots, ligules, leaves, sheaths, pollen grains, and surrounding the vascular tissues of anthers, suggesting that OsNLA1 is important throughout the development of rice. Disruption of <i>OsNLA1</i> resulted in increased Pi uptake from roots as well as impaired pollen development and reduced grain production. In summary, our study reveals that Pi-induced <i>OsNLA1</i> expression regulated by a unique mechanism functions in Pi acquisition, Pi translocation, and reproductive success.
