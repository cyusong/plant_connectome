['36306001', 'De novo genes created in the plant mitochondrial genome have frequently been  transferred into the nuclear genome via intergenomic gene transfer events.  Therefore, plant mitochondria might be a source of de novo genes in the nuclear  genome. However, the functions of de novo genes originating from mitochondria and  the evolutionary fate remain unclear. Here, we revealed that an Arabidopsis  thaliana specific small coding gene derived from the mitochondrial genome  regulates floral transition. We previously identified 49 candidate de novo genes  that induce abnormal morphological changes on overexpression. We focused on a  candidate gene derived from the mitochondrial genome (sORF2146) that encodes 66  amino acids. Comparative genomic analyses indicated that the mitochondrial  sORF2146 emerged in the Brassica lineage as a de novo gene. The nuclear sORF2146  emerged following an intergenomic gene transfer event in the A. thaliana after  the divergence between Arabidopsis and Capsella. Although the nuclear and  mitochondrial sORF2146 sequences are the same in A. thaliana, only the nuclear  sORF2146 is transcribed. The nuclear sORF2146 product is localized in  mitochondria, which may be associated with the pseudogenization of the  mitochondrial sORF2146. To functionally characterize the nuclear sORF2146, we  performed a transcriptomic analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing the  nuclear sORF2146. Flowering transition-related genes were highly regulated in the  transgenic plants. Subsequent phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the  overexpression and knockdown of sORF2146 in transgenic plants resulted in delayed  and early flowering, respectively. These findings suggest that a lineage-specific  de novo gene derived from mitochondria has an important regulatory effect on  floral transition.', '2023 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-022-01320-6', 'ORCID:']
