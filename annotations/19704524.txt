In a recent paper, we reported that both ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) are important for selenium (Se) resistance in Arabidopsis.1 Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species were associated with ethylene and JA production in a Se-resistant Arabidopsis ecotype. Here, we further discuss the functions of these phytohormones, and their possible interactions, in plant Se resistance and -accumulation, placing our data in a broader perspective of other recently published papers.
