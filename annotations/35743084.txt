Melatonin (MEL), a ubiquitous indolamine molecule, has gained interest in the last few decades due to its regulatory role in plant metabolism. Likewise, nitric oxide (NO), a gasotransmitter, can also affect plant molecular pathways due to its function as a signaling molecule. Both MEL and NO can interact at multiple levels under abiotic stress, starting with their own biosynthetic pathways and inducing a particular signaling response in plants. Moreover, their interaction can result in the formation of NOmela, a very recently discovered nitrosated form of MEL with promising roles in plant physiology. This review summarizes the role of NO and MEL molecules during plant development and fruit ripening, as well as their interactions. Due to the impact of climate-change-related abiotic stresses on agriculture, this review also focuses on the role of these molecules in mediating abiotic stress tolerance and the main mechanisms by which they operate, from the upregulation of the entire antioxidant defense system to the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of important molecules. Their individual interaction and crosstalk with phytohormones and H<sub>2</sub>S are also discussed. Finally, we introduce and summarize the little information available about NOmela, an emerging and still very unknown molecule, but that seems to have a stronger potential than MEL and NO separately in mediating plant stress response.
