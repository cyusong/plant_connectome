MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to regulate expression of genes under stress. We report here the deep sequencing of small RNAs expressed during control, short and prolonged heat stress and recovery. Genome-wide identification of miRNAs in tolerant (Nagina 22) and susceptible (Vandana) rice cultivars was performed in 16 samples representing root and shoot of 13-day-old seedlings. The expression profile of miRNAs was analysed in 36 pairwise combinations to identify the genotype-, treatment- and tissue-dependent expression of miRNAs. Small-RNA sequencing of 16 libraries yielded ~271 million high-quality raw sequences; 162 miRNA families were identified. The highly expressed miRNAs in rice tissues were miR166, miR168, miR1425, miR529, mR162, miR1876, and miR1862. Expression of osa-miR1436, osa-miR5076, osa-miR5161, and osa-miR6253 was observed only in stressed tissue of both genotypes indicating their general role in heat stress response. Expression of osa-miR1439, osa-miR1848, osa-miR2096, osa-miR2106, osa-miR2875, osa-miR3981, osa-miR5079, osa-miR5151, osa-miR5484, osa-miR5792, and osa-miR5812 was observed only in Nagina 22 during high temperature, suggesting a specific role of these miRNAs in heat stress tolerance. This study provides details of the repertoire of miRNAs expressed in root and shoot of heat susceptible and tolerant rice genotypes under heat stress and recovery.
