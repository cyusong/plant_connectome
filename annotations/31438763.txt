Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for optimal plant growth and ultimately for crop productivity Nitrate serves as the main N source for most plants. Although it seems a well-established fact that nitrate concentration affects flowering, its molecular mode of action in flowering time regulation was poorly understood. We recently found how nitrate, present at the shoot apical meristem (SAM), controls flowering time In this short communication, we present data on the tissue-specific expression patterns of <i>NITRATE REDUCTASE 1 (NIA1)</i> and <i>NIA2 in planta</i>. We show that transcripts of both genes are present throughout the life cycle of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants with <i>NIA1</i> being predominantly active in leaves and <i>NIA2</i> in meristematic tissues.

N: !affects! flowering
NIA1: !localizes to! leaves
NIA2: !localizes to! meristematic tissues
