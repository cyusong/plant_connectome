The regulation of plant physiology by plant mineral nutrient transporter (MNT) is well understood. Recently, the extensive characterization of beneficial and pathogenic plant-microbe interactions has defined the roles for MNTs in such relationships. In this review, we summarize the roles of diverse nutrient transporters in the symbiotic or pathogenic relationships between plants and microorganisms. In doing so, we highlight how MNTs of plants and microbes can act in a coordinated manner. In symbiotic relationships, MNTs play key roles in the establishment of the interaction between the host plant and rhizobium or mycorrhizae as well in the subsequent coordinated transport of nutrients. Additionally, MNTs may also regulate the colonization or degeneration of symbiotic microorganisms by reflecting the nutrient status of the plant and soil. This allows the host plant obtain nutrients from the soil in the most optimal manner. With pathogenic-interactions, MNTs influence pathogen proliferation, the efficacy of the host's biochemical defense and related signal transduction mechanisms. We classify the MNT effects in plant-pathogen interactions as either indirect by influencing the nutrient status and fitness of the pathogen, or direct by initiating host defense mechanisms. While such observations indicate the fundamental importance of MNTs in governing the interactions with a range of microorganisms, further work is needed to develop an integrative understanding of their functions.
