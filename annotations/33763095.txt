Plants undergo profound physiological changes when transitioning from vegetative to reproductive growth. These changes affect crop production, as in the case of leafy vegetables. Lettuce is one of the most valuable leafy vegetable crops in the world. Past genetic studies have identified multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect the timing of the floral transition in lettuce. Extensive functional molecular studies in the model organism Arabidopsis provide the opportunity to transfer knowledge to lettuce to explore the mechanisms through which genetic variations translate into changes in flowering time. In this review, we integrated results from past genetic and molecular studies for flowering time in lettuce with orthology and functional inference from Arabidopsis. This summarizes the basis for all known genetic variation underlying the phenotypic diversity of flowering time in lettuce and how the genetics of flowering time in lettuce projects onto the established pathways controlling flowering time in plants. This comprehensive overview reveals patterns across experiments as well as areas in need of further study. Our review also represents a resource for developing cultivars with delayed flowering time.
