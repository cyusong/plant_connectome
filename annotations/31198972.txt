The plant hormone auxin is essential for plant growth and development, controlling both organ development and overall plant architecture. Auxin homeostasis is regulated by coordination of biosynthesis, transport, conjugation, sequestration/storage, and catabolism to optimize concentration-dependent growth responses and adaptive responses to temperature, water stress, herbivory, and pathogens. At present, the best defined pathway of auxin biosynthesis is the TAA/YUC route, in which the tryptophan aminotransferases TAA and TAR and YUCCA flavin-dependent monooxygenases produce the auxin indole-3-acetic acid from tryptophan. This review highlights recent advances in our knowledge of TAA/YUC-dependent auxin biosynthesis focusing on membrane localization of auxin biosynthetic enzymes, differential regulation in root and shoot tissue, and auxin biosynthesis during abiotic stress.
