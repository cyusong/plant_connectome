In previous work, we identified that exposure to limited water availability induced changes in cell wall composition of mature Helianthus annuus L. leaves that affected mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (gm). However, it is unclear on which timescale these changes in cell wall composition occurred. Here, we subjected H. annuus to control (i.e. water availability), different levels of short-term water deficit stress (ST), long-term water deficit stress (LT), and long-term water deficit stress followed by gradual recoveries addressed at different timescales (LT-Rec) to evaluate the dynamics of modifications in the main composition of cell wall (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins and lignins) affecting photosynthesis. During gradual ST treatments, pectins enhancement was associated with gm decline. However, during LT-Rec, pectins content decreased significantly after only 5 h, while hemicelluloses and lignins amounts changed after 24 h, all being uncoupled from gm. Surprisingly, lignins increased by around 200% compared with control and were related to stomatal conductance to gas diffusion (gs) during LT-Rec. Although we suspect that the accuracy of the protocols to determine cell wall composition should be re-evaluated, we demonstrate for the first time that a highly dynamic cell wall composition turnover differently affects photosynthesis in plants subjected to distinct water regimes.
