Longan (<i>Dimocarpus Longan</i>) is one of the most important fruit crops in Southern China. Lack of available Mg in acidic soil conditions is a limitation to further increasing longan yield. Magnesium transporter (MGT/MRS2) mediates the uptake, transport, and redistribution of Mg2+ in higher plants. To understand the role of MGTs family members in longan Mg deficiency. We identified and analyzed the protein characteristics, phylogeny, expression changes, subcellular localization, and transcriptional regulation of DlMGTs members. The results showed that, twelve DlMGTs are localized in the cell membrane, chloroplast, and nucleus. The evolutionary differences in MGTs between herbaceous and woody species in different plants. The DlMGTs promoters contained many cis-acting elements and transcription factor binding sites related to the hormone, environmental, and stress response. Subcellular localization assays showed that DlMGT1 localizes in the cell membrane of <i>Arabidopsis</i> protoplasts. The candidate transcription factor DlGATA16, which may regulate the expression of DlMGT1, was localized in the nucleus of tobacco leaves. Dual luciferase analysis demonstrated that DlGATA16 is a potential factor regulating the transcriptional activity of DlMGT1. In this study, we identified and analyzed DlMGTs on a genome-wide scale and the subcellular localization and interaction of DlMGT1 and DlGATA16, which has important implications for further functional analysis studies of MGTs and the use of MGT for longan genetic improvement.
