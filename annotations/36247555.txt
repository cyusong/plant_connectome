Brassinosteriod (BR) plays important roles in regulation of plant growth, development and environmental responses. BR signaling regulates multiple biological processes through controlling the activity of BES1/BZR1 regulators. Apart from the roles in the promotion of plant growth, BR is also involved in regulation of the root foraging response under low nitrogen, however how BR signaling regulate this process remains unclear. Here we show that BES1 and LBD37 antagonistically regulate root foraging response under low nitrogen conditions. Both the transcriptional level and dephosphorylated level of BES1, is significant induced by low nitrogen, predominantly in root. Phenotypic analysis showed that <i>BES1</i> gain-of-function mutant or <i>BES1</i> overexpression transgenic plants exhibits progressive outgrowth of lateral root in response to low nitrogen and BES1 negatively regulates repressors of nitrate signaling pathway and positively regulates several key genes required for NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> uptake and signaling. In contrast, <i>BES1</i> knock-down mutant <i>BES1-RNAi</i> exhibited a dramatical reduction of lateral root elongation in response to low N. Furthermore, we identified a BES1 interacting protein, LBD37, which is a negative repressor of N availability signals. Our results showed that BES1 can inhibit LBD37 transcriptional repression on N-responsive genes. Our results thus demonstrated that BES1-LBD37 module acts critical nodes to integrate BR signaling and nitrogen signaling to modulate the root forging response at LN condition.
