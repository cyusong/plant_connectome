['12172022', 'We present the cloning and characterization of an Arabidopsis gene, FRD3,  involved in iron homeostasis. Plants carrying any of the three alleles of frd3  constitutively express three strategy I iron deficiency responses and misexpress  a number of iron deficiency-regulated genes. Mutant plants also accumulate  approximately twofold excess iron, fourfold excess manganese, and twofold excess  zinc in their shoots. frd3-3 was first identified as man1. The FRD3 gene is  expressed at detectable levels in roots but not in shoots and is predicted to  encode a membrane protein belonging to the multidrug and toxin efflux family.  Other members of this family have been implicated in a variety of processes and  are likely to transport small organic molecules. The phenotypes of frd3 mutant  plants, which are consistent with a defect in either iron deficiency signaling or  iron distribution, indicate that FRD3 is an important component of iron  homeostasis in Arabidopsis.', '2002 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.001495', 'Guerinot']
