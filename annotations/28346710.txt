['28346710', 'Thiamin diphosphate (TPP, vitamin B(1) ) is an essential coenzyme present in all  organisms. Animals obtain TPP from their diets, but plants synthesize TPPde novo.  We isolated and characterized an Arabidopsis pale green1 (pale1) mutant that  contained higher concentrations of thiamin monophosphate (TMP) and less thiamin  and TPP than the wild type. Supplementation with thiamin, but not the thiazole  and pyrimidine precursors, rescued the mutant phenotype, indicating that the  pale1 mutant is a thiamin-deficient mutant. Map-based cloning and whole-genome  sequencing revealed that the pale1 mutant has a mutation in At5g32470 encoding a  TMP phosphatase of the TPP biosynthesis pathway. We further confirmed that the  mutation of At5g32470 is responsible for the mutant phenotypes by complementing  the pale1 mutant with constructs overexpressing full-length At5g32470. Most plant  TPP biosynthetic enzymes are located in the chloroplasts and cytosol, but  At5g32470-GFP localized to the mitochondrion of the root, hypocotyl, mesophyll  and guard cells of the 35S:At5g32470-GFP complemented plants. The subcellular  localization of a functional TMP phosphatase suggests that the complete vitamin  B1 biosynthesis pathway may involve the chloroplasts, mitochondria and cytosol in  plants. Analysis of PALE1 promoter-uidA activity revealed that PALE1 is mainly  expressed in vascular tissues of Arabidopsis seedlings. Quantitative RT-PCR  analysis of TPP biosynthesis genes and genes encoding the TPP-dependent enzymes  pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase revealed  that the transcript levels of these genes were upregulated in the pale1 mutant.  These results suggest that endogenous levels of TPP may affect the expression of  genes involved in TPP biosynthesis and TPP-dependent enzymes.', '2017 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13552', 'Hsieh']
