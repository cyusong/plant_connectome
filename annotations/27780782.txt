Protein arginine methylation plays important roles in diverse biological processes, but its role in regulating shoot regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the function of the protein arginine methyltransferase AtPRMT5 during de novo shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis. AtPRMT5 encodes a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that methylates proteins, including histones and RNA splicing factors. The frequency of shoot regeneration and the number of shoots per callus were decreased in the atprmt5 mutant compared with those in the wild type. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that AtPRMT5 targets KIP-RELATED PROTEINs (KRPs), which encode the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that repress the cell cycle. During shoot regeneration, the KRP transcript level increased in the atprmt5 mutant, which resulted from reduced histone H4R3 methylation in the KRP promoter. Overexpression of KRP significantly reduced the frequency of shoot regeneration and shoot number per callus. Furthermore, abnormal pre-mRNA splicing in the gene RELATED TO KPC1 (RKP), which encodes an ubiquitin E3 ligase, was detected in the atprmt5 mutant. RKP functions in regulating KRP protein degradation, and mutation in RKP inhibited shoot regeneration. Thus, AtPRMT5 regulated shoot regeneration through histone modification-mediated KRP transcription and RKP pre-mRNA splicing. Our findings provide new insights into the function of protein arginine methylation in de novo shoot regeneration.
