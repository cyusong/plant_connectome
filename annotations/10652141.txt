['10652141', 'Transport across the nuclear envelope is mediated by transport receptors from the  Importin beta family. We identified Exportin 1 from Arabidopsis (AtXPO1/AtCRM1)  as the nuclear export receptor for proteins carrying leucine-rich nuclear export  signals (NESs). AtXPO1 shares 42-50% identity with its functional homologues from  humans and yeasts. We functionally characterised AtXPO1 by its interaction with  NESs of animal and plant proteins, which is inhibited by the cytotoxin leptomycin  B (LMB), and also by its interaction with the small GTPase Ran1 in the yeast  two-hybrid system. Furthermore, we demonstrated the existence of a nuclear export  pathway for proteins in plants. For the characterisation of nuclear export  activities, we established an in vivo assay based on the localisation equilibrium  of a GFP reporter protein fused to both a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) and  an NES motif. Using this in vivo assay we demonstrated that the NES of the  heterologous protein Rev is also functional in plants and that its export is  inhibited by LMB. In addition, we identified a leucine-rich NES in the  Arabidopsis protein AtRanBP1a. The NES, which is located at the carboxy terminus  of the protein, is disrupted by mutating three long chain hydrophobic amino acid  residues to alanine (L176A, L179A, V181A). In BY-2 protoplasts the NES of  AtRanBP1a is functionally indistinguishable from the Rev NES. Our results  demonstrate that the machinery for the nuclear export of proteins is functionally  conserved in plants.', '1999 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00644.x', 'Merkle']
