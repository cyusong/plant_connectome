['26908759', 'The chloroplast originated from the endosymbiosis of an ancient photosynthetic  bacterium by a eukaryotic cell. Remarkably, the chloroplast has retained elements  of a bacterial stress response pathway that is mediated by the signaling  nucleotides guanosine penta- and tetraphosphate (ppGpp). However, an  understanding of the mechanism and outcomes of ppGpp signaling in the  photosynthetic eukaryotes has remained elusive. Using the model plant Arabidopsis  thaliana, we show that ppGpp is a potent regulator of chloroplast gene expression  in vivo that directly reduces the quantity of chloroplast transcripts and  chloroplast-encoded proteins. We then go on to demonstrate that the antagonistic  functions of different plant RelA SpoT homologs together modulate ppGpp levels to  regulate chloroplast function and show that they are required for optimal plant  growth, chloroplast volume, and chloroplast breakdown during dark-induced and  developmental senescence. Therefore, our results show that ppGpp signaling is not  only linked to stress responses in plants but is also an important mediator of  cooperation between the chloroplast and the nucleocytoplasmic compartment during  plant growth and development.', '2016 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00045', 'ORCID:']
