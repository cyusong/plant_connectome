Plants must adapt to cope with adverse environmental conditions that affect their growth and development. To overcome these constraints, they can alter their developmental patterns by modulating cellular processes and activating stress-responsive signals. Alongside the activation of the antioxidant (AOX) system, a high number of genes are expressed, and proteins must be distributed to the correct locations within the cell. The endomembrane system and associated vesicles thus play an important role. Several pathways have been associated with adverse environmental conditions, which is the case for the exocyst-positive organelle-EXPO. The present work, using Arabidopsis mutants with T-DNA insertions in the gene <i>EXO70</i>, essential for EXPO vesicles formation, was designed to characterise the anatomical (morphology and root length), biochemical (quantification of stress markers and antioxidant system components), and molecular responses (gene expression) to abiotic stresses (saline, drought, oxidative, and metal-induced toxicity). The results obtained showed that mutant plants behave differently from the wild type (WT) plants. Therefore, in the <i>exo70</i> mutant, morphological changes were more noticeable in plants under stress, and the non-enzymatic component of the antioxidant system was activated, with no alterations to the enzymatic component. Furthermore, other defence strategies, such as autophagy, did not show important changes. These results confirmed the EXPO as an important structure for tolerance/adaptation to stress.
