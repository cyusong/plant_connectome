['31084884', 'Seeds germination or dormancy is strictly controlled by endogenous phytohormone  signal and environment cues. High temperature (HT) suppresses seeds germination  or triggers seeds dormancy but underlying mechanism by which HT mediates seeds  germination thermoinhibition needs more investigating. SOM is reported as the  critical factor negatively controls light-irradiation seeds germination by  altering Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin acid (GA) biosynthesis. Here we  found that HT accelerates SOM expressing through ABA signal transduction  component ABI3, both of abi3 and som mutants seeds show high germination rate  under HT in contrast to wild type seeds. Using ABI3 as the bait, we identified  the epigenetic factor Powerdress (PWR) as the ABI3 interaction protein. Genetic  and physiological analysis showed that PWR negatively control the expressing of  SOM, and overexpressing PWR enhanced, while pwr mutant reduced, seeds germination  thermotolerance. Without HT stress, PWR accelerated the histone H3 deacetylation  level and H2A.Z deposition at SOM locus, and thus suppressed ABI3-dependent SOM  transcription for seeds germination, HT stress block PWR transcriptional level,  thus attenuated the inhibition effect of PWR on SOM expressing, resulting into  seeds germination thermoinhibition. Thus our finding propose a new function of  PWR in controlling seeds germination under HT through histone acetylation  modification and H2A.Z deposition.', '2019 Jul', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.04.001', 'Hu']
