Plant growth and development are influenced by the interactions with other organisms including bacteria, fungi, herbivores and neighboring plants. Plant density influences the phase transitions during the entire life cycle and root architecture through a mechanism involving auxin and MEDIATOR 25 in Arabidopsis thaliana, but the nature of the signals that are perceived in response to increasing number of neighbors remains elusive. Here, we report that plant-plant perception can occur distantly, since root growth and auxin response in Arabidopsis seedlings grown at high plant density into half-divided Petri plates, decreased both primary root growth and lateral root formation in comparison with single plants grown alone, which correlates with reduced auxin response at the primary root tip. It is possible that a diffusible, yet unidentified volatile can be perceived by neighbors to synchronize physiological and developmental behavior.
