Biological invasion poses several biotic and abiotic challenges due to abrupt distribution shifts. Invasive species may benefit from local adaptation responding to environmental stresses during colonization. Saltcedar (<i>Tamarix</i>), a notorious invasive shrub in the western US introduced from Eurasia may have adapted to low rainfall as the species widely occupies the arid land throughout the southwestern US. We investigated variation of quantitative traits in saltcedar between two regions exhibiting opposing average annual precipitations under experimentally manipulated water treatments to test local adaptation. We measured eight quantitative traits, proxies for fitness and genotyped 64 individual samples using genotype by sequencing technique. To test local adaptation, we applied <i>Q<sub>CT</sub></i> - <i>F<sub>CT</sub></i> test based on null distribution of <i>F<sub>CT</sub></i> estimated from 2,697 genome-wide SNPs and <i>Q<sub>CT</sub></i> estimated for the eight phenotypic traits measured. Saltcedar in the southwestern US exhibited a significant interaction between the degree of leaf loss (biomass loss by senesced leaves to total biomass) under simulated drought conditions and the origins from which the genotypes were collected, either relatively high or low rainfall regimes. The divergence found in leaf loss was significantly greater among regions than the expected given the genetic divergence on neutral loci suggesting signature of local adaptation responding to drought. The results demonstrate adaptive potential of saltcedar populations to extreme drought. As extreme aridity is often predicted in climate models across the southwestern US, the western saltcedar genotypes locally adapted to drought may further expand their ranges in this region.
