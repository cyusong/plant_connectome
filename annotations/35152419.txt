Wood formation is controlled by transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) involving regulatory homeostasis determined by combinations of transcription factor (TF)-DNA and TF-TF interactions. Functions of TF-TF interactions in wood formation are still in the early stages of identification. PtrMYB074 is a woody dicot-specific TF in a TRN for wood formation in Populus trichocarpa. Here, using yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we conducted a genome-wide screening for PtrMYB074 interactors and identified 54 PtrMYB074-TF pairs. Of these pairs, 53 are novel. We focused on the PtrMYB074-PtrWRKY19 pair, the most highly expressed and xylem-specific interactor, and its direct transregulatory target, PtrbHLH186, the xylem-specific one of the pair's only two direct TF target genes. Using transient and CRISPR-mediated transgenesis in P. trichocarpa coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that PtrMYB074 is recruited by PtrWRKY19 and that the PtrMYB074-PtrWRKY19 dimers are required to transactive PtrbHLH186. Overexpressing PtrbHLH186 in P. trichocarpa resulted in retarded plant growth, increased guaiacyl lignin, a higher proportion of smaller stem vessels and strong drought-tolerant phenotypes. Knowledge of the PtrMYB074-PtrWRKY19-PtrbHLH186 regulation may help design genetic controls of optimal growth and wood formation to maximize beneficial wood properties while minimizing negative effects on growth.
