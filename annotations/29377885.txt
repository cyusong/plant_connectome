['29377885', 'Auxin is unique among plant hormones due to its directional transport that is  mediated by the polarly distributed PIN auxin transporters at the plasma  membrane. The canalization hypothesis proposes that the auxin feedback on its  polar flow is a crucial, plant-specific mechanism mediating multiple  self-organizing developmental processes. Here, we used the auxin effect on the  PIN polar localization in Arabidopsis thaliana roots as a proxy for the auxin  feedback on the PIN polarity during canalization. We performed microarray  experiments to find regulators of this process that act downstream of auxin. We  identified genes that were transcriptionally regulated by auxin in an AXR3/IAA17-  and ARF7/ARF19-dependent manner. Besides the known components of the PIN  polarity, such as PID and PIP5K kinases, a number of potential new regulators  were detected, among which the WRKY23 transcription factor, which was  characterized in more detail. Gain- and loss-of-function mutants confirmed a role  for WRKY23 in mediating the auxin effect on the PIN polarity. Accordingly,  processes requiring auxin-mediated PIN polarity rearrangements, such as vascular  tissue development during leaf venation, showed a higher WRKY23 expression and  required the WRKY23 activity. Our results provide initial insights into the auxin  transcriptional network acting upstream of PIN polarization and, potentially,  canalization-mediated plant development.', '2018 Jan', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1007177', 'ORCID:']
