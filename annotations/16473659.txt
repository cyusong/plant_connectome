A cDNA clone (designated as SsPR10, GenBank Accession Number AY660753 ) encoding a PR10 protein from yellow-fruit nightshade (Solanum surattense) was isolated and characterized. SsPR10 encoded a 160-amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 17.58 kDa and pI of 5.29. Sequence alignments showed that SsPR10 had high identity (68.1%) with CaPR10, but had only about 31.7% identity with JIOsPR10 at the amino acid level. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis indicated that SsPR10 belonged to a multigene family. The constitutively expressed SsPR10 was detected to be the highest in roots of the sterile seedlings cultured in jars, while SsPR10 expression was the highest in old yellow leaves from the seedlings incubated with sap containing TMV. SsPR10 always expressed at slightly higher level in senescent leaves than in tender ones under both conditions. Further expression analysis revealed that the signaling components of defense/stress pathways (MeJA, SA, ABA, GA3, H2O2 and Cu2+) up-regulated significantly the SsPR10 mRNA levels over the control. However, darkness failed to induce SsPR10 expression and its expression was also inhibited by cold treatment. The SsPR10 was successfully expressed in Eschericha coli and the expressed protein was purified to near homogeneity. The dialytically renatured SsPR10 protein without phosphorylation exhibited ribonucleolytic activity against S. surattense leaf total RNA preparations and could inhibit hyphal growth of Pyricularia oryzae. Our findings suggest that the novel stress- and pathogen-inducible SsPR10 with ribonucleolytic and antimicrobial activity participates not only in the defense/stress response pathways but also in plants' growth, development and senescence.
