Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as extracellular ATP, act as danger signals in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Extracellular ATP is perceived by a plant purinoceptor, P2 receptor kinase 1 (P2K1), inducing downstream signaling for defense responses. How ATP induces these defense responses has not been well studied. A recent study by Tripathi et al. (Plant Physiology, 176: 511-523, 2018) revealed a synergistic interaction between extracellular ATP and jasmonate (JA) signaling during plant defense responses. This signaling crosstalk requires the formation of secondary messengers, i.e., cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. This finding has given a new direction towards understanding the defense signals activated by DAMPs. In this addendum, we discuss possible insights into how extracellular ATP signaling interacts with the JA signaling pathway for plant defense responses.
