In adaptation to their function the walls of plant cell display tissue-specific variations of composition according to their developmental stage, cell type and stress of various origin. It is therefore important to obtain a precise analytical data describing the cell wall composition with respect to these different factors. In the present work, laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used for isolating different tissues from the stem of Urtica dioica L. at a semi-preparative scale. The technique was associated for the first time to a one-pot sequential cell wall preparation and hydrolysis for the carbohydrate analysis of each cell type. The results demonstrate that the combination of LCM and micro-analytical methods can provide individual cell type composition and should improve our knowledge of the biochemical diversity of cell walls in plants. This approach will be of potential interest for the understanding of the effects of stress or genetic engineering on the composition of the cell walls.
