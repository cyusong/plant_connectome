Muscadine grapes accumulate higher amounts of bioactive phenolics compared with other grape species. To identify the molecular events associated with polyphenolic accumulation that influence antioxidant capacity, two contrasting muscadine genotypes (C5 and C6) with varied phenolic/flavonoid content and antioxidant activity were investigated <i>via</i> RNA-sequencing during berry development. The results showed that berry development is concomitant with transcriptome profile changes, which was more pronounced at the véraison (V) stage. Despite that the downregulation pattern of gene expression dominated the upregulation through berry development, the C5 genotype maintained higher expression levels. Comparative transcript profiling allowed the identification of 94 differentially expressed genes with potential relevance in regulating fruit secondary metabolism, including 18 transcription factors and 76 structural genes. The genes underlying the critical enzymes in the modification reactions of polyphenolics biosynthetic pathway, including hydroxylation, methylation, and glycosylation were more pronounced during the immature stages of prevéraison (PrV), V, and postvéraison (PoV) in the C5 genotype, resulting in more accumulation of biologically active phenolic/flavonoid derivatives. The results suggested that muscadine grapes, as in bunch grapes (<i>Vitis</i> sp.); possess a similar mechanism that organizes polyphenolics accumulation; however, the set of total flavonoids (TFs) and structural genes coordinating the pathway varies between the two species.
