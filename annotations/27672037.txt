['27672037', 'Epigenetic regulation is important for organismal development and response to the  environment. Alteration in epigenetic status has been known mostly from the  perspective of enzymatic actions of DNA methylation and/or histone modifications.  In a genetic screen for cellular factors involved in preventing epigenetic  silencing, we isolated an Arabidopsis mutant defective in SAC3B, a component of  the conserved TREX-2 complex that couples mRNA transcription with  nuleo-cytoplasmic export. Arabidopsis SAC3B dysfunction causes gene silencing at  transgenic and endogenous loci, accompanied by elevation in the repressive  histone mark H3K9me2 and by reduction in RNA polymerase Pol II occupancy. SAC3B  dysfunction does not alter promoter DNA methylation level of the transgene  d35S::LUC, although the DNA demethylase ROS1 is also required for d35S::LUC  anti-silencing. THP1 and NUA were identified as SAC3B-associated proteins whose  mutations also caused d35S::LUC silencing. RNA-DNA hybrid exists at the repressed  loci but is unrelated to gene suppression by the sac3b mutation. Genome-wide  analyses demonstrated minor but clear involvement of SAC3B in regulating siRNAs  and DNA methylation, particularly at a group of TAS and TAS-like loci. Together  our results revealed not only a critical role of mRNA-export factors in  transcriptional anti-silencing but also the contribution of SAC3B in shaping  plant epigenetic landscapes.', '2017 Jan 9', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkw850', 'Zhu']
