RAD17, a replication factor C (RFC)-like DNA damage sensor protein, is involved in DNA checkpoint control and required for both meiosis and mitosis in yeast and mammals. In plant, the meiotic function of <i>RAD17</i> was only reported in rice so far. Here, we identified and characterized the <i>RAD17</i> homolog in maize. The <i>Zmrad17</i> mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth but male was partially sterile. In <i>Zmrad17</i> pollen mother cells, non-homologous chromosome entanglement and chromosome fragmentation were frequently observed. Immunofluorescence analysis manifested that DSB formation occurred as normal and the loading pattern of RAD51 signals was similar to wild-type at the early stage of prophase I in the mutants. The localization of the axial element ASY1 was normal, while the assembly of the central element ZYP1 was severely disrupted in <i>Zmrad17</i> meiocytes. Surprisingly, no obvious defect in female sterility was observed in <i>Zmrad17</i> mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>ZmRAD17</i> is involved in DSB repair likely by promoting synaptonemal complex assembly in maize male meiosis. These phenomena highlight a high extent of divergence from its counterpart in rice, indicating that the <i>RAD17</i> dysfunction can result in a drastic dissimilarity in meiotic outcome in different plant species.
