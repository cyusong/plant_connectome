Latex flow in <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i> (the Para rubber tree), the sole commercial source of natural rubber (<i>cis</i>-1,4-polyisoprene, NR), renders it uniquely suited for the study of plant stress responses. Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinases (CIPK) serving as calcium-sensor protein kinases react with calcineurin B-like proteins (CBL) to play crucial roles in hormone signaling transduction and response to abiotic stress in plant developmental processes. However, little is known about their functions in <i>Hevea</i>. In this study, a total of twelve <i>CBL</i> (<i>HbCBL</i>) and thirty <i>CIPK</i> (<i>HbCIPK</i>) genes were identified from the <i>Hevea</i> genome. Structure and phylogenetic analysis assigned these CIPKs to five groups and CBLs to four groups, and mapped onto fourteen of the eighteen <i>Hevea</i> chromosomes. RNA-seq and qPCR analysis showed that the expressions of <i>HbCBL</i> and <i>HbCIPK</i> genes varied in the seven <i>Hevea</i> tissues examined, i.e., latex (cytoplasm of rubber-producing laticifers), bark, leaf, root, seed, female flower, and male flower. The expressions of two <i>HbCBL</i> and sixteen <i>HbCIPK</i> genes showed upward trends during leaf development. Following ethylene yield stimulation and the latex tapping treatment, both practices invoking stress, the expression levels of most latex-expressed genes were significantly altered. Yeast two-hybrid test revealed interactions for multiple combinations of HbCBLs and HbCIPKs with substantial gene expression in latex or other <i>Hevea</i> tissues. However, all the HbCBL-HbCIPK complexes examined did not recruit HbSOS1 or AtSOS1 to form functional salt tolerance SOS pathway in yeast cells. Taken together, the results suggested a role of the <i>Hevea</i> CBL-CIPK network as a point of convergence for several different signaling pathways in growth, development, and stress responses in relation to latex production.
