['16920872', 'Posttranslational protein modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier  (SUMO) is a highly dynamic and reversible process. To analyze the substrate  specificity of SUMO-conjugating and -deconjugating enzymes from Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), we reconstituted its SUMOylation cascade in vitro and  tested the capacity of this system to conjugate the Arabidopsis SUMO isoforms  AtSUMO1, 2, and 3 to the model substrate ScPCNA from yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae). This protein contains two in vivo SUMOylated lysine residues, namely  K127 and K164. Under in vitro conditions, the Arabidopsis SUMOylation system  specifically conjugates all tested SUMO isoforms to lysine-127, but not to  lysine-164, of ScPCNA. The SUMO isoforms AtSUMO1 and AtSUMO2, but not AtSUMO3,  were found to form polymeric chains on ScPCNA due to a self-SUMOylation process.  In a complementary approach, we analyzed both the SUMO isopeptidase activity and  the pre-SUMO-processing capacity of the putative Arabidopsis SUMO proteases  At1g60220, At1g10570, and At5g60190 using the known SUMO isopeptidases ScULP1,  XopD, and ESD4 (At4g15880) as reference enzymes. Interestingly, At5g60190  exhibits no SUMO protease activity but processes the pre-form of Arabidopsis  Rub1. The other five enzymes represent SUMO isopeptidases that show different  substrate preferences. All these enzymes cleave AtSUMO1 and AtSUMO2 conjugates of  ScPCNA, whereas only the putative bacterial virulence factor XopD is able to  release AtSUMO3. In addition, all five enzymes cleave pre-AtSUMO1 and pre-AtSUMO2  peptides, but none of the proteins efficiently produce mature AtSUMO3 or AtSUMO5  molecules from their precursors.', '2006 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.085415', 'Stuible']
