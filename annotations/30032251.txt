In grass, the spikelet is a unique inflorescence structure that directly determines grain yield. Despite a great deal of research, the molecular mechanisms behind spikelet development are not fully understood. In the study, FZP encodes an ERF domain protein, and functions in grain size and sterile lemma identity. Mutation of FZP causes smaller grains and degenerated sterile lemmas. The small fzp-12 grains were caused by a reduction in cell number and size in the hulls. Interestingly, the sterile lemma underwent a homeotic transformation into a rudimentary glume in the fzp-12 and fzp-13 mutants, whereas the sterile lemma underwent a homeotic transformation into a lemma in FZP over-expressing plants, suggesting that FZP specifically determines the sterile lemma identity. We confirmed the function of FZP by complementation, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and cytological and molecular tests. Additionally, FZP interacts specifically with the GCC-box and DRE motifs, and may be involved in regulation of the downstream genes. Our results revealed that FZP plays a vital role in the regulation of grain size, and first provides clear evidence in support of the hypothesis that the lemma, rudimentary glume, and sterile lemma are homologous organs.
