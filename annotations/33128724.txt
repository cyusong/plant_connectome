Moss PPR-SMR protein PpPPR_64 is a pTAC2 homolog but is functionally distinct from pTAC2. PpPPR_64 is required for psaA gene expression and its function may have evolved in mosses. The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are key regulatory factors responsible for the control of plant organellar gene expression. A small subset of PPR proteins possess a C-terminal small MutS-related (SMR) domain and have diverse roles in plant organellar biogenesis. However, the function of PPR-SMR proteins is not fully understood. Here, we report the function of PPR-SMR protein PpPPR_64 in the moss Physcomitrium patens. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PpPPR_64 belongs to the same clade as the Arabidopsis PPR-SMR protein pTAC2. PpPPR_64 knockout (KO) mutants grew autotrophically but with reduced protonemata growth and the poor formation of photosystems' antenna complexes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and RNA gel blot hybridization analyses revealed a significant reduction in transcript levels of the psaA-psaB-rps14 gene cluster but no alteration to transcript levels of most photosynthesis- and non-photosynthesis-related genes. In addition, RNA processing of 23S-4.5S rRNA precursor was impaired in the PpPPR_64 KO mutants. This suggests that PpPPR_64 is specifically involved in the expression level of the psaA-psaB-rps14 gene and in processing of the 23S-4.5S rRNA precursor. Our results indicate that PpPPR_64 is functionally distinct from pTAC2 and is a novel PPR-SMR protein required for proper chloroplast biogenesis in P. patens.
