['31341004', 'In the plant sterol biosynthetic pathway, sterol 4alpha-methyl oxidase1 (SMO1) and  SMO2 enzymes are involved in the removal of the first and second methyl groups at  the C-4 position, respectively. SMO2s have been found to be essential for  embryonic and postembryonic development, but the roles of SMO1s remain unclear.  Here, we found that the three Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SMO1 genes  displayed different expression patterns. Single smo1 mutants and smo1-1 smo1-3  double mutants showed no obvious phenotype, but the smo1-1 smo1-2 double mutant  was embryo lethal. The smo1-1 smo1-2 embryos exhibited severe defects, including  no cotyledon or shoot apical meristem formation, abnormal division of suspensor  cells, and twin embryos. These defects were associated with enhanced and ectopic  expression of auxin biosynthesis and response reporters. Consistently, the  expression pattern and polar localization of PIN FORMED1, PIN FORMED7, and AUXIN  RESISTANT1 auxin transporters were dramatically altered in smo1-1 smo1-2 embryos.  Moreover, cytokinin biosynthesis and response were reduced in smo1-1 smo1-2  embryos. Tissue culture experiments further demonstrated that homeostasis between  auxin and cytokinin was altered in smo1-1 smo1-2 heterozygous mutants. This  disturbed balance of auxin and cytokinin in smo1-1 smo1-2 embryos was accompanied  by unrestricted expression of the quiescent center marker WUSCHEL-RELATED  HOMEOBOX5 Accordingly, exogenous application of either auxin biosynthesis  inhibitor or cytokinin partially rescued the embryo lethality of smo1-1 smo1-2  Sterol analyses revealed that 4,4-dimethylsterols dramatically accumulated in  smo1-1 smo1-2 heterozygous mutants. Together, these data demonstrate that SMO1s  function through maintaining correct sterol composition to balance auxin and  cytokinin activities during embryogenesis.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00144', 'ORCID:']
