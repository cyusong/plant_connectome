['12869544', 'Import of chloroplast precursor proteins is controlled by the coordinate action  of two homologous GTPases, Toc159 and Toc33, located at the cytosol-outer  membrane interface. Recent studies in Arabidopsis showed that the cytosolic form  of the precursor binding protein Toc159 is targeted to its receptor at the import  machinery, Toc33, via heterodimerization of their GTP-binding domains. Toc33 may  also form GDP-bound homodimers, as suggested by the crystal structure of its pea  ortholog. Moreover, the structural data suggested that arginine 130 (Arg130) of  Arabidopsis Toc33 may function as a GTPase-activating "arginine-finger" at the  other monomer in the Toc33 dimer. Here, we demonstrate that Arg130 of Toc33 does  not function as an Arginine-finger. A mutant, Toc33-R130A, binds and hydrolyzes  GTP like the wild type. However, we demonstrate that Arg130 is involved in both  homodimerization of Toc33 and in heterodimerization with the GTP-binding domain  of Toc159. The dependence of Toc33 homodimerization on Arg130 is mutual,  requiring the presence of Arg130 at both monomers. As the GTPase is not activated  by dimerization, it may be activated independently at either monomer, possibly  even before dimerization. Independent regulation of GTPase activity may serve to  coordinate the interactions of the GTPases during the import of proteins into the  chloroplast.', '2003 Sep 26', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M305946200', 'Kessler']
