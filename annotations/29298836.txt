['29298836', 'In angiosperms, the gynoecium is the last structure to develop within the flower  due to the determinate fate of floral meristem (FM) stem cells. The maintenance  of stem cell activity before its arrest at the stage called FM termination  affects the number of carpels that develop. The necessary inhibition at this  stage of WUSCHEL (WUS), which is responsible for stem cell maintenance, involves  a two-step mechanism. Direct repression mediated by the MADS domain transcription  factor AGAMOUS (AG), followed by indirect repression requiring the C2H2  zinc-finger protein KNUCKLES (KNU), allow for the complete termination of floral  stem cell activity. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana MINI ZINC FINGER2  (AtMIF2) and its homolog in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), INHIBITOR OF MERISTEM  ACTIVITY (SlIMA), participate in the FM termination process by functioning as  adaptor proteins. AtMIF2 and SlIMA recruit AtKNU and SlKNU, respectively, to form  a transcriptional repressor complex together with TOPLESS and HISTONE  DEACETYLASE19. AtMIF2 and SlIMA bind to the WUS and SlWUS loci in the respective  plants, leading to their repression. These results provide important insights  into the molecular mechanisms governing (FM) termination and highlight the  essential role of AtMIF2/SlIMA during this developmental step, which determines  carpel number and therefore fruit size.', '2018 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00653', 'ORCID:']
