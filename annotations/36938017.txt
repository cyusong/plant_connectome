Cotton fiber provides the predominant plant textile in the world, and it is also a model for plant cell wall biosynthesis. The development of the single-celled cotton fiber takes place across several overlapping but discrete stages, including fiber initiation, elongation, the transition from elongation to secondary cell wall formation, cell wall thickening, and maturation and cell death. During each stage, the developing fiber undergoes a complex restructuring of genome-wide gene expression change and physiological/biosynthetic processes, which ultimately generate a strikingly elongated and nearly pure cellulose product that forms the basis of the global cotton industry. Here, we provide an overview of this developmental process focusing both on its temporal as well as evolutionary dimensions. We suggest potential avenues for further improvement of cotton as a crop plant.
