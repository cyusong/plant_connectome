MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA chains (20-24 bp) which are emerging as important regulators of gene expression. miRNAs are encoded by specific genes, and in Arabidopsis, 190 genes have presently been identified. It has been shown that miR399 is essential for the phosphate starvation response, and recent studies have shown transcriptional changes in a number of additional miRNAs in response to a shortage of phosphate. In this study, global profiles of the miRNA in shoots of Arabidopsis plants grown on limited phosphate or full nutrient in combination with sucrose feed were analysed using the miRCURY LNA microRNA Array system. Furthermore, changes in miRNA transcript were compared between a mutant lacking the transcription factor phosphate starvation responses 1 (PHR1) and wild-type plants. The global analysis identified miRNAs belonging to nine families to respond to P deprivation, sucrose or PHR1. Among these, miR399d, miR827, miR866, miR391 and miR163 were most prominently induced upon P starvation, whereas miR169b/c was strongly induced in previously starved plants when provided with sufficient P and more so when combined with an addition of sucrose. This study shows that array analysis is in general agreement with data obtained by other high-throughput technologies. The array data were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses of selected pri-miRNAs. Our data corroborate the implication that several miRNAs are involved in the P-starvation response and further identify miR866 and miR163 as new candidates of miRNAs associated with the regulation of the P-starvation response.
