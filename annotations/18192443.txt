Like many crucifer-specialist herbivores, Pieris rapae uses the presence of glucosinolates as a signal for oviposition and larval feeding. Arabidopsis thaliana glucosinolate-related mutants provide a unique resource for studying the in vivo role of these compounds in affecting P. rapae oviposition. Low indole glucosinolate cyp79B2 cyp79B3 mutants received fewer eggs than wild type, confirming prior research showing that indole glucosinolates are an important oviposition cue. Transgenic plants overexpressing epithiospecifier protein, which shifts glucosinolate breakdown toward nitrile formation, are less attractive to ovipositing P. rapae females. Exogenous application of indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate breakdown products to cyp79B2 cyp79B3 mutants showed that oviposition was increased by indole-3-carbinol and decreased by indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN). P. rapae larvae tolerate a cruciferous diet by using a gut enzyme to redirect glucosinolate breakdown toward less toxic nitriles, including IAN, rather than isothiocyanates. The presence of IAN in larval regurgitant contributes to reduced oviposition by adult females on larvae-infested plants. Therefore, production of nitriles via epithiospecifier protein in cruciferous plants, which makes the plants more sensitive to generalist herbivores, may be a counter-adaptive mechanism for reducing oviposition by P. rapae and perhaps other crucifer-specialist insects.
