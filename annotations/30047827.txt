Mulberry (Morus spp.), a commercially exploited tree species as the host of monophagous pest silk worm (Bombyx mori), belongs to the family Moraceae. The domesticated tree has diverse beneficial characters such as traits associated with rapid growth and biomass production, plant insect/microbe interaction, abiotic stress tolerance and the traits associated with nutritional and medicinal values; some of which have been exploited. Draft genome of Morus notabilis has been sequenced and a large volume of transcriptome and genomic resources have been generated. In this review an attempt has been made to examine the options for considering mulberry as another tree model system to study unique traits associated with perennial systems. The diverse traits and features in mulberry suggest that the system can be a "comprehensive trait integrated tree system" quite different from other model tree systems.
