['24867923', 'Iron is essential for both plant growth and human health and nutrition. Knowledge  of the signaling mechanisms that communicate iron demand from shoots to roots to  regulate iron uptake as well as the transport systems mediating iron partitioning  into edible plant tissues is critical for the development of crop  biofortification strategies. Here, we report that OPT3, previously classified as  an oligopeptide transporter, is a plasma membrane transporter capable of  transporting transition ions in vitro. Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana show that  OPT3 loads iron into the phloem, facilitates iron recirculation from the xylem to  the phloem, and regulates both shoot-to-root iron signaling and iron  redistribution from mature to developing tissues. We also uncovered an aspect of  crosstalk between iron homeostasis and cadmium partitioning that is mediated by  OPT3. Together, these discoveries provide promising avenues for targeted  strategies directed at increasing iron while decreasing cadmium density in the  edible portions of crops and improving agricultural productivity in iron  deficient soils.', '2014 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.123737', 'Vatamaniuk']
