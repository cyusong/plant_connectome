Spontaneous mutations associated with the tomato transcription factors COLORLESS NON-RIPENING (SPL-CNR), NON-RIPENING (NAC-NOR), and RIPENING-INHIBITOR (MADS-RIN) result in fruit that do not undergo the normal hallmarks of ripening but are phenotypically distinguishable. Here, we expanded knowledge of the physiological, molecular, and genetic impacts of the ripening mutations on fruit development beyond ripening. We demonstrated through phenotypic and transcriptome analyses that <i>Cnr</i> fruit exhibit a broad range of developmental defects before the onset of fruit ripening, but fruit still undergo some ripening changes similar to wild type. Thus, <i>Cnr</i> should be considered as a fruit developmental mutant and not just a ripening mutant. Additionally, we showed that some ripening processes occur during senescence in the <i>nor</i> and <i>rin</i> mutant fruit, indicating that while some ripening processes are inhibited in these mutants, others are merely delayed. Through gene expression analysis and direct measurement of hormones, we found that <i>Cnr</i>, <i>nor</i>, and <i>rin</i> have alterations in the metabolism and signaling of plant hormones. <i>Cnr</i> mutants produce more than basal levels of ethylene, while <i>nor</i> and <i>rin</i> accumulate high concentrations of abscisic acid. To determine genetic interactions between the mutations, we created for the first time homozygous double mutants. Phenotypic analyses of the double ripening mutants revealed that <i>Cnr</i> has a strong influence on fruit traits and that combining <i>nor</i> and <i>rin</i> leads to an intermediate ripening mutant phenotype. However, we found that the genetic interactions between the mutations are more complex than anticipated, as the <i>Cnr/nor</i> double mutant fruit has a <i>Cnr</i> phenotype but displayed inhibition of ripening-related gene expression just like <i>nor</i> fruit. Our reevaluation of the <i>Cnr</i>, <i>nor</i>, and <i>rin</i> mutants provides new insights into the utilization of the mutants for studying fruit development and their implications in breeding for tomato fruit quality.
