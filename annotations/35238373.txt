The pathway of starch synthesis in guard cells (GCs), despite the crucial role starch plays in stomatal movements, is not well understood. Here, we characterized starch dynamics in GCs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants lacking enzymes of the phosphoglucose isomerase-phosphoglucose mutase-ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase starch synthesis pathway in leaf mesophyll chloroplasts or sugar transporters at the plastid membrane, such as glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocators, which are active in heterotrophic tissues. We demonstrate that GCs have metabolic features of both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic cells. GCs make starch using different carbon precursors depending on the time of day, which can originate both from GC photosynthesis and/or sugars imported from the leaf mesophyll. Furthermore, we unravel the major enzymes involved in GC starch synthesis and demonstrate that they act in a temporal manner according to the fluctuations of stomatal aperture, which is unique for GCs. Our work substantially enhances our knowledge on GC starch metabolism and uncovers targets for manipulating GC starch dynamics to improve stomatal behavior, directly affecting plant productivity.
