['22672016', 'Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha is an important strategy for living organisms to adapt  to metabolic and physiological changes that are often associated with external  stimuli. GCN2 is one of the well-studied eIF2alpha kinases in yeast and mammals,  which is responsible for the survival of the organism under amino acid  starvation. Despite the downstream reactions being quite divergent, AtGCN2  exhibits a high primary sequence similarity to its yeast and animal counterparts.  In this study, we provide experimental evidence to show that AtGCN2 shares  similar biochemical properties to the yeast and animal homologues. Our in vitro  assays demonstrate the binding of the C-terminus of AtGCN2 to uncharged tRNA  molecules and the enzymatic activities of AtGCN2 on both eIF2alpha homologues in  A. thaliana, thus providing essential information for further understanding the  functions of plant general control non-repressible (GCN) homologues.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Biol (Stuttg)', '10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00606.x', 'Lam']
