<b>:</b> Grafting has been widely used to improve plant growth and tolerance in crop production, as well as for clarifying systemic mRNA signaling from donor to recipient tissues in organ-to-organ communication. In this study, we investigated graft partner interaction mechanisms of Cucumis sativus (Csa) and Cucurbita moschata (Cmo) using a large-scale endogenous mRNA transport. The results indicated that most mobile transcripts followed an allocation pathway from source to sink. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that mRNA mobility functions are universally common and individually specific. Identification of mRNA mobility between distant tissues in heterografts with RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR), RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptional quantitative real time PCR), and clone sequencing were used to estimate 78.75% of selected mobile transcripts. Integration of bioinformatic analysis and RT-qPCR identification allowed us to hypothesize a scion-to-rootstock-to-scion feedback signal loop of Csa move-down and Cmo move-up mRNAs, where Csa scion move-down mRNAs were involved in carbon fixation and biosynthesis of amino acid pathways, and Cmo root received Csa move-down mRNA and then delivered the corresponding Cmo upward mRNA to scion to improve photosynthesis of cucumber scion. This formed a feedback signal loop of scion-to-rootstock-to scion to explain why pumpkin rootstock enhanced cucumber production in the industry, which was utilized for organ communication and mediates photosynthesis processes in heterograft cucurbit crops.
