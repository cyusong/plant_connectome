Environmental stresses cause an increased number of unfolded or misfolded proteins to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in ER stress. To restore ER homeostasis and survive, plants initiate an orchestrated signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Asparagine-rich protein (NRP) 1 and NRP2, two homologous proteins harboring a Development and Cell Death domain, are associated with various stress responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but the relevant molecular mechanism remains obscure. Here, we show that NRP1 and NRP2 act as key pro-survival factors during the ER stress response and that they inhibit cell death. Loss-of-function of NRP1 and NRP2 results in decreased tolerance to the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (TM), accelerating cell death. NRP2 is constitutively expressed while NRP1 is induced in plants under ER stress. In Arabidopsis, basic leucine zipper protein (bZIP) 28 and bZIP60 are important transcription factors in the UPR that activates the expression of many ER stress-related genes. Notably, under ER stress, bZIP60 activates NRP1 by directly binding to the UPRE-I element in the NRP1 promoter. These findings reveal a pro-survival strategy in plants wherein the bZIP60-NRPs cascade suppresses cell death signal transmission, improving survival under adverse conditions.
