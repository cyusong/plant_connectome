Partial root-zone irrigation (PRI), a water-saving technique, improves water uptake in hydrated roots by inducing specific responses that are thought to be regulated by signals originating from leaves; however, this signaling is poorly understood. Using a split-root system and polyethylene glycol 6000 to simulate PRI in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>), we showed that increased root hydraulic conductance (<i>L</i>) and water uptake in the hydrated roots may be due to the elevated expression of cotton plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) genes. Jasmonate (jasmonic acid [JA] and jasmonic acid-isoleucine conjugate [JA-Ile]) content and the expression of three JA biosynthesis genes increased in the leaves of the PRI plants compared with those of the polyethylene glycol-free control. JA/JA-Ile content also increased in the hydrated roots, although the expression of the three JA genes was unaltered, compared with the control. The JA/JA-Ile contents in leaves increased after the foliar application of exogenous JA and was followed by an increase in both JA/JA-Ile content and <i>L</i> in the hydrated roots, whereas the silencing of the three JA genes had the opposite effect in the leaves. Ring-barking the hydrated hypocotyls increased the JA/JA-Ile content in the leaves but decreased the JA/JA-Ile content and <i>L</i> in the hydrated roots. These results suggested that the increased JA/JA-Ile in the hydrated roots was mostly transported from the leaves through the phloem, thus increasing <i>L</i> by increasing the expression of <i>GhPIP</i> in the hydrated roots under PRI. We believe that leaf-derived JA/JA-Ile, as a long-distance signal, positively mediates water uptake from the hydrated roots of cotton under PRI.
