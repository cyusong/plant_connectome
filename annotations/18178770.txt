['18178770', 'Root hairs are extensions of root epidermal cells and a model system for  directional tip growth of plant cells. A previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis  thaliana phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase gene (PIP5K3) was identified  and found to be expressed in the root cortex, epidermal cells, and root hairs.  Recombinant PIP5K3 protein was catalytically active and converted  phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate  [PtdIns(4,5)P2]. Arabidopsis mutant plants homozygous for T-DNA-disrupted PIP5K3  alleles were compromised in root hair formation, a phenotype complemented by  expression of wild-type PIP5K3 cDNA under the control of a 1500-bp PIP5K3  promoter fragment. Root hair-specific PIP5K3 overexpression resulted in root hair  deformation and loss of cell polarity with increasing accumulation of PIP5K3  transcript. Using reestablishment of root hair formation in T-DNA mutants as a  bioassay for physiological functionality of engineered PIP5K3 variants, catalytic  activity was found to be essential for physiological function, indicating that  PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation is required for root hair development. An N-terminal  domain containing membrane occupation and recognition nexus repeats, which is not  required for catalytic activity, was found to be essential for the establishment  of root hair growth. Fluorescence-tagged PIP5K3 localized to the periphery of the  apical region of root hair cells, possibly associating with the plasma membrane  and/or exocytotic vesicles. Transient heterologous expression of full-length  PIP5K3 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes increased plasma membrane  association of a PtdIns(4,5)P2-specific reporter in these tip-growing cells. The  data demonstrate that root hair development requires PIP5K3-dependent  PtdIns(4,5)P2 production in the apical region of root hair cells.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.052852', 'Heilmann']
