Genome-wide DNA polymorphism analysis and molecular marker development are important for forward genetics research and DNA marker-assisted breeding. As an ideal model system for Panicoideae grasses and an important minor crop in East Asia, foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i>) has a high-quality reference genome as well as large mutant libraries based on the "Yugu1" variety. However, there is still a lack of genetic and mutation mapping tools available for forward genetics research on <i>S. italica</i>. Here, we screened another <i>S. italica</i> genotype, "SSR41", which is morphologically similar to, and readily cross-pollinates with, "Yugu1". High-throughput resequencing of "SSR41" identified 1,102,064 reliable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 196,782 insertions/deletions (InDels) between the two genotypes, indicating that these two genotypes have high genetic diversity. Of the 8,361 high-quality InDels longer than 20 bp that were developed as molecular markers, 180 were validated with 91.5% accuracy. We used "SSR41" and these developed molecular markers to map the white leaf sheath gene <i>SiWLS1</i>. Further analyses showed that <i>SiWLS1</i> encodes a chloroplast-localized protein that is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development in bundle sheath cells in the leaf sheath in <i>S. italica</i> and is related to sensitivity to heavy metals. Our study provides the methodology and an important resource for forward genetics research on <i>Setaria</i>.
