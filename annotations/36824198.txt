Cadmium, one of the toxic heavy metals, robustly impact crop growth and development and food safety. In this study, the mechanisms of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) selenium-binding protein-A (TaSBP-A) involved in response to Cd stress was fully investigated by overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat. As a cytoplasm protein, TaSBP-A showed a high expression in plant roots and its expression levels were highly induced by Cd treatment. The overexpression of <i>TaSBP-A</i> enhanced Cd-toleration in yeast, Arabidopsis and wheat. Meanwhile, transgenic Arabidopsis under Cd stress showed a lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and malondialdehyde content and a higher photochemical efficiency in the leaf and a reduction of free Cd<sup>2+</sup> in the root. Transgenic wheat seedlings of TaSBP exhibited an increment of Cd content in the root, and a reduction Cd content in the leaf under Cd<sup>2+</sup> stress. Cd<sup>2+</sup> binding assay combined with a thermodynamics survey and secondary structure analysis indicated that the unique CXXC motif in TaSBP was a major Cd-binding site participating in the Cd detoxification. These results suggested that TaSBP-A can enhance the sequestration of free Cd<sup>2+</sup> in root and inhibit the Cd transfer from root to leaf, ultimately conferring plant Cd-tolerance <i>via</i> alleviating the oxidative stress and photosynthesis impairment triggered by Cd stress.
