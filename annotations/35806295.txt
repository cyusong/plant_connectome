Salt is one of the most common abiotic stresses, causing ionic and osmotic pressure changes that affect plant growth and development. In this work, we present molecular and genetic evidence that <i>Arabidopsis Toxicos en Levadura 12 (ATL12)</i> is involved in both salt stress and in the abscisic acid response to this stress. We demonstrate that <i>ATL12</i> is highly induced in response to salt stress and that <i>atl12</i> mutants have a lower germination rate, decreased root length, and lower survival rate compared to the <i>Col-0</i> wild-type in response to salt stress. Overexpression of <i>ATL12</i> increases expression of the salt stress-associated genes <i>SOS1/2</i>, and ABA-responsive gene <i>RD29B</i>. Additionally, higher levels of reactive oxygen species are detected when <i>ATL12</i> is overexpressed, and qRT-PCR showed that <i>ATL12</i> is involved in the <i>AtRBOHD/F</i>-mediated signaling. <i>ATL12</i> expression is also highly induced by ABA treatment. Mutants of <i>atl12</i> are hypersensitive to ABA and have a shorter root length. A decrease in water loss and reduced stomatal aperture were also observed in <i>atl12</i> mutants in response to ABA. ABA-responsive genes <i>RD29B</i> and <i>RAB18</i> were downregulated in <i>atl12 mutants</i> but were upregulated in the overexpression line of <i>ATL12</i> in response to ABA. Taken together our results suggest that <i>ATL12</i> modulates the response to salt stress and is involved in the ABA signaling pathway in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
