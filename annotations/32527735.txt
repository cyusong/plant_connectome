Calcium signaling has been postulated to be critical for both heat and chilling tolerance in plants, but its molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the function of two closely related cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel (CNGC) proteins, OsCNGC14 and OsCNGC16, in temperature-stress tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) by examining their loss-of-function mutants generated by genome editing. Under both heat and chilling stress, both the <i>cngc14</i> and <i>cngc16</i> mutants displayed reduced survival rates, higher accumulation levels of hydrogen peroxide, and increased cell death. In the <i>cngc16</i> mutant, the extent to which some genes were induced and repressed in response to heat stress was altered and some <i>Heat Shock factor</i> (<i>HSF</i>) and <i>Heat Shock Protein</i> (<i>HSP</i>) genes were slightly more induced compared to the wild type. Furthermore, the loss of either <i>OsCNGC14</i> or <i>OsCNGC16</i> reduced or abolished cytosolic calcium signals induced by either heat or chilling stress. Therefore, <i>OsCNGC14</i> and <i>OsCNGC16</i> are required for heat and chilling tolerance and are modulators of calcium signals in response to temperature stress. In addition, loss of their homologs <i>AtCNGC2</i> and <i>AtCNGC4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) also led to compromised tolerance of low temperature. Thus, this study indicates a critical role of <i>CNGC</i> genes in both chilling and heat tolerance in plants, suggesting a potential overlap in calcium signaling in response to high- and low-temperature stress.
