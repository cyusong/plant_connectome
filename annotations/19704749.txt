A series of works have described an important role of chemical signaling compounds in generation of the stress response of plants in both the wounded and distant undamaged plant tissues. However, pure chemical signals are often not considered in the fast (minutes) long-distance signaling (systemic response) because of their slow propagation speed. Physical signals (electrical and hydraulic) or a combination of the physical and chemical signals (hydraulic dispersal of solutes) have been proposed as possible linkers of the local wound and the rapid systemic response. We have recently demonstrated an evidence for involvement of chemical compounds (jasmonic and abscisic acids) in the rapid (within 1 hour) inhibition of photosynthetic rate and stomata conductance in distant undamaged tobacco leaves after local burning. The aim of this addendum is to discuss plausible mechanisms of a rapid long-distance chemical signaling and the putative interactions between the physical and chemical signals leading to the fast systemic response.
