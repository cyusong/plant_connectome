Potassium (K) is crucial for crop growth and is strongly related to stress tolerance and water-use efficiency (WUE). A major physiological effect of K deficiency is the inhibition of net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (A<sub>N</sub>) during photosynthesis. Whether this reduction originates from limitations either to photochemical energy conversion or biochemical CO<sub>2</sub> fixation or from a limitation to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion through stomata and the leaf mesophyll is debated. In this study, limitations to photosynthetic carbon gain of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) under K deficiency and PEG- induced water deficit were quantified and their implications on plant- and leaf-scale WUE (WUE<sub>P</sub>, WUE<sub>L</sub>) were evaluated. Results show that neither maximum quantum use efficiency (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) nor in-vivo RubisCo activity were directly affected by K deficiency and that the observed impairment of A<sub>N</sub> was primarily due to decreased CO<sub>2</sub> mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub>). K deficiency additionally impaired leaf area development which, together with reduced A<sub>N</sub>, resulted in inhibition of plant growth and a reduction of WUE<sub>P</sub>. Contrastingly, WUE<sub>L</sub> was not affected by K supply which indicated no inhibition of stomatal control. PEG-stress further impeded A<sub>N</sub> by stomatal closure and resulted in enhanced WUE<sub>L</sub> and high oxidative stress. It can be concluded from this study that reduction of g<sub>m</sub> is a major response of leaves to K deficiency, possibly due to changes in leaf anatomy, which negatively affects A<sub>N</sub> and contributes to the typical symptoms like oxidative stress, growth inhibition and reduced WUE<sub>P</sub>.
