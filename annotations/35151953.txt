During multicellularization, plants evolved unique cell-cell connections, the plasmodesmata (PD). PD of angiosperms are complex cellular domains, embedded in the cell wall and consisting of multiple membranes and a large number of proteins. From the beginning, it had been assumed that PD provide passage for a wide range of molecules, from ions to metabolites and hormones, to RNAs and even proteins. In the context of assimilate allocation, it has been hypothesized that sucrose produced in mesophyll cells is transported via PD from cell to cell down a concentration gradient towards the phloem. Entry into the sieve element companion cell complex (SECCC) is then mediated on three potential routes, depending on the species and conditions, - either via diffusion across PD, after conversion to raffinose via PD using a polymer trap mechanism, or via a set of transporters which secrete sucrose from one cell and secondary active uptake into the SECCC. Multiple loading mechanisms can likely coexist. We here review the current knowledge regarding photoassimilate transport across PD between cells as a prerequisite for translocation from leaves to recipient organs, in particular roots and developing seeds. We summarize the state-of-the-art in protein composition, structure, transport mechanism and regulation of PD to apprehend their functions in carbohydrate allocation. Since many aspects of PD biology remain elusive, we highlight areas that require new approaches and technologies to advance our understanding of these enigmatic and important cell-cell connections.
