['18410484', 'The female gametophyte contains two synergid cells that play a role in many steps  of the angiosperm reproductive process, including pollen tube guidance. At their  micropylar poles, the synergid cells have a thickened and elaborated cell wall:  the filiform apparatus that is thought to play a role in the secretion of the  pollen tube attractant(s). MYB98 regulates an important subcircuit of the  synergid gene regulatory network (GRN) that functions to activate the expression  of genes required for pollen tube guidance and filiform apparatus formation. The  MYB98 subcircuit comprises at least 83 downstream genes, including 48 genes  within four gene families (CRP810, CRP3700, CRP3730 and CRP3740) that encode  Cys-rich proteins. We show that the 11 CRP3700 genes, which include DD11 and  DD18, are regulated by a common cis-element, GTAACNT, and that a multimer of this  sequence confers MYB98-dependent synergid expression. The GTAACNT element  contains the MYB98-binding site identified in vitro, suggesting that the 11  CRP3700 genes are direct targets of MYB98. We also show that five of the CRP810  genes, which include DD2, lack a functional GTAACNT element, suggesting that they  are not directly regulated by MYB98. In addition, we show that the five CRP810  genes are regulated by the cis-element AACGT, and that a multimer of this  sequence confers synergid expression. Together, these results suggest that the  MYB98 branch of the synergid GRN is multi-tiered and, therefore, contains at  least one additional downstream transcription factor.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03514.x', 'Drews']
