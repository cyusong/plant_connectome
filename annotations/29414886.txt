Plant SWEETs (sugars will eventually be exported transporters) play a role in plant growth and plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, <i>DsSWEET12</i> from <i>Dianthus spiculifolius</i> was identified and characterized. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that <i>DsSWEET12</i> expression was induced by sucrose starvation, mannitol, and hydrogen peroxide. Colocalization experiment showed that the DsSWEET12-GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane, which was labeled with FM4-64 dye, in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and suspension cells of <i>D. spiculifolius</i>. Compared to wild type plants, transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings overexpressing <i>DsSWEET12</i> have longer roots and have a greater fresh weight, which depends on sucrose content. Furthermore, a relative root length analysis showed that transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed higher tolerance to osmotic and oxidative stresses. Finally, a sugar content analysis showed that the sucrose content in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> was less than that in the wild type, while fructose and glucose contents were higher than those in the wild type. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>DsSWEET12</i> plays an important role in seedling growth and plant response to osmotic and oxidative stress in <i>Arabidopsis</i> by influencing sugar metabolism.
