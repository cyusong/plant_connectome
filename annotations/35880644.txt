The Meloidogyne enterolobii effector MeTCTP is a member of the translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) family, involved in M. enterolobii parasitism. In this study, we found that MeTCTP forms homodimers and, in this form, binds calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ). At the same time, Ca<sup>2+</sup> could induce homodimerization of MeTCTP. We further identified that MeTCTP inhibits the increase of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> ) in plant cells and suppresses plant immune responses. This includes suppression of reactive oxygen species burst and cell necrosis, further promoting M. enterolobii parasitism. Our results have elucidated that the effector MeTCTP can directly target Ca<sup>2+</sup> by its homodimeric form and prevent [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> rise in plant roots, revealing a novel mechanism utilized by plant pathogens to suppress plant immunity.
