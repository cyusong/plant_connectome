Plant response to light is a complex and diverse phenomenon. Several studies have elucidated the mechanisms via which light and hormones regulate hypocotyl growth. However, the hormone-dependent ultraviolet-B (UV-B) response in plants remains obscure. Involvement of gibberellins (GAs) in UV-B-induced hypocotyl inhibition and its mechanisms in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> were investigated in the present research. UV-B exposure remarkably decreased the endogenous GA<sub>3</sub> content through the UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) receptor pathway, and exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> partially restored the hypocotyl growth. UV-B irradiation affected the expression levels of GA metabolism-related genes (<i>GA20ox1</i>, <i>GA2ox1</i> and <i>GA3ox1</i>) in the <i>hy5-215</i> mutant, resulting in increased GA content.ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) promoted the accumulation of DELLA proteins under UV-B radiation; HY5 appeared to regulate the abundance of DELLAs at the transcriptional level under UV-B. As a result, the GA<sub>3</sub> content decreased, which eventually led to the shortening of the hypocotyl. To conclude, the present study provides new insight into the regulation of plant photomorphogenesis under UV-B.
