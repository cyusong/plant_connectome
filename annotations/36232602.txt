Agriculture is facing increasing challenges with regard to achieving sustainable growth in productivity without negatively impacting the environment. The use of bioinoculants is emerging as a sustainable solution for agriculture, especially bioinoculants based on diazotrophic bacteria. Brazil is at the forefront of studies intended to identify beneficial diazotrophic bacteria, as well as in the molecular characterization of this association on both the bacterial and plant sides. Here we highlight the main advances in molecular studies to understand the benefits brought to plants by diazotrophic bacteria. Different molecular pathways in plants are regulated both genetically and epigenetically, providing better plant performance. Among them, we discuss the involvement of genes related to nitrogen metabolism, cell wall formation, antioxidant metabolism, and regulation of phytohormones that can coordinate plant responses to environmental factors. Another important aspect in this regard is how the plant recognizes the microorganism as beneficial. A better understanding of plant-bacteria-environment interactions can assist in the future formulation of more efficient bioinoculants, which could in turn contribute to more sustainable agriculture practices.
