The yield of 24 commercial varieties and accessions of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) has been determined at different sites in Chile and Bolivia. Statistical analysis was performed in order to characterize whether a particular variety was more or less stable in yield under different environmental conditions. Amongst these, two varieties have been identified for more detailed study: one variety has a higher than average yield under unstressed conditions but is strongly affected by stress, and another has a reduced yield under unstressed conditions but is less affected by stress. The contrasting rate of abscission of the reproductive organs under drought stress was clearly consistent with these differences. The more tolerant genotype shows a great deal of plasticity at the biochemical and cellular level when exposed to drought stress, in terms of stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate, abscisic acid synthesis, and resistance to photoinhibition. By contrast, the former lacks such plasticity, but shows an enhanced tendency for a morphological response, the movement of leaves, which appears to be its principal response to drought stress.
