['28507175', 'The asymmetric cell divisions necessary for stomatal lineage initiation and  progression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) require the function of the  basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH). Mutants  lacking SPCH do not produce stomata or lineages. Here, we isolated a new spch-5  allele carrying a point mutation in the bHLH domain that displayed normal growth,  but had an extremely low number of sometimes clustered stomata in the leaves,  whereas the hypocotyls did not have any stomata. In vivo tracking of leaf  epidermal cell divisions, combined with marker lines and genetic analysis, showed  that the spch-5 leaf phenotype is dosage dependent and results from the decreased  ability to initiate and amplify lineages, defects in asymmetric cell fate  allocation, and misorientation of asymmetric division planes. Notably,  application of brassinosteroids (BRs) partly rescued the stomatal leaf phenotype  of spch-5 Transcriptomic analysis combining spch-5 with BR treatments revealed  that the expression of a set of SPCH target genes was restored by BRs. Our  results also show that BR-dependent stomata formation and expression of some, but  not all, SPCH target genes require the integrity of the bHLH domain of SPCH.', '2017 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00615', 'ORCID:']
