Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by metabolic pathways in almost all cells. As signaling components, ROS are best known for their roles in abiotic and biotic stress-related events. However, recent studies have revealed that they are also involved in numerous processes throughout the plant life cycle, from seed development and germination, through to root, shoot and flower development. Here, we provide an overview of ROS production and signaling in the context of plant growth and development, highlighting the key functions of ROS and their interactions with plant phytohormonal networks.
