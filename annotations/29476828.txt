['29476828', 'Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is an indispensable lipid class in photosynthetic  activity. However, the importance of PG biosynthesis in non-photosynthetic organs  remains elusive. We previously identified phosphatidylglycerophosphate  phosphatase 1 (PGPP1), which catalyzes the last step of PG biosynthesis in  Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present report, we noted considerably shorter roots  of the pgpp1-1 mutant compared to the wild type. We observed defective order of  columella cells in the root apices, which was complemented by introducing the  wild-type PGPP1 gene. Although PGPP1 is chloroplast-localized in leaf mesophyll  cells, we observed mitochondrial localization of PGPP1 in root cells, suggesting  possible dual targeting of PGPP1. Moreover, we identified previously  uncharacterized 2 protein tyrosine phosphatase-like proteins as functional PGPPs.  These proteins, designated PTPMT1 and PTPMT2, complemented growth and lipid  phenotypes of Deltagep4, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant of PGPP. The ptpmt1-1  ptpmt2-1 exhibited no visible phenotype; however, the pgpp1-1 ptpmt1-1 ptpmt2-1  significantly enhanced the root phenotype of pgpp1-1 without further affecting  the photosynthesis, suggesting that these newly found PGPPs are involved in the  root phenotype. Radiolabeling experiment of mutant roots showed that decreased PG  biosynthesis is associated with the mutation of PGPP1. These results suggest that  PG biosynthesis is required for the root growth.', '2018 Jun', 'Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Biol Lipids', '10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.02.007', 'Nakamura']
