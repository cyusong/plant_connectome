['12848826', 'Under optimal growth conditions (120 micro mol photons m-2 sec-1  photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), 16-h photoperiod), the recessive  ozone-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh. mutant lcd1-1 exhibits a pale  phenotype compared to the wild type. Confocal and multiphoton microscopy revealed  that the paleness of lcd1-1 is because of a lower cell density in the leaf  palisade parenchyma, resulting in decreased chlorophyll content. When exposed to  ozone, lcd1-1 leaves become paler and contain an increased amount of the lipid  peroxidation product malondialdehyde compared to the wild type, suggesting that  lcd1-1 suffers from elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in  the apoplast. Infection of leaves with virulent Pseudomonas syringae reveals  higher bacterial growth as well as lower pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1)  and PR-5 expression in lcd1-1 than in the wild type. When the wild type and  lcd1-1 are exposed to short-term high-light stress, leaves do not bleach in  lcd1-1 and potential activities of photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII) decrease to  a similar extent in both the genotypes, indicating that the photosynthetic  apparatus is not affected by lcd1-1 mutation. The LCD1 gene, found to contain a  nonsense mutation in the mutant, has been identified. It is located at the bottom  of chromosome 2 of the Arabidopsis genome. However, the function of the protein  encoded by LCD1 is not yet known. We hypothesize that LCD1 plays a role in normal  leaf development, and that the increased sensitivity to ozone and virulent P.  syringae is a secondary effect that presumably results from the  lower-cell-density phenotype in lcd1-1.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01795.x', 'Conklin']
