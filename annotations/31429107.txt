Starch is the major form of carbohydrate storage in plants and exists as discrete starch granules (SGs). Isolation of high-quality SGs in different plant tissues is a prerequisite for studying the roles of SGs during plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic stress. However, it is difficult to isolate transitory SGs from leaves and storage SGs from pollen grains due to their small sizes and low quantities. Herein, we develop a novel method for isolating SGs by using the aqueous two-phase system (ATS) of ethanol/NaH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> . The ATS method efficiently separated SGs from contaminants based on their differences in density, solubility, and polarity. Using this method, we first isolated and purified three kinds of SGs from maize seeds, pollen, and leaves. The biochemical, microscopic, and proteomic analyses demonstrated the high purity of the isolated SGs. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct differences in SG-bound proteins between seed SGs and pollen SGs. As a simple, rapid, and low-cost method, the ATS-based method exhibits highly universal and reproducible results for starch-containing tissues in various plant species.
