MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, noncoding small RNAs that function as critical regulators of gene expression. In plants, miRNAs have shown their potential as regulators of growth, development, signal transduction, and stress tolerance. Although the miRNA-mediated regulation of several processes is known, the involvement of miRNAs in regulating secondary plant product biosynthesis is poorly understood. In this study, we functionally characterized Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) miR858a, which putatively targets R2R3-MYB transcription factors involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. Overexpression of miR858a in Arabidopsis led to the down-regulation of several MYB transcription factors regulating flavonoid biosynthesis. In contrast to the robust growth and early flowering of miR858OX plants, reduction of plant growth and delayed flowering were observed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing an artificial miRNA target mimic (MIM858). Genome-wide expression analysis using transgenic lines suggested that miR858a targets a number of regulatory factors that modulate the expression of downstream genes involved in plant development and hormonal and stress responses. Furthermore, higher expression of MYBs in MIM858 lines leads to redirection of the metabolic flux towards the synthesis of flavonoids at the cost of lignin synthesis. Altogether, our study has established the potential role of light-regulated miR858a in flavonoid biosynthesis and plant growth and development.
