Metazachlor is a chloroacetamide herbicide, frequently used in Brassica napus cultivations around the world. Its primary target is the inhibition of very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis. This study included a morphological and physiological screening of hydroponically grown B. napus, exposed to a concentration range of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0kg metazachlor per hectare. The results indicate that within a month after application, growth and development of B. napus are severely affected by low metazachlor doses. At intermediate metazachlor concentrations, loss of phosphorous and potassium from the plant tissues suggests destabilisation of cellular membranes, which may be a direct consequence of metazachlor application. This membrane instability could be indirectly linked with alterations of electron transport and a reduction of carbon assimilation. At increased metazachlor doses of 0.75kga.i.ha(-1), pigment concentrations are strongly reduced. However, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters seem to remain unaffected at metazachlor doses up to 0.75kga.i.ha(-1). At a metazachlor concentration of 1.0kga.i.ha(-1), negative effects are observed on all tested parameters, resulting in limited survival. The results indicate photosynthesis is assured at intermediate metazachlor concentrations for the cost of growth and development. It is clear that photosynthesis plays a key role in the survival strategy of young plants to overcome initially induced chemical stress.
