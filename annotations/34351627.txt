The regulatory network of R2R3 MYB transcription factors in anthocyanin biosynthesis is not fully understood in blue-coloured berries containing delphinidin compounds. We used blue berries of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) to comprehensively characterise flavonoid-regulating R2R3 MYBs, which revealed a new type of co-regulation in anthocyanin biosynthesis between members of MYBA-, MYBPA1- and MYBPA2-subgroups. VmMYBA1, VmMYBPA1.1 and VmMYBPA2.2 expression was elevated at berry ripening and by abscisic acid treatment. Additionally, VmMYBA1 and VmMYBPA1.1 expression was strongly downregulated in a white berry mutant. Complementation and transient overexpression assays confirmed VmMYBA1 and VmMYBA2 to induce anthocyanin accumulation. Promoter activation assays showed that VmMYBA1, VmMYBPA1.1 and VmMYBPA2.2 had similar activity towards dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), but differential regulation activity for UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) and flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) promoters. Silencing of VmMYBPA1.1 in berries led to the downregulation of key anthocyanin and delphinidin biosynthesis genes. Functional analyses of other MYBPA regulators, and a member of novel MYBPA3 subgroup, associated them with proanthocyanidin biosynthesis and F3'5'H expression. The existence of 18 flavonoid-regulating MYBs indicated gene duplication, which may have enabled functional diversification among MYBA, MYBPA1 and MYBPA2 subgroups. Our results provide new insights into the intricate regulation of the complex anthocyanin profile found in blue-coloured berries involving regulation of both cyanidin and delphinidin branches.
