Methyl benzoate is a constituent of floral scent profile of many flowering plants. However, its biosynthesis, particularly in monocots, is scarcely reported. The monocot <i>Hedychium coronarium</i> is a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions partly for its intense and inviting fragrance, which is mainly determined by methyl benzoate and monoterpenes. Interestingly, several related <i>Hedychium</i> species lack floral scent. Here, we studied the molecular mechanism of methyl benzoate biosynthesis in <i>H. coronarium</i>. The emission of methyl benzoate in <i>H. coronarium</i> was found to be flower-specific and developmentally regulated. As such, seven candidate genes associated with methyl benzoate biosynthesis were identified from flower transcriptome of <i>H. coronarium</i> and isolated. Among them, HcBSMT1 and HcBSMT2 were demonstrated to catalyze the methylation of benzoic acid and salicylic acid to form methyl benzoate and methyl salicylate, respectively. Methyl salicylate is a minor constituent of <i>H. coronarium</i> floral scent. Kinetic analysis revealed that HcBSMT2 exhibits a 16.6-fold lower <i>K</i>m value for benzoic acid than HcBSMT1, indicating its dominant role for floral methyl benzoate formation. The seven genes associated with methyl benzoate biosynthesis exhibited flower-specific or flower-preferential expression that was developmentally regulated. The gene expression and correlation analysis suggests that <i>HcCNL</i> and <i>HcBSMT2</i> play critical roles in the regulation of methyl benzoate biosynthesis. Comparison of emission and gene expression among four <i>Hedychium</i> species suggested that coordinated and high-level expression of biosynthetic pathway genes is responsible for the massive emission of floral methyl benzoate in <i>H. coronarium</i>. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism for methyl benzoate biosynthesis in monocots and identify useful molecular targets for genetic modification of scent-related traits in <i>Hedychium</i>.
