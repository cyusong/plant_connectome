Predominant NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition causes an "ammonium syndrome" that induces metabolic changes and thereby provides resistance against Pseudomonas syringae infection through the activation of systemic acquired acclimation (SAA). Hence, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-mediated SAA, the changes in nutrient balance and C and N skeletons were studied in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-treated plants upon infection by P. syringae. A general decrease in cation and an increase in anion levels was observed in roots and leaves of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-treated plants. Upon NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-based nutrition and infection, tomato leaves showed an accumulation of S, P, Zn, and of Mn. Mn accumulation might be required for ROS detoxification since it acts as a cofactor of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Primary metabolism was modified in both tissues of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-fed plants to counteract NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity by decreasing TCA intermediates. A significant increase in Arg, Gln, Asn, Lys, Tyr, His and Leu was observed in leaves of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-treated plants. The high level of the putrescine precursor Arg hints towards the importance of the Glu pathway as a key metabolic check-point in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-treated and infected plants. Taken together, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-fed plants displayed a high level of basal responses allowing them to activate SAA and to trigger defense responses against P. syringae through nutrient imbalances and changes in primary metabolism.
