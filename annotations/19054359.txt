['19054359', 'Nitric oxide (NO) is involved together with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the  activation of various stress responses in plants. We have used ozone (O(3)) as a  tool to elicit ROS-activated stress responses, and to activate cell death in  plant leaves. Here, we have investigated the roles and interactions of ROS and NO  in the induction and regulation of O(3)-induced cell death. Treatment with O(3)  induced a rapid accumulation of NO, which started from guard cells, spread to  adjacent epidermal cells and eventually moved to mesophyll cells. During the  later time points, NO production coincided with the formation of hypersensitive  response (HR)-like lesions. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and O(3)  individually induced a large set of defence-related genes; however, in a combined  treatment SNP attenuated the O(3) induction of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and  other defence-related genes. Consistent with this, SNP treatment also decreased  O(3)-induced SA accumulation. The O(3)-sensitive mutant rcd1 was found to be an NO  overproducer; in contrast, Atnoa1/rif1 (Arabidopsis nitric oxide associated  1/resistant to inhibition by FSM1), a mutant with decreased production of NO, was  also O(3) sensitive. This, together with experiments combining O(3) and the NO donor  SNP suggested that NO can modify signalling, hormone biosynthesis and gene  expression in plants during O(3) exposure, and that a functional NO production is  needed for a proper O(3) response. In summary, NO is an important signalling  molecule in the response to O(3).', '2009 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03756.x', 'Kangasjarvi']
