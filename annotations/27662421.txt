Wounding is the first event that occurs in plant regeneration. However, wound signaling in plant regeneration is barely understood. Using a simple system of de novo root organogenesis from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf explants, we analyzed the genes downstream of wound signaling. Leaf explants may produce at least two kinds of wound signals to trigger short-term and long-term wound signaling. Short-term wound signaling is primarily involved in controlling auxin behavior and the fate transition of regeneration-competent cells, while long-term wound signaling mainly modulates the cellular environment at the wound site and maintains the auxin level in regeneration-competent cells. YUCCA (YUC) genes, which are involved in auxin biogenesis, are targets of short-term wound signaling in mesophyll cells and of long-term wound signaling in regeneration-competent cells. The expression patterns of YUCs provide important information about the molecular basis of wound signaling in plant regeneration.

Long-term wound signaling: !modulates! Cellular environment/Maintains auxin level in regeneration-competent cells
YUCCA genes: !targeted by! Short-term/Long-term wound signaling
