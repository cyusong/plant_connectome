Moderate and temporary heat stresses (HS) prime plants to tolerate, and survive, a subsequent severe HS. Such acquired thermotolerance can be maintained for several days under normal growth conditions, and create a HS memory. We recently demonstrated that plastid-localized small heat shock protein HSP21 is a key component of HS memory in Arabidopsis thaliana. A sustained high abundance of HSP21 during the HS recovery phase extends HS memory. The level of HSP21 is negatively controlled by plastid-localized metalloprotease FtsH6 during HS recovery. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy, a cellular recycling mechanism, exerts additional control over HSP21 degradation. Genetic and chemical disruption of both, metalloprotease activity and autophagy trigger superior HSP21 accumulation, thereby improving memory. Furthermore, we provide evidence that autophagy cargo receptor ATG8-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (ATI1) is associated with HS memory. ATI1 bodies colocalize with both autophagosomes and HSP21, and their abundance and transport to the vacuole increase during HS recovery. Together, our results provide new insights into the control module for the regulation of HS memory, in which two distinct protein degradation pathways act in concert to degrade HSP21, thereby enabling cells to recover from the HS effect at the cost of reducing the HS memory.
