['12007405', 'Plant steroid hormones, known as brassinosteroids (BRs), signal through a plasma  membrane localized receptor kinase BRI1. We identified bes1, a semidominant  suppressor of bri1, which exhibits constitutive BR response phenotypes including  long and bending petioles, curly leaves, accelerated senescence, and constitutive  expression of BR-response genes. BES1 accumulates in the nucleus in response to  BRs. BES1 is phosphorylated and appears to be destabilized by the glycogen  synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) BIN2, a negative regulator of the BR pathway. These  results establish a signaling cascade for BRs with similarities to the Wnt  pathway, in which signaling through cell surface receptors leads to inactivation  of a GSK-3 allowing accumulation of a nuclear protein that regulates target gene  expression.', '2002 Apr 19', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(02)00721-3', 'Chory']
