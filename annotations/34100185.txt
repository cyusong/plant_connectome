OsPUB41 plays a negative role in drought stress response through the mediation of OsUBC25 and interacts with OsCLC6, suggesting a putative substrate. The notable expansion of Plant U-Box E3 ligases (PUB), compared with those in mammals, implies that PUB proteins have evolved to perform plant-specific functions. OsPUB41, a potential ortholog of CMPG1, was recently reported to regulate the cell wall degrading enzyme (CWDE)-induced innate immune response in rice. Here, we characterized the OsPUB41 gene, which encodes a dual-localized cytosolic and nuclear U-box E3 ligase in rice. OsPUB41 expression was specifically induced by dehydration among various abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Furthermore, we revealed that the core U-box motif of OsPUB41 possesses the E3 ligase activity that can be activated by OsUBC25 in rice. The Ubi:RNAi-OsPUB41 knock-down and ospub41 suppression mutant plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild-type rice plants in terms of transpirational water loss, long-term dehydration response, and chlorophyll content. Moreover, the knock-down or suppression of the OsPUB41 gene did not cause adverse effect on rice yield-related traits. Yeast two-hybrid and an in vitro pull-down analyses revealed that OsCLC6, a chloride channel, is a putative substrate of OsPUB41. Overall, these results suggest that OsPUB41 acts as a negative regulator of dehydration conditions and interacts with OsCLC6, implying that it is a substrate of OsPUB41.
