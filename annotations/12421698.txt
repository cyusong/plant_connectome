['12421698', 'Distinct forms of cytokinesis characterise specific phases of development in  plants. In Arabidopsis, as in many other species, the endosperm that nurtures the  embryo in the seed initially develops as a syncytium. This syncytial phase ends  with simultaneous partitioning of the multinucleate cytoplasm into individual  cells, a process referred to as cellularisation. Our in vivo observations show  that, as in cytokinesis, cellularisation of the Arabidopsis endosperm is coupled  to nuclear division. A genetic analysis reveals that most Arabidopsis mutations  affecting cytokinesis in the embryo also impair endosperm cellularisation. These  results imply that cellularisation and cytokinesis share multiple components of  the same basic machinery. We further report the identification of mutations in a  novel gene, SPATZLE, that specifically interfere with cellularisation of the  endosperm, but not with cytokinesis in the embryo. The analysis of this mutant  might identify a specific checkpoint for the onset of cellularisation.', '2002 Dec', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.00152', 'Berger']
