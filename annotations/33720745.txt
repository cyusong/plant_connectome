Fusarium head blight (FHB) and the occurrence of mycotoxins is the largest food safety threat to malting and brewing grains. Worldwide surveys of commercial beers have reported that the trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is the most frequent contaminant in beer. Although the DON content of grain generally declines during steeping due to its solubilization, <i>Fusarium</i> spp. can continue to grow and produce DON from steeping through the early kilning stage of malting. DON present on malt is largely extracted into beer. The objective of the current study was to localize the growth of <i>Fusarium</i> spp. within FHB-infected kernels by developing an improved method and to associate fungal growth with the production of DON during malting. FHB-infected barley, wheat, rye, and triticale grains that exhibited large increases in the amount of <i>Fusarium Tri5</i> DNA and trichothecene mycotoxins following malting were screened for hyphal localization. The growth of fungal hyphae associated with grain and malt was imaged by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy assisted with WGA-Alexa Fluor 488 staining, respectively. In barley, hyphae were present on or within the husk, vascular bundle, and pericarp cavities. Following malting, vast hyphal growth was observed not only in these regions but also in the aleurone layer, endosperm, and embryo. Extensive fungal growth was also observed following malting of wheat, rye, and triticale. However, these grains already had an extensive internal presence of <i>Fusarium</i> hyphae in the unmalted grain, thus representing an enhanced chance of fungal expansion during the malting.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
