The evolution of predominant self-fertilisation frequently coincides with the evolution of a collection of phenotypes that comprise the 'selfing syndrome', in both plants and animals. Genomic features also display a selfing syndrome. Selfing syndrome traits often involve changes to male and female reproductive characters that were subject to sexual selection and sexual conflict in the obligatorily outcrossing ancestor, including the gametic phase for both plants and animals. Rapid evolution of reproductive traits, due to both relaxed selection and directional selection under the new status of predominant selfing, lays the genetic groundwork for reproductive isolation. Consequently, shifts in sexual selection pressures coupled to transitions to selfing provide a powerful paradigm for investigating the speciation process. Plant and animal studies, however, emphasise distinct selective forces influencing reproductive-mode transitions: genetic transmission advantage to selfing or reproductive assurance outweighing the costs of inbreeding depression vs the costs of males and meiosis. Here, I synthesise links between sexual selection, evolution of selfing and speciation, with particular focus on identifying commonalities and differences between plant and animal systems and pointing to areas warranting further synergy.
