Novel eukaryotic chlorophyll-carotenoid proteins have evolved at least twice following the origin of the plastid and include the widely distributed integral membrane light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) and the dinoflagellate-specific soluble peridinin-chlorophyll proteins. In the glaucophytes, homologs of these proteins are reportedly absent. We have identified a novel carotenoid-rich protein (CRP) in the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa that is 28 kDa and immunologically related to the family of LHCs. CRP is associated with the thylakoid membrane, though it can be removed by stringent washes, suggesting that there are probably significant structural differences between CRP and the LHCs. CRP co-localizes with a zeaxanthin-rich thylakoid membrane fraction that also contains beta-carotene, chlorophyll and an unidentified carotenoid. Despite this, we found no evidence for carotenoid-chlorophyll energy transfer in the isolated complex, suggesting that light harvesting may not be a primary function. The presence of CRP in C. paradoxa is evidence for the evolution of a novel pigment-binding protein in the glaucophytes.
