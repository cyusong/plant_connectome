In planta, very limited information is available about how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contributes to cellular Ca(2+) dynamics and homeostasis. Here, we report the generation of an ER-targeted Cameleon reporter protein suitable for analysis of Ca(2+) accumulation and dynamics in the lumen of the ER in plant cells. Using stably transformed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants expressing this reporter protein, we observed a transiently enhanced accumulation of Ca(2+) in the ER in response to stimuli inducing cytosolic Ca(2+) rises in root tip cells. In all experimental conditions, ER Ca(2+) dynamics were substantially different from those monitored in the cytosol. A pharmacological approach enabled us to evaluate the contribution of the different ER-resident Ca(2+)-ATPase classes in the regulation of the ER Ca(2+) homeostasis. Taken together, our results do not provide evidence for a role of the ER as a major source that releases Ca(2+) for stimulus-induced increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Instead, our results show that the luminal ER Ca(2+) elevations typically follow cytosolic ones, but with distinct dynamics. These findings suggest fundamental differences for the function of the ER in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in plants and animals.
