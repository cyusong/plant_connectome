['26408532', 'The plant immune system consists of multiple layers of responses targeting  various phases of pathogen infection. Here, we provide evidence showing that two  responses, one controlling stomatal closure and the other mediated by  intracellular receptor proteins, can be regulated by the same proteins but in an  antagonistic manner. The HEAT SHOCK COGNATE70 (HSC70), while previously known as  a negative regulator of stomatal closure, is a positive regulator of immune  responses mediated by the immune receptor protein SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1,  CONSTITUTIVE1 (SNC1) as well as basal defense responses. In contrast to HSC70, a  calcium-binding protein, BONZAI1 (BON1), promotes abscisic acid- and  pathogen-triggered stomatal closure in addition to and independent of its  previously known negative role in SNC1 regulation. BON1 likely regulates stomatal  closure through activating SUPPESSOR OF THE G2 ALLELE OF SKP1 VARIANT B and  inhibiting HSC70. New functions of BON1 and HSC70 identified in this study thus  reveal opposite effects of each of them on immunity. The opposing roles of these  regulators at different phases of plant immune responses exemplify the complexity  in immunity regulation and suggest that immune receptors may guard positive  regulators functioning at stomatal closure control.', '2015 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.00970', 'ORCID:']
