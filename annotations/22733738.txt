['22733738', 'Asparagine-linked glycans (N-glycans) are crucial signals for protein folding,  quality control, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) in  yeast and mammals. Although similar ERAD processes were reported in plants,  little is known about their biochemical mechanisms, especially their  relationships with N-glycans. Here, we show that a missense mutation in the  Arabidopsis EMS-mutagenized bri1 suppressor 3 (EBS3) gene suppresses a dwarf  mutant, bri1-9, the phenotypes of which are caused by ER retention and ERAD of a  brassinosteroid receptor, BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BR1). EBS3 encodes the  Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast asparagine-linked glycosylation 9 (ALG9), which  catalyzes the ER luminal addition of two terminal alpha1,2 mannose (Man) residues in  assembling the three-branched N-glycan precursor  [glucose(Glc)](3)(Man)(9)[N-acetylglucosamine(GlcNAc)](2). Consistent with recent  discoveries revealing the importance of the Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) C-branch in  generating an ERAD signal, the ebs3-1 mutation prevents the Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)  assembly and inhibits the ERAD of bri1-9. By contrast, overexpression of EBS4 in  ebs3-1 bri1-9, which encodes the Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast ALG12  catalyzing the ER luminal alpha1,6 Man addition, adds an alpha1,6 Man to the truncated  N-glycan precursor accumulated in ebs3-1 bri1-9, promotes the bri1-9 ERAD, and  neutralizes the ebs3-1 suppressor phenotype. Furthermore, a transfer (T)-DNA  insertional alg3-T2 mutation, which causes accumulation of an even smaller  N-glycan precursor carrying a different exposed alpha1,6 Man, promotes the ERAD of  bri1-9 and enhances its dwarfism. Taken together, our results strongly suggest  that the glycan signal to mark an ERAD client in Arabidopsis is likely conserved  to be an alpha1,6 Man-exposed N-glycan.', '2012 Jul 10', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1119173109', 'Li']
