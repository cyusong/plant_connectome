['20188559', "Growth control in animals and plants involves mobile signals. Depending on their  range of action, these signals coordinate the growth of cells within an organ or  the growth of different organs in a larger, functionally integrated structure. In  plants, flowers are such integrated structures, yet it remains poorly understood  how growth of the constituent organs is coordinated to ensure their correct  relative sizes. The cytochrome P450 KLUH/CYP78A5 and its homolog CYP78A7 promote  organ growth via a non-cell-autonomous signal; however, the range of this signal  and thus its developmental function are unknown. Here we use a system for the  predictable generation of chimeric plants to determine the range of the  KLUH-dependent signal. In contrast with the largely autonomous behavior of  another tested growth-control gene, we find that KLUH activity extends beyond  individual organs and flowers. Its overall activity is integrated across an  inflorescence to determine final organ size, which is largely independent of the  genotype of the individual organs. Thus, the KLUH-dependent signal appears to  move beyond individual organs in a flower, providing a mechanism for coordinating  their growth and ensuring floral symmetry as an important determinant of a  plant's attractiveness to pollinators.", '2010 Mar 23', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2010.01.039', 'Lenhard']
