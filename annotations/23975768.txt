The contribution of signalling peptides to plant development is increasingly evident as more new peptide families become identified. The recently discovered GLV/RGF/CLEL secreted peptide family comprises 11 members in Arabidopsis and has been shown by independent research groups to be involved in different plant developmental programmes such as root meristem maintenance, root hair development, and root and hypocotyl gravitropism. This short review summarizes our current knowledge on GLV/RGF/CLEL peptides and highlights future challenges to decipher their function.
