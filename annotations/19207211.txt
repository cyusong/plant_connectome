['19207211', 'In plants, sterols play fundamental roles as membrane constituents in the  biosynthesis of steroid hormones, and act as precursors for cell wall deposition.  Sterols are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but mainly accumulate  in the plasma membrane. How sterols are trafficked in plant cells is largely  unknown. In non-plant systems, oxysterol-binding proteins have been involved in  sterol trafficking and homeostasis. There are at least twelve homologs of  oxysterol-binding proteins in the Arabidopsis genome, but the biology of these  proteins remains for the most part obscure. Here, we report our analysis of the  targeting requirements and the sterol-binding properties of a small Arabidopsis  oxysterol-binding protein, ORP3a. We have determined that ORP3a is a bona fide  sterol-binding protein with sitosterol-binding properties. Live-cell imaging  analyses revealed that ORP3a is localized at the ER, and that binding to this  organelle depends on a direct interaction with PVA12, a member of the largely  uncharacterized VAP33 family of plant proteins. Molecular modeling analyses and  site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of a novel protein domain  that is responsible for the PVA12-ORP3a interaction. Disruption of the integrity  of this domain caused redistribution of ORP3a to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting  that ORP3a may cycle between the ER and the Golgi. These results represent new  insights into the biology of sterol-binding proteins in plant cells, and  elucidate a hitherto unknown relationship between members of oxysterol-binding  protein and VAP33 families of plant proteins in the early plant secretory  pathway.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03815.x', 'Brandizzi']
