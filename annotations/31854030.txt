After entering the leaf, CO<sub>2</sub> faces an intricate pathway to the site of photosynthetic fixation embedded within the chloroplasts. The efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> flux is hindered by a number of structural and biochemical barriers which, together, define the ease of flow of the gas within the leaf, termed mesophyll conductance. Previous authors have identified the key elements of this pathway, raising the prospect of engineering the system to improve CO<sub>2</sub> flux and, thus, to increase leaf photosynthetic efficiency. In this review, we provide a perspective on the potential for improving the individual elements that contribute to this complex parameter. We lay particular emphasis on generation of the cellular architecture of the leaf which sets the initial boundaries of a number of mesophyll conductance parameters, incorporating an overview of the molecular transport processes which have been proposed as major facilitators of CO<sub>2</sub> flux across structural boundaries along the pathway. The review highlights the research areas where future effort might be invested to increase our fundamental understanding of mesophyll conductance and leaf function and, consequently, to enable translation of these findings to improve the efficiency of crop photosynthesis.
