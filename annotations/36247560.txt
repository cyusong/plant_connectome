Stem form is the shape of the trunk, differs among tree species and mainly affected by stand density factor. Accurate taper equations are crucial for estimating the stem diameter, form and tree volume, which is conducive to timber utilization and sustainable forest management and planning. Larch (<i>Larix principis-rupprechtii</i> Mayr.) is a valuable afforestation species under large-scale development in North China, but no study on the effect of density on its stem taper has been reported yet. The dataset included 396 analytical trees from 132 standard plots of larch plantation in Saihanba, Hebei Province. Based on 12 different forms of models, we explored the optimal basic equation for plantations and the effects of the stand density, basal area, canopy density and different forms of stand density on the prediction accuracy of the variable-exponent models. The variable-exponent taper equation that includes Sd (stand density) was constructed by using nonlinear regression, a nonlinear mixed effect model and the nonlinear quantile regression method. The results indicate that the Kozak's 2004 variable-exponent taper equation was the best basic model for describing changes in the stem form of larch plantations, and the density factor in the form of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt><mrow><mi>S</mi> <mi>d</mi></mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math> improved the prediction accuracy of the basic model. Among the three regression methods, the quantile regression method had the highest fitting accuracy, followed by the nonlinear mixed effect model. When the quantile was 0.5, the nonlinear quantile regression model exhibited the best performance which provides a scientific basis for the rational management of larch plantations.
