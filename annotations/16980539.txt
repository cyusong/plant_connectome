['16980539', 'In contrast with the model Escherichia coli Clp protease, the ATP-dependent Clp  protease in higher plants has a remarkably diverse proteolytic core consisting of  multiple ClpP and ClpR paralogs, presumably arranged within a dual heptameric  ring structure. Using antisense lines for the nucleus-encoded ClpP subunit,  ClpP6, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana Clp protease is vital for  chloroplast development and function. Repression of ClpP6 produced a proportional  decrease in the Clp proteolytic core, causing a chlorotic phenotype in young  leaves that lessened upon maturity. Structural analysis of the proteolytic core  revealed two distinct subcomplexes that likely correspond to single heptameric  rings, one containing the ClpP1 and ClpR1-4 proteins, the other containing  ClpP3-6. Proteomic analysis revealed several stromal proteins more abundant in  clpP6 antisense lines, suggesting that some are substrates for the Clp protease.  A proteolytic assay developed for intact chloroplasts identified potential  substrates for the stromal Clp protease in higher plants, most of which were more  abundant in young Arabidopsis leaves, consistent with the severity of the  chlorotic phenotype observed in the clpP6 antisense lines. The identified  substrates all function in more general housekeeping roles such as plastid  protein synthesis, folding, and quality control, rather than in metabolic  activities such as photosynthesis.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.044594', 'Clarke']
