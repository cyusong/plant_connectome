Sclerotinia stem rot, caused by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, is a devastating disease in rapeseed. The objective of this study was to investigate the role and the mechanism of silicon (Si) in alleviating the disease severity of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> in rapeseed. In the absorption assays, the rapeseed that absorbed 10 mM of K<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> exhibited an 86% decrease in lesion size on infected leaves as compared with controls. In the spray assay, the lesion length on rapeseed stems was reduced by 30.5-32.9% with the use of 100 mM of a foliar Si fertilizer as compared with controls. In the pot assay, the lesion length on rapeseed stems was reduced by 34.9-38.3% when using the Si fertilizer as basal fertilizer. In the field assay, both the disease incidence and disease index of sclerotinia stem rot were significantly reduced with the usage of a solid Si fertilizer, Si foliar fertilizer, and the application of both, without negative affection on the main agronomic traits and seed quality of rapeseed. The transcriptome sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), and biochemical assays between K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>- and K<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>- treated rapeseed leaves revealed that Si promoted the biosynthesis of defense-related substances and enhanced the antioxidation and detoxification abilities of rapeseed after infection. Thus, this study concluded that Si can alleviate the disease severity of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> in rapeseeds, partially due to the induced defense responses.
