Auxin is an indispensable hormone throughout the lifetime of nearly all plant species. Several aspects of plant growth and development are rigidly governed by auxin, from micro to macro hierarchies; auxin also has a close relationship with plant-pathogen interactions. Undoubtedly, precise auxin levels are vitally important to plants, which have many effective mechanisms to maintain auxin homeostasis. One mechanism is conjugating amino acid to excessive indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; main form of auxin) through some GH3 family proteins to inactivate it. Our previous study demonstrated that GH3-2 mediated broad-spectrum resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by suppressing pathogen-induced IAA accumulation and downregulating auxin signaling. Here, we further investigated the expression pattern of GH3-2 and other GH3 family paralogues in the life cycle of rice and presented the possible function of GH3-2 on rice root development by histochemical analysis of GH3-2 promoter:GUS reporter transgenic plants.
