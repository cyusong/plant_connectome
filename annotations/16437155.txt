['16437155', 'Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are vital prosthetic groups for Fe-S proteins  involved in fundamental processes such as electron transfer, metabolism, sensing  and signaling. In plants, sulfur (SUF) protein-mediated Fe-S cluster biogenesis  involves iron acquisition and sulfur mobilization, processes suggested to be  plastidic. Here we have shown that AtSufE in Arabidopsis rescues growth defects  in SufE-deficient Escherichia coli. In contrast to other SUF proteins, AtSufE  localizes to plastids and mitochondria interacting with the plastidic AtSufS and  mitochondrial AtNifS1 cysteine desulfurases. AtSufE activates AtSufS and AtNifS1  cysteine desulfurization, and AtSufE activity restoration in either plastids or  mitochondria is not sufficient to rescue embryo lethality in AtSufE  loss-of-function mutants. AtSufE overexpression induces AtSufS and AtNifS1  expression, which in turn leads to elevated cysteine desulfurization activity,  chlorosis and retarded development. Our data demonstrate that plastidic and  mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis shares a common, essential component, and  that AtSufE acts as an activator of plastidic and mitochondrial desulfurases in  Arabidopsis.', '2006 Feb 22', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600968', 'Moller']
