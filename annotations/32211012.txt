Maintenance of gene repression by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is integral to the orchestration of developmental programs in most multicellular eukaryotes. Faithful inheritance of H3K27me3 patterns across replication ensures the stability of PRC2-mediated transcriptional silencing over cell generations, thereby safeguarding cellular identities. In this review, we discuss the molecular and mechanistic principles that underlie H3K27me3 restoration after the passage of the replication fork, considering recent advances in different model systems. In particular, we aim at emphasizing parallels and differences between plants and other organisms, focusing on the recycling of parental histones and the replenishment of H3K27me3 patterns post-replication thanks to the remarkable properties of the PRC2 complex. We then discuss the necessity for fine-tuning this genuine epigenetic memory system so as to allow for cell fate and developmental transitions. We highlight recent insights showing that genome-wide destabilization of the H3K27me3 landscape during chromatin replication participates in achieving this flexible stability and provides a window of opportunity for subtle transcriptional reprogramming.
