Members of the GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) family of transcription factors play key roles in the promotion of plant growth and development. Many GRFs are post-transcriptionally repressed by microRNA (miRNA) miR396, an evolutionarily conserved small RNA, which restricts their expression to proliferative tissue. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the GRF family in eudicot plants and found that in many species all the GRFs have a miR396-binding site. Yet, we also identified GRFs with mutations in the sequence recognized by miR396, suggesting a partial or complete release of their post-transcriptional repression. Interestingly, Brassicaceae species share a group of GRFs that lack miR396 regulation, including Arabidopsis GRF5 and GRF6. We show that instead of miR396-mediated post-transcriptional regulation, the spatiotemporal control of GRF5 is achieved through evolutionarily conserved promoter sequences, and that AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2 (ARF2) binds to such conserved sequences to repress GRF5 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the unchecked expression of GRF5 in arf2 mutants is responsible for the increased cell number of arf2 leaves. The results describe a switch in the repression mechanisms that control the expression of GRFs and mechanistically link the control of leaf growth by miR396, GRFs, and ARF2 transcription factors.
