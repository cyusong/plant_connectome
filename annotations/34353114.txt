<i>Pectobacterium atrosepticum</i> is a narrow-host-range, pectinolytic, plant-pathogenic bacterium causing blackleg of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.) worldwide. Till present, several <i>P. atrosepticum</i> genomes have been sequenced and characterized in detail; however, all of these genomes have come from <i>P. atrosepticum</i> isolates from plants grown in temperate zones, not from hosts cultivated under different climatic conditions. Herewith, we present the first complete, high-quality genome of the <i>P. atrosepticum</i> strain Green1 isolated from potato plants grown under a subarctic climate in Greenland. The genome of <i>P. atrosepticum</i> strain Green1 consists of one chromosome of 4,959,719 bp, with a GC content of 51% and no plasmids. The genome contains 4,531 annotated features, including 4,179 protein-coding genes, 22 ribosomal RNA genes, 70 transfer RNA genes, 8 noncoding RNA genes, 2 CRISPRs, and 126 pseudogenes. We believe that the information in this first high-quality, complete, closed genome of <i>P. atrosepticum</i> strains isolated from host plants grown in a subarctic agricultural region will provide resources for comparative genomic studies and for analyses targeting climatic adaptation and ecological fitness mechanisms present in <i>P. atrosepticum</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
