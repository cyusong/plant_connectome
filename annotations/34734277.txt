Mechanoperception, the ability to perceive and respond to mechanical stimuli, is a common and fundamental property of all forms of life. Vascular plants such as Mimosa pudica use this function to protect themselves against herbivory. The mechanical stimulus caused by a landing insect triggers a rapid closing of the leaflets that drives the potential pest away. While this thigmonastic movement is caused by ion fluxes accompanied by a rapid change of volume in the pulvini, the mechanism responsible for the detection of the mechanical stimulus remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of mechanosensitive ion channels in the first step of this evolutionarily conserved defense mechanism: the mechanically evoked closing of the leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the key site of mechanosensation in the Mimosa leaflets is the pulvinule, which expresses a stretch-activated chloride-permeable mechanosensitive ion channel. Blocking these channels partially prevents the closure of the leaflets following mechanical stimulation. These results demonstrate a direct relation between the activity of mechanosensitive ion channels and a central defense mechanism of M. pudica.
