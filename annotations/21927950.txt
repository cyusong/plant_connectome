Phenols are toxic, environmentally persistent products of the chemical industry that are capable of bioaccumulation and biomagnifications in the food chain. Little is known of how plants respond to this compound. To understand the transcriptional changes under phenol, microarray experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana were performed. Microarray results revealed numerous perturbations in signaling and metabolic pathways. The results indicated that the phenol response was related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and oxidative conditions, including ROS generated for pathogen defense.
