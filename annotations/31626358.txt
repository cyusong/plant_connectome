Flavonoids are major secondary metabolites derived from the plant phenylpropanoid pathway that play important roles in plant development and also have benefits for human health. So-called MBW ternary complexes involving R2R3-MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors along with WD-repeat proteins have been reported to regulate expression of the biosynthetic genes in the flavonoid pathway. MYB4 and its closest homolog MYB7 have been suggested to function as repressors of phenylpropanoid metabolism. However, the detailed mechanism by which they act has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana MYB4 and its homologs MYB7 and MYB32 interact with the bHLH transcription factors TT8, GL3 and EGL3 and thereby interfere with the transcriptional activity of the MBW complexes. In addition, MYB4 can also inhibit flavonoid accumulation by repressing expression of the gene encoding Arogenate Dehydratase 6 (ADT6), which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, the precursor for flavonoid biosynthesis. MYB4 potentially represses not only the conventional ADT6 encoding the plastidial enzyme but also the alternative isoform encoding the cytosolic enzyme. We suggest that MYB4 plays dual roles in modulating the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis.
