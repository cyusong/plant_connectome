['21750235', 'In higher plant cells, microtubules (MTs) are nucleated and organized in a  centrosome-independent manner. It is unclear whether augmin-dependent mechanisms  underlie spindle MT organization in plant cells as they do in animal cells. When  AUGMIN subunit3 (AUG3), which encodes a homolog of animal dim gamma-tubulin 3/human  augmin-like complex, subunit 3, was disrupted in Arabidopsis thaliana,  gametogenesis frequently failed due to defects in cell division. Compared with  the control microspores, which formed bipolar spindles at the cell periphery, the  mutant cells often formed peripheral half spindles that only attached to  condensed chromosomes or formed elongated spindles with unfocused interior poles.  In addition, defective cells exhibited disorganized phragmoplast MT arrays, which  caused aborted cytokinesis. The resulting pollen grains were either shrunken or  contained two nuclei in an undivided cytoplasm. AUG3 was localized along MTs in  the spindle and phragmoplast, and its signal was pronounced in anaphase spindle  poles. An AUG3-green fluorescent protein fusion exhibited a dynamic distribution  pattern, similar to that of the gamma-tubulin complex protein2. When AUG3 was  enriched from seedlings by affinity chromatography, AUG1 was detected by  immunoblotting, suggesting an augmin-like complex was present in vivo. We  conclude that augmin plays a critical role in MT organization during plant cell  division.', '2011 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.086892', 'Liu']
