The Medicago truncatula LATD/NIP gene is essential for the development of lateral and primary root and nitrogen-fixing nodule meristems as well as for rhizobial invasion of nodules. LATD/NIP encodes a member of the NRT1(PTR1) nitrate and di-and tri-peptide transporter family, suggesting that its function is to transport one of these or another compound(s). Because latd/nip mutants can have their lateral and primary root defects rescued by ABA, ABA is a potential substrate for transport. LATD/NIP expression in the root meristem was demonstrated to be regulated by auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid, but not by nitrate. LATD/NIP's potential function and its role in coordinating root architecture and nodule formation are discussed.
