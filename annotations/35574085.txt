Since the development of <i>indica</i> hybrid rice in the 1970s, great success has been achieved in hybrid rice production in China and around the world. The utilization of inter-subspecific <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrid rice has always been considered due to its stronger heterosis characteristics. However, <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> hybrids face a serious problem of sterility, which hinders the exploitation of their heterosis. In the past decades, the genetic basis of <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> hybrid sterility has been well studied. It was found that in sterile <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> hybrids, female sterility was mainly controlled by the <i>S5</i> locus and male sterility by the <i>Sa</i>, <i>Sb</i>, <i>Sc</i>, <i>Sd</i>, and <i>Se</i> loci. In this study, we developed wide-compatible <i>indica</i> lines (WCILs) by pyramiding multiple neutral (n) alleles of the hybrid sterility loci. First, we identified <i>S<sup>n</sup></i> alleles of the loci in single-segment substitution lines (SSSLs) in the genetic background of <i>indica</i> Huajingxian 74 (HJX74). Then, the <i>S<sup>n</sup></i> alleles of <i>S5</i>, <i>Sb</i>, <i>Sc</i>, <i>Sd</i>, and <i>Se</i> loci in SSSLs were pyramided in the HJX74 genetic background. The WCILs carrying <i>S<sup>n</sup></i> alleles at the <i>S5</i>, <i>Sb</i>, <i>Sc</i>, <i>Sd</i>, and <i>Se</i> loci showed wide compatibility with <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties. Therefore, the WCILs will be used to develop inter-subspecific <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrid rice with normal fertility.
