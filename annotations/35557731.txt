Although human activities have greatly increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs to the alpine grassland ecosystems, how soil microbial functional genes involved in nutrient cycling respond to N and P input remains unknown. Based on a fertilization experiment established in an alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we investigated the response of the abundance of soil carbon (C), N, and P cycling genes to N and P addition and evaluated soil and plant factors related to the observed effects. Our results indicated that the abundance of C, N, and P cycling genes were hardly affected by N addition, while P addition significantly increased most of them, suggesting that the availability of P plays a more important role for soil microorganisms than N in this alpine meadow ecosystem. Meanwhile, when N and P were added together, the abundance of C, N, and P cycling genes did not change significantly, indicating that the promoting effects of P addition on microbial functional genes abundances were overwhelmed by N addition. The Mantel analysis and the variation partitioning analysis revealed the major role of shoot P concentration in regulating the abundance of C, N, and P cycling genes. These results suggest that soil P availability and plant traits are key in governing C, N, and P cycling genes at the functional gene level in the alpine grassland ecosystem.

N: !hardly affects! C, N, and P cycling genes
P: !significantly increases! C, N, and P cycling genes
N + P: !overwhelms! promoting effects of P addition
shoot P concentration: !regulates! abundance of C, N, and P cycling genes
