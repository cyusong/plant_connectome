Plant organellar RNA editing is a distinct type of post-transcriptional RNA modification that is critical for plant development. We showed previously that the RNA editing factor SlORRM4 is required for mitochondrial function and fruit ripening in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). However, a comprehensive atlas of the RNA editing mediated by SlORRM4 is lacking. We observed that SlORRM4 is targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria, and its knockout results in pale-green leaves and delayed fruit ripening. Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 12 chloroplast editing sites and 336 mitochondrial editing sites controlled by SlORRM4, accounting for 23% of chloroplast sites in leaves and 61% of mitochondrial sites in fruits, respectively. Analysis of native RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that SlORRM4 binds to 31 RNA targets; 19 of these targets contain SlORRM4-dependent editing sites. Large-scale analysis of putative SlORRM4-interacting proteins identified SlRIP1b, a RIP/MORF protein. Moreover, functional characterization demonstrated that SlRIP1b is involved in tomato fruit ripening. Our results indicate that SlORRM4 binds to RNA targets and interacts with SlRIP1b to broadly affect RNA editing in tomato organelles. These results provide insights into the molecular and functional diversity of RNA editing factors in higher plants.
