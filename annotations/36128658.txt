Visualization of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is the most elementary experiment in the field of mycorrhizal symbiosis. The most widely used approach for evaluating levels of AMF colonization is staining with trypan blue or ink, which is scored using the time-consuming grid intersection method. Here we demonstrate the use of an anthocyanin-based visual marker system for visualizing AMF colonization of Medicago truncatula roots. Expression of MtLAP1, a transcription factor which regulates the production of anthocyanins, from the AMF-induced Kunitz Protease Inhibitor 106 promoter, allowed the visualization of arbuscules in live plant tissues without microscopy or staining. This marker system allowed straightforward qualitative evaluation of the ram1, vpy and dmi3 AMF phenotypes using Agrobacterium rhizogenes hairy-root transformation. For the strigolactone biosynthesis mutant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8a and a novel mutant scooby, which show quantitative AMF symbiotic phenotypes, the amount of anthocyanins in the roots estimated by spectrophotometry correlated very well with colonization levels estimated by staining and scoring using the grid intersection method. The LAP1-based marker system therefore provides a highly efficient approach for mutant screening and monitoring of AMF colonization in live tissues by eye, or for quantitative assessment using a simple and quick photometric assay.
