['18252252', 'Plant SET domain proteins are known to be involved in the epigenetic control of  gene expression during plant development. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis  SET domain protein, SDG4, contributes to the epigenetic regulation of pollen tube  growth, thus affecting fertilization. Using an SDG4-GFP fusion construct, the  chromosomal localization of SDG4 was established in tobacco BY-2 cells. In  Arabidopsis, sdg4 knockout showed reproductive defects. Tissue-specific  expression analyses indicated that SDG4 is the major ASH1-related gene expressed  in the pollen. Immunological analyses demonstrated that SDG4 was involved in the  methylation of histone H3 in the inflorescence and pollen grains. The significant  reduction in the amount of methylated histone H3 K4 and K36 in sdg4 pollen  vegetative nuclei resulted in suppression of pollen tube growth. Our results  indicate that SDG4 is capable of modulating the expression of genes that function  in the growth of pollen tube by methylation of specific lysine residues of the  histone H3 in the vegetative nuclei.', '2008 Mar 15', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.12.016', 'Fukui']
