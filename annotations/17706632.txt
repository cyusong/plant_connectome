['17706632', 'Tissue growth as the result of cell division is an essential part of embryonic  development. Previous studies have shown that STIMPY (STIP)/WOX9, a homeodomain  transcription factor of the Arabidopsis thaliana WOX family, is required for  maintaining cell division and preventing premature differentiation in emerging  seedlings. Here we present evidence that STIP performs similar functions during  embryogenesis. Complete loss of STIP activity results in early embryonic arrest,  most likely due to a failure in cell division. STIMPY-LIKE (STPL)/WOX8, a close  homolog of STIP in Arabidopsis, also positively regulates early embryonic growth  and can replace STIP function when expressed under the STIP promoter. STPL shares  redundant functions with a more distantly related member of the WOX family, WOX2,  in regulating embryonic apical patterning. These findings show that combinatorial  action of WOX transcription factors is essential for Arabidopsis embryonic  development.', '2007 Sep 15', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.07.019', 'Weigel']
