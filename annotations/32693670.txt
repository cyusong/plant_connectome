Rattan spines are most often regarded as an identification trait and perhaps as a physical protection structure. In this study, we study the spinescence traits from five different species rattan: <i>Daemonorops lewisiana, Daemonorops geniculata, Calamus castaneus, Plectomia griffithii</i>, and <i>Korthalsia scortechinii</i>. We tested length, width, angle, strength, spine density, cross-section surface, spine color, and leaf trichomes (only for <i>D. lewisiana, C. castaneus</i> and <i>D. geniculata</i>). We also tested whether the spines were capable of deterring small climbing mammals (for <i>Plectomia griffithii</i> and <i>Calamus castaneus</i>) by using a choice selection experiment. Due to a variety of spine traits, we could not categorize whether any species is more or less spinescent than the others. We suggest that spines have a much more significant role than merely as a physical defense and work together with other rattan characteristics. This is also evidenced by our choice selection experiment, in which the spines on a single stem donot deter small climbing mammals. However, this is a work in progress, and we have outlined several alternative methods to be used in future work.
