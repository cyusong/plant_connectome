Despite being the primary source of energy in the biosphere, photosynthesis is a process that inevitably produces reactive oxygen species. Chloroplasts are a major source of hydrogen peroxide production in plant cells; therefore, different systems for peroxide reduction, such as ascorbate peroxidase and peroxiredoxins (Prxs), are found in this organelle. Most of the reducing power required for hydrogen peroxide reduction by these systems is provided by Fd reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain; hence, the function of these systems is highly dependent on light. Recently, it was described a novel plastidial enzyme, stated NTRC, formed by a thioredoxin reductase (NTR) domain at the N-terminus and a thioredoxin (Trx) domain at the C-terminus. NTRC is able to conjugate both NTR and Trx activities to efficiently reduce 2-Cys Prx using NADPH as a source of reducing power. Based on these results, it was proposed that NTRC is a new pathway to transfer reducing power to the chloroplast detoxification system, allowing the use of NADPH, besides reduced Fd, for such function. In this article, the most important features of NTRC are summarized and the implications of this novel activity in the context of chloroplast protection against oxidative damage are discussed.

Fd: !reduces! 2-Cys Prx 
NADPH: !provides reducing power to! NTRC 
NTRC: !conjugates! NTR and Trx activities 
NTRC: !transfers reducing power to! chloroplast detoxification system
