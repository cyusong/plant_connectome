Different classes of biotic (e.g., plant hormones) and abiotic (e.g., different wavelengths of light) signals act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate all aspects of plant development. Full signal transduction chains have not yet been described for most light or hormonal-mediated events despite the wide range of events early in development which are dependent upon hormonal and light signals. We recently reported a single signal transduction chain which can be initiated by both blue light (BL) and ABA, and which leads to the expression of specific members of the Lhcb gene family in the apical bud of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. The signal transduction chain consists of GCR1 (one of two Arabidopsis proteins coding for a potential G-protein coupled receptor), GPA1 (the sole Arabidopsis Ga subunit), PRN1 (Pirin1, one of four members of an iron-containing subgroup of the cupin superfamily), and a Nuclear Factor -Y (NF-Y) heterotrimer comprised of A5, B9 and possibly C9. The same signaling proteins control ABA-mediated delay of germination.
