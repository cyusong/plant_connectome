The potential biotechnological application of NAC overexpression has been challenged by meta-analysis, establishing a correlation between the magnitudes of several physiological and biochemical parameters and the enhanced tolerance to cold. Overexpression of various NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) transcription factors in different plant systems was shown to confer enhanced tolerance to low temperatures by inducing both common and distinctive stress response pathways. However, lack of consensus on the type of parameters evaluated, their magnitudes, and direction of the responses complicates drawing general conclusions on the effects of NAC expression in plant physiology. We report herein a meta-analysis summarizing the most critical response variables used to study the effect of overexpressing NAC regulators on cold stress tolerance. We found that NAC overexpression affected all of the outcome parameters in stressed plants, and one response in control conditions. Transformed plants displayed an increase of at least 40% in positive responses, while negative outcomes were reduced by at least 30%. The most reported parameters included survival, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde contents, whereas the most sensitive to the treatments were the F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> parameter, survival, and the activity of catalases. We also explored how different experimental arrangements affected the magnitudes of the responses. NAC-mediated improvements were best observed after severe stress episodes and during brief treatments (ranging from 5 to 24 h), especially in terms of antioxidant activities, accumulation of free proline, and parameters related to membrane integrity. Use of heterologous expression also favored several indicators of plant fitness. Our findings should help both basic and applied research on the influence of NAC expression on enhanced tolerance to cold.
