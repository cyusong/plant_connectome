Stem cells play important roles in animal and plant biology, as they sustain morphogenesis and tissue replenishment following aging or injury. In plants, stem cells are embedded in multicellular structures called meristems. The formation of new meristems is essential for the plastic expansion of the highly branched shoot and root systems. In particular, axillary meristems (AMs) that produce lateral shoots arise from the division of boundary domain cells at the leaf base. The CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) genes are major determinants of the boundary domain and are required for AM initiation. However, how AMs get structured and how stem cells become established de novo remain elusive. Here, we show that two NGATHA-LIKE (NGAL) transcription factors, DEVELOPMENT-RELATED PcG TARGET IN THE APEX4 (DPA4)/NGAL3 and SUPPRESSOR OF DA1-1 7 (SOD7)/NGAL2, redundantly repress CUC expression in initiating AMs of Arabidopsis thaliana. Ectopic boundary fate leads to abnormal growth and organization of the AM and prevents de novo stem cell establishment. Floral meristems of the dpa4 sod7 double mutant show a similar delay in de novo stem cell establishment. Altogether, while boundary fate is required for the initiation of AMs, our work reveals how it is later repressed to allow proper meristem establishment and de novo stem cell niche formation.
