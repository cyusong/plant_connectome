A regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) family protein has been functionally characterized to be involved in various cellular processes. In this study, one <i>RCC1</i> gene named <i>SaRCC1</i> was cloned from the full-length cDNA library of <i>Spartina</i><i>alterniflora</i>. The open reading frame (ORF) of <i>SaRCC1</i> was 1440 bp, and it encoded 479 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 51.65 kDa. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments showed that SaRCC1 had high identity with other plant RCC1s, and the phylogenetic analysis indicated that SaRCC1 had a closer affinity to <i>Zea mays</i> RCC1 family protein (ZmRCC1). <i>SaRCC1</i> gene was induced under salt stress conditions, and its encoded protein was located in peroxisome. In order to further investigate the function of <i>SaRCC1</i>, transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants ectopically both sense-overexpressing and antisense-overexpressing <i>SaRCC1</i> were generated. <i>SaRCC1</i>-overexpressing lines exhibited an increased salt and ABA hypersensitivity and reduced resistance to salinity stress. On the other hand, the transcripts of some stress-responsive genes in the <i>SaRCC1</i> transgenic plants were affected in response to salinity stress. Our results provide evidence for the involvement of <i>SaRCC1</i>, negatively regulating salt stress responses by affecting stress-related gene expression in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
