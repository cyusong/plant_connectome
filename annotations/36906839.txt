The plant 14-3-3 proteins are essential for many biological processes and responses to abiotic stress. We performed genome-wide identification and analysis of the 14-3-3 family genes in tomato. To explore the properties of the thirteen Sl14-3-3 found in the tomato genome, their chromosomal location, phylogenetic, and syntenic relationships were analyzed. The Sl14-3-3 promoters were found to have a number of growth-, hormone-, and stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements. Moreover, the qRT-PCR assay revealed that Sl14-3-3 genes are responsive to heat and osmotic stress. Subcellular localization experiments evidenced that the SlTFT3/6/10 proteins occur in the nucleus and cytoplasm Additional analysis on Sl14-3-3 putative interactor proteins revealed a number of prospective clients that potentially participate in stress reactions and developmental processes. Furthermore, overexpression of an Sl14-3-3 family gene, SlTFT6, improved tomato plants thermotolerance. Taken together, the study provides basic information on tomato 14-3-3 family genes in plant growth and abiotic stress response (high temperature stress), which can be helpful to further study the underlying molecular mechanisms.
