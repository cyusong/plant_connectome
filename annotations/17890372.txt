['17890372', 'Regulated RNA metabolism appears to be a critical component of molecular  mechanisms directing flowering initiation in plants. A group of RNA binding  proteins exerts their roles through the autonomous flowering pathway.  Posttranscriptional mechanisms regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) also play a key  role in flowering-time control. Here, we demonstrate that the GIGANTEA  (GI)-regulated miR172 defines a unique genetic pathway that regulates  photoperiodic flowering by inducing FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) independent of  CONSTANS (CO). A late-flowering mutant in which a miR172 target gene, TARGET OF  EAT1, is constitutively activated by the nearby insertion of the cauliflower  mosaic virus 35S enhancer normally responded to vernalization and gibberellic  acid treatments. By contrast, its response to daylength changes was severely  disrupted. In the mutant, FT was significantly repressed, but other flowering  genes were unaffected. Notably, miR172 abundance is regulated by photoperiod via  GI-mediated miRNA processing. Accordingly, miR172-overproducing plants exhibit  early flowering under both long days and short days, even in the absence of  functional CO, indicating that miR172 promotes photoperiodic flowering through a  CO-independent genetic pathway. Therefore, it appears that GI-mediated  photoperiodic flowering is governed by the coordinated interaction of two  distinct genetic pathways: one mediated via CO and the other mediated via miR172  and its targets.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054528', 'Park']
