Phospholipid biosynthesis is essential for the construction of most eukaryotic cell membranes, but how this process is regulated in plants remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, two Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolases called PAH1 and PAH2 act redundantly to repress phospholipid biosynthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Leaves from pah1 pah2 double mutants contain ~1.8-fold more phospholipid than the wild type and exhibit gross changes in ER morphology, which are consistent with massive membrane overexpansion. The net rate of incorporation of [methyl-(14)C]choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC) is ~1.8-fold greater in the double mutant, and the transcript abundance of several key genes that encode enzymes involved in phospholipid synthesis is increased. In particular, we show that PHOSPHORYLETHANOLAMINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (PEAMT1) is upregulated at the level of transcription in pah1 pah2 leaves. PEAMT catalyzes the first committed step of choline synthesis in Arabidopsis and defines a variant pathway for PC synthesis not found in yeasts or mammals. Our data suggest that PAH1/2 play a regulatory role in phospholipid synthesis that is analogous to that described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the target enzymes differ, and key components of the signal transduction pathway do not appear to be conserved.
