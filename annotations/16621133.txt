Phospholipase D (PLD) activity was found to be higher in etiolated oat seedlings than in green seedlings. White and red (R) light exposure inhibited PLD activity in etiolated seedlings. Far-red light eliminated R-light-induced decrease in PLD activity, indicating phytochrome participation in observed photomodulation. Inhibitor of electron transport in chloroplast 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea stimulated and glucose suppressed PLD activity in green and etiolated oat seedlings, respectively. These results suggest that PLD activity in oat seedling is regulated by light with involvement of phytochrome photoreceptor, and associated with photosynthesis process.
