['30914470', 'Spatial organization of chromatin contributes to gene regulation of many cellular  processes and includes a connection of chromatin with the nuclear lamina (NL).  The NL is a protein mesh that resides underneath the inner nuclear membrane and  consists of lamins and lamina-associated proteins. Chromatin regions associated  with lamins in animals are characterized mostly by constitutive heterochromatin,  but association with facultative heterochromatin mediated by Polycomb-group (PcG)  proteins has been reported as well. In contrast with animals, plant NL components  are largely not conserved and NL association with chromatin is poorly explored.  Here, we present the connection between the lamin-like protein, CROWDED NUCLEI1  (CRWN1), and the chromatin- and PcG-associated component,  PROLINE-TRYPTOPHANE-TRYPTOPHANE-PROLINE INTERACTOR OF POLYCOMBS1, in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that PWO1 and CRWN1 proteins associate physically  with each other, act in the same pathway to maintain nuclear morphology, and  control expression of a similar set of target genes. Moreover, we demonstrate  that transiently expressed PWO1 proteins form foci located partially at the  subnuclear periphery. Ultimately, as CRWN1 and PWO1 are plant-specific, our  results argue that plants might have developed an equivalent, rather than  homologous, mechanism of linking chromatin repression and NL.', '2019 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00663', 'ORCID:']
