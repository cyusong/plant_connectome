An interesting AMF colonization microcosm has been detected in the roots of Pancratium maritimum (sea daffodil). Both sequencing techniques (Sanger and NGS) have been used for AMF characterisation, showing a balanced trade-off between pros and cons. By Sanger and next generation sequencing of rRNA nuclear molecular markers (SSU-ITS-LSU and ITS2, respectively), the presence of AMF communities in the roots of P. maritimum was evaluated. Our results shed light on the presence of AMF in sea daffodil and the diversity of assemblages of AMF detected after Sanger sequencing of the SSU-ITS-LSU marker is much higher than that determined following NGS sequencing of ITS2 alone.

Sanger sequencing: !detects! AMF communities 
NGS sequencing: !detects! AMF communities 
SSU-ITS-LSU marker: !evaluates! presence of AMF 
ITS2: !evaluates! presence of AMF 
Sanger sequencing: !reveals! higher diversity of AMF assemblages 
NGS sequencing: !reveals! lower diversity of AMF assemblages
