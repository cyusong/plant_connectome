Flowering time regulation is one of the most important processes in the whole life of flowering plants and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a central repressor of flowering time. However, whether metabolic acetate level affects flowering time is unknown. Here we report that ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE ALDH3F1 plays essential roles in floral transition via FLC-dependent pathway. In the aldh3f1-1 mutant, the flowering time was significant earlier than Col-0 and the FLC expression level was reduced. ALDH3F1 had aldehyde dehydrogenase activity to affect the acetate level in plants, and the amino acids of E214 and C252 are essential for its catalytic activity. Moreover, aldh3f1 mutation reduced acetate level and the total acetylation on histone H3. The H3K9Ac level on FLC locus was decreased in aldh3f1-1, which reduced FLC expression. Expression of ALDH3F1 could rescue the decreased H3K9Ac level on FLC, FLC expression and also the early-flowering phenotype of aldh3f1-1, however ALDH3F1<sup>E214A</sup> or ALDH3F1<sup>C252A</sup> could not. Our findings demonstrate that ALDH3F1 participates in flowering time regulation through modulating the supply of acetate for acetyl-CoA, which functions as histone acetylation donor to modulate H3K9Ac on FLC locus.
