['18774967', 'Effector-triggered immunity provides plants with strong protection from  pathogens. However, this response has the potential to be highly deleterious to  the host and needs to be tightly controlled. The molecular mechanisms in the  plant that regulate the balance between activation and suppression of resistance  are not fully understood. Previously, we identified Arabidopsis suppressor of  rps4-RLD 1 (srfr1) mutants with enhanced resistance to the bacterial effector  AvrRps4. These mutants were recessive and retained full susceptibility to  virulent bacteria, suggesting that SRFR1 functions as a negative regulator and  that AvrRps4-triggered immunity was specifically enhanced in the mutants.  Consistent with this, we show here that the response to flagellin, an elicitor of  basal resistance, is unaltered in srfr1-1. In contrast, resistance to AvrRps4 in  srfr1-1 requires EDS1, a central regulator of effector-triggered immunity via  multiple resistance genes. SRFR1 is a single-copy gene encoding a pioneer  tetratricopeptide repeat protein conserved between plants and animals. The SRFR1  tetratricopeptide repeat domain shows sequence similarity to those of  transcriptional repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis  elegans. Indeed, a sub-pool of SRFR1 transiently expressed in Nicotiana  benthamiana leaf cells localizes to the nucleus. Identification of SRFR1 may  therefore provide insight into the regulation of the transcriptional  reprogramming that is activated by effector-triggered immunity.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03669.x', 'Gassmann']
