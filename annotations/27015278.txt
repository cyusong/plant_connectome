['27015278', 'MicroProteins are short, single domain proteins that act by sequestering larger,  multi-domain proteins into non-functional complexes. MicroProteins have been  identified in plants and animals, where they are mostly involved in the  regulation of developmental processes. Here we show that two Arabidopsis thaliana  microProteins, miP1a and miP1b, physically interact with CONSTANS (CO) a potent  regulator of flowering time. The miP1a/b-type microProteins evolved in  dicotyledonous plants and have an additional carboxy-terminal PF(V/L)FL motif.  This motif enables miP1a/b microProteins to interact with TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED  (TPL/TPR) proteins. Interaction of CO with miP1a/b/TPL causes late flowering due  to a failure in the induction of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression under  inductive long day conditions. Both miP1a and miP1b are expressed in vascular  tissue, where CO and FT are active. Genetically, miP1a/b act upstream of CO thus  our findings unravel a novel layer of flowering time regulation via  microProtein-inhibition.', '2016 Mar', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005959', 'Wenkel']
