Lysine malonylation is a kind of post-translational modifications (PTMs) discovered in recent years, which plays an important regulatory role in plants. Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) is a major global cereal crop. Immunoblotting revealed that maize was rich in malonylated proteins. We therefore performed a qualitative malonylome analysis to globally identify malonylated proteins in maize. In total, 1,722 uniquely malonylated lysine residues were obtained in 810 proteins. The modified proteins were involved in various biological processes such as photosynthesis, ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation. Notably, a large proportion of the modified proteins (45%) were located in chloroplast. Further functional analysis revealed that 30 proteins in photosynthesis and 15 key enzymes in the Calvin cycle were malonylated, suggesting an indispensable regulatory role of malonylation in photosynthesis and carbon fixation. This work represents the first comprehensive survey of malonylome in maize and provides an important resource for exploring the function of lysine malonylation in physiological regulation of maize.
