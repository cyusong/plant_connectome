A fascinating aspect of floral diversity is the dramatic difference in flower size observed in nature. The largest flowers in the world, Rafflesia arnoldii, span several feet while flowers of the genus Wolffia are microscopic. My own particular interest in flower size started when I overexpressed the Arabidopsis gene AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and observed a larger flower phenotype.
