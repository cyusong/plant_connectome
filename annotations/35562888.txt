In recent years, advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have continued to change our views on biological systems by increasing the spatiotemporal resolution of our analysis to single-cell resolution. Application of scRNA-seq to plants enables the comprehensive characterization of both common and rare cell types and cell states, uncovering new cell types and revealing how cell types relate to each other spatially and developmentally. This review provides an overview of scRNA-seq methodologies, highlights the application of scRNA-seq in plant science, justifies why scRNA-seq is a master player of sequencing, and explains the role of single-cell transcriptomics technologies in environmental stress adaptation, alongside the challenges and prospects of single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, we put forward a central role of single-cell sequencing in plant research.
