['8016262', 'A cDNA clone was isolated from an Arabidopsis leaf cDNA library that shared a  high degree of protein sequence identity with mitochondrial acyl carrier proteins  (mtACPs) isolated from Neurospora crassa and bovine heart muscle. The cDNA  encoded an 88-amino acid mature protein that was preceded by a putative 35-amino  acid presequence. In vitro protein import studies have confirmed that the  presequence specifically targets this protein into pea mitochondria but not into  chloroplasts. These studies indicated that pea mitochondria were not only able to  import and process the precursor protein but also possessed the ability to  acylate the mature protein. The mitochondrial localization of this protein,  mtACP-1, was confirmed by western blot analysis. Arabidopsis mitochondrial  protein extracts contained two cross-reacting bands that comigrated with the  mature mtACP-1 and acylated mtACP-1 proteins. The acylated form of mtACP-1 was  approximately 4 times more abundant than the unacylated form and appeared to be  localized predominantly in the mitochondrial membrane where the unacylated  mtACP-1 was present mostly in the matrix fraction. A chloroplast fatty acid  synthase system was used, and mtACP-1 was able to function as a cofactor for  fatty acid synthesis. However, predominantly short- and medium-chain fatty acids  were produced in fatty acid synthase reactions supplemented with mtACP-1,  suggesting that mtACP-1 may be causing premature fatty acid chain termination.', '1994 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.4.1221', 'Ohlrogge']
