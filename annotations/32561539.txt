Self-incompatibility (SI) is used by many angiosperms to reject self-pollen and avoid inbreeding. In field poppy (<i>Papaver rhoeas</i>), SI recognition and rejection of self-pollen is facilitated by a female <i>S</i>-determinant, <i>PrsS</i>, and a male <i>S</i>-determinant, <i>PrpS</i> <i>PrsS</i> belongs to the cysteine-rich peptide family, whose members activate diverse signaling networks involved in plant growth, defense, and reproduction. <i>PrsS</i> and <i>PrpS</i> are tightly regulated and expressed solely in pistil and pollen cells, respectively. Interaction of cognate PrsS and PrpS triggers pollen tube growth inhibition and programmed cell death (PCD) of self-pollen. We previously demonstrated functional intergeneric transfer of <i>PrpS</i> and <i>PrsS</i> to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) pollen and pistil. Here, we show that <i>PrpS</i> and <i>PrsS</i>, when expressed ectopically, act as a bipartite module to trigger a self-recognition:self-destruct response in Arabidopsis independently of its reproductive context in vegetative cells. The addition of recombinant PrsS to seedling roots expressing the cognate <i>PrpS</i> resulted in hallmark features of the <i>P</i> <i>rhoeas</i> SI response, including <i>S</i>-specific growth inhibition and PCD of root cells. Moreover, inducible expression of <i>PrsS</i> in <i>PrpS</i>-expressing seedlings resulted in rapid death of the entire seedling. This demonstrates that, besides specifying SI, the bipartite <i>PrpS-PrsS</i> module can trigger growth arrest and cell death in vegetative cells. Heterologous, ectopic expression of a plant bipartite signaling module in plants has not been shown previously and, by extrapolation, our findings suggest that cysteine-rich peptides diversified for a variety of specialized functions, including the regulation of growth and PCD.
