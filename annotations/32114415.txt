Rice tillering, which determines the panicle number per plant, is an important agronomic trait for grain production. In higher plants, ascorbic acid (Asc) plays a major role in ROS-scavenging activity. l-Galactono-1, 4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH, EC1.3.2.3) is an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of Asc biosynthesis in plants. Previously, we have reported that homozygous L-GalLDH-suppressed transgenic rice plants (GI) display a reduced tiller number and a lower level of foliar carotenoids (Car) compared with wild type. Strigolactones (SL), which play an important role in the suppression of shoot branching, are synthesized in the roots of rice plant using Car as substrates. In this paper, the relationship between Asc, SL, the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, changes in antioxidant capacity, enzyme activities, and gene transcriptions related to the synthesis of SL were analyzed in transgenic rice plants for L-GalLDH suppressed (GI-1 and GI-2) and overexpressing (GO-2). The results showed that the altered level of Asc in the L-GalLDH transgenic rice plants leads to a change in redox homeostasis, resulting in a marked accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and decreased antioxidant capacity in GI-1 and GI-2, but lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content and increased antioxidant capacity in GO-2. Meanwhile, the altered level of Asc also leads to altered enzyme activities and gene transcript abundances related to SL synthesis in L-GalLDH transgenics. These observations support the conclusion that Asc influences tiller number in the L-GalLDH transgenics by affecting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and antioxidant capacity, and altering those enzyme activities and gene transcript abundances related to SL synthesis.
