['19168645', 'The Signal Peptide Peptidases (SPP) are members of the Intramembrane Cleaving  Proteases, which are involved in an array of protein-processing and intracellular  signaling events in animals. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has six genes  encoding SPP-like proteins, the physiological functions of which are unknown. As  a first step in defining the roles of the SPPs in plants, we examined the  distribution and activities of Arabidopsis SPP (AtSPP; accession no. At2g03120),  the SPP-like gene with the highest degree of similarity to human SPP. The  protease is expressed at low levels throughout the plant, with the highest levels  in emerging leaves, roots, and floral tissues. Homozygous plants carrying a T-DNA  insertion mutation in AtSPP, spp-2, could not be recovered, and transmission of  the mutant allele through pollen was reduced to less than 2% in reciprocal cross  experiments. Although viable, pollen from spp-2 heterozygous plants exhibited a  50% reduction in germination rate and a disruption in male germ unit  organization. These data demonstrate that AtSPP is required for male gametophyte  development and pollen maturation in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.130252', 'Schnell']
