['12215507', 'The genesis of phyllotaxis, which often is associated with the Fibonacci series  of numbers, is an old unsolved puzzle in plant morphogenesis. Here, we show that  disruption of an Arabidopsis topoisomerase (topo) I gene named TOP1alpha affects  phyllotaxis and plant architecture. The divergence angles and internode lengths  between two successive flowers were more random in the top1alpha mutant than in  the wild type. The top1alpha plants sporadically produced multiple flowers from  one node, and the number of floral organ primordia often was different. The  mutation also caused the twisting of inflorescences and individual flowers and  the serration of leaf margins. These morphological abnormalities indicate that  TOP1alpha may play a critical role in the maintenance of a regular pattern of  organ initiation. The top1alpha mutant transformed with the RNA interference  construct for TOP1beta, another topo I gene arrayed tandemly with TOP1alpha, was  found to be lethal at young seedling stages, suggesting that topo I activity is  essential in plants.', '2002 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.001925', 'Komeda']
