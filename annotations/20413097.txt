['20413097', 'Cell-surface-localized plant immune receptors, such as FLS2, detect  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate PAMP-triggered  immunity (PTI) through poorly understood signal-transduction pathways. The  pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPphB, a cysteine protease, cleaves  the Arabidopsis receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBS1 to trigger cytoplasmic  immune receptor RPS5-specified effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Analyzing the  function of AvrPphB in plants lacking RPS5, we find that AvrPphB can inhibit PTI  by cleaving additional PBS1-like (PBL) kinases, including BIK1, PBL1, and PBL2.  In unstimulated plants, BIK1 and PBL1 interact with FLS2 and are rapidly  phosphorylated upon FLS2 activation by its ligand flg22. Genetic and molecular  analyses indicate that BIK1, and possibly PBL1, PBL2, and PBS1, integrate immune  signaling from multiple immune receptors. Whereas AvrPphB-mediated degradation of  one of these kinases, PBS1, is monitored by RPS5 to initiate ETI, this pathogenic  effector targets other PBL kinases for PTI inhibition.', '2010 Apr 22', 'Cell Host Microbe', '10.1016/j.chom.2010.03.007', 'Zhou']
