['29396477', 'Reticulons are integral ER membrane proteins characterised by a reticulon  homology domain comprising four transmembrane domains which results in the  proteins sitting in the membrane in a W-topology. Here we report on a novel  subgroup of reticulons with an extended N-terminal domain and in particular on  arabidopsis reticulon 20. Using high resolution confocal microscopy we show that  reticulon 20 is located in a unique punctate pattern on the ER membrane. Its  closest homologue reticulon 19 labels the whole ER. Other than demonstrated for  the other members of the reticulon protein family RTN20 and 19 do not display ER  constriction phenotypes on over expression. We show that mutants in RTN20 or  RTN19, respectively, display a significant change in sterol composition in roots  indicating a role in lipid regulation. A third homologue in this family  -3BETAHSD/D1- is unexpectedly localised to ER exit sites resulting in an  intriguing location difference for the three proteins.', '2018 Feb 2', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-018-20840-0', 'Hawes']
