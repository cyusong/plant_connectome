['24114060', 'Boron (B) is required for cross linking of the pectic polysaccharide  rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) and is consequently essential for the maintenance  of cell wall structure. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BOR1 is an efflux B  transporter for xylem loading of B. Here, we describe the roles of BOR2, the most  similar paralog of BOR1. BOR2 encodes an efflux B transporter localized in plasma  membrane and is strongly expressed in lateral root caps and epidermis of  elongation zones of roots. Transfer DNA insertion of BOR2 reduced root elongation  by 68%, whereas the mutation in BOR1 reduced it by 32% under low B availability  (0.1 microm), but the reduction in shoot growth was not as obvious as that in the  BOR1 mutant. A double mutant of BOR1 and BOR2 exhibited much more severe growth  defects in both roots and shoots under B-limited conditions than the  corresponding single mutants. All single and double mutants grew normally under  B-sufficient conditions. These results suggest that both BOR1 and BOR2 are  required under B limitation and that their roles are, at least in part,  different. The total B concentrations in roots of BOR2 mutants were not  significantly different from those in wild-type plants, but the proportion of  cross-linked RG-II was reduced under low B availability. Such a reduction in  RG-II cross linking was not evident in roots of the BOR1 mutant. Thus, we propose  that under B-limited conditions, transport of boric acid/borate by BOR2 from  symplast to apoplast is required for effective cross linking of RG-II in cell  wall and root cell elongation.', '2013 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.225995', 'Fujiwara']
