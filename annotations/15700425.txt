Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) is the predominant cool-season pasture grass in the USA. Embryogenic calluses were induced from seeds/caryopsis of elite tall fescue cultivars Jesup and Kentucky-31, and were broken up into small pieces and used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Agrobacterium strains LBA4404 and EHA105 harboring pCAMBIA vectors or the super-binary vector pTOK233 were used to infect the embryogenic callus pieces. The number of hygromycin resistant calluses obtained per dish of infected callus pieces was in the range of 2.0-5.8, and the number of transgenic plants recovered per dish of infected callus pieces was in the range of 0.4-1.7. When transformation efficiency was calculated based on the number of transgenic plants recovered and the number of original intact calluses used, the transformation frequency was in the range of 1.9-8.7%. The use of the easily available pCAMBIA vectors could produce equivalent results as the superbinary vector pTOK233. The transgenic nature of the regenerated plants was demonstrated by Southern hybridization analysis using undigested and digested genomic DNA samples. Expression of the transgenes was confirmed by northern hybridization analysis, GUS staining, and detection of GFP signals. Fertile transgenic plants were obtained after vernalization in the greenhouse. Progeny analysis revealed Mendelian inheritance of the transgenes.
