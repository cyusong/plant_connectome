In order to explore the mechanisms of nitrate's beneficial effect on ammonium-grown plants, we investigated the effects of nitrate on free and conjugated polyamine plant content and ethylene biosynthesis in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants grown with ammonium nutrition. Two different doses of nitrate (100 microM and 5 mM) were supplied to ammonium-fed plants, in order to determine whether the effects of nitrate require significant doses (nutritional character), or can be promoted by very low doses (pseudo-hormonal character). Our results showed that nitrate's effects on putrescine, spermidine and spermine contents of ammonium-grown plants tended to follow the pattern associated with strict nitrate nutrition. Both low (100 microM) and high (5 mM) nitrate doses caused a rapid and significant increase in free spermidine content in roots and shoots, which was well correlated with reduced root ethylene production. In shoots, this increase in free spermidine was correlated with changes in the conjugation pattern, while in roots these changes appear to be due to alternative mechanisms. On the other hand, no clear relationship between the supply of a lower dose of nitrate (100 microM) and a reduction of free putrescine content was observed. With higher doses of nitrate (5 mM) we observed a reduction of free putrescine content that was well correlated with increases in its conjugated forms. In conclusion, nitrate's effects on putrescine, spermidine and spermine contents of ammonium-fed plants tended to follow the pattern associated with strict nitrate nutrition, corroborating its beneficial effect.
