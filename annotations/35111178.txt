Inter-organ communication and the heat stress (HS; 45°C, 6 h) responses of organs exposed and not directly exposed to HS were evaluated in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) by comparing the impact of HS applied either to whole plants, or only to shoots or roots. Whole-plant HS reduced photosynthetic activity (F <sub><i>v</i></sub> /F <sub><i>m</i></sub> and QY<sub>_<i>Lss</i></sub> ), but this effect was alleviated by prior acclimation (37°C, 2 h). Dynamics of <i>HSFA2d</i>, <i>HSP90.2</i>, <i>HSP90.3</i>, and <i>SIG5</i> expression revealed high protection of crowns and roots. Additionally, <i>HSP26.2</i> was strongly expressed in leaves. Whole-plant HS increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and cytokinin <i>cis</i>-zeatin in leaves, while up-regulating auxin indole-3-acetic acid and down-regulating <i>trans</i>-zeatin in leaves and crowns. Ascorbate peroxidase activity and expression of alternative oxidases (<i>AOX</i>) increased in leaves and crowns. HS targeted to leaves elevated levels of JA in roots, <i>cis</i>-zeatin in crowns, and ascorbate peroxidase activity in crowns and roots. HS targeted to roots increased levels of abscisic acid and auxin in leaves and crowns, <i>cis</i>-zeatin in leaves, and JA in crowns, while reducing <i>trans</i>-zeatin levels. The weaker protection of leaves reflects the growth strategy of rice. HS treatment of individual organs induced changes in phytohormone levels and antioxidant enzyme activity in non-exposed organs, in order to enhance plant stress tolerance.
