The ethylene response factor (ERF) plays a crucial role in plant innate immunity. However, the molecular function of ERF in response to <i>Exserohilum turcicum</i> (<i>E</i>. <i>turcicum</i>) remains unknown in maize. In this study, a novel ERF gene, designated as <i>ZmERF105</i>, was firstly isolated and characterized. The <i>ZmERF105</i> protein contains an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) domain and a conserved LSPLSPHP motif in its C-terminal region. ZmERF105 protein was exclusively localized to the nucleus. <i>ZmERF105</i> expression responded to <i>E</i>. <i>turcicum</i> treatment. Yeast one-hybrid and transcription activity assays revealed that <i>ZmERF105</i> is an activator of transcription and binds to GCC-box elements. Over-expression of <i>ZmERF105</i> was shown to increase maize resistance against <i>E</i>. <i>turcicum</i>, and <i>erf105</i> mutant lines displayed opposite phenotype. Moreover, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) in the <i>ZmERF105</i> over-expression lines were markedly higher than in the wild-type maize lines (WT) after infection with <i>E</i>. <i>turcicum</i>, and were compromised in the <i>erf105</i> mutant lines. Simultaneously, <i>ZmERF105</i> over-expression lines enhanced the expression of several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, including <i>ZmPR1a</i>, <i>ZmPR2</i>, <i>ZmPR5</i>, <i>ZmPR10.1</i>, and <i>ZmPR10.2</i> after infection with <i>E</i>. <i>turcicum</i>. In contrast, the expression of PR genes was reduced in <i>erf105</i> mutant lines. Our work reveals that <i>ZmERF105</i> as a novel player of the ERF network and positively regulates the maize resistance response to <i>E</i>. <i>turcicum</i>.
