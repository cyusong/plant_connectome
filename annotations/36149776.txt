DNA methylation and histone modification are evolutionarily conserved epigenetic modifications that are crucial for the expression regulation of abiotic stress-responsive genes in plants. Dynamic changes in gene expression levels can result from changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications. In the last two decades, how epigenetic machinery regulates abiotic stress responses in plants has been extensively studied. Here, based on recent publications, we review how DNA methylation and histone modifications impact gene expression regulation in response to abiotic stresses such as drought, abscisic acid, high salt, extreme temperature, nutrient deficiency or toxicity, and ultraviolet B exposure. We also review the roles of epigenetic mechanisms in the formation of transgenerational stress memory. We posit that a better understanding of the epigenetic underpinnings of abiotic stress responses in plants may facilitate the design of more stress-resistant or -resilient crops, which is essential for coping with global warming and extreme environments.
