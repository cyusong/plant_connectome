Halophytes tolerate high salinity levels that would kill conventional crops. Understanding salt tolerance mechanisms will provide clues for breeding salt-tolerant plants. Many halophytes, such as quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), are covered by a layer of epidermal bladder cells (EBCs) that are thought to mediate salt tolerance by serving as salt dumps. We isolated an epidermal bladder cell-free (ebcf) quinoa mutant that completely lacked EBCs and was mutated in REBC and REBC-like1. This mutant showed no loss of salt stress tolerance. When wild-type quinoa plants were exposed to saline soil, EBCs accumulated potassium (K<sup>+</sup> ) as the major cation, in quantities far exceeding those of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup> ). Emerging leaves densely packed with EBCs had the lowest Na<sup>+</sup> content, whereas old leaves with deflated EBCs served as Na<sup>+</sup> sinks. When the leaves expanded, K<sup>+</sup> was recycled from EBCs, resulting in turgor loss that led to a progressive deflation of EBCs. Our findings suggest that EBCs in young leaves serve as a K<sup>+</sup> -powered hydrodynamic system that functions as a water sink for solute storage. Sodium ions accumulate within old leaves that subsequently wilt and are shed. This mechanism improves the survival of quinoa under high salinity conditions.

REBC: !mediates! salt tolerance 
EBCs: !accumulate! K+ 
EBCs: !store! solutes 
Na+: !accumulates in! old leaves 
K+: !powers! hydrodynamic system 
EBCs: !deflate! when leaves expand
