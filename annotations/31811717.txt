Rice allelopathy is a natural method of weed control that is regarded as an eco-friendly practice in agroecology. The allelopathic potential of rice is regulated by various genes, including those that encode transcription factors. Our study characterized a MYB transcription factor, OsMYB57, to explore its role in the regulation of rice allelopathy. Increasing the expression of OsMYB57 in rice using the transcription activator VP64 resulted in increased inhibitory ratios against barnyardgrass. The gene expression levels of OsPAL, OsC4H, OsOMT, and OsCAD from the phenylpropanoid pathway were also up-regulated, and the content of l-phenylalanine increased. Chromatin immunoprecipitation incorporated with HiSeq demonstrated that OsMYB57 transcriptionally regulated a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMAPK11); in addition, OsMAPK11 interacted with OsPAL2;3. The expression of OsPAL2;3was higher in the allelopathic rice PI312777 than in the non-allelopathic rice Lemont, and OsPAL2;3 was negatively regulated by Whirly transcription factors. Moreover, microbes with weed-suppression potential, including Penicillium spp. and Bacillus spp., were assembled in the rhizosphere of the rice accession Kitaake with increased expression of OsMYB57, and were responsible for phenolic acid induction. Our findings suggest that OsMYB57 positively regulates rice allelopathy, providing an option for the improvement of rice allelopathic traits through genetic modification.
