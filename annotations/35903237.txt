Hybrid sterility genes define species identities, setting reproductive barriers between distantly related <i>Oryza</i> relatives. They induce allelic-specific selective gametic abnormalities by killing pollens, embryo sacs, or both, and thus resulting in the male specific transmission ratio distortion (<i>m</i>TRD), female specific transmission ratio distortion (<i>f</i> TRD), and/or sex-independent transmission ratio distortion (<i>si</i>TRD) in hybrids. Although more than 50 hybrid sterility genes have been reported, comprehensive analysis on the distributional pattern of TRD systems in <i>Oryza</i> species is limited. In this review, we surveyed the TRD systems and the underlying possible mechanisms in these species. In rice, pollen killers which cause <i>m</i>TRD are often observed in higher frequency than egg killers and gamete eliminators, which are factors affecting <i>f</i> TRD and <i>si</i>TRD, respectively. Due to the rather massive population of pollen grains, their reduction in the number caused by hybrid sterility possesses a smaller selective disadvantage to the hybrid individuals, in contrast to female gamete abortion. The pattern of TRD distribution displays less abundancy in <i>si</i>TRD. It suggests that fixation of <i>si</i>TRD might require a certain time rather than single sex-specific factors. The presence of linked sterility factors worked for <i>m</i>TRD and <i>f</i> TRD, and strength of their linkage in chromosomal regions might determine the type of sterility and TRD. The study of TRD systems has a potential to reveal the relationships between selfish genes and their functions for reproductive isolation.
