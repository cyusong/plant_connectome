Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is considered a highly nutritional and economical crop due to its high contents of bioactive substances, such as anthocyanin and chlorogenic acid (CGA), especially in leaves and stems. The roles of noncoding RNAs (ncRNA), including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), in CGA synthesis, are still unknown. In this study, the differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs in two leafy vegetable genotypes "FS7-6-14-7" (high CGA content) and "FS7-6" (low CGA content) were identified. The cis-regulation between lncRNA and mRNA was analyzed. Then, the CGA synthesis-related modules MEBlue and MEYellow were identified to detect trans-regulation mRNA-lncRNA pairs. The GO and KEGG annotations suggested that mRNA in these two modules was significantly enriched in the secondary metabolite synthesis biosynthesis category. A competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network, including 8730 miRNA-mRNA and 444 miRNA-lncRNA pairs, was constructed by DEmiRNA target prediction. Then, a CGA synthesis-related ceRNA network was obtained with lncRNA and mRNA from MEBlue and MEYellow. Finally, one relational pair, MSTRG.47662.1/mes-miR398/itb04g00990, was selected for functional validation. Overexpression of lncRNA MSTRG.47662.1 and mRNA itb04g00990 increased CGA content in both tobacco and sweet potato callus, while overexpression of miRNA mes-miR398 decreased CGA content. Meanwhile, regression analysis of the expression patterns demonstrated that MSTRG.47662.1, acting as a ceRNA, promoted itb04g00990 expression by competitively binding mes-miR398 in CGA synthesis in sweet potato. Our results provide insights into how ncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory networks likely contribute to CGA synthesis in leafy sweet potato.
