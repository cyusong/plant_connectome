Rho of Plants (ROPs) are GTPases that regulate polarity and patterned wall deposition in plants. As these small, globular proteins have many interactors, it has been difficult to ensure that methods to visualize ROP in live cells do not affect ROP function. Here, motivated by work in fission yeast (<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>), we generated a fluorescent moss (<i>Physcomitrium</i> [<i>Physcomitrella</i>] <i>patens</i>) ROP4 fusion protein by inserting mNeonGreen after Gly-134. Plants harboring tagged <i>ROP4</i> and no other <i>ROP</i> genes were phenotypically normal. Plants lacking all four <i>ROP</i> genes comprised an unpatterned clump of spherical cells that were unable to form gametophores, demonstrating that ROP is essentially for spatial patterning at the cellular and tissue levels. The functional ROP fusion protein formed a steep gradient at the apical plasma membranes of growing tip cells. ROP also predicted the site of branch formation in the apical cell at the onset of mitosis, which occurs one to two cell cycles before a branch cell emerges. While fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies demonstrated that ROP dynamics do not depend on the cytoskeleton, acute depolymerization of the cytoskeleton removed ROP from the membrane only in recently divided cells, pointing to a feedback mechanism between the cell cycle, cytoskeleton, and ROP.
