In flowering plants, C-to-U RNA editing can be critical to normal functions of mitochondrion-encoded proteins. Mitochondrial C-to-U RNA editing is facilitated by many factors from diverse protein families, of which the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play an important role. Owing to their large number and frequent embryo lethality in mutants, functions of many PPRs remain unknown. In this study, we characterized a mitochondrion-localized DYW-type PPR protein, DEK48, functioning in the C-to-U RNA editing at multiple mitochondrial transcripts in maize. Null mutation of <i>Dek48</i> severely arrests embryo and endosperm development, causing a <i>defective kernel</i> (<i>dek</i>) phenotype, named <i>dek48</i>. DEK48 loss of function abolishes the C-to-U editing at <i>nad3</i>-185, -215, and <i>nad4</i>-376, -977 sites and decreases the editing at 11 other sites, resulting in the alteration of the corresponding amino acids. Consequently, the absence of editing caused reduced assembly and activity of complex I in <i>dek48</i>. Interestingly, we identified a point mutation in <i>dek48-3</i> causing a deletion of the Tryptophan (W) residue in the DYW motif that abolishes the editing function. In sum, this study reveals the function of DEK48 in the C-to-U editing in mitochondrial transcripts and seed development in maize, and it demonstrates a critical role of the W residue in the DYW triplet motif of DEK48 for the C-to-U editing function in vivo.
