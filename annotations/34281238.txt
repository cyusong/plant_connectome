This study evaluated the effects of different light spectra (white light; WL, blue light; BL and red light; RL) on the root morphological traits and metabolites accumulation and biosynthesis in <i>Sarcandra glabra</i>. We performed transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling by RNA-seq and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS), respectively. When morphological features were compared to WL, BL substantially increased under-ground fresh weight, root length, root surface area, and root volume, while RL inhibited these indices. A total of 433 metabolites were identified, of which 40, 18, and 68 compounds differentially accumulated in roots under WL (WG) vs. roots under BL (BG), WG vs. roots under RL (RG), and RG vs. BG, respectively. In addition, the contents of sinapyl alcohol, sinapic acid, fraxetin, and 6-methylcoumarin decreased significantly in BG and RG. In contrast, chlorogenic acid, rosmarinyl glucoside, quercitrin and quercetin were increased considerably in BG. Furthermore, the contents of eight terpenoids compounds significantly reduced in BG. Following transcriptomic profiling, several key genes related to biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid-derived and terpenoids metabolites were differentially expressed, such as caffeic acid 3-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase) (<i>COMT</i>), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (<i>HCT</i>), O-methyltransferase (<i>OMT</i>), and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthetase (<i>DXS</i>). In summary, our findings showed that BL was suitable for growth and accumulation of bioactive metabolites in root tissue of <i>S. glabra</i>. Exposure to a higher ratio of BL might have the potential to improve the production and quality of <i>S. glabra</i> seedlings, but this needs to be confirmed further.
