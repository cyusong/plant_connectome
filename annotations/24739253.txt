['24739253', 'Arabinogalactan proteins are abundant cell-surface proteoglycans in plants and  are involved in many cellular processes including somatic embryogenesis,  cell-cell interactions, and cell elongation. We reported a  glucuronosyltransferase encoded by Arabidopsis AtGlcAT14A, which catalyzes an  addition of glucuronic acid residues to beta-1,3- and beta-1,6-linked galactans of  arabinogalactan (Knoch et al. 2013). The knockout mutant of this gene resulted in  the enhanced growth rate of hypocotyls and roots of seedlings, suggesting an  involvement of AtGlcAT14A in cell elongation. AtGlcAt14A belongs to the family  GT14 in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme database (CAZy; www.cazy.org), in which a  total of 11 proteins, including AtGLCAT14A, are classified from Arabidopsis  thaliana. In this paper, we report the enzyme activities for the rest of the  Arabidopsis GT14 isoforms, analyzed in the same way as for AtGlcAT14A. Evidently,  two other Arabidopsis GT14 isoforms, At5g15050 and At2g37585, also possess the  glucuronosyltransferase activity adding glucuronic acid residues to beta-1,3- and  beta-1,6-linked galactans. Therefore, we named At5g15050 and At2g37585 as AtGlcAT14B  and AtGlcAT14C, respectively.', '2014', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.28891', 'Geshi']
