Guard cells shrink in response to drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, thereby reducing stomatal aperture. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an important signaling molecule acting to induce stomatal closure. As yet, the molecular basis of control over the level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the guard cells remains largely unknown. Here, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-receptor-like kinase (RLK) protein HSL3 has been shown to have the ability to negatively regulate stomatal closure by modulating the level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the guard cells. <i>HSL3</i> was markedly up-regulated by treating plants with either ABA or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as well as by dehydration. In the loss-of-function <i>hsl3</i> mutant, both stomatal closure and the activation of anion currents proved to be hypersensitive to ABA treatment, and the mutant was more tolerant than the wild type to moisture deficit; the overexpression of <i>HSL3</i> had the opposite effect. In the <i>hsl3</i> mutant, the transcription of NADPH oxidase gene <i>RbohF</i> involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production showed marked up-regulation, as well as the level of catalase activity was weakly inducible by ABA, allowing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to accumulate in the guard cells. HSL3 was concluded to participate in the regulation of the response to moisture deficit through ABA-induced stomatal closure triggered by the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the guard cells.
