Apetala2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) family of transcription factors plays important roles in plant development and stress responses. However, few members of this family have been functionally and mechanistically characterised in maize. In this study, we characterised a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, ZmEREBP60 from maize. Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that ZmEREBP60 belongs to cluster I of the AP2/ERF family. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that ZmEREBP60 expression was highly induced by drought in the roots, coleoptiles, and leaves. Subcellular localisation analysis revealed that ZmEREBP60 was localised in the nucleus. Moreover, overexpression of ZmEREBP60 enhanced tolerance to drought stress while alleviating the drought-induced increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and malondialdehyde content in transgenic lines. Transcriptome analysis showed that ZmEREBP60 regulates the expression of genes involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> catabolism, water deprivation response, and abscisic acid signalling pathway. Collectively, as a new member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family in maize, ZmEREBP60 is a positive regulator of plant drought response.
