Double-flower <i>Eriobotrya japonica</i>, of which one phenotype is homeotic transformation of sepals into petals, is a new germplasm for revealing the molecular mechanisms underlying the floral organ transformation. Herein, we analyzed the sequence, expression pattern and functional characterization of <i>EjPI</i>, which encoded a B-class floral homeotic protein referred to as <i>PISTILLATA</i> ortholog, from genetically cognate single-flower and double-flower <i>E. japonica</i>. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the <i>EjPI</i> gene was assigned to the rosids PI/GLO lineage. Analysis of protein sequence alignments showed that EjPI has typical domains of M, I, K, and C, and includes a distinctive PI motif at the C-terminal region. Compared with asterids PI/GLO lineage, the K1 and K3 subdomains of EjPI both contain a single amino acid difference. Subcellular localization of EjPI was determined to be in the nucleus. Expression pattern analysis revealed that <i>EjPI</i> expressed not only in petals, filament, and anther in single-flower <i>E. japonica</i>, but also in petaloid sepals in double-flower <i>E. japonica</i>. Meanwhile, there were high correlation between <i>EjPI</i> transcript level and petaloid area within a sepal. Furthermore, 35S::<i>EjPI</i> transgenic wild-type Arabidopsis caused the homeotic transformation of the first whorl sepals into petaloid sepals. Ectopic expression of <i>EjPI</i> in transgenic <i>pi-1</i> mutant Arabidopsis rescued normal petals and stamens. These results suggest expression pattern of <i>EjPI</i> is associated with the formation of petaloid sepal. Our study provides the potential application of <i>EjPI</i> for biotechnical engineering to create petaloid sepals or regulate floral organ identity in angiosperms.
