Mature indeterminate Medicago truncatula nodules are zonated with an apical meristem, an infection zone, a fixation zone with nitrogen-fixing bacteroids, and a "developmental" senescence zone that follows nodule growth with a conical front originating in the center of the fixation zone. In nitrogen-fixing cells, senescence is initiated coincidently with the expression of a family of conserved cysteine proteases that might be involved in the degradation of symbiotic structures. Environmental stress, such as prolonged dark treatment, interferes with nodule functioning and triggers a fast and global nodule senescence. Developmental and dark stress-induced senescence have several different structural and expression features, suggesting at least partly divergent underlying molecular mechanisms.

cysteine proteases: !initiate! senescence 
environmental stress: !interferes with! nodule functioning 
environmental stress: !triggers! global nodule senescence
