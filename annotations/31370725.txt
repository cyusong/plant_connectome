Nitric oxide (NO) as an important secondary messager plays crucial roles in modulating stomatal movement, especially abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. Accumulating evidence indicates that NO positively and negatively regulates guard cell ABA signaling. NO is also implicated in stomatal closure mediated by hydrogen sulfide, small peptides, polyamines, and methyl jasmonate. In this review, we summarize recent advances on the roles and the underlying mechanisms of NO in regulating stomatal closure in plants.

NO: !positively regulates! ABA signaling
NO: !negatively regulates! ABA signaling
NO: !mediates! stomatal closure
NO: !modulates! stomatal movement
Hydrogen sulfide: !mediates! stomatal closure
Small peptides: !mediate! stomatal closure
Polyamines: !mediate! stomatal closure
Methyl jasmonate: !mediates! stomatal closure
