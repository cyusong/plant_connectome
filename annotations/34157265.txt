Plant immunity has long been divided into two 'tiers', involving cell-surface versus intracellular immune receptors. Although both systems can induce similar diagnostic responses, they have been considered independent pathways. Recent work challenges this view, showing a striking requirement for both recognition layers to achieve maximum immune output.

Cell-surface receptor: !induces! Diagnostic response
Intracellular receptor: !induces! Diagnostic response
Cell-surface receptor: !requires! Intracellular receptor
Intracellular receptor: !requires! Cell-surface receptor
Both receptors: !achieve! Maximum immune output
