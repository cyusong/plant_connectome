The production of two functional sperm cells within each male gametophyte is essential for double fertilization in flowering plants and involves a single mitotic division of the male germ cell and cell specification to produce functional gametes. Several proteins that are important regulators of male germ cell division have been identified as well as the R2R3 MYB protein DUO1 that has a dual role in cell division and cell specification. We recently identified a novel regulatory protein DUO3, that has overlapping roles with DUO1 in cell division and specification and shows similarity to GON4 related cell lineage regulators in animals. DUO3 also has important roles outside the germline and is required for embryo patterning and meristem function. We outline the regulatory roles of DUO3 in male germline development and its possible mechanisms of action as a lineage regulator in current models that link germ cell cycle control and gamete specification.
