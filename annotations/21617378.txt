It is known that wounding systemically activates the expression of various defense-related genes in plants. However, most studies of wound-induced systemic response are concerned with a leaf-to-leaf response. We have recently reported that the long distance signaling was also observed in the shoots of Arabidopsis seedling with wounded roots. We identified early and late root-to-shoot responsive (RtS) genes that were upregulated in the shoots of root-wounded seedlings at 30 min and 6 h post-injury, respectively. It is likely that the primary signals were rapidly transfered from injured roots to shoots, and then these signals were converted into chemical signals. In fact, increase of JA and OPDA content activated the expression of early and late RtS genes in shoots, respectively. In addition, we visualized wound-induced root-to-shoot response by using RtS promoter-luciferase (Luc) transgenic plants. Analysis of the AtERF13 promoter::Luc transgenic plants clearly shows that the wound-induced root-to-shoot signaling was rapidly activated via the vascular systems.
