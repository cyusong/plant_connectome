A novel mapping population consisting of 39 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) was used to locate the putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for cadmium (Cd) concentration in brown rice (Oryza sativa). The mapping population carried a single chromosome segment of 'Kasalath' (indica) in each line overlapping with neighbouring segments in a 'Koshihikari' (japonica) genetic background. The parents and CSSLs were grown in pots filled with Cd-polluted soil until grain filling. The brown rice of three of the 39 CSSLs had significantly lower Cd concentrations than that of Koshihikari, and the brown rice of a further three had significantly higher concentrations. On the basis of graphical genotypes of CSSLs, putative QTLs controlling the Cd concentration in brown rice were detected on chromosomes 3, 6 and 8. Each of the CSSLs was nearly isogenic to Koshihikari, which is the most popular rice cultivar in Japan: they carried > 90% of the Koshihikari genetic background. Therefore, the development of a new Koshihikari with less Cd concentration in brown rice would be feasible in the near future.
