Woody oil plants are the most productive oil-bearing species that produce seeds with high levels of valuable triacylglycerols (TAGs). TAGs and their derivatives are the raw materials for many macromolecular bio-based products, such as nylon precursors, and biomass-based diesel. Here, we identified 280 genes encoding seven distinct classes of enzymes (i.e., G3PAT, LPAAT, PAP, DGAT, PDCT, PDAT, and CPT) involved in TAGs-biosynthesis. Several multigene families are expanded by large-scale duplication events, such as <i>G3PATs</i>, and <i>PAPs</i>. RNA-seq was used to survey the expression profiles of these TAG pathway-related genes in different tissues or development, indicating functional redundancy for some duplicated genes originated from the large-scale duplication events, and neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization for some of them. Sixty-two genes showed strong, preferential expression during the period of rapid seed lipid synthesis, suggesting that their might represented the core TAG-toolbox. We also revealed for the first time that there is no PDCT pathway in <i>Vernicia fordii</i> and <i>Xanthoceras sorbifolium</i>. The identification of key genes involved in lipid biosynthesis will be the foundation to plan strategies to develop woody oil plant varieties with enhanced processing properties and high oil content.
