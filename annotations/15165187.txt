['15165187', 'Rad17 is involved in DNA checkpoint control in yeast and human cells. A homologue  of this gene as well as other genes of the pathway (the 9-1-1 complex) are  present in Arabidopsis and share conserved sequence domains with their yeast and  human counterparts. DNA-damaging agents induce AtRAD17 transcriptionally. AtRAD17  mutants show increased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging chemicals bleomycin and  mitomycin C (MMC), which can be reversed by complementation, suggesting that the  loss of function of Rad17 disturbs DNA repair in plant cells. Our results are  further confirmed by the phenotype of a mutant of the 9-1-1 complex (Rad9), which  is also sensitive to the same chemicals. AtRAD9 and AtRAD17 seem to be epistatic  as the double mutant is not more sensitive to the chemicals than the single  mutants. The mutants show a delay in the general repair of double-strand breaks  (DSBs). However, frequencies of intrachromosomal homologous recombination (HR)  are enhanced. Nevertheless, the mutants are proficient for a further induction of  HR by genotoxic stresses. Our results indicate that a mutant Rad17 pathway is  associated with a general deregulation of DNA repair, which seems to be  correlated with a deficiency in non-homologous DSB repair.', '2004 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02097.x', 'Puchta']
