The DsbA/DsbB oxidation pathway is one of the two pathways that catalyze disulfide bond formation of proteins in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria. It has been demonstrated that DsbA is essential for multiple virulence factors of several animal bacterial pathogens. In this article, we present genetic evidence to show that the open reading frame XC_3314 encodes a DsbB protein that is involved in disulfide bond formation in periplasm of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, the causative agent of crucifer black rot disease. The dsbB mutant of X. campestris pv. campestris exhibited attenuation in virulence, hypersensitive response, cell motility, and bacterial growth in planta. Furthermore, mutation in the dsbB gene resulted in ineffective type II and type III secretion systems as well as flagellar assembly. These findings reveal that DsbB is required for the pathogenesis process of X. campestris pv. campestris.
