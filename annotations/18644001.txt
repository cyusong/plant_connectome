['18644001', 'Successful male reproductive function in plants is dependent on the correct  development and functioning of stamens and pollen. AGP6 and AGP11 are two  homologous Arabidopsis genes encoding cell wall-associated arabinogalactan  glycoproteins (AGPs). Both genes were found to be specifically expressed in  stamens, pollen grains and pollen tubes, suggesting that these genes may play a  role in male organ development and function. RNAi lines with reduced AGP6 and  AGP11 expression were generated. These, together with lines harboring point  mutations in the coding region of AGP6, were used to show that loss of function  in AGP6 and AGP11 led to reduced fertility, at least partly as a result of  inhibition of pollen tube growth. Our results also suggest that AGP6 and AGP11  play an additional role in the release of pollen grains from the mature anther.  Thus, our study demonstrates the involvement of specific AGPs in pollen tube  growth and stamen function.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03607.x', 'Zik']
