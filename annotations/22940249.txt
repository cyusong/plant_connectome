['22940249', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, the putative RNA-helicase SDE3 assists  posttranscriptional-gene-silencing (PTGS) amplification by  RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase-6 (RDR6). SDE3 homologs in Drosophila, worm and  human contribute to silence viruses, transposons or recently duplicated genes but  the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SDE3  is present with the PTGS effectors AGO1 and AGO2 in higher-order protein  complexes owing to a specialized GW-repeat-containing C-terminal domain. We  uncover an essential contribution of the RNA-helicase activity and a facilitating  role for AGO binding in SDE3 action, which occurs downstream of RDR6. We show  that these biochemical properties underpin dual roles for SDE3 in antiviral  defense and, unexpectedly, in transposon silencing via a hitherto unanticipated  pathway that correlates with DNA methylation, suggesting a continuum of action  between PTGS and chromatin-level silencing. We identified endogenous SDE3 targets  corresponding to nonconserved intergenic regions, transposons and recently  evolved pseudogenes, unraveling striking functional convergences among plant and  metazoan SDE3 pathways.', '2012 Oct 12', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2012.07.028', 'Voinnet']
