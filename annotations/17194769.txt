['17194769', 'Tocopherols (vitamin E) are lipophilic antioxidants that are synthesized by all  plants and are particularly abundant in seeds. Two tocopherol-deficient mutant  loci in Arabidopsis thaliana were used to examine the functions of tocopherols in  seedlings: vitamin e1 (vte1), which accumulates the pathway intermediate  2,3-dimethyl-5-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMPBQ); and vte2, which lacks all  tocopherols and pathway intermediates. Only vte2 displayed severe seedling growth  defects, which corresponded with massively increased levels of the major classes  of nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation products: hydroxy fatty acids,  malondialdehyde, and phytoprostanes. In the absence of pathogens, the phytoalexin  camalexin accumulated in vte2 seedlings to levels 100-fold higher than in  wild-type or vte1 seedlings. Similarly, gene expression profiling in wild-type,  vte1, and vte2 seedlings indicated that increased levels of nonenzymatic lipid  peroxidation in vte2 corresponded to increased expression of many defense-related  genes, which were not induced in vte1. Both biochemical and transcriptional  analyses of vte2 seedlings indicate that nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation plays a  significant role in modulating plant defense responses. Together, these results  establish that tocopherols in wild-type plants or DMPBQ in vte1 plants limit  nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation during germination and early seedling  development, thereby preventing the inappropriate activation of transcriptional  and biochemical defense responses.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.044065', 'DellaPenna']
