Globally, flooding is a major threat causing substantial yield decline of cereal crops, and is expected to be even more serious in many parts of the world due to climatic anomaly in the future. Understanding the mechanisms of plants coping with unanticipated flooding will be crucial for developing new flooding-tolerance crop varieties. Here we describe survival strategies of plants adaptation to flooding stress at the morphological, physiological and anatomical scale systemically, such as the formation of adventitious roots (ARs), aerenchyma and radial O<sub>2</sub> loss (ROL) barriers. Then molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive strategies are summarized, and more than thirty identified functional genes or proteins associated with flooding-tolerance are searched out and expounded. Moreover, we elaborated the regulatory roles of phytohormones in plant against flooding stress, especially ethylene and its relevant transcription factors from the group VII Ethylene Response Factor (ERF-VII) family. ERF-VIIs of main crops and several reported ERF-VIIs involving plant tolerance to flooding stress were collected and analyzed according to sequence similarity, which can provide references for screening flooding-tolerant genes more precisely. Finally, the potential research directions in the future were summarized and discussed. Through this review, we aim to provide references for the studies of plant acclimation to flooding stress and breeding new flooding-resistant crops in the future.
