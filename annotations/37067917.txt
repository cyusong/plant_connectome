Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism that generates multiple transcripts of the same gene precursor by the spliceosome complex, promoting messenger RNA complexity and proteome diversity. Although AS is extensively studied in response to environmental stresses, whether it mediates age-dependent development and how it is adjusted by growth transitions are largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively explored the AS landscape at different development stages in the grass model plant Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon). We identified abundant coding genes and non-coding transcripts subject to dynamic AS regulation during juvenile, adult, and reproductive transitions. Moreover, we revealed that SC35-LIKE SPLICING FACTOR 33 (SCL33), a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor in spliceosomes, plays a redundant and antagonistic role with its putative paralog, SCL33L, in regulating intron assembly across distinct developmental stages. In addition, we determined global AS variations in microRNA156 (miR156)-overproducing plants, in which growth transitions are delayed, and found that SPLs were regulated by miR156 in intron retention alteration in addition to mRNA clearance and translation inhibition manners. Finally, we demonstrated a complex regulatory process of age-dependent AS events in B. distachyon that were coincidently or separately regulated by miR156 and SCL33/SCL33L. These results illustrate a substantial -machinery of AS that mediates phase transitions in plants.
