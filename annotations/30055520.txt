The well-known neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) not only regulates sleep and mood in humans and animals but may also play important roles in modulating growth, development, and defense responses, such as seed germination, flowering, and abiotic stress tolerance, in plants. Serotonin inhibits primary root (PR) growth; however, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying serotonin-mediated PR growth inhibition remain largely unclear. Here, we investigate the effects of serotonin on root growth and development in Arabidopsis. Serotonin inhibits PR elongation by affecting both the meristem and elongation zones. In the meristem zone, serotonin represses both meristem cell division potential and stem cell niche activity. Serotonin induces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> overaccumulation in the elongation zone and reduces O<sub>2</sub>- accumulation in the meristem zone by a UPB1 pathway, thereby disrupting reactive oxygen species (ROS) equilibrium in root tips, thus resulting in PR growth inhibition. Serotonin also regulates auxin distribution in root tips by decreasing auxin-related gene expression and repressing auxin transport through modulation of AUX1 and PIN2 abundances in root tips. Taken together, our data indicate that high concentrations of serotonin result in stress responses in plants by inhibiting PR elongation through the regulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>- distribution in PR tips and through an auxin pathway via the repression of auxin biosynthesis and transport.
