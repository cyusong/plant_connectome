['27920157', 'Cell signaling pathways mediated by leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases  (LRR-RLKs) are essential for plant growth, development, and defense. The EMS1  (EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1) LRR-RLK and its small protein ligand TPD1 (TAPETUM  DETERMINANT1) play a fundamental role in somatic and reproductive cell  differentiation during early anther development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). However, it is unclear whether other cell surface molecules serve as  coregulators of EMS1. Here, we show that SERK1 (SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS  RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1) and SERK2 LRR-RLKs act redundantly as coregulatory and  physical partners of EMS1. The SERK1/2 genes function in the same genetic pathway  as EMS1 in anther development. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation, Forster  resonance energy transfer, and coimmunoprecipitation approaches revealed that  SERK1 interacted biochemically with EMS1. Transphosphorylation of EMS1 by SERK1  enhances EMS1 kinase activity. Among 12 in vitro autophosphorylation and  transphosphorylation sites identified by tandem mass spectrometry, seven of them  were found to be critical for EMS1 autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore,  complementation test results suggest that phosphorylation of EMS1 is required for  its function in anther development. Collectively, these data provide genetic and  biochemical evidence of the interaction and phosphorylation between SERK1/2 and  EMS1 in anther development.', '2017 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.01219', 'ORCID:']
