Plant breeding has been proposed as one of the most effective and environmentally safe methods to control fungal infection and to reduce fumonisin accumulation. However, conventional breeding can be hampered by the complex genetic architecture of resistance to fumonisin accumulation and marker-assisted selection is proposed as an efficient alternative. In the current study, GWAS has been performed for the first time for detecting high-resolution QTL for resistance to fumonisin accumulation in maize kernels complementing published GWAS results for Fusarium ear rot. Thirty-nine SNPs significantly associated with resistance to fumonisin accumulation in maize kernels were found and clustered into 17 QTL. Novel QTLs for fumonisin content would be at bins 3.02, 5.02, 7.05 and 8.07. Genes with annotated functions probably implicated in resistance to pathogens based on previous studies have been highlighted. Breeding approaches to fix favorable functional variants for genes implicated in maize immune response signaling may be especially useful to reduce kernel contamination with fumonisins without significantly interfering in mycelia development and growth and, consequently, in the beneficial endophytic behavior of Fusarium verticillioides.
