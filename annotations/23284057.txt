['23284057', 'PREMISE: Gravity is an important environmental factor that affects growth and  development of plants. In response to changes in gravity, directional growth  occurs along the major axes and lateral branches of both shoots and roots. The  gravity persistent signal (gps) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana were previously  identified as having an altered response to gravity when reoriented relative to  the gravity vector in the cold, with the gps1 mutant exhibiting a complete loss  of tropic response under these conditions. METHODS: Thermal asymmetric interlaced  (TAIL) PCR was used to identify the gene defective in gps1. Gene expression data,  molecular modeling and computational substrate dockings, quantitative RT-PCR  analyses, reporter gene fusions, and physiological analyses of knockout mutants  were used to characterize the genes identified. RESULTS: Cloning of the gene  defective in gps1 and genetic complementation revealed that GPS1 encodes  CYP705A22, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450). CYP705A5, a closely related  family member, was identified as expressed specifically in roots in response to  gravistimulation, and a mutation affecting its expression resulted in a delayed  gravity response, increased flavonol levels, and decreased basipetal auxin  transport. Molecular modeling coupled with in silico substrate docking and  diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester (DBPA) staining indicated that these P450s  are involved in biosynthesis of flavonoids potentially involved in auxin  transport. CONCLUSION: The characterization of two novel P450s (CYP705A22 and  CYP705A5) and their role in the gravity response has offered new insights into  the regulation of the genetic and physiological controls of plant gravitropism.', '2013 Jan', 'Am J Bot', '10.3732/ajb.1200436', 'Wyatt']
