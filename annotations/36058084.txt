Non-timber forest plants have always played a significant role in livelihood security by providing valuable non-timber forest products, especially in less-developed countries. Artificial cultivation is a key approach to sustainably develop non-timber forest plants, for which, in-forest planting is vital. Light conditions in forests severely affect in-forest planting, and the growth of many plants may be restricted due to inappropriate light conditions. Thus, to fully and effectively utilize forest spaces with various light environments, fertilization, as an important practice to supply nutrients for promoting plant growth, was selected to mitigate light constraints in forests. Aralia elata (a valuable non-timber forest plant species) was chosen as the subject to explore the effects of fertilization on photosynthetic and morphological adaptation to light and the growth of in-forest planted seedlings by simulating different light environments. The results showed that the effects of fertilization on light adaptability (i.e., photosynthesis and leaf traits) of A. elata seedlings were limited; that is, only the variations in light-saturated photosynthetic net rate (P<sub>Nmax</sub>), specific leaf area (SLA), and chlorophyll (Chl) content of A. elata seedlings between different shade intensities were noticeably affected by fertilization. Fertilization was positive for growth, and a half fertilization treatment (50 g per plot) was optimum for improving the growth of A. elata seedlings under light conditions of 0-75% shade intensities. These results can provide some practical references for the application of fertilization in in-forest planting and management of transplanted non-timber forest plant seedlings under various light conditions in the forests.
