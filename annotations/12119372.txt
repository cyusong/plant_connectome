['12119372', 'Wild-type stomata are distributed nonrandomly, and their density is controlled by  endogenous and exogenous factors. In the Arabidopsis mutant stomatal density and  distribution1-1 (sdd1-1), the establishment of the stomatal pattern is disrupted,  resulting in stomata clustering and twofold to fourfold increases in stomatal  density. The SDD1 gene that encodes a subtilisin-like Ser protease is expressed  strongly in stomatal precursor cells (meristemoids and guard mother cells), and  the SDD1 promoter is controlled negatively by a feedback mechanism. The encoded  protein is exported to the apoplast and probably is associated with the plasma  membrane. SDD1 overexpression in the wild type leads to a phenotype opposite to  that caused by the sdd1-1 mutation, with a twofold to threefold decrease in  stomatal density and the formation of arrested stomata. While SDD1 overexpression  was effective in the flp mutant, the tmm mutation acted epistatically. Thus, we  propose that SDD1 generates an extracellular signal by meristemoids/guard mother  cells and demonstrate that the function of SDD1 is dependent on TMM activity.', '2002 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.001016', 'Altmann']
