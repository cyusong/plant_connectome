Genetic mapping provides a powerful tool for the analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) at the genomic level. Herein, we report a new genetic linkage map developed from an F(1)-derived doubled haploid (DH) population of 168 lines, which was generated from the cross between two elite Chinese common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties, Huapei 3 and Yumai 57. The map contained 305 loci, represented by 283 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 22 expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR markers, which covered a total length of 2141.7 cM with an average distance of 7.02 cM between adjacent markers on the map. The chromosomal locations and map positions of 22 new SSR markers were determined, and were found to distribute on 14 linkage groups. Twenty SSR loci showed different chromosomal locations from those reported in other maps. Therefore, this map offers new information on the SSR markers of wheat. This genetic map provides new opportunities to detect and map QTLs controlling agronomically important traits. The unique features of this map are discussed.
