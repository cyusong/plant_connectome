Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids, are responsible for the orange to blue coloration of flowers and act as visual attractors to aid pollination and seed dispersal. Malonyl-CoA is the precursor for the formation of flavonoids and anthocyanins. Previous studies have suggested that malonyl-CoA is formed almost exclusively by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA and bicarbonate. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of Petunia hybrida acyl-activating enzyme 13 (PhAAE13), a member of clade VII of the AAE superfamily that encodes malonyl-CoA synthetase, was isolated. The expression of PhAAE13 was highest in corollas and was down-regulated by ethylene. Virus-induced gene silencing of petunia PhAAE13 significantly reduced anthocyanin accumulation, fatty acid content, and cuticular wax components content, and increased malonic acid content in flowers. The silencing of PhAAE3 and PhAAE14, the other two genes in clade VII of the AAE superfamily, did not change the anthocyanin content in petunia flowers. This study provides strong evidence indicating that PhAAE13, among clade VII of the AAE superfamily, is specifically involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in petunia flowers.
