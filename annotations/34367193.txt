Aminoacylase-1 is a zinc-binding enzyme that is important in urea cycling, ammonia scavenging, and oxidative stress responses in animals. Aminoacylase-1 (<i>ACY-1</i>) has been reported to play a role in resistance to pathogen infection in the model plant <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. However, little is known about its function in plant growth and abiotic stress responses. In this study, we cloned and analyzed expression patterns of <i>ZmACY-1</i> in <i>Zea mays</i> under different conditions. We also functionally characterized <i>ZmACY-1</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i>. We found that <i>ZmACY-1</i> is expressed specifically in mature shoots compared with other tissues. <i>ZmACY-1</i> is repressed by salt, drought, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid, but is induced by abscisic acid and ethylene, indicating a potential role in stress responses and plant growth. The overexpression of <i>ZmACY-1</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> promoted growth rate by promoting growth-related genes, such as <i>NbEXPA1</i> and <i>NbEIN2</i>. At the same time, the overexpression of <i>ZmACY-1</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> reduced tolerance to drought and salt stress. With drought and salt stress, the activity of protective enzymes, such as peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) from micrococcus lysodeikticus was lower; while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and relative electrolytic leakage was higher in <i>ZmACY-1</i> overexpression lines than that in wild-type lines. The results indicate that <i>ZmACY-1</i> plays an important role in the balance of plant growth and defense and can be used to assist plant breeding under abiotic stress conditions.
