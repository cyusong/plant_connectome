['34778961', 'Dolichols (Dols), ubiquitous components of living organisms, are indispensable  for cell survival. In plants, as well as other eukaryotes, Dols are crucial for  post-translational protein glycosylation, aberration of which leads to fatal  metabolic disorders in humans and male sterility in plants. Until now, the  mechanisms underlying Dol accumulation remain elusive. In this study, we have  analysed the natural variation of the accumulation of Dols and six other  isoprenoids among more than 120 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Subsequently, by  combining QTL and GWAS approaches, we have identified several candidate genes  involved in the accumulation of Dols, polyprenols, plastoquinone and  phytosterols. The role of two genes implicated in the accumulation of major Dols  in Arabidopsis-the AT2G17570 gene encoding a long searched for  cis-prenyltransferase (CPT3) and the AT1G52460 gene encoding an alpha/beta-hydrolase-is  experimentally confirmed. These data will help to generate Dol-enriched plants  which might serve as a remedy for Dol-deficiency in humans.', '2022 Feb', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.14223', 'ORCID:']
