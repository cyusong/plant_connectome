Shoot branches are formed from the axillary meristem and their formation is a key process in plant development. Although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is progressing, our knowledge of these mechanisms during the process of axillary meristem development is insufficient. To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying axillary meristem development in rice (Oryza sativa), we undertook a molecular genetic analysis focusing on TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), respective orthologs of the WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 genes involved in SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We revealed that stem cells were established at an early stage of axillary meristem development in the wild-type, but were not maintained in tab1. By contrast, the stem cell region and TAB1 expression domain were expanded in fon2, and FON2 overexpression inhibited axillary meristem formation. These results indicate that TAB1 is required to maintain stem cells during axillary meristem development, whereas FON2 negatively regulates stem cell fate by restricting TAB1 expression. Thus, the genetic pathway regulating SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis seems to have been recruited to play a specific role within a narrow developmental window - namely, axillary meristem establishment - in rice.

TAB1: !maintains! stem cells
FON2: !restricts! TAB1 expression
TAB1: !required for! axillary meristem development
FON2: !negatively regulates! stem cell fate
