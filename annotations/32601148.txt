Mg<sup>2+</sup> is among the most abundant divalent cations in living cells. In plants, investigations on magnesium (Mg) homeostasis are restricted to the functional characterization of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters. Here, we demonstrate that the splicing factors <i>SUPPRESSORS OF MEC-8 AND UNC-52 1</i> (<i>SMU1</i>) and <i>SMU2</i> mediate Mg homeostasis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A low-Mg sensitive Arabidopsis mutant was isolated, and the causal gene was identified as <i>SMU1</i> Disruption of SMU2, a protein that can form a complex with SMU1, resulted in a similar low-Mg sensitive phenotype. In both mutants, an Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter gene, <i>Mitochondrial RNA Splicing 2</i> (<i>MRS2-7</i>), showed altered splicing patterns. Genetic evidence indicated that <i>MRS2-7</i> functions in the same pathway as <i>SMU1</i> and <i>SMU2</i> for low-Mg adaptation. In contrast with previous results showing that the SMU1-SMU2 complex is the active form in RNA splicing, <i>MRS2-7</i> splicing was promoted in the <i>smu2</i> mutant overexpressing <i>SMU1</i>, indicating that complex formation is not a prerequisite for the splicing. We found here that formation of the SMU1-SMU2 complex is an essential step for their compartmentation in the nuclear speckles, a type of nuclear body enriched with proteins that participate in various aspects of RNA metabolism. Taken together, our study reveals the involvement of the SMU splicing factors in plant Mg homeostasis and provides evidence that complex formation is required for their intranuclear compartmentation.
