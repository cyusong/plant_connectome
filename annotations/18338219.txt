['18338219', 'Mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATPase is a key enzyme in plant metabolism, providing  cells with ATP that uses the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient to  drive synthesis of ATP. A 6 kDa protein (At3g46430) has been previously purified  from Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATPase. In this study, the gene  (AtMtATP6; GenBank accession no. AK117680) encoding this protein was isolated  from Arabidopsis and characterized. Northern blot analyses showed that the  expression of AtMtATP6 gene in Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells was induced  by several abiotic stresses from salts, drought, and cold. Over-expression of  AtMtATP6 gene in transgenic yeast and Arabidopsis plants increased the resistance  to salts, drought, oxidative and cold stresses. Taken together, our data raise  the possibility that induction of the F(1)F(0)-ATPase plays a role in stress  tolerance.', '2008 Jul', 'Biotechnol Lett', '10.1007/s10529-008-9685-6', 'Takano']
