Clubroot, caused by the soil-borne protist <i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i>, is one of the most destructive diseases of Chinese cabbage worldwide. However, the clubroot resistance mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, in both clubroot-resistant (DH40R) and clubroot-susceptible (DH199S) Chinese cabbage lines, the primary (root hair infection) and secondary (cortical infection) infection stages started 2 and 5 days after inoculation (dai), respectively. With the extension of the infection time, cortical infection was blocked and complete <i>P. brassica</i> resistance was observed in DH40R, while disease scales of 1, 2, and 3 were observed at 8, 13, and 22 dai in DH199S. Transcriptome analysis at 0, 2, 5, 8, 13, and 22 dai identified 5,750 relative DEGs (rDEGs) between DH40R and DH199S. The results indicated that genes associated with auxin, PR, disease resistance proteins, oxidative stress, and <i>WRKY</i> and <i>MYB</i> transcription factors were involved in clubroot resistance regulation. In addition, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified three of the modules whose functions were highly associated with clubroot-resistant, including ten hub genes related to clubroot resistance (<i>ARF2</i>, <i>EDR1</i>, <i>LOX4</i>, <i>NHL3</i>, <i>NHL13</i>, <i>NAC29</i>, two <i>AOP1</i>, <i>EARLI 1</i>, and <i>POD56</i>). These results provide valuable information for better understanding the molecular regulatory mechanism of Chinese cabbage clubroot resistance.
