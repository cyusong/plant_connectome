['35972413', 'Chemical defense systems involving tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites  (TDSMs) and salicylic acid (SA) are induced by general nonself signals and  pathogen signals, respectively, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Whether and how these  chemical defense systems are connected and balanced is largely unknown. In this  study, we identified the AVRRPT2-INDUCED GENE2A (AIG2A) and AIG2B genes as  gatekeepers that prevent activation of SA defense systems by TDSMs. These genes  also were identified as important contributors to natural variation in disease  resistance among A. thaliana natural accessions. The loss of AIG2A and AIG2B  function leads to upregulation of both SA and TDSM defense systems. Suppressor  screens and genetic analysis revealed that a functional TDSM system is required  for the upregulation of the SA pathway in the absence of AIG2A and AIG2B, but not  vice versa. Furthermore, the AIG2A and AIG2B genes are co-induced with TDSM  biosynthesis genes by general pathogen elicitors and nonself signals, thereby  functioning as a feedback control of the TDSM defense system, as well as limiting  activation of the SA defense system by TDSMs. Thus, this study uncovers an AIG2A-  and AIG2B-mediated mechanism that fine-tunes and balances SA and TDSM chemical  defense systems in response to nonpathogenic and pathogenic microbes.', '2022 Oct 27', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koac255', 'ORCID:']
