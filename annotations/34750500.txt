In mammals and plants, cytosine DNA methylation is essential for the epigenetic repression of transposable elements and foreign DNA. In plants, DNA methylation is guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a self-reinforcing cycle termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). RdDM requires the specialized RNA polymerase V (Pol V), and the key unanswered question is how Pol V is first recruited to new target sites without pre-existing DNA methylation. We find that Pol V follows and is dependent on the recruitment of an AGO4-clade ARGONAUTE protein, and any siRNA can guide the ARGONAUTE protein to the new target locus independent of pre-existing DNA methylation. These findings reject long-standing models of RdDM initiation and instead demonstrate that siRNA-guided ARGONAUTE targeting is necessary, sufficient and first to target Pol V recruitment and trigger the cycle of RdDM at a transcribed target locus, thereby establishing epigenetic silencing.

siRNA: !guides! ARGONAUTE
ARGONAUTE: !recruits! Pol V
Pol V: !triggers! RdDM
