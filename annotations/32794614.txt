In plants, race-specific defence against microbial pathogens is facilitated by resistance (R) genes which correspond to specific pathogen avirulence genes. This study reports the cloning of a blackleg R gene from Brassica napus (canola), Rlm9, which encodes a wall-associated kinase-like (WAKL) protein, a newly discovered class of race-specific plant RLK resistance genes. Rlm9 provides race-specific resistance against isolates of Leptosphaeria maculans carrying the corresponding avirulence gene AvrLm5-9, representing only the second WAKL-type R gene described to date. The Rlm9 protein is predicted to be cell membrane-bound and while not conclusive, our work did not indicate direct interaction with AvrLm5-9. Rlm9 forms part of a distinct evolutionary family of RLK proteins in B. napus, and while little is yet known about WAKL function, the Brassica-Leptosphaeria pathosystem may prove to be a model system by which the mechanism of fungal avirulence protein recognition by WAKL-type R genes can be determined.
