Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the gold-standard method for detection of interactions between proteins and chromatin and is a powerful tool for identification of epigenetic modifications. Although ChIP protocols for plant species have been developed, many specific features of plants, especially woody plants, still hinder the efficiency of immunoprecipitation, resulting in inefficient ChIP enrichment and an active demand for a highly efficient ChIP protocol. In this study, using birch (<i>Betula platyphylla</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as the research materials, we identified five factors closely associated with ChIP efficiency, including crosslinking, concentration of chromatin using centrifugal filters, use of a different immunoprecipitation buffer, rescue of DNA with proteinase K, and use of Suc to increase immunoprecipitation efficiency. Optimization of any these factors can significantly improve ChIP efficiency. Considering these factors together, we developed a robust ChIP protocol that achieved a 14-fold improvement in ChIP enrichment for birch and a >6-fold improvement for Arabidopsis compared to the standard ChIP method. As this ChIP method works well in both birch and Arabidopsis, it should also be suitable for other woody and herbaceous species. In addition, this ChIP method enables detection of low-abundance transcription factor-DNA interactions and may extend the application of ChIP in the plant kingdom.
