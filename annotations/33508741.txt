Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two of the most important nutrients for plant growth and crop yields. In the last decade, plenty of studies have revealed the genetic factors and their regulatory networks which are involved in N and/or P uptake and utilization in different model plant species, especially in Arabidopsis and rice. However, increasing evidences have shown that epigenetic regulation also plays a vital role in modulating plant responses to nutrient availability. In this review, we make a brief summary of epigenetic regulation including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and other chromatin structure alterations in tuning N and P responses. We also give an outlook for future research directions to comprehensively dissect the involvement of epigenetic regulation in modulating nutrient response in plants.

Nitrogen: !regulates! Phosphorus
Histone modifications: !modulate! N and P responses
DNA methylation: !modulate! N and P responses
Chromatin structure alterations: !modulate! N and P responses
