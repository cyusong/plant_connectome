The plasma membrane (PM) proton pump ATPases (H(+)-ATPases) are involved in almost all aspects of biology. They are plant specific and several members of this family are supposed to play a key role in nutrient acquisition. At present, only some members of this gene family in plants have been characterized. However, no nutrient uptake associated H(+)-ATPase gene in rice has been functionally analysed. It is reported here that OsA8, a typical PM H(+)-ATPases gene that was predominantly expressed in roots of rice, is down-regulated by nutrient deficiency. The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus (P) starvation conditions. Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots. These analyses demonstrate that OsA8 not only influences the uptake of P by roots, but also the translocation of P from the roots to the shoots in rice.
