The cytochrome P450 CYP78A5/KLUH in Arabidopsis thaliana is predicted to be involved in the synthesis of a mobile signal molecule that has a pleiotropic function that is distinct from classical phytohormones. CYP78A5 has five close relatives in Arabidopsis. We first investigated their functions, focusing on the plastochron, leaf size, and leaf senescence. Our analyses revealed that CYP78A5 and CYP78A7 are involved in the plastochron and leaf size, and CYP78A6 and CYP78A9 are involved in leaf senescence. Complementation analyses using heterologous promoters and expression analyses suggested that CYP78A isoforms have a common biochemical function and are functionally differentiated via organ-specific expression. The altered meristem program1 (amp1) carboxypeptidase mutant shows a phenotype very similar to that of the cyp78a5 mutant. Complementation analyses using boundary and organizing center-specific promoters suggested that both CYP78A5 and AMP1 act in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Analyses of multiple cyp78a mutants and crosses between cyp78a and amp1 mutants revealed that AMP1/LIKE AMP1 (LAMP1) and CYP78A isoforms regulate plastochron length and leaf senescence in the same genetic pathway, whereas leaf size is independently regulated. Furthermore, we detected feedback regulation between CYP78A6/CYP78A9 and AMP1 at the gene expression level. These observations raise the possibility that AMP1 and CYP78A isoforms are involved in the synthesis of the same mobile signal molecule, and suggest that AMP1 and CYP78A signaling pathways have a very close, albeit complex, functional relationship.
