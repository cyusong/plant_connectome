['14653999', 'Light is an important environmental cue to plants, and much of their physiology  is influenced by light. The light signals that drive these responses are  perceived by photoreceptors including the red/far-red responsive phytochromes  (phyA-E). In addition to direct effects, light also exerts its influence by  modifying the rhythms generated by the circadian clock. In Arabidopsis thaliana,  the molecular makeup of the interface between the central clock and its  input/output pathways is not fully defined, but a major point of control is  likely to be protein turnover mediated by the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system. To  identify additional constituents of this interface, stable double-stranded RNA  interference (RNAi) was used to reduce mRNA levels of rhythmically expressed  candidate genes encoding putative components of E3 ubiquitin ligases (i.e., F box  and RING finger proteins), followed by screening of the transgenic plants for  circadian and light signaling defects. RNAi lines with diminished expression of  the novel gene ATTENUATED FAR-RED RESPONSE (AFR) display phenotypes consistent  with impaired phyA-mediated light signaling. Furthermore, AFR is a true SCF E3  ubiquitin ligase component. SCF(AFR) is expected to mediate the turnover of a  repressor of phyA signaling, possibly to prepare the plant to receive light  signals at dawn.', '2003 Dec 2', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2003.11.019', 'Kay']
