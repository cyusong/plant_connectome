F-box protein, one of the building blocks of the SCF complex, functions in substrate recognition of the SCF subtype of E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, the role of F-box protein in salt stress is largely elusive in plants. Here, we report the characterization of an Arabidopsis salt-tolerant mutant est1 with significantly reduced sodium content and higher Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter activity after NaCl treatment compared to the wild-type. Over-expression of EST1 resulted in increased sensitivity to salt stress, suggesting that EST1 may act as a negative regulator for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. EST1 encodes an F-box protein, which interacts with ASK4, ASK14, and ASK18, and is likely targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, EST1 interacts with MKK4 and negatively regulates MKK4 protein levels and the activity of the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter. Our findings demonstrate the existence of an EST1-MKK4 module that mediates salt sensitivity by regulating the activity of the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter. These results provide important information for engineering salt-tolerant crops.
