['18182028', 'Meiotic crossovers/chiasmata, that are required to ensure chromosome disjunction,  arise via the class I interference-dependent pathway or via the class II  interference-free pathway. The proportions of these two classes vary considerably  between different organisms. In Arabidopsis, about 85% of chiasmata are  eliminated in Atmsh4 mutants, denoting that these are class I events. In budding  and fission yeasts Msh4-independent crossovers arise largely or entirely via a  Mus81-dependent pathway. To investigate the origins of the 15% residual  (AtMSH4-independent) chiasmata in Arabidopsis we conducted a cytological and  molecular analysis of AtMUS81 meiotic expression and function. Although AtMUS81  functions in somatic DNA repair and recombination, it is more highly expressed in  reproductive tissues. The protein is abundantly present in early prophase I  meiocytes, where it co-localizes, in a double-strand break-dependent manner, with  the recombination protein AtRAD51. Despite this, an Atmus81 mutant shows normal  growth and has no obvious defects in reproductive development that would indicate  meiotic impairment. A cytological analysis confirmed that meiosis was apparently  normal in this mutant and its mean chiasma frequency was similar to that of  wild-type plants. However, an Atmsh4/Atmus81 double mutant revealed a  significantly reduced mean chiasma frequency (0.85 per cell), compared with an  Atmsh4 single mutant (1.25 per cell), from which we conclude that AtMUS81  accounts for some, but not all, of the 15% AtMSH4-independent residual  crossovers. It is possible that other genes are responsible for these residual  chiasmata. Alternatively the AtMUS81 pathway coexists with an alternative  parallel pathway that can perform the same functions.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03403.x', 'Jones']
