The potato root system is often characterized as shallow and inefficient, with poor ability to extract water and minerals from the soil. Potato root system architecture (RSA) refers to its 3-dimensional structure as determined by adventitious root (AR) growth and branching through lateral roots (LR). Understanding how the root system develops holds potential to increase plant yield and optimize agricultural land use. Root system development was monitored in greenhouse-grown potato while a root-on-a-plate assay was developed to explore factors that affect AR and LR development. Expression study of LR-related genes was conducted. Transgenic plants carrying DR5:GFP and CycB1:GUS reporter genes were used to monitor auxin signaling and cell division during root primordia formation, respectively. Maximum root development occurred mainly during the 6-week post seed-tuber planting and slowed during the onset of tuberization. AR and LR development was coordinated - a positive correlation was found between the length of AR and LR and between LR length and number. The expression of LR-related genes was higher in LR than in AR. High nitrate levels reduced LR number and length, however ablation of root-cap by high temperature (33°C) or cutting resulted with enhanced formation of LR. Growth conditions affect AR and LR development in potato, determining the final architecture of its root system. The overall results indicate that LR formation in potato follows similar pattern as in model plants, facilitating study and manipulation of its RSA to improve soil exploitation and yield.
