Abscisic acid receptors (ABR) involve transduction of the ABA signaling in plants, impacting largely on stress-defensive physiological processes and plant osmotic stress response. In this study, we characterized TaPYL4, a gene of ABR family in T. aestivum, in mediating plant drought tolerance given scarcity of functional characterization on wheat ABR members thus far. TaPYL4 harbors nine conserved domains shared by its PYL counterparts, targeting onto plasma membrane and nucleus after endoplasmic reticulum assortment. TaPYL4 interacts with TaPP2C2 whereas the latter with TaSnRK2.1, which establish a core module of the ABA signaling pathway. TaPYL4 expression was upregulated in root and aerial tissues upon drought stress. Overexpressing TaPYL4 conferred plants improved growth traits whereas knockdown expression of target gene alleviated growth feature compared with wild type under drought treatment. The TaPYL4-enhanced drought adaptation associates gene function in positively regulating stomata movement, osmolyte biosynthesis, and root system architecture (RSA) establishment. Expression analysis on the P5CS family genes involving proline biosynthesis indicated that TaP5CS1 exerts critical roles in promoting osmolytes accumulation in drought-challenged TaPYL4 lines. TaPIN9, a PIN-FORMED gene modulating cellular auxin translocation, was validated to function as a crucial mediator in defining RSA establishment underlying TaPYL4 regulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TaPYL4 controls transcription of numerous genes, which impact on physiological processes associated with 'biological process', 'molecular component', and 'cellular process'. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes mediated by TaPYL4 were closely related to stress defensive pathways. Our investigation suggested that TaPYL4 acts as a positive regulator in plant drought tolerance and a valuable target for engineering drought-tolerant cultivars in T. aestivum.
