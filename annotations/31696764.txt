Earlier, we demonstrated that transcript levels of <i>METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN2</i> (<i>MTP2)</i> and of <i>HEAVY METAL ATPase2</i> (<i>HMA2</i>) increase strongly in roots of Arabidopsis upon prolonged zinc (Zn) deficiency and respond to shoot physiological Zn status, and not to the local Zn status in roots. This provided evidence for shoot-to-root communication in the acclimation of plants to Zn deficiency. Zn-deficient soils limit both the yield and quality of agricultural crops and can result in clinically relevant nutritional Zn deficiency in human populations. Implementing Zn deficiency during cultivation of the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> on agar-solidified media is difficult because trace element contaminations are present in almost all commercially available agars. Here, we demonstrate root morphological acclimations to Zn deficiency on agar-solidified medium following the effective removal of contaminants. These advancements allow reproducible phenotyping toward understanding fundamental plant responses to deficiencies of Zn and other essential trace elements.
