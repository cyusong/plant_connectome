Executor (<i>E</i>) genes comprise a new type of plant resistance (<i>R</i>) genes, identified from host-<i>Xanthomonas</i> interactions. The <i>Xanthomonas</i>-secreted transcription activation-like effectors (TALEs) usually function as major virulence factors, which activate the expression of the so-called "susceptibility" (<i>S</i>) genes for disease development. This activation is achieved via the binding of the TALEs to the effector-binding element (EBE) in the <i>S</i> gene promoter. However, host plants have evolved EBEs in the promoters of some otherwise silent <i>R</i> genes, whose expression directly causes a host cell death that is characterized by a hypersensitive response (HR). Such <i>R</i> genes are called <i>E</i> genes because they trap the pathogen TALEs in order to activate expression, and the resulting HR prevents pathogen growth and disease development. Currently, deploying <i>E</i> gene resistance is becoming a major component in disease resistance breeding, especially for rice bacterial blight resistance. Currently, the biochemical mechanisms, or the working pathways of the E proteins, are still fuzzy. There is no significant nucleotide sequence homology among <i>E</i> genes, although E proteins share some structural motifs that are probably associated with the signal transduction in the effector-triggered immunity. Here, we summarize the current knowledge regarding TALE-type avirulence proteins, <i>E</i> gene activation, the E protein structural traits, and the classification of <i>E</i> genes, in order to sharpen our understanding of the plant <i>E</i> genes.
