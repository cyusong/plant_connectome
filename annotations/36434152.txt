Identification of MAPKKK genes in pear and functional characterization of PbrMAPKKK82 in response to pear black spot. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) is located upstream of the MAPK cascade pathway. This region senses extracellular stimuli via the signaling molecule or by themselves and is activated by phosphorylation. In this study, we identified 108 PbrMAPKKK genes from the pear genome. The genes were divided into three subfamilies and contained the conserved domain. Except for chromosome 7, there were 93 PbrMAPKKK genes randomly distributed on 16 out of the 17 chromosomes, while 15 PbrMAPKKK genes were detected on unknown chromosomes. They largely originated from whole-genome duplication (WGD) and dispersed events. In the expression analysis of PbrMAPKKK genes in seven pear tissue types by using a database, 20 PbrMAPKKK genes were selected to verify the expression associated with different resistance in two varieties by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that PbrMAPKKK12, PbrMAPKKK13, PbrMAPKKK53, PbrMAPKKK60, PbrMAPKKK65, PbrMAPKKK82, PbrMAPKKK83, and PbrMAPKKK96 were correlated with black spot resistance. PbrMAPKKK3, PbrMAPKKK9, PbrMAPKKK11, PbrMAPKKK34, PbrMAPKKK80, PbrMAPKKK81, PbrMAPKKK99, and PbrMAPKKK100 were correlated with black spot susceptibility, while the PbrMAPKKK gene positively responded to the life process of pear resistance to black spot. Furthermore, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) indicated that the PbrMAPKKK82 gene enhanced resistance to pear black spot disease.
