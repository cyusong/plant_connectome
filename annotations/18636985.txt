Cold injury is frequently seen in the commercially important shrub Hydrangea macrophylla but not in Hydrangea paniculata. Cold acclimation and deacclimation and associated physiological adaptations were investigated from late September 2006 to early May 2007 in stems of field-grown H. macrophylla ssp. macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser. cv. Blaumeise and H. paniculata Sieb. cv. Kyushu. Acclimation and deacclimation appeared approximately synchronized in the two species, but they differed significantly in levels of mid-winter cold hardiness, rates of acclimation and deacclimation and physiological traits conferring tolerance to freezing conditions. Accumulation patterns of sucrose and raffinose in stems paralleled fluctuations in cold hardiness in both species, but H. macrophylla additionally accumulated glucose and fructose during winter, indicating species-specific differences in carbohydrate metabolism. Protein profiles differed between H. macrophylla and H. paniculata, but distinct seasonal patterns associated with winter acclimation were observed in both species. In H. paniculata concurrent increases in xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations ([ABA](xylem)) and freezing tolerance suggests an involvement of ABA in cold acclimation. In contrast, ABA from the root system was seemingly not involved in cold acclimation in H. macrophylla, suggesting that species-specific differences in cold hardiness may be related to differences in [ABA](xylem). In both species a significant increase in stem freezing tolerance appeared long after growth ceased, suggesting that cold acclimation is more regulated by temperature than by photoperiod.
