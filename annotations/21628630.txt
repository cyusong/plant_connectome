['21628630', 'Phosphorus (P) remobilization in plants is required for continuous growth and  development. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) inorganic phosphate (Pi)  transporter Pht1;5 has been implicated in mobilizing stored Pi out of older  leaves. In this study, we used a reverse genetics approach to study the role of  Pht1;5 in Pi homeostasis. Under low-Pi conditions, Pht1;5 loss of function  (pht1;5-1) resulted in reduced P allocation to shoots and elevated transcript  levels for several Pi starvation-response genes. Under Pi-replete conditions,  pht1;5-1 had higher shoot P content compared with the wild type but had reduced P  content in roots. Constitutive overexpression of Pht1;5 had the opposite effect  on P distribution: namely, lower P levels in shoots compared with the wild type  but higher P content in roots. Pht1;5 overexpression also resulted in altered Pi  remobilization, as evidenced by a greater than 2-fold increase in the  accumulation of Pi in siliques, premature senescence, and an increase in  transcript levels of genes involved in Pi scavenging. Furthermore, Pht1;5  overexpressors exhibited increased root hair formation and reduced primary root  growth that could be rescued by the application of silver nitrate (ethylene  perception inhibitor) or aminoethoxyvinylglycine (ethylene biosynthesis  inhibitor), respectively. Together, these data indicate that Pht1;5 plays a  critical role in mobilizing Pi from P source to sink organs in accordance with  developmental cues and P status. The study also provides evidence for a link  between Pi and ethylene signaling pathways.', '2011 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.174805', 'Smith']
