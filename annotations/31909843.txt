Alternative polyadenylation (APA) regulates diverse developmental and physiological processes through its effects on gene expression, mRNA stability, translatability, and transport. Sorghum is a major cereal crop in the world and, despite its importance, not much is known about the role of post-transcriptional regulation in mediating responses to abiotic stresses in Sorghum. A genome-wide APA analysis unveiled widespread occurrence of APA in Sorghum in response to drought, heat, and salt stress. Abiotic stress treatments incited changes in poly(A) site choice in a large number of genes. Interestingly, abiotic stresses led to the re-directing of transcriptional output into non-productive pathways defined by the class of poly(A) site utilized. This result revealed APA to be part of a larger global response of Sorghum to abiotic stresses that involves the re-direction of transcriptional output into non-productive transcriptional and translational pathways. Large numbers of stress-inducible poly(A) sites could not be linked with known, annotated genes, suggestive of the existence of numerous unidentified genes whose expression is strongly regulated by abiotic stresses. Furthermore, we uncovered a novel stress-specific cis-element in intronic poly(A) sites used in drought- and heat-stressed plants that might play an important role in non-canonical poly(A) site choice in response to abiotic stresses.
