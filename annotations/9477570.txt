['9477570', 'To identify mutants potentially defective in signaling intermediates specific to  phytochrome A (phyA), we screened for extragenic mutations that suppress the  morphological phenotype exhibited by a weak phyA mutant (phyA-105) of  Arabidopsis. A new recessive mutant, designated spa1 (for suppressor of  phyA-105), was isolated and mapped to the bottom of chromosome 2. spa1 phyA-105  double mutants exhibit restoration of several responses to limiting fluence rates  of continuous far-red light that are absent in the parental phyA-105 mutant, such  as deetiolation, anthocyanin accumulation, and a far-red light-induced inability  of seedlings to green upon subsequent transfer to continuous white light. spa1  mutations do not cause a phenotype in darkness, indicating that the suppression  phenotype is light dependent. Enhanced photoresponsiveness was observed in spa1  seedlings in a wild-type PHYA background as well as in the mutant phyA-105  background but not in a mutant phyA null background. These results indicate that  phyA is necessary in a non-allele-specific fashion for the expression of the spa1  mutant phenotype and that phyB to phyE are not sufficient for this effect. Taken  together, the data suggest that spa1 mutations specifically amplify phyA  signaling and therefore that the SPA1 locus encodes a component that acts  negatively early in the phyA-specific signaling pathway.', '1998 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.1.19', 'Quail']
