Trichomes are epidermal structures with a large variety of ecological functions and economic applications. Glandular trichomes produce a rich repertoire of secondary metabolites, whereas non-glandular trichomes create a physical barrier on the epidermis: both operate in tandem against biotic and abiotic stressors. A deeper understanding of trichome development and function would enable the breeding of more resilient crops. However, little is known about the impact of altered trichome density on leaf photosynthesis, gas exchange and energy balance. Previous work has compared multiple, closely related species differing in trichome density. Here, we analysed monogenic trichome mutants in the same tomato genetic background (Solanum lycopersicum cv. 'Micro-Tom'). We determined growth parameters, leaf spectral properties, gas exchange and leaf temperature in the hairs absent (h), Lanata (Ln) and Woolly (Wo) trichome mutants. Shoot dry weight, leaf area, leaf spectral properties and cuticular conductance were not affected by the mutations. However, the Ln mutant showed increased net carbon assimilation rate (A<sub>n</sub>), associated with higher stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>), with no differences in stomatal density or stomatal index between genotypes. Leaf temperature was furthermore reduced in Ln in the hottest, early hours of the afternoon. We show that a single monogenic mutation that modifies trichome density, a desirable trait for crop breeding, concomitantly improves leaf gas exchange and reduces leaf temperature.
