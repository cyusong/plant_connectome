['35412622', 'Holliday junction is the key homologous recombination intermediate, resolved by  structure-selective endonucleases (SSEs). SLX1 is the most promiscuous SSE of the  GIY-YIG nuclease superfamily. In fungi and animals, SLX1 nuclease activity relies  on a non-enzymatic partner, SLX4, but no SLX1-SLX4 like complex has ever been  characterized in plants. Plants exhibit specialized DNA repair and recombination  machinery. Based on sequence similarity with the GIY-YIG nuclease domain of SLX1  proteins from fungi and animals, At-HIGLE was identified to be a possible SLX1  like nuclease from plants. Here, we elucidated the crystal structure of the  At-HIGLE nuclease domain from Arabidopsis thaliana, establishing it as a member  of the SLX1-lineage of the GIY-YIG superfamily with structural changes in DNA  interacting regions. We show that At-HIGLE can process branched-DNA molecules  without an SLX4 like protein. Unlike fungal SLX1, At-HIGLE exists as a  catalytically active homodimer capable of generating two coordinated nicks during  HJ resolution. Truncating the extended C-terminal region of At-HIGLE increases  its catalytic activity, changes the nicking pattern, and monomerizes At-HIGLE.  Overall, we elucidated the first structure of a plant SLX1-lineage protein,  showed its HJ resolving activity independent of any regulatory protein, and  identified an in-built novel regulatory mechanism engaging its C-terminal region.', '2022 May 6', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkac239', 'ORCID:']
