['33908063', 'Secondary cell wall biosynthesis has been shown to be regulated by a suite of  transcription factors. Here, we identified a new xylem vessel-specific NAC domain  transcription factor, secondary wall-associated NAC domain protein5 (SND5), in  Arabidopsis thaliana and studied its role in regulating secondary wall  biosynthesis. We showed that the expression of SND5 and its close homolog,  SND4/ANAC075, was specifically associated with secondary wall-containing cells  and dominant repression of their functions severely reduced secondary wall  thickening in these cells. Overexpression of SND4/5 as well as their homologs  SND2/3 fused with the activation domain of the viral protein VP16 led to ectopic  secondary wall deposition in cells that are normally parenchymatous. SND2/3/4/5  regulated the expression of the same downstream target genes as do the secondary  wall NAC master switches (SWNs) by binding to and activating the secondary wall  NAC binding elements (SNBEs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the poplar  (Populus trichocarpa) orthologs of SND2/3/4/5 also activated SNBEs and regulated  secondary wall biosynthesis during wood formation. Together, these findings  indicate that SND2/3/4/5 and their poplar orthologs regulate the expression of  secondary wall-associated genes through activating SNBEs and they are positioned  at an upper level in the SWN-mediated transcriptional network.', '2021 Aug', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.17425', 'ORCID:']
