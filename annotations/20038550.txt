Fluorescent studies of living plant cells such as confocal microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging often suffer from a strong autofluorescent background contribution that significantly reduces the dynamic image contrast and the quantitative access to sub-cellular processes at high spatial resolution. Here, we present a novel technique--fluorescence intensity decay shape analysis microscopy (FIDSAM)--to enhance the dynamic contrast of a fluorescence image of at least one order of magnitude. The method is based on the analysis of the shape of the fluorescence intensity decay (fluorescence lifetime curve) and benefits from the fact that the decay patterns of typical fluorescence label dyes strongly differ from emission decay curves of autofluorescent sample areas. Using FIDSAM, we investigated Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl cells in their tissue environment, which accumulate an eGFP fusion of the plasma membrane marker protein LTI6b (LTI6b-eGFP) to low level. Whereas in conventional confocal fluorescence images, the membranes of neighboring cells can hardly be optically resolved due to the strong autofluorescence of the cell wall, FIDSAM allows for imaging of single, isolated membranes at high spatial resolution. Thus, FIDSAM will enable the sub-cellular analysis of even low-expressed fluorophore-tagged proteins in living plant cells. Furthermore, the combination of FIDSAM with fluorescence lifetime imaging provides the basis to study the local physico-chemical environment of fluorophore-tagged biomolecules in living plant cells.
