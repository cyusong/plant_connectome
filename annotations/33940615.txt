GIBBERELLIN MYB GENE (GAMYB), UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (UDT1), TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2/bHLH142), TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), and ETERNAL TAPETUM 1/DELAYED TAPETUM DEGENERATION (EAT1/DTD) are important transcription factors that play a crucial role during pollen development in rice. This study demonstrates that bHLH142 acts downstream of UDT1 and GAMYB and works as a 'hub' in these two pollen pathways. We show that GAMYB modulates bHLH142 expression through specific binding to the MYB motif of the bHLH142 promoter during the early stage of pollen development, while TDR acts as a transcriptional repressor of the GAMYB modulation of bHLH142 by binding to the E-box close to the MYB motif on the promoter. Altered expression of these transcription factors highlights that a tight, precise, and coordinated regulation among them is essential for normal pollen development. Most notably, we show that the regulatory pathways of GAMYB and UDT1 rely on bHLH142 in a direct and indirect manner, respectively, and function in different tissues with distinct biological roles during pollen development. This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of rice pollen development.
