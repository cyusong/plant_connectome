The developmental expression pattern and localization of calreticulin were studied in Nicotiana tabacum L. anthers, pollen and pollen tubes. High transcript and protein levels were detected throughout anther development. Immunolocalization of calreticulin in the anthers showed particular dense label in tapetum and pollen at developmental stage 2, when the tapetum is highly active and the pollen tetrads are formed. Much lower transcript and protein levels were detected in dry and hydrated pollen and in pollen tubes. Immunofluorescence labeling of both chemically fixed and cryo-fixed and freeze-substituted pollen tubes showed the presence of calreticulin in Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calreticulin was seen throughout the stacks in the Golgi apparatus and in the areas with coated-Golgi vesicles but much less so in the ER. Calreticulin was not found in the secretory vesicles. A relatively intense label was occasionally seen adjacent to the wall of the tube. No significant label was observed in mitochondria, vacuoles, generative cells, cell wall or callose plugs. The present results are consistent with a role of calreticulin in Ca2+-dependent folding of secreted glycoproteins in tapetum, pollen and pollen tubes.
