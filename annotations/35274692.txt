Since Mendel, maize has been a powerhouse of fundamental genetics research. From testing the Mendelian laws of inheritance, to the first genetic and cytogenetic maps, to the use of whole-genome sequencing data for crop improvement, maize is at the forefront of genetics advances. Underpinning much of this revolutionary work are the classic morphological mutants; the "freaks" that stood out in the field to even the untrained eye. Here we review some of these classic developmental mutants and their importance in the history of genetics, as well as their key role in our fundamental understanding of plant development.
