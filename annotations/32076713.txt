Accumulating evidence suggests that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important signaling molecule in plant environmental interactions. The consensus view amongst plant scientists is that environmental stress leads to enhanced production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). H2S interacts with the ROS-mediated oxidative stress response network at multiple levels, including the regulation of ROS-processing systems by transcriptional or post-translational modifications. H2S-ROS crosstalk also involves other interacting factors, including nitric oxide, and can affect key cellular processes like autophagy. While H2S often functions to prevent ROS accumulation, it can also act synergistically with ROS signals in processes such as stomatal closure. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of H2S action and the multifaceted roles of this molecule in plant stress responses. Emphasis is placed on the interactions between H2S, ROS, and the redox signaling network that is crucial for plant defense against environmental threats.
