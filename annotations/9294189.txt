['9294189', 'We describe mutations of three genes in Arabidopsis thaliana-extra cotyledon1  (xtc1), extra cotyledon2 (xtc2), and altered meristem programming1 (amp1)-that  transform leaves into cotyledons. In all three of these mutations, this  transformation is associated with a change in the timing of events in  embryogenesis. xtc1 and xtc2 delay the morphogenesis of the embryo proper at the  globular-to-heart transition but permit the shoot apex to develop to an unusually  advanced stage late in embryogenesis. Both mutations have little or no effect on  seed maturation and do not affect the viability of the shoot or the rate of leaf  initiation after germination. amp1 perturbs the pattern of cell division at an  early globular stage, dramatically increases the size of the shoot apex and, like  xtc1 and xtc2, produces enlarged leaf primordia during seed development. These  unusual phenotypes suggest that these genes play important regulatory roles in  embryogenesis and demonstrate that the development of the shoot apical meristem  and the development of the embryo proper are regulated by independent processes  that must be temporally coordinated to ensure normal organ identity.', '1997 Sep 16', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.94.19.10209', 'Poethig']
