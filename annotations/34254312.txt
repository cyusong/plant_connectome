Plants absorb sulfur from the environment and assimilate it into suitable forms for the biosynthesis of a broad range of molecules. Although the biochemical pathway of sulfur assimilation is known, how genetic differences contribute to natural variation in sulfur assimilation remains poorly understood. Here, using a genome-wide association study, we uncovered a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant in the sulfite reductase (SiR) gene that was significantly associated with SiR protein abundance in a maize natural association population. We also demonstrated that the synonymous C to G base change at SNP69 may repress translational activity by altering messenger RNA secondary structure, which leads to reduction in ZmSiR protein abundance and sulfur assimilation activity. Population genetic analyses showed that the SNP69C allele was likely a variant occurring after the initial maize domestication and accumulated with the spread of maize cultivation from tropical to temperate regions. This study provides the first evidence that genetic polymorphisms in the exon of ZmSiR could influence the protein abundance through a posttranscriptional mechanism and in part contribute to natural variation in sulfur assimilation. These findings provide a prospective target to improve maize varieties with proper sulfur nutrient levels assisted by molecular breeding and engineering.
