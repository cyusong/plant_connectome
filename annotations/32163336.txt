<i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> is a plant-pathogenic fungus with a broad host range. It causes significant losses to important crops, including apple, pear, strawberry, and other Rosaceae and non-Rosaceae species. To date, two short read-based <i>C. fructicola</i> genomes are publicly available, but both are fragmented. In this study, we re-sequenced the genome of <i>C. fructicola</i> using nanopore long-read technology and refined the assembly with Hi-C map data. The resulting high-quality assembly is an important resource for further comparative and experimental studies with <i>C. fructicola</i>.
