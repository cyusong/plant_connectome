Over 80,000 angiosperm species produce flowers with petals fused into a corolla tube. The corolla tube contributes to the tremendous diversity of flower morphology and plays a critical role in plant reproduction, yet it remains one of the least understood plant structures from a developmental genetics perspective. Through mutant analyses and transgenic experiments, we show that the tasiRNA-<i>ARF</i> pathway is required for corolla tube formation in the monkeyflower species <i>Mimulus lewisii</i> Loss-of-function mutations in the <i>M. lewisii</i> orthologs of <i>ARGONAUTE7</i> and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3</i> cause a dramatic decrease in abundance of <i>TAS3</i>-derived small RNAs and a moderate upregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3</i> (<i>ARF3</i>) and <i>ARF4</i>, which lead to inhibition of lateral expansion of the bases of petal primordia and complete arrest of the upward growth of the interprimordial regions, resulting in unfused corollas. Using the <i>DR5</i> auxin-responsive promoter, we discovered that auxin signaling is continuous along the petal primordium base and the interprimordial region during the critical stage of corolla tube formation in the wild type, similar to the spatial pattern of <i>MlARF4</i> expression. Auxin response is much weaker and more restricted in the mutant. Furthermore, exogenous application of a polar auxin transport inhibitor to wild-type floral apices disrupted petal fusion. Together, these results suggest a new conceptual model highlighting the central role of auxin-directed synchronized growth of the petal primordium base and the interprimordial region in corolla tube formation.
