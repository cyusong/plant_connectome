To meet the demands of a larger and more affluent global population, wheat yields must increase faster this century than last, with less irrigation, fertilizer, and land. Modelling and experiments consistently demonstrate a large potential for increasing wheat productivity by improving root systems; however, application of research to new varieties is slow because of the inherent difficulties associated with working underground. This review makes the case for the use of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon to simplify root research and accelerate the identification of genes underlying wheat root improvement. Brachypodium is a small temperate grass with many genomic, genetic, and experimental resources that make it a tractable model plant. Brachypodium and wheat have very similar root anatomies which are distinct from rice root anatomy that is specialized to help it overcome anaerobic conditions associated with submerged roots. As a dicotyledonous plant, Arabidopsis has an even more divergent root system that features a tap root system and cambia with secondary growth, both of which are lacking in the grasses. The major advantage of Brachypodium is its small stature that allows the adult grass root system to be readily phenotyped, unlike rice and maize. This will facilitate the identification of genes in adult roots that greatly influence yield by modulating water uptake during flowering and grain development. A summary of the advantages of Brachypodium for root studies is presented, including the adult root system architecture and root growth during grain development. Routes to translate discoveries from Brachypodium to wheat are also discussed.
