Polyamines play an important role in plant growth and development, and response to abiotic stresses. Previously, differentially expressed proteins in sugar beet M14 (<i>Bv</i>M14) under salt stress were identified by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics. One of the proteins was an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), a key rate-limiting enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines. In this study, the <i>BvM14-SAMDC</i> gene was cloned from the sugar beet M14. The full-length <i>BvM14-SAMDC</i> was 1960 bp, and its ORF contained 1119 bp encoding the SAMDC of 372 amino acids. In addition, we expressed the coding sequence of <i>BvM14-SAMDC</i> in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and purified the ~40 kD BvM14-SAMDC with high enzymatic activity. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the <i>BvM14-SAMDC</i> was up-regulated in the <i>Bv</i>M14 roots and leaves under salt stress. To investigate the functions of the <i>BvM14-SAMDC</i>, it was constitutively expressed in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The transgenic plants exhibited greater salt stress tolerance, as evidenced by longer root length and higher fresh weight and chlorophyll content than wild type (WT) under salt treatment. The levels of spermidine (Spd) and spermin (Spm) concentrations were increased in the transgenic plants as compared with the WT. Furthermore, the overexpression plants showed higher activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased cell membrane damage. Compared with WT, they also had low expression levels of <i>RbohD</i> and <i>RbohF</i>, which are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Together, these results suggest that the BvM14-SAMDC mediated biosynthesis of Spm and Spd contributes to plant salt stress tolerance through enhancing antioxidant enzymes and decreasing ROS generation.
