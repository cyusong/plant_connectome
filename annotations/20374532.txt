['20374532', 'Sulphonation of small molecules by cytosolic sulphotransferases in mammals is an  important process in which endogenous molecules are modified for  inactivation/activation of their biological effects. Plants possess large numbers  of sulphotransferase genes, but their biological functions are largely unknown.  Here, we present a functional analysis of the Arabidopsis sulphotransferase  AtSOT12 (At2g03760). AtSOT12 gene expression is strongly induced by salt, and  osmotic stress and hormone treatments. The T-DNA knock-out mutant sot12 exhibited  hypersensitivity to NaCl and ABA in seed germination, and to salicylic acid (SA)  in seedling growth. In vitro enzyme activity assay revealed that AtSOT12  sulphonates SA, and endogenous SA levels suggested that sulphonation of SA  positively regulates SA production. Upon challenging with the pathogen  Pseudomonas syringae, sot12 mutant and AtSOT12 over-expressing lines accumulate  less and more SA, respectively, when compared with wild type. Consistent with the  changes in SA levels, the sot12 mutant was more susceptible, while AtSOT12  over-expressing plants are more resistant to pathogen infection. Moreover,  pathogen-induced PR gene expression in systemic leaves was significantly enhanced  in AtSOT12 over-expressing plants. The role of sulphonation of SA in SA  production, mobile signalling and acquired systemic resistance is discussed.', '2010 Aug 1', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02156.x', 'Shi']
