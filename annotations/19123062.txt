The photosynthetic responses of the tropical tree species Acacia nigrescens Oliv. grown at different atmospheric CO(2) concentrations-from sub-ambient to super-ambient-have been studied. Light-saturated rates of net photosynthesis (A (sat)) in A. nigrescens, measured after 120 days exposure, increased significantly from sub-ambient (196 microL L(-1)) to current ambient (386 microL L(-1)) CO(2) growth conditions but did not increase any further as [CO(2)] became super-ambient (597 microL L(-1)). Examination of photosynthetic CO(2) response curves, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf thickness showed that this acclimation was most likely caused by reduction in Rubisco activity and a shift towards ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration-limited photosynthesis, but not a consequence of changes in mesophyll conductance. Also, measurements of the maximum efficiency of PSII and the carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio of leaves indicated that it was unlikely that the pattern of A (sat) seen was a consequence of growth [CO(2)] induced stress. Many of the photosynthetic responses examined were not linear with respect to the concentration of CO(2) but could be explained by current models of photosynthesis.
