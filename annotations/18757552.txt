Plastid genomes contain a conserved set of genes encoding components of the translational apparatus. While knockout of plastid translation is lethal in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), it is not known whether each individual component of the plastid ribosome is essential. Here, we used reverse genetics to test whether several plastid genome-encoded ribosomal proteins are essential. We found that, while ribosomal proteins Rps2, Rps4, and Rpl20 are essential for cell survival, knockout of the gene encoding ribosomal protein Rpl33 did not affect plant viability and growth under standard conditions. However, when plants were exposed to low temperature stress, recovery of Rpl33 knockout plants was severely compromised, indicating that Rpl33 is required for sustaining sufficient plastid translation capacity in the cold. These findings uncover an important role for plastid translation in plant tolerance to chilling stress.
