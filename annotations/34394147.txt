The conversion of cytidines to uridines (C-to-U) at specific sites in mitochondrial and plastid transcripts is a post-transcriptional processing event that is important to the expression of organellar genes. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are involved in this process. In this study, we report the function of a previously uncharacterized PPR-DYW protein, Empty pericarp17 (EMP17), in the C-to-U editing and kernel development in maize. EMP17 is targeted to mitochondria. The loss-function of EMP17 arrests maize kernel development, abolishes the editing at <i>ccmF</i> <sub><i>C</i></sub> -799 and <i>nad2</i>-677 sites, and reduces the editing at <i>ccmF</i> <sub><i>C</i></sub> -906 and -966 sites. The absence of editing causes amino acid residue changes in CcmF<sub>C</sub>-267 (Ser to Pro) and Nad2-226 (Phe to Ser), respectively. As CcmF<sub>C</sub> functions in cytochrome <i>c</i> (Cyt<i>c</i>) maturation, the amount of Cyt<i>c</i> and Cyt<i>c</i> <sub>1</sub> protein is drastically reduced in <i>emp17</i>, suggesting that the CcmF<sub>C</sub>-267 (Ser to Pro) change impairs the CcmF<sub>C</sub> function. As a result, the assembly of complex III is strikingly decreased in <i>emp17</i>. In contrast, the assembly of complex I appears less affected, suggesting that the Nad2-226 (Phe to Ser) change may have less impact on Nad2 function. Together, these results indicate that EMP17 is required for the C-to-U editing at several sites in mitochondrial transcripts, complex III biogenesis, and seed development in maize.
