Microalgae accumulate triacylglycerol (TAG) during nutrient deprivation and break it down after nutrient resupply, and these processes involve dramatic shifts in cellular carbon allocation. Due to the importance of algae in the global carbon cycle, and the potential of algal lipids as feedstock for chemical and fuel production, these processes are of both ecophysiological and biotechnological importance. However, the metabolism of TAG is not well understood, particularly the contributions of fatty acids (FAs) from different membrane lipids to TAG accumulation and the fate of TAG FAs during degradation. Here, we used isotopic labeling time course experiments on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to track FA synthesis and transfer between lipid pools during nitrogen (N)-deprivation and resupply. When cells were labeled before N-deprivation, total levels of label in cellular FAs were unchanged during subsequent N-deprivation and later resupply, despite large fluxes into and out of TAG and membrane lipid pools. Detailed analyses of FA levels and labeling revealed that about one-third of acyl chains accumulating in TAG during N-deprivation derive from preexisting membrane lipids, and in total, at least 45% of TAG FAs passed through membrane lipids at one point. Notably, most acyl chains in membrane lipids during recovery after N-resupply come from TAG. Fluxes of polyunsaturated FAs from plastidic membranes into TAG during N-deprivation were particularly noteworthy. These findings demonstrate a high degree of integration of TAG and membrane lipid metabolism and highlight a role for TAG in storage and supply of membrane lipid components.
