Phosphate homeostasis in multicellular eukaryotes depends on both phosphate influx and efflux. The mammalian Xenotropic Polytropic Virus Receptor 1 (XPR1) shares homology to the Arabidopsis PHO1, a phosphate exporter expressed in roots. However, phosphate export activity of XPR1 has not yet been demonstrated in a heterologous system. Here, wedemonstrate that transient expression in tobacco leaves of XPR1-GFP leads to specific phosphate export. Like PHO1-GFP, XPR1-GFP is localized predominantly to the endomembrane system in tobacco cells. These results show that tobacco leaves are a good heterologous system to study the transport activity of members of the PHO1/XPR1 family.
