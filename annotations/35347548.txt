This review presents the multiple ways how topless and topless-related proteins regulate defense activation in plants and help in optimizing the defense-growth tradeoff. Eukaryotic gene expression is tightly regulated at various levels by hormones, transcription regulators, post-translational modifications, and transcriptional coregulators. TOPLESS (TPL)/TOPLESS-related (TPR) corepressors regulate gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors. TPRs regulate auxin, gibberellins, jasmonic acid, strigolactone, and brassinosteroid signaling in plants. In general, except for GA, TPLs suppress these signaling pathways to prevent unwanted activation of hormone signaling. The association of TPL/TPRs in these hormonal signaling reflects a wide role of this class of corepressors in plants' normal and stress physiology. The involvement of TPL in immune responses was first demonstrated a decade ago as a repressor of DND1 and DND2 that are negative regulators of plant immune response. Over the last decade, several research groups have established a larger role of TPL/TPRs in plant immunity during both pattern- and effector-triggered immunity. Very recent research unraveled the significant involvement of TPRs in balancing the growth and defense trade-off. TPRs, along with proteasomal degradation complex, miRNA, and phasiRNA, suppress the activation of autoimmunity in plants under normal conditions and promote defense under pathogen attack.
