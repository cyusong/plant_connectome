Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) has drawn intense research attention due to its potential ability to promote healing of serious injuries, such as cuts, burns, and diabetic ulcers. Although hEGF displays prospective clinical value, the growth factor is restricted to the treatment of chronic diabetic ulcers because of its high production cost. Leguminous plant peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.) hairy roots contain relatively few toxic and harmful substances, and tested as an excellent production system for hEGF in our study. To explore the possibility of hEGF expression in peanut, <i>hEGF</i> overexpression hairy roots were obtained by infecting leaves with <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</i> R1601. The maximum transgenic hairy roots inducing rate was 82%. Protein purification and mass spectrometry assays showed that the protein expressed in peanut hairy roots was identified as hEGF. Furthermore, Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay showed that hEGF promoted HL-7702 liver cells proliferation, which indicate that hEGF has biological activity and non-toxic on human cells. Our results demonstrate the capacity of peanut hairy root cultures as a controlled, sustainable, and scalable production system that can be induced to produce valued human proteins, such as hEGF.
