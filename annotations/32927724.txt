Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a highly conserved kinase present in all eukaryotes and functions as a key regulator of a wide range of physiological and developmental processes. The kinase, known in land plants as GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase (GSK), is a key player in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway. The <i>GSK</i> genes, through the BRs, affect diverse developmental processes and modulate responses to environmental factors. In this work, we describe functional analysis of <i>HvGSK1.1</i>, which is one of the <i>GSK3/SHAGGY</i>-like orthologs in barley. The RNAi-mediated silencing of the target <i>HvGSK1.1</i> gene was associated with modified expression of its paralogs <i>HvGSK1.2</i>, <i>HvGSK2.1</i>, <i>HvGSK3.1</i>, and <i>HvGSK4.1</i> in plants grown in normal and in salt stress conditions. Low nucleotide similarity between the silencing fragment and barley <i>GSK</i> genes and the presence of BR-dependent transcription factors' binding sites in promoter regions of barley and rice <i>GSK</i> genes imply an innate mechanism responsible for co-regulation of the genes. The results of the leaf inclination assay indicated that silencing of <i>HvGSK1.1</i> and the changes of <i>GSK</i> paralogs enhanced the BR-dependent signaling in the plants. The strongest phenotype of transgenic lines with downregulated <i>HvGSK1.1</i> and <i>GSK</i> paralogs had greater biomass of the seedlings grown in normal conditions and salt stress as well as elevated kernel weight of plants grown in normal conditions. Both traits showed a strong negative correlation with the transcript level of the target gene and the paralogs. The characteristics of barley lines with silenced expression of <i>HvGSK1.1</i> are compatible with the expected phenotypes of plants with enhanced BR signaling. The results show that manipulation of the GSK-encoding genes provides data to explore their biological functions and confirm it as a feasible strategy to generate plants with improved agricultural traits.
