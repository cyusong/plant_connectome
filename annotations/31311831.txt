Auxin transport inhibitors are essential tools for understanding auxin-dependent plant development. One mode of inhibition affects actin dynamics; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we characterized the action of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) on actin dynamics in greater mechanistic detail. By surveying mutants for candidate actin-binding proteins with reduced TIBA sensitivity, we determined that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) villins contribute to TIBA action. By directly interacting with the C-terminal headpiece domain of villins, TIBA causes villin to oligomerize, driving excessive bundling of actin filaments. The resulting changes in actin dynamics impair auxin transport by disrupting the trafficking of PIN-FORMED auxin efflux carriers and reducing their levels at the plasma membrane. Collectively, our study provides mechanistic insight into the link between the actin cytoskeleton, vesicle trafficking, and auxin transport.
