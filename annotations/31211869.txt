Plants exist in an environment of changing abiotic and biotic stresses. They have developed a complex set of strategies to respond to these stresses and over recent years it has become clear that sphingolipids are a key player in these responses. Sphingolipids are not universally present in all three domains of life. Many bacteria and archaea do not produce sphingolipids but they are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and have been intensively studied in yeast and mammals. During the last decade there has been a steadily increasing interest in plant sphingolipids. Plant sphingolipids exhibit structural differences when compared with their mammalian counterparts and it is now clear that they perform some unique functions. Sphingolipids are recognised as critical components of the plant plasma membrane and endomembrane system. Besides being important structural elements of plant membranes, their particular structure contributes to the fluidity and biophysical order. Sphingolipids are also involved in multiple cellular and regulatory processes including vesicle trafficking, plant development and defence. This review will focus on our current knowledge as to the function of sphingolipids during plant stress responses, not only as structural components of biological membranes, but also as signalling mediators.
