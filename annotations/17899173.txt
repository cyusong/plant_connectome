SBgLR (Solanum tuberosum genomic lysine-rich) gene was isolated from a potato genomic library using SB401 (S. berthaultii 401) cDNA as probe. RT-PCR analysis of SBgLR gene expression profile and microscopic analysis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in tobacco plants transformed with SBgLR promoter-GFP reporters indicate that SBgLR is a pollen-specific gene. A series of 5'deletions of SBgLR promoter were fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and stably introduced into tobacco plants. Histochemical and quantitative assays of GUS expression in transgenic plants allowed us to localize an enhancer of SBgLR promoter to the region -345 to -269 relative to the translation start site. This 76 bp (-345 to -269) fragment enhanced GUS expression in leaves, stems and roots when fused to -90/+6 CaMV 35S minimal promoter. Deletion analysis showed that a cis-element, which can repress gene expression in root hairs, was located in the region -345 to -311. Further study indicated that the -269 to -9 region was sufficient to confer pollen-specific expression of GFP when fused to CaMV 35S enhancer.
