['15173560', 'To study the role of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase in starch  metabolism in the leaves of Arabidopsis, two independent mutant lines containing  T-DNA insertions within the phosphorylase gene were identified. Both insertions  eliminate the activity of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase. Measurement  of other enzymes of starch metabolism reveals only minor changes compared with  the wild type. The loss of plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase does not cause a  significant change in the total accumulation of starch during the day or its  remobilization at night. Starch structure and composition are unaltered. However,  mutant plants display lesions on their leaves that are not seen on wild-type  plants, and mesophyll cells bordering the lesions accumulate high levels of  starch. Lesion formation is abolished by growing plants under 100% humidity in  still air, but subsequent transfer to circulating air with lower humidity causes  extensive wilting in the mutant leaves. Wilted sectors die, causing large lesions  that are bordered by starch-accumulating cells. Similar lesions are caused by the  application of acute salt stress to mature plants. We conclude that plastidial  phosphorylase is not required for the degradation of starch, but that it plays a  role in the capacity of the leaf lamina to endure a transient water deficit.', '2004 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.032631', 'Smith']
