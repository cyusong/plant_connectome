['22443289', 'We investigated the role of the Arabidopsis microtubule associated proteins 65-1  and 65-2 (MAP65-1 and MAP65-2) in the control of axial root growth. Transgenic  plants expressing fluorescent fusion proteins from native promoters indicated  exactly overlapping accumulation of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 in the root tip and  elongation zone. Nearly identical protein accumulation patterns were observed  when MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 were expressed behind a constitutive CaMV 35S promoter,  suggesting a level of post-transcriptional control that restricts these proteins  to rapidly growing portions of the root. Co-expression of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2  fusion proteins showed precise co-localization to interphase and cytokinetic  microtubule arrays. In interphase root tip cells, the fluorescent protein fusions  labeled microtubules that were organized into a variety of different array  patterns. In the rapidly growing cells of the root elongation zone, we found  MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 co-localized exclusively to the lateral faces of cells that  were axially extending. Genetic analysis showed that MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 are  coordinately required for proper root elongation. Double map65-1-1 map65-2-2  mutant roots from dark-grown plants contained 50% fewer cells per file than  wild-type roots, but we found no evidence that cytokinesis was disrupted. We  additionally discovered that cell length was significantly shorter in the mature  regions of the root beyond the zone where MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 accumulated. Our  data indicate that MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 play a critical role in root growth by  promoting cell proliferation and axial extension.', '2012 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05002.x', 'Shaw']
