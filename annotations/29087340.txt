['29087340', 'Ubiquitin E3 ligases are crucial for eliminating misfolded proteins before they  form cytotoxic aggregates that threaten cell fitness and survival. However, it  remains unclear how emerging misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm can be  selectively recognized and eliminated by E3 ligases in plants. We found that  Misfolded Protein Sensing RING E3 ligase 1 (MPSR1) is an indispensable E3 ligase  required for plant survival after protein-damaging stress. Under no stress, MPSR1  is prone to rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome, concealing its protein  quality control (PQC) E3 ligase activity. Upon proteotoxic stress, MPSR1 directly  senses incipient misfolded proteins and tethers ubiquitins for subsequent  degradation. Furthermore, MPSR1 sustains the structural integrity of the  proteasome complex at the initial stage of proteotoxic stress. Here, we suggest  that the MPSR1 pathway is a constitutive mechanism for proteostasis under  protein-damaging stress, as a front-line surveillance system in the cytoplasm.', '2017 Nov 14', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1713574114', 'ORCID:']
