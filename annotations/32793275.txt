Adaptation to drought stress is essential for plant growth and development. Plants often adapt to water deficit conditions by activating the ABA signaling. Here, we report that the pepper <i>CaDIK1</i> (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> Drought Induced Kinase 1) gene is essential for plant tolerance to drought stress. <i>CaDIK1</i> contains a serine-threonine kinase domain, which plays a role for attachment of phosphate to the target protein. The expression levels of <i>CaDIK1</i> are upregulated in pepper leaves by ABA, drought, NaCl and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatments suggesting its role in abiotic stress response. We used <i>CaDIK1</i>-silenced pepper and <i>CaDIK1-</i>overexpressing (OX) transgenic Arabidopsis plants to evaluate their responses to ABA and drought. <i>CaDIK1-</i>silenced pepper plants conferred a reduced ABA sensitivity and drought hypersensitivity, which was accompanied by high levels of transpirational water loss. <i>CaDIK1-</i>OX plants displayed opposite phenotypes to <i>CaDIK1</i>-silenced peppers. In contrast, substitution of Lys350 to Asn in the kinase domain of CaDIK1 did not lead to alteration of drought sensitivity. Collectively, these data indicate that <i>CaDIK1</i> is a positive regulator of the ABA-mediated drought-stress tolerance.
