['10948257', 'The titan (ttn) mutants of Arabidopsis exhibit dramatic alterations in mitosis  and cell cycle control during seed development. Endosperm development in these  mutants is characterized by the formation of giant polyploid nuclei with enlarged  nucleoli. Embryo development is accompanied by significant cell enlargement in  some mutants (ttn1 and ttn5) but not others (ttn2 and ttn3). We describe here the  molecular cloning of TTN5 using a T-DNA-tagged allele. A second allele with a  similar phenotype contains a nonsense mutation in the same coding region. The  predicted protein is related to ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs), members of the  RAS family of small GTP binding proteins that regulate various cellular functions  in eukaryotes. TTN5 is most closely related in sequence to the ARL2 class of  ARF-like proteins isolated from humans, rats, and mice. Although the cellular  functions of ARL proteins remain unclear, the ttn5 phenotype is consistent with  the known roles of ARFs in the regulation of intracellular vesicle transport.', '2000 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.8.1379', 'Meinke']
