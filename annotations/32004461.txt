['32004461', 'Cell polarity is fundamental for tissue morphogenesis in multicellular organisms.  Plants and animals evolved multicellularity independently, and it is unknown  whether their polarity systems are derived from a single-celled ancestor. Planar  polarity in animals is conferred by Wnt signaling, an ancient signaling pathway  transduced by Dishevelled, which assembles signalosomes by dynamic head-to-tail  DIX domain polymerization. In contrast, polarity-determining pathways in plants  are elusive. We recently discovered Arabidopsis SOSEKI proteins, which exhibit  polar localization throughout development. Here, we identify SOSEKI as ancient  polar proteins across land plants. Concentration-dependent polymerization via a  bona fide DIX domain allows these to recruit ANGUSTIFOLIA to polar sites, similar  to the polymerization-dependent recruitment of signaling effectors by  Dishevelled. Cross-kingdom domain swaps reveal functional equivalence of animal  and plant DIX domains. We trace DIX domains to unicellular eukaryotes and thus  show that DIX-dependent polymerization is an ancient mechanism conserved between  kingdoms and central to polarity proteins.', '2020 Feb 6', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.011', 'Weijers']
