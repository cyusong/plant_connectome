High temperature reduces crop production; however, little is known about the effects of high night temperature (HNT) on the development of male and female reproductive organs, pollination, kernel formation and grain yield in maize (Zea mays L.). Therefore, a temperature-controlled experiment was carried out using heat-sensitive maize hybrid and including three temperature treatments of 32/22°C (day/night; control), 32/26°C and 32/30°C during 14 consecutive days encompassing the flowering stage. When exposed to 30°C night temperature, grain yield and kernel number reduced by 23.8 and 25.1%, respectively, compared with the control. The decrease in grain yield was mainly because of the lower kernel number rather than change in kernel weight under HNT exposure around flowering. No significant differences in grain yield and kernel number were found between 22 and 26°C night temperatures. HNT had no significant effects on the onset of flowering time and anthesis-silking interval but significantly reduced time period of pollen shedding duration and pollen viability, and increased leaf night respiration. Different from high daytime temperature, HNT had no lasting effects on daytime leaf photosynthesis, biomass production and assimilate transportation. From the perspective of source-flow-sink relationship, the unchanged source and flow capacities during daytime are supposed to alleviate the adverse effects on sink strength caused by HNT compared with daytime heat stress. These new findings commendably filled the knowledge gaps concerning heat stress in maize.
