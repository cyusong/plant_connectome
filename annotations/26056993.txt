Plant development, as occur in other eukaryotes, is conducted through a complex network of hormones, transcription factors, enzymes and micro RNAs, among other cellular components. They control developmental processes such as embryo, apical root and shoot meristem, leaf, flower, or seed formation, among others. The research in these topics has been very active in last decades. Recently, an explosion of new data concerning regulation mechanisms as well as the response of these processes to environmental changes has emerged. Initially, most of investigations were carried out in the model eudicot Arabidopsis but currently data from other plant species are available in the literature, although they are still limited. The aim of this review is focused on summarize the main molecular actors involved in plant development regulation in diverse plant species. A special attention will be given to the major families of genes and proteins participating in these regulatory mechanisms. The information on the regulatory pathways where they participate will be briefly cited. Additionally, the importance of certain structural features of such proteins that confer ductility and flexibility to these mechanisms will also be reported and discussed.
