We found novel vesicles derived from rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in rice endosperm. The novel vesicles had characteristic structures different from that of the ER-derived protein body type I and the Golgi-derived dense vesicles. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the novel vesicles are derived directly from the aggregates of vacuolar storage proteins in the rough ER. In addition, BiP, an ER-resident molecular chaperone, was localized in the novel vesicles, but also in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs). These results suggest that the novel vesicles mediate transport of vacuolar storage proteins directly from the ER to PSVs in rice endosperm.
