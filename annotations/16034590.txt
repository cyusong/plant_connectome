Efficiency of novel fiber formation was much improved in protoplast culture of embryogenic cells (ECs) of a conifer, Larix leptolepis (Sieb. et Zucc.) Gord., by pre-culturing ECs in a medium containing a high concentration of glutamine (13.7 mM). The fibrillar substructures of large and elongated fibers of protoplasts isolated from Larix ECs were investigated by laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) after Aniline Blue staining and atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a micromanipulator without any pre-treatment. Fibers were composed of bundles of fibrils and subfibrils, whose diameters were defined as 0.7 and 0.17 mum, respectively, by image analysis after LCSM and AFM. These fibers were proven to be composed of callose by using specific degrading enzymes for beta-1,4-glucan and beta-1,3-glucan.
