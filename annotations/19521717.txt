['19521717', 'Hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs) are secondary metabolites involved in the  defense of plants against pathogens. Here, we report the first identification of  HCAAs, p-coumaroylagmatine, feruloylagmatine, p-coumaroylputrescine and  feruloylputrescine, in Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves infected with  Alternaria brassicicola and the assignment of At5g61160 as the agmatine  coumaroyltransferase (AtACT) that catalyzes the last reaction in the biosynthesis  of the HCAAs. Feeding experiments with putative labeled precursors revealed that  the four HCAAs were synthesized from hydroxycinnamic acids and agmatine or  putrescine. AtACT gene function was identified from an analysis of a mutant that  did not accumulate HCAAs. In wild-type Arabidopsis, AtACT transcripts markedly  increased in response to A. brassicicola infection. Enzymatic activity that  catalyzes the synthesis of the HCAAs was confirmed in vitro by using a  recombinant AtACT expressed in Escherichia coli. The Atact mutant was susceptible  to infection by A. brassicicola, indicating that HCAAs are responsible for  defense against pathogens in A. thaliana.', '2009 Aug', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-009-0960-0', 'Nishioka']
