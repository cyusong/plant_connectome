Soybean is a predominantly self-pollinated crop. It is also one of the important oilseed legumes. Soybean is an excellent crop having industrial, traditional, culinary, feeding, and cultural roles. Genetic diversity in breeding programs is of prime importance as it ensures the success of any breeding by enhancing the outcomes and results of the plants. The phenomenon wherein the progeny exhibits greater biomass (yield) and a faster rate of development and fertility than its parents is referred to as heterosis. As of now, heterosis is mainly limited to the trait of seed yield and is considered the basis for the development of better (superior) varieties. Male sterility (MS) is extensively used for the production of seeds and the improvement of crops coupled with the traditional breeding programs and molecular technology. Therefore, deployment of MS and heterosis in breeding soybean could yield better outcomes. This review aims to focus on two aspects, namely, MS and heterosis in soybean with its scope for crop improvement.
