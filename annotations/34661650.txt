Programmed cell death is a tightly regulated genetically controlled process that leads to cell suicide and eliminates cells that are either no longer needed or damaged/harmful. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins have recently emerged as a novel class of Ca2+-permeable channels that operate in plant immune responses. This viewpoint argues that the unique structure of this channel, its permeability to other cations, and specificity of its operation make it an ideal candidate to mediate cell signaling and adaptive responses not only to pathogens but also to a broad range of abiotic stress factors.
