Phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, [PtdIns(4,5)P 2], is a signaling lipid involved in many important processes in animal cells such as cytoskeleton organization, intracellular vesicular trafficking, secretion, cell motility, regulation of ion channels, and nuclear signaling pathways. In the last years PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and its synthesizing enzyme, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK), has been intensively studied in plant cells, revealing a key role in the control of polar tip growth. Analysis of the PIPK members from Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Physcomitrella patens showed that they share some regulatory features with animal PIPKs but also exert plant-specific modes of regulation. This review aims at giving an overview on the PIPK family from Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens. Even though their basic structure, modes of activation and physiological role is evolutionary conserved, modules responsible for plasma membrane localization are distinct for different PIPKs, depending on differences in physiological and/or developmental status of cells, such as polarized and non-polarized.
