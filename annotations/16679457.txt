['16679457', 'Boron (B) is essential in plants but often present at low concentrations in the  environment. To investigate how plants survive under conditions of B limitation,  we conducted a transcriptome analysis and identified NIP5;1, a member of the  major intrinsic protein family, as a gene upregulated in B-deficient roots of  Arabidopsis thaliana. Promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusions indicated that NIP5;1  is strongly upregulated in the root elongation zone and the root hair zone under  B limitation, and green fluorescent protein-tagged NIP5;1 proteins localized to  the plasma membrane. Expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated that  NIP5;1 facilitated the transport of boric acid in addition to water. Importantly,  two T-DNA insertion lines of NIP5;1 displayed lower boric acid uptake into roots,  lower biomass production, and increased sensitivity of root and shoot development  to B deficiency. These results identify NIP5;1 as a major plasma membrane boric  acid channel crucial for the B uptake required for plant growth and development  under B limitation.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.041640', 'Fujiwara']
