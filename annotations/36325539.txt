The invasive weed <i>Ageratina adenophora</i> can form a positive symbiotic relationship with native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to promote its invasion ability. However, the function of AMF during the feeding of <i>Aphis gossypii</i> in <i>A. adenophora</i> was poorly understand. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two dominant AMF (<i>Claroideoglomus etunicatum and Septoglomus constrictum</i>) on <i>A. adenophora</i> in response to the feeding of the generalist herbivore <i>A. gossypii</i>. The results showed that <i>A. gossypii</i> infestation could significantly reduce the biomass, nutrient and proline contents <i>of A. adenophora</i>, and increase the antioxidant enzyme activities, defense hormone and secondary metabolite contents of the weed. Compared with the <i>A. gossypii</i> infested <i>A. adenophora</i>, inoculation <i>C</i>. <i>etunicatum and S</i>. <i>constrictum</i> could significantly promote the growth ability and enhanced the resistance of <i>A. adenophora</i> to <i>A. gossypii</i> infestation, and the aboveground biomass of <i>A. adenophora</i> increased by 317.21% and 114.73%, the root biomass increased by 347.33% and 120.58%, the polyphenol oxidase activity heightened by 57.85% and 12.62%, the jasmonic acid content raised by 13.49% and 4.92%, the flavonoid content increased by 27.29% and 11.92%, respectively. The survival rate of <i>A. gossypii</i> and density of nymphs were significantly inhibited by AMF inoculation, and the effect of <i>C. etunicatum</i> was significantly greater than that of <i>S. constrictum</i>. This study provides clarified evidence that AMF in the rhizosphere of <i>A. adenophora</i> are effective in the development of tolerance and chemical defense under the feeding pressure of insect herbivory, and offer references for the management of the <i>A. adenophora</i> from the perspective of soil microorganisms.
