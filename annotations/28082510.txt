At the onset of ripening, some fleshy fruits shift the dominant water import pathway from the xylem to the phloem, but the cause for the decline in xylem inflow remains obscure. This study found that xylem-mobile dye movement into grape berries decreased despite transient increases in berry growth and transpiration during early ripening, whereas outward dye movement continued unless the roots were pressurized. Modeling berry vascular flows using measurements of pedicel phloem sap sugar concentration, berry growth, solute accumulation, and transpiration showed that a fraction of phloem-derived water was used for berry growth and transpiration; the surplus was recirculated via the xylem. Changing phloem sap sugar concentration to a much higher published value led to model simulations predicting xylem inflow or backflow depending on the developmental stage and genotype. Mathematically preventing net xylem flow resulted in large variations in phloem sap sugar concentration in pedicels serving neighboring berries on the same fruit cluster. Moreover, restricting water discharge via the xylem and/or across the skin impaired berry solute accumulation and color change. Collectively, these results indicate that discharge of surplus phloem water via berry transpiration and/or xylem backflow may be necessary to facilitate normal grape ripening.
