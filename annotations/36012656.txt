Viral satellite RNAs (satRNAs) are small subviral particles that are associated with the genomic RNA of a helper virus (HV). Their replication, encapsidation, and movement depend on the HV. In this paper, we performed a global analysis of the satRNAs associated with different isolates of tomato black ring virus (TBRV). We checked the presence of satRNAs in 42 samples infected with TBRV, performed recombination and genetic diversity analyses, and examined the selective pressure affecting the satRNAs population. We identified 18 satRNAs in total that differed in length and the presence of point mutations. Moreover, we observed a strong effect of selection operating upon the satRNA population. We also constructed infectious cDNA clones of satRNA and examined the viral load of different TBRV isolates in the presence and absence of satRNAs, as well as the accumulation of satRNA molecules on infected plants. Our data provide evidence that the presence of satRNAs significantly affects viral load; however, the magnitude of this effect differs among viral isolates and plant hosts. We also showed a positive correlation between the number of viral genomic RNAs (gRNAs) and satRNAs for two analysed TBRV isolates.
