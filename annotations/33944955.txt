['33944955', 'Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact sites (ER-PM CS) play fundamental  roles in all eukaryotic cells. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking the ER-PM  protein tether synaptotagmin1 (SYT1) exhibit decreased PM integrity under  multiple abiotic stresses, such as freezing, high salt, osmotic stress, and  mechanical damage. Here, we show that, together with SYT1, the stress-induced  SYT3 is an ER-PM tether that also functions in maintaining PM integrity. The  ER-PM CS localization of SYT1 and SYT3 is dependent on PM  phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate and is regulated by abiotic stress. Lipidomic  analysis revealed that cold stress increased the accumulation of diacylglycerol  at the PM in a syt1/3 double mutant relative to wild-type while the levels of  most glycerolipid species remain unchanged. In addition, the SYT1-green  fluorescent protein fusion preferentially binds diacylglycerol in vivo with  little affinity for polar glycerolipids. Our work uncovers a SYT-dependent  mechanism of stress adaptation counteracting the detrimental accumulation of  diacylglycerol at the PM produced during episodes of abiotic stress.', '2021 Aug 13', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab122', 'ORCID:']
