['17158744', 'RNA silencing refers to small regulatory RNA-mediated processes that repress  endogenous gene expression and defend hosts from offending viruses. As an  anti-host defense mechanism, viruses encode suppressors that can block RNA  silencing pathways. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-encoded 2b protein was among the  first suppressors identified that could inhibit post-transcriptional gene  silencing (PTGS), but with little or no effect on miRNA functions. The mechanisms  underlying 2b suppression of RNA silencing are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that  the CMV 2b protein also interferes with miRNA pathways, eliciting developmental  anomalies partially phenocopying ago1 mutant alleles. In contrast to most  characterized suppressors, 2b directly interacts with Argonaute1 (AGO1) in vitro  and in vivo, and this interaction occurs primarily on one surface of the  PAZ-containing module and part of the PIWI-box of AGO1. Consistent with this  interaction, 2b specifically inhibits AGO1 cleavage activity in RISC  reconstitution assays. In addition, AGO1 recruits virus-derived small interfering  RNAs (siRNAs) in vivo, suggesting that AGO1 is a major factor in defense against  CMV infection. We conclude that 2b blocks AGO1 cleavage activity to inhibit miRNA  pathways, attenuate RNA silencing, and counter host defense. These findings  provide insight on the molecular arms race between host antiviral RNA silencing  and virus counterdefense.', '2006 Dec 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1495506', 'Chua']
