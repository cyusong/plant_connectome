Various phenolic compounds of sorghum are effective in the management of abiotic stress (salt, nutrients) and biotic stress (caused by birds, fungi and aphids). The health and industrial application of phenolics is mainly contributed by inherent antioxidant and nutraceutical potential. In a natural environment, plant growth is affected by various biotic and abiotic stresses. In every ecosystem, the presence of a wide range of harmful biological agents (bacteria, fungi, nematodes, mites, and insects) and undesirable environmental factors (drought, salinity, heat, excessive or low rainfall, etc.) may cause a heavy loss in crop productivity. Being sessile during evolution, plants have evolved multiple defense mechanisms against various types of microbial pathogens and environmental stresses. A plant's natural defense system produces some compounds named secondary metabolites, which include phenolics, terpenes, and nitrogen. The phenolic profile of grain sorghum, the least utilized staple crop, is unique, more diverse, and more abundant than in any other common cereal grain. It mainly contains phenolic acids, 3-deoxyanthocyanidins and condensed tannins. Sorghum polyphenols play a major role in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses and have many additional health benefits along with various industrial applications. The objective of this review is to discuss the phenolic compounds derived from grain sorghum and describe their role in plant defense, human health, and industrial applications.
