Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) is a low-abundance membrane lipid essential for plasma membrane function<sup>1,2</sup>. In plants, mutations in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) 5-kinases (PIP5K) suggest that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production is involved in development, immunity and reproduction<sup>3-5</sup>. However, phospholipid synthesis is highly intricate<sup>6</sup>. It is thus likely that steady-state depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> triggers confounding indirect effects. Furthermore, inducible tools available in plants allow PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to increase<sup>7-9</sup> but not decrease, and no PIP5K inhibitors are available. Here, we introduce iDePP (inducible depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plants), a system for the inducible and tunable depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plants in less than three hours. Using this strategy, we confirm that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is critical for various aspects of plant development, including root growth, root-hair elongation and organ initiation. We show that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is required to recruit various endocytic proteins, including AP2-µ, to the plasma membrane, and thus to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Finally, we find that inducible PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> perturbation impacts the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton as well as microtubule anisotropy. Together, we propose that iDePP is a simple and efficient genetic tool to test the importance of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in given cellular or developmental responses, and also to evaluate the importance of this lipid in protein localization.
