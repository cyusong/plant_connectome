The plant glutathione peroxidase (GPX) family consists of multiple isoenzymes with distinct subcellular locations which exhibit different tissue-specific expression patterns and environmental stress responses. Contrary to most of their counterparts in animal cells, plant GPXs contain cysteine instead of selenocysteine in their active site and while some of them have both glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin peroxidase functions, the thioredoxin regenerating system is much more efficient in vitro than the glutathione system. At present, the function of these enzymes in plants is not completely understood. The occurrence of thiol-dependent activities of plant GPX isoenzymes suggests that - besides detoxification of H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides - they may be involved in regulation of the cellular redox homeostasis by maintaining the thiol/disulfide or NADPH/NADP(+) balance. GPXs may represent a link existing between the glutathione- and the thioredoxin-based system. The various thiol buffers, including Trx, can affect a number of redox reactions in the cells most probably via modulation of thiol status. It is still required to identify the in vivo reductant for particular GPX isoenzymes and partners that GPXs interact with specifically. Recent evidence suggests that plant GPXs does not only protect cells from stress induced oxidative damage but they can be implicated in plant growth and development. Following a more general introduction, this study summarizes present knowledge on plant GPXs, highlighting the results on gene expression analysis, regulation and signaling of Arabidopsis thaliana GPXs and also suggests some perspectives for future research.
