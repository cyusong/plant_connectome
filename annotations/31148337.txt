The phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae delivers into host cells type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) that promote virulence. One virulence mechanism employed by T3SEs is to target hormone signaling pathways to perturb hormone homeostasis. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) influences interactions between various phytopathogens and their plant hosts, and has been shown to be a target of P. syringae T3SEs. In order to provide insight into how T3SEs manipulate ABA responses, we generated an ABA-T3SE interactome network (ATIN) between P. syringae T3SEs and Arabidopsis proteins encoded by ABA-regulated genes. ATIN consists of 476 yeast-two-hybrid interactions between 97 Arabidopsis ABA-regulated proteins and 56 T3SEs from four pathovars of P. syringae. We demonstrate that T3SE interacting proteins are significantly enriched for proteins associated with transcription. In particular, the ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (ERF) family of transcription factors is highly represented. We show that ERF105 and ERF8 displayed a role in defense against P. syringae, supporting our overall observation that T3SEs of ATIN converge on proteins that influence plant immunity. In addition, we demonstrate that T3SEs that interact with a large number of ABA-regulated proteins can influence ABA responses. One of these T3SEs, HopF3<sub>Pph6</sub> , inhibits the function of ERF8, which influences both ABA-responses and plant immunity. These results provide a potential mechanism for how HopF3<sub>Pph6</sub> manipulates ABA-responses to promote P. syringae virulence, and also demonstrate the utility of ATIN as a resource to study the ABA-T3SE interface.
