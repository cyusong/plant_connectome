Ubiquitination is an important post-translational protein modification. Although BROAD-COMPLEX, TRAMTRACK AND BRIC A BRAC and TRANSCRIPTION ADAPTOR PUTATIVE ZINC FINGER domain protein 2 (BT2) is involved in many biological processes, its role in apple (Malus domestic) root formation remains unclear. Here, we revealed that MdBT2 inhibits adventitious root (AR) formation through interacting with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR8 (MdARF8) and INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE3 (MdIAA3). MdBT2 facilitated MdARF8 ubiquitination and degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway and negatively regulated GRETCHEN HAGEN 3.1 (MdGH3.1) and MdGH3.6 expression. MdARF8 regulates AR formation through inducing transcription of MdGH3s (MdGH3.1, MdGH3.2, MdGH3.5, and MdGH3.6). In addition, MdBT2 facilitated MdIAA3 stability and slightly promoted its interaction with MdARF8. MdIAA3 inhibited AR formation by forming heterodimers with MdARF8 as well as other MdARFs (MdARF5, MdARF6, MdARF7, and MdARF19). Our findings reveal that MdBT2 acts as a negative regulator of AR formation in apple.
