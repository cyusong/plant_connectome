Glycerolipid synthesis in plants is coordinated between plastids and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A central step within the glycerolipid synthesis is the transport of phosphatidic acid from ER to chloroplasts. The chloroplast outer envelope protein TGD4 belongs to the LptD family conserved in bacteria and plants and selectively binds and may transport phosphatidic acid. We describe a second LptD-family protein in A. thaliana (atLPTD1; At2g44640) characterized by a barrel domain with an amino-acid signature typical for cyanobacterial LptDs. It forms a cation selective channel in vitro with a diameter of about 9 Å. atLPTD1 levels are induced under phosphate starvation. Plants expressing an RNAi construct against atLPTD1 show a growth phenotype under normal conditions. Expressing the RNAi against atLPTD1 in the tgd4-1 background renders the plants more sensitive to light stress or phosphate limitation than the individual mutants. Moreover, lipid analysis revealed that digalactosyldiacylglycerol and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol levels remain constant in the RNAi mutants under phosphate starvation, while these two lipids are enhanced in wild-type. Based on our results, we propose a function of atLPTD1 in the transport of lipids from ER to chloroplast under phosphate starvation, which is combinatory with the function of TGD4.
