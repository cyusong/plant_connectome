Plant growth and development are coordinalely controlled by several internal factors and environmental signals. To sense these environmental signals, the higher plants have evolved a complex signaling network, which may also cross talk with each other. Plants can respond to the signals as individual cells and as whole organisms. Various receptors including phytochromes, G-proteins coupled receptors (GPCR), kinase and hormone receptors play important role in signal transduction but very few have been characterized in plant system. The heterotrimeric G-proteins mediate the coupling of signal transduction from activated GPCR to appropriate downstream effectors and thereby play an important role in signaling. In this review we have focused on some of the recent work on G-proteins and two of the effectors, PLC and PLD, which have been shown to interact with Galpha subunit and also discussed their role in abiotic stress tolerance.
