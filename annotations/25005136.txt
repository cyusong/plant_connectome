['25005136', 'Plants acquire nitrogen in the form of amino acids from the soil, and transport  proteins located in the plasma membrane of root cells are required for this  process. It was found that the Arabidopsis lysine-histidine-like transporter LHT6  is expressed in root cells important for amino acid uptake, including the  epidermis, root hairs, and cortex. Transport studies with lht6 mutants using high  levels of amino acids demonstrated that LHT6 is in fact involved in amino acid  uptake. To determine if LHT6 plays a role in nitrogen acquisition at soil amino  acid concentrations, growth and uptake studies were performed with low levels of  toxic amino acid analogues and radiolabelled amino acids, respectively. In  addition, mutants of AAP1, another root amino acid transporter, and lht6/aap1  double mutants were examined. The results showed that LHT6 is involved in uptake  of acidic amino acids, glutamine and alanine, and probably phenylalanine. LHT6  seems not to transport basic or other neutral amino acids, or, alternatively,  other transporters might compensate for eliminated LHT6 function. Previous  studies suggested that AAP1 only takes up amino acids at high concentrations;  however, here it is demonstrated that the transporter functions in acquisition of  glutamate and neutral amino acids when present at soil concentrations. When  comparing the characterized root uptake systems, it appears that transporters  both with overlapping substrate specificity and with preference for specific  substrates are required to access the soil amino acid pool.', '2014 Oct', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eru278', 'Tegeder']
