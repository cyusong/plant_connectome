['23570231', 'Plants allocate an estimated 15-25% of their proteome to specialized metabolic  pathways that remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a genome mining  strategy for exploring such unknown pathways and demonstrate this approach for  triterpenoids by functionally characterizing three cytochrome P450s from  Arabidopsis thaliana . Building on proven methods for characterizing  oxidosqualene cyclases, we heterologously expressed in yeast known cyclases with  candidate P450s chosen from gene clustering and microarray coexpression patterns.  The yeast cultures produced mg/L amounts of plant metabolites in vivo without the  complex phytochemical background of plant extracts. Despite this simplification,  the product multiplicity and novelty overwhelmed analytical efforts by MS  methods. HSQC analysis overcame this problem. Side-by-side HSQC comparisons of  crude P450 extracts against a control resolved even minor P450 products among  ~100 other yeast metabolites spanning a dynamic range of >10,000:1. HSQC and  GC-MS then jointly guided purification and structure determination by classical  NMR methods. Including our present results for P450 oxidation of thalianol,  arabidiol, and marneral, the metabolic fate for most of the major triterpene  synthase products in Arabidopsis is now at least partially known.', '2013 Apr 17', 'J Am Chem Soc', '10.1021/ja401535g', 'Matsuda']
