Plant phosphate transporter (PT) genes comprise a large family with important roles in various physiological and biochemical processes. In this study, a database search yielded 26 potential PT family genes in rice (Oryza sativa). Analysis of these genes led to identification of eight conserved motifs and 5-12 trans-membrane segments, most of them conserved. A total of 237 putative cis elements were found in the 2-kb upstream region of these genes. Of these, a majority were Pi-response and other stress-related cis regulatory elements, such as PHO-like, TATA-box-like, PHR1, or Helix-loop-helix elements, and WRKY1 and ABRE elements, suggesting gene regulation by these signals. Comprehensive expression analysis of these genes was performed using data from microarrays hybridized with RNA from 27 tissues covering the entire lifecycle from three rice genotypes: Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and Shanyou 63. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that three rice PT genes are preferentially expressed in stamen at 1 d before flowering, two in panicle at the heading stage, and two in flag leaf at 14 d after the heading stage. Hormone-treatment experiments revealed differential up-regulation or down-regulation of 11 rice PT genes in seedlings exposed to five hormones, respectively. These results will be useful for elucidating the roles of these genes in the growth, development, and stress response of the rice plant.
