14-3-3 Proteins regulate many cellular processes by binding to phosphorylated proteins. Previous findings suggest a connection between three 14-3-3 isoforms and plant nutrient signaling. To better understand how these 14-3-3s regulate metabolism in response to changes in plant nutrient status, putative new targets involved in nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) metabolisms have been identified. The interactions between these 14-3-3s and multiple proteins involved in N and S metabolism and altered activity of the target proteins were confirmed in planta. Using a combination of methods, this work elucidates how 14-3-3s function as modulators of plant N and S metabolic pathways.
