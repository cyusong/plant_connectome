['26016527', "Water-soluble chlorophyll proteins (WSCPs) constitute a small family of unusual  chlorophyll (Chl)-binding proteins that possess a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor  domain. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a WSCP has been identified, named AtWSCP, that  forms complexes with Chl and the Chl precursor chlorophyllide (Chlide) in vitro.  AtWSCP exhibits a quite unexpected expression pattern for a Chl binding protein  and accumulated to high levels in the apical hook of etiolated plants. AtWSCP  expression was negatively light-regulated. Transgenic expression of AtWSCP fused  to green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that AtWSCP is localized to cell  walls/apoplastic spaces. Biochemical assays identified AtWSCP as interacting with  RD21 (responsive to desiccation 21), a granulin domain-containing cysteine  protease implicated in stress responses and defense. Reconstitution experiments  showed tight interactions between RD21 and WSCP that were relieved upon Chlide  binding. Laboratory feeding experiments with two herbivorous isopod crustaceans,  Porcellio scaber (woodlouse) and Armadillidium vulgare (pillbug), identified the  apical hook as Achilles' heel of etiolated plants and that this was protected by  RD21 during greening. Because Chlide is formed in the apical hook during seedling  emergence from the soil, our data suggest an unprecedented mechanism of herbivore  resistance activation that is triggered by light and involves AtWSCP.", '2015 Jun 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1507714112', 'Reinbothe']
