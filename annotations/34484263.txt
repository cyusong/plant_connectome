<i>Orobanche cumana</i> WALLR. is a host-specific root parasite of cultivated sunflowers with increasing economic importance in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. While sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) released from sunflower roots were identified as natural germination stimulants of <i>O. cumana</i> seeds in the soil, the chemical nature of the signals guiding the emerging germ tube toward the host root has remained unknown hitherto. Thus, we designed a bioassay that allowed the observation of broomrape germination and subsequent germ tube development in the presence of substances with putative chemotropic activity. Root exudates and sunflower oil extracts, both containing STLs in micromolar concentrations, caused the positive chemotropic orientation of germ tubes. A similar positive chemotropic effect was achieved with costunolide, one of the four STLs of sunflower present in the exudate and oil extracts. In contrast, GR24, a synthetic strigolactone (SL) with germination-inducing activity on <i>O. cumana</i> seeds, showed no effect on the germ tube orientation. The effect of costunolide was concentration-dependent and within the range of its natural micromolar occurrence in roots. We assume that an STL gradient is responsible for the stronger inhibition of elongation growth on the host-facing flank of the germ tube compared with the far side flank. This would confer a double role of STLs from sunflower root exudates in the sunflower-broomrape interaction, namely, as germination stimulants and as chemotropic signals.
