Chloroplasts mediate genetically controlled cell death via chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. To decipher the mechanism, we examined chloroplast-linked lesion-mimic mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) deficient in plastid division, thereby developing gigantic chloroplasts (GCs). These GC mutants, including <i>crumpled leaf</i> (<i>crl</i>), constitutively express immune-related genes and show light-dependent localized cell death (LCD), mirroring typical autoimmune responses. Our reverse genetic approach excludes any potential role of immune/stress hormones in triggering LCD. Instead, transcriptome and in silico analyses suggest that reactive electrophile species (RES) generated via oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or lipid peroxidation-driven signaling may induce LCD. Consistent with these results, the one of the suppressors of <i>crl</i>, <i>dubbed spcrl4</i>, contains a causative mutation in the nuclear gene encoding chloroplast-localized FATTY ACID DESATURASE5 (FAD5) that catalyzes the conversion of palmitic acid (16:0) to palmitoleic acid (16:1). The loss of FAD5 in the <i>crl</i> mutant might attenuate the levels of RES and/or lipid peroxidation due to the reduced levels of palmitic acid-driven PUFAs, which are prime targets of reactive oxygen species. The fact that <i>fad5</i> also compromises the expression of immune-related genes and the development of LCD in other GC mutants substantiates the presence of an intrinsic retrograde signaling pathway, priming the autoimmune responses in a FAD5-dependent manner.
