['26147117', 'Mitogen-activated dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases are important negative  regulators in the MAPK signalling pathways responsible for many essential  processes in plants. In a screen for mutants with reduced organ size we have  identified a mutation in the active site of the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase  indole-3-butyric acid-response5 (IBR5) that we named tinkerbell (tink) due to its  small size. Analysis of the tink mutant indicates that IBR5 acts as a novel  regulator of organ size that changes the rate of growth in petals and leaves.  Organ size and shape regulation by IBR5 acts independently of the KLU  growth-regulatory pathway. Microarray analysis of tink/ibr5-6 mutants identified  a likely role for this phosphatase in male gametophyte development. We show that  IBR5 may influence the size and shape of petals through auxin and TCP growth  regulatory pathways.', '2015', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0131103', 'Lenhard']
