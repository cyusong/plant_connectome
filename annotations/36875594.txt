The root is an important organ for plants to absorb water and nutrients. <i>In situ</i> root research method is an intuitive method to explore root phenotype and its change dynamics. At present, <i>in situ</i> root research, roots can be accurately extracted from <i>in situ</i> root images, but there are still problems such as low analysis efficiency, high acquisition cost, and difficult deployment of image acquisition devices outdoors. Therefore, this study designed a precise extraction method of <i>in situ</i> roots based on semantic segmentation model and edge device deployment. It initially proposes two data expansion methods, pixel by pixel and equal proportion, expand 100 original images to 1600 and 53193 respectively. It then presents an improved DeeplabV3+ root segmentation model based on CBAM and ASPP in series is designed, and the segmentation accuracy is 93.01%. The root phenotype parameters were verified through the Rhizo Vision Explorers platform, and the root length error was 0.669%, and the root diameter error was 1.003%. It afterwards designs a time-saving Fast prediction strategy. Compared with the Normal prediction strategy, the time consumption is reduced by 22.71% on GPU and 36.85% in raspberry pie. It ultimately deploys the model to Raspberry Pie, realizing the low-cost and portable root image acquisition and segmentation, which is conducive to outdoor deployment. In addition, the cost accounting is only $247. It takes 8 hours to perform image acquisition and segmentation tasks, and the power consumption is as low as 0.051kWh. In conclusion, the method proposed in this study has good performance in model accuracy, economic cost, energy consumption, etc. This paper realizes low-cost and high-precision segmentation of <i>in-situ</i> root based on edge equipment, which provides new insights for high-throughput field research and application of <i>in-situ</i> root.
