SBP-box (Squamosa-promoter binding protein) genes are a type of plant-specific transcription factor and play important roles in plant growth, signal transduction, and stress response. However, little is known about the role of pepper SBP-box transcription factor genes in response to abiotic stress. Here, one of the pepper SBP-box gene, <i>CaSBP12</i>, was selected and isolated from pepper genome database in our previous study. The <i>CaSBP12</i> gene was induced under salt stress. Silencing the <i>CaSBP12</i> gene enhanced pepper plant tolerance to salt stress. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of the detached leaves of <i>CaSBP12</i>-silenced plants was significantly lower than that of control plants. Besides, the Na<sup>+</sup>, malondialdehyde content, and conductivity were significantly increased in control plants than that in the <i>CaSBP12</i>-silenced plants. In addition, the <i>CaSBP12</i> over-expressed <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> plants were more susceptible to salt stress with higher damage severity index percentage and accumulation of ROS as compared to the wild-type. These results indicated that <i>CaSBP12</i> negatively regulates salt stress tolerance in pepper may relate to ROS signaling cascades.
