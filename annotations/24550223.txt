['24550223', 'The trade-off between growth and immunity is crucial for survival in plants.  However, the mechanism underlying growth-immunity balance has remained elusive.  The PRE-IBH1-HBI1 tripartite helix-loop-helix/basic helix-loop-helix module is  part of a central transcription network that mediates growth regulation by  several hormonal and environmental signals. Here, genome-wide analyses of HBI1  target genes show that HBI1 regulates both overlapping and unique targets  compared with other DNA binding components of the network in Arabidopsis  thaliana, supporting a role in specifying network outputs and fine-tuning  feedback regulation. Furthermore, HBI1 negatively regulates a subset of genes  involved in immunity, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) signals  repress HBI1 transcription. Constitutive overexpression and loss-of-function  experiments show that HBI1 inhibits PAMP-induced growth arrest, defense gene  expression, reactive oxygen species production, and resistance to pathogen. These  results show that HBI1, as a component of the central growth regulation circuit,  functions as a major node of crosstalk that mediates a trade-off between growth  and immunity in plants.', '2014 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.121111', 'Wang']
