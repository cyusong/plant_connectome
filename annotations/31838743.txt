Roots in flooded soils experience hypoxia, with the least O<sub>2</sub> in the vascular cylinder. Gradients in CO<sub>2</sub> across roots had not previously been measured. The respiratory quotient (RQ; CO<sub>2</sub> produced : O<sub>2</sub> consumed) is expected to increase as O<sub>2</sub> availability declines. A new CO<sub>2</sub> microsensor and an O<sub>2</sub> microsensor were used to measure profiles across roots of chickpea seedlings in aerated or hypoxic conditions. Simultaneous, nondestructive flux measurements of O<sub>2</sub> consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production, and thus RQ, were taken for roots with declining O<sub>2</sub> . Radial profiling revealed severe hypoxia and c. 0.8 kPa CO<sub>2</sub> within the root vascular cylinder. The distance penetrated by O<sub>2</sub> into the roots was shorter at lower O<sub>2</sub> . The gradient in CO<sub>2</sub> was in the opposite direction to that of O<sub>2</sub> , across the roots and diffusive boundary layer. RQ increased as external O<sub>2</sub> was lowered. For chickpea roots in solution at air equilibrium, O<sub>2</sub> was very low and CO<sub>2</sub> was elevated within the vascular cylinder; the extent of the severely hypoxic core increased as external O<sub>2</sub> was reduced. The increased RQ in roots in response to declining external O<sub>2</sub> highlighted the shift from respiration to ethanolic fermentation as the severely hypoxic/anoxic core became a progressively greater proportion of the root tissues.
