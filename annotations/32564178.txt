Plants are exposed to various environmental cues that lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. ROS production and detoxification are tightly regulated to maintain balance. Although studies of glucose (Glc) are always accompanied by ROS in animals, the role of Glc in respect of ROS in plants is unclear. We isolated gsm2 (Glc-hypersensitive mutant 2), a mutant with a notably chlorotic-cotyledon phenotype. The chloroplast-localized GSM2 was characterized as a transaldolase in the pentose phosphate pathway. With 3% Glc treatment, fewer or no thylakoids were observed in gsm2 cotyledon chloroplasts than in wild-type cotyledon chloroplasts, suggesting that GSM2 is required for chloroplast protection under stress. gsm2 also showed evaluated accumulation of ROS with 3% Glc treatment and was more sensitive to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than the wild type. Gene expression analysis of the antioxidant enzymes in gsm2 revealed that chloroplast damage to gsm2 cotyledons results from the accumulation of excessive ROS in response to Glc. Moreover, the addition of diphenyleneiodonium chloride or phenylalanine can rescue Glc-induced chlorosis in gsm2 cotyledons. This work suggests that GSM2 functions to maintain ROS balance in response to Glc during early seedling growth and sheds light on the relationship between Glc, the pentose phosphate pathway and ROS.
