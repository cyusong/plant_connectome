['29576081', 'The evolutionary conserved family of Selenoproteins performs redox-regulatory  functions in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Among them, members of the  SELENOPROTEIN O (SELO) subfamily are located in mammalian and yeast mitochondria,  but their functions are thus far enigmatic. Screening of T-DNA knockout mutants  for resistance to the proline analogue thioproline (T4C), identified mutant  alleles of the plant SELO homologue in Arabidopsis thaliana. Absence of SELO  resulted in a stress-induced transcriptional activation instead of silencing of  mitochondrial proline dehydrogenase, and also high elevation of  Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase involved in degradation of proline,  thereby alleviating T4C inhibition and lessening drought-induced proline  accumulation. Unlike its animal homologues, SELO was localized to chloroplasts of  plants ectopically expressing SELO-GFP. The protein was co-fractionated with  thylakoid membrane complexes, and co-immunoprecipitated with FNR, PGRL1 and STN7,  all involved in regulating PSI and downstream electron flow. The selo mutants  displayed extended survival under dehydration, accompanied by longer  photosynthetic activity, compared with wild-type plants. Enhanced expression of  genes encoding ROS scavenging enzymes in the unstressed selo mutant correlated  with higher oxidant scavenging capacity and reduced methyl viologen damage. The  study elucidates SELO as a PSI-related component involved in regulating ROS  levels and stress responses.', '2018 May', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.02.023', 'Zilberstein']
