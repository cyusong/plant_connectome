Although photosynthesis is essential to sustain life on Earth, not all plants use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. Holoparasitic plants, which are important in agricultural and natural ecosystems, are dependent on other plants for nutrients. Phytohormones are crucial in holoparasitic plant-host interactions, from seed germination to senescence, not only because they act as growth and developmental regulators, but also because of their central role in the regulation of host photosynthesis and source-sink relations between the host and the holoparasitic plant. Here, we compile and discuss current knowledge on the impact and ecophysiology of holoparasitic plants (such as the broomrapes Orobanche sp. and Phelipanche sp.) that infest economically important dicotyledonous crops in Mediterranean agroecosystems (legumes [Fabaceae], sunflowers [Helianthus sp.], or tomato [Solanum lycopersicum] plants). We also highlight the role of holoparasitic plant-host interactions (such as those between Cytinus hypocistis and various shrubs of the genus Cistus) in shaping natural Mediterranean ecosystems. The roles of phytohormones in controlling plant-host interactions, abiotic factors in parasitism, and the biological significance of natural seed banks and how dormancy and germination are regulated, will all be discussed. Holoparasitic plants are unique organisms; improving our understanding of their interaction with hosts as study models will help us to better manage parasitic plants, both in agricultural and natural ecosystems.
