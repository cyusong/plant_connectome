['19929878', 'An Arabidopsis thaliana mutant was identified as having increases in 12 of 20  free proteogenic amino acids in seeds. Because these metabolites are produced  from multiple, seemingly unrelated biosynthetic networks, it was not possible to  use a candidate gene approach to discover the enzyme defect responsible for this  complex syndrome. Complementary metabolite profiling analyses revealed increased  seed homomethionine and isovaleroyloxypropyl-glucosinolate, along with reduced  3-benzoyloxypropyl-glucosinolate. These data led to the discovery of impaired  branched chain amino acid catabolic enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (encoded  by gene At3g45300 or atIVD) as the cause of this metabolic syndrome. These  results indicate that catabolism plays an important role in regulating levels of  branched chain amino acids in seeds. The diverse set of metabolites affected in  the ivd1 mutants suggests the existence of a more complex network regulating seed  amino acid accumulation than previously observed. This combined targeted and  non-targeted metabolite profiling approach is broadly applicable to the  characterization of metabolic mutants, human disease studies and crop germplasm.', '2010 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04083.x', 'Last']
