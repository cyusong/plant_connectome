Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) is the most conserved transducer of the unfolded protein response that produces either adaptive or death signals depending on the amplitude and duration of its activation. Here, we report that SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 6 (SPL6)-deficient plants displayed hyperactivation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1, leading to cell death in rice panicles, indicating that SPL6 is an essential survival factor for the suppression of persistent or intense ER stress conditions. Importantly, knockdown of the hyperactivated mRNA level of IRE1 rescues panicle apical abortion in the spl6-1 transgenic plants harbouring the IRE1-RNAi constructs, establishing the genetic linkage between the hyperactivation of IRE1 and cell death in spl6-1. Our findings reveal a novel cell survival machinery in which SPL6 represses the transcriptional activation of the ER stress sensor IRE1 in control of ER stress signalling outputs that hinge on a balance between adaptive and death signals for determining cell fates during ER stress.

IRE1: !produces! adaptive or death signals 
SPL6: !suppresses! IRE1 
IRE1: !activates! cell death 
SPL6: !represses! transcriptional activation of IRE1 
IRE1: !controls! ER stress signalling outputs
