Gamete formation is an important step in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms. In flowering plants, haploid spores are formed after the meiotic division of spore mother cells. These spores develop into male and female gametophytes containing gametes after undergoing mitotic divisions. In the female, the megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis forming four megaspores, of which one is functional and three degenerate. The megaspore then undergoes three mitotic cycles thus generating an embryo sac with eight nuclei. The embryo sac undergoes cellularization to form the mature seven-celled female gametophyte. Entry into and progression through meiosis is essential for megasporogenesis and subsequent megagametogenesis, but control of this process is not well understood. FOUR LIPS (FLP) and its paralogue MYB88, encoding R2R3 MYB transcription factors, have been extensively studied for their role in limiting the terminal division in stomatal development by direct regulation of the expression of cell cycle genes. Here it is demonstrated that FLP and MYB88 also regulate female reproduction. Both FLP and MYB88 are expressed during ovule development and their loss significantly increases the number of ovules produced by the placenta. Despite the presence of excess ovules, single and double mutants exhibit reduced seed set due to reduced female fertility. The sterility results at least in part from defective meiotic entry and progression. Therefore, FLP and MYB88 are important regulators of entry into megasporogenesis, and probably act via the regulation of cell cycle genes.
