Full-length cDNAs are very important for genome annotation and functional analysis of genes. The number of full-length cDNAs from maize (Zea mays L.) remains limited. Here we report the construction of a full-length enriched cDNA library from osmotically stressed maize seedlings by using the modified CAP trapper method. From this library, 2073 full-length cDNAs were collected and further analyzed by sequencing from both the 5'- and 3'-ends. A total of 1728 (83.4%) sequences did not match known maize mRNA and full-length cDNA sequences in the GenBank database and represent new full-length genes. After alignment of the 2073 full-length cDNAs with 448 maize BAC sequences, it was found that 84 full-length cDNAs could be mapped to the BACs. Of these, 43 genes (51.2%) have been correctly annotated from the BAC clones, 37 genes (44.0%) have been annotated with a different exon-intron structure from our cDNA, and four genes (4.76%) had no annotations in the TIGR database. Expression analysis of 2073 full-length maize cDNAs using a cDNA macroarray led to the identification of 79 genes upregulated by stress treatments and 329 downregulated genes. Of the 79 stress-inducible genes, 30 genes contain ABRE, DRE, MYB, MYC core sequences or other abiotic-responsive cis-acting elements in their promoters. These results suggest that these cis-acting elements and the corresponding transcription factors take part in plant responses to osmotic stress either cooperatively or independently. Additionally, the data suggest that an ethylene signaling pathway may be involved in the maize response to drought stress.
