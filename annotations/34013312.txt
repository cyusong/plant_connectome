Heterosis occurs when the F1s outperform their parental lines for a trait. Reciprocal hybrids are obtained by changing the cross direction of parental genotypes. Both biological phenomena could affect the external and internal attributes of fleshy fruits. This work aimed to detect reciprocal effects and heterosis in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit quality traits and metabolite content. Twelve agronomic traits and 28 metabolites identified and estimated by 1H-NMR were evaluated in five cultivars grown in two environments. Given that the genotype component was more important than the phenotype, the traits were evaluated following a full diallel mating design among those cultivars, in a greenhouse. Hybrids showed a higher phenotypic diversity than parental lines. Interestingly, the metabolites, mainly amino acids, displayed more reciprocal effects and heterosis. Agronomic traits were more influenced by general combining ability (GCA) and metabolites by specific combining ability (SCA). Furthermore, the genetic distance between parental lines was not causally related to the occurrence of reciprocal effects or heterosis. Hybrids with heterosis and a high content of metabolites linked to tomato flavour and nutritious components were obtained. Our results highlight the impact of selecting a cultivar as male or female in a cross to enhance the variability of fruit attributes through hybrids as well as the possibility to exploit heterosis for fruit composition.
