An Arabidopsis thaliana leaf-variegated mutant yellow variegated2 (var2) results from loss of FtsH2, a major component of the chloroplast FtsH complex. FtsH is an ATP-dependent metalloprotease in thylakoid membranes and degrades several chloroplastic proteins. To understand the role of proteolysis by FtsH and mechanisms leading to leaf variegation, we characterized the second-site recessive mutation fu-gaeri1 (fug1) that suppressed leaf variegation of var2. Map-based cloning and subsequent characterization of the FUG1 locus demonstrated that it encodes a protein homologous to prokaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (cpIF2) located in chloroplasts. We show evidence that cpIF2 indeed functions in chloroplast protein synthesis in vivo. Suppression of leaf variegation by fug1 is observed not only in var2 but also in var1 (lacking FtsH5) and var1 var2. Thus, suppression of leaf variegation caused by loss of FtsHs is most likely attributed to reduced protein synthesis in chloroplasts. This hypothesis was further supported by the observation that another viable mutation in chloroplast translation elongation factor G also suppresses leaf variegation in var2. We propose that the balance between protein synthesis and degradation is one of the determining factors leading to the variegated phenotype in Arabidopsis leaves.
