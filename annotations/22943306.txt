Methionine (Met) in proteins can be oxidized to two diastereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide, Met-S-O and Met-R-O, which are reduced back to Met by two types of methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs), A and B, respectively. MSRs are generally supplied with reducing power by thioredoxins. Plants are characterized by a large number of thioredoxin isoforms, but those providing electrons to MSRs in vivo are not known. Three MSR isoforms, MSRA4, MSRB1 and MSRB2, are present in Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts. Under conditions of high light and long photoperiod, plants knockdown for each plastidial MSR type or for both display reduced growth. In contrast, overexpression of plastidial MSRBs is not associated with beneficial effects in terms of growth under high light. To identify the physiological reductants for plastidial MSRs, we analyzed a series of mutants deficient for thioredoxins f, m, x or y. We show that mutant lines lacking both thioredoxins y1 and y2 or only thioredoxin y2 specifically display a significantly reduced leaf MSR capacity (-25%) and growth characteristics under high light, related to those of plants lacking plastidial MSRs. We propose that thioredoxin y2 plays a physiological function in protein repair mechanisms as an electron donor to plastidial MSRs in photosynthetic organs.
