['9611176', 'A new mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that initiates flowering early and  terminates the inflorescence with floral structures has been identified and named  terminal flower2 (tfl2). While these phenotypes are similar to that of the  terminal flower1 (tfl1) mutant, tfl2 mutant plants are also dwarfed in  appearance, have reduced photoperiod sensitivity and have a more variable  terminal flower structure. Under long-day and short-day growth conditions tfl1  tfl2 double mutants terminate the inflorescence without development of lateral  flowers; thus, unlike tfl1 single mutants the double mutant inflorescence  morphology is not affected by day length. The enhanced phenotype of the double  mutant suggests that TFL2 acts in a developmental pathway distinct from TFL1. The  complex nature of the tfl2 single mutant phenotype suggests that TFL2 has a  regulatory role more global than that of TFL1. Double mutant analysis of tfl2 in  combination with mutant alleles of the floral meristem identity genes LEAFY and  APETALA1 demonstrates that TFL2 function influences developmental processes  controlled by APETALA1, but not those regulated by LEAFY. Thus, the TFL2 gene  product appears to have a dual role in regulating meristem activity, one being to  regulate the meristem response to light signals affecting the development of the  plant and the other being the maintenance of inflorescence meristem identity.', '1998 Jun', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/149.2.597', 'Meeks-Wagner']
