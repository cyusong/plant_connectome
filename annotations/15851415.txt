Initially linked to photosynthesis, regulation by change in the redox state of thiol groups (S-S<-- -->2SH) is now known to occur throughout biology. Thus, in addition to serving important structural and catalytic functions, it is recognized that, in many cases, disulphide bonds can be broken and reformed for regulation. Several systems, each linking a hydrogen donor to an intermediary disulphide protein, act to effect changes that alter the activity of target proteins by change in the thiol redox state. Pertinent to the present discussion is the chloroplast ferredoxin/thioredoxin system, comprised of photoreduced ferredoxin, a thioredoxin, and the enzyme ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, that occur in the stroma. In this system, thioredoxin links the activity of enzymes to light: those enzymes functional in biosynthesis are reductively activated by light via thioredoxin (S-S-->2SH), whereas counterparts acting in degradation are deactivated under illumination conditions and are oxidatively activated in the dark (2SH-->S-S). Recent research has uncovered a new paradigm in which an immunophilin, FKBP13, and potentially other enzymes of the chloroplast thylakoid lumen are oxidatively activated in the light (2SH-->S-S). The present review provides a perspective on this recent work.
