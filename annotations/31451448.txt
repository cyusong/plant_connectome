Complexes of diploid and polyploid species have formed frequently during the evolution of land plants. In false flax (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an important hexaploid oilseed crop closely related to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the putative parental species as well as the origin of other <i>Camelina</i> species remained unknown. By using bacterial artificial chromosome-based chromosome painting, genomic in situ hybridization, and multi-gene phylogenetics, we aimed to elucidate the origin and evolution of the polyploid complex. Genomes of diploid camelinas (<i>Camelina hispida</i>, <i>n</i> = 7; <i>Camelina laxa</i>, <i>n</i> = 6; and <i>Camelina neglecta</i>, <i>n</i> = 6) originated from an ancestral <i>n</i> = 7 genome. The allotetraploid genome of <i>Camelina rumelica</i> (<i>n</i> = 13, N<sup>6</sup>H) arose from hybridization between diploids related to <i>C. neglecta</i> (<i>n</i> = 6, N<sup>6</sup>) and <i>C. hispida</i> (<i>n</i> = 7, H), and the N subgenome has undergone a substantial post-polyploid fractionation. The allohexaploid genomes of <i>C. sativa</i> and <i>Camelina microcarpa</i> (<i>n</i> = 20, N<sup>6</sup>N<sup>7</sup>H) originated through hybridization between an auto-allotetraploid <i>C. neglecta</i>-like genome (<i>n</i> = 13, N<sup>6</sup>N<sup>7</sup>) and <i>C. hispida</i> (<i>n</i> = 7, H), and the three subgenomes have remained stable overall since the genome merger. Remarkably, the ancestral and diploid <i>Camelina</i> genomes were shaped by complex chromosomal rearrangements, resembling those associated with human disorders and resulting in the origin of genome-specific shattered chromosomes.plantcell;31/11/2596/FX1F1fx1.
