Litchi is an important evergreen fruit tree. Floral formation in litchi is induced by low temperatures (LTs). However, unstable flowering is a challenge for litchi production in times of global warming and climate change. Previous studies have shown that the methyl viologen dichloride hydrate-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) could promote flowering. Leaves in the panicles may affect the development of the inflorescence in litchi under high-temperature condition. In this study, potted litchi trees were transferred to growth chambers at LT and high temperature (HT). From a previous dataset of the RNA sequencing of the ROS-treated rudimentary leaves, a NAC transcription factor-encoding gene <i>LcNAC13</i> was identified. By genetic transformation of <i>LcNAC13</i> to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and tobacco, it was found that the ROS-induced senescence of the leaves was accelerated. Silencing <i>LcNAC13</i> by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) delayed ROS-dependent senescence. Our results suggested that <i>LcNAC13</i> regulates rudimentary leaf senescence. Our study provided a new target gene for the future molecular breeding of new cultivars that could flower under global warming conditions.
