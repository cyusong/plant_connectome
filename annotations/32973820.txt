Calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (<i>CIPKs</i>) play essential roles in plant abiotic stress response. In order to better understand salt tolerance, we cloned and analyzed the <i>NtCIPK9</i> gene from the halophyte <i>Nitraria tangutorum</i>. Phylogenetic analysis shows that <i>NtCIPK9</i> belongs to a sister clade with the <i>Arabidopsis AtCIPK9</i> gene and is thought to localize to the plasma membrane. <i>NtCIPK9</i> shows the highest expression level in the <i>Nitraria tangutorum</i> root under normal growth conditions, whereas after NaCl treatment, the highest expression was found in the blade. <i>NtCIPK9</i>-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants have a higher seed germination rate, longer root length, and displayed higher salt tolerance than wild type seedlings under salt stress conditions. Furthermore, <i>NtCIPK9</i> overexpression might enhance the expression of genes related to K<sup>+</sup> transportation after NaCl treatment. Thus, we conclude that <i>NtCIPK9</i> increases transgenic plant salt tolerance and reduces damage associated with salt stress by promoting the expression of genes controlling ion homeostasis. Our results suggest that <i>NtCIPK9</i> could serve as an ideal candidate gene to genetically engineer salt-tolerant plants.
