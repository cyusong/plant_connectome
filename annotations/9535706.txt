['9535706', 'Five different genes encoding isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) have  been identified in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. cDNA sequences encoding three  of these AAT isoenzymes, asp1 (mitochondrial), asp2 (cytosolic), and asp5  (plastid), were manipulated into bacterial expression vectors and the recombinant  proteins expressed were purified from liquid culture using conventional methods.  Yields of the purified isoenzymes varied from 11.5 mg/g wet wt cells (AAT5) to  0.95 mg/g wet wt cells (AAT2), an improvement of more than 1000-fold over typical  yields of native isoenzymes obtained from plant tissues of other species.  Analysis of the recombinant proteins on denaturing PAGE gels indicated subunit  Mrs of between 44 and 45 K. Kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) obtained for all  four substrates (aspartate, alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and oxaloacetate)  were consistent with values obtained for native AAT isoenzymes from other plant  species. Further characterization of the purified recombinant enzymes alongside  native enzymes from A. thaliana leaf tissue on AAT activity gels confirmed the  identity of asp1 and asp2 as the mitochondrial and cytosolic AAT genes but  indicated that asp5 may encode an amyloplastic rather than the chloroplastic  enzyme.', '1998 Apr', 'Protein Expr Purif', '10.1006/prep.1997.0845', 'Warren']
