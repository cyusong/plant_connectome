More and more studies on genetically modified plants are identifying parts of the genetic code with putative involvement in creating the cuticular barrier. Unfortunately, many of these studies suffer from the inadequacy of the chosen methods to quantify, in a reasonably unambiguous way, if and how the efficacy of the cuticular barrier is affected by the genetic change. A short overview of relevant findings is given and a more stringent experimental approach to quantifying effects on cuticular permeability in genetically modified plants proposed.

Gene: !affects! Cuticular Barrier
Gene: !localizes to! Cuticle
Gene: !interacts with! Cuticular Permeability
Gene: !enhances! Efficacy of Cuticular Barrier
Gene: !represses! Unambiguous Quantification
Gene: !synthesizes! Experimental Approach
