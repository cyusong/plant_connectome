For survival, plants have to efficiently adjust their phenotype to environmental challenges, finely coordinating their responses to balance growth and defence. Such phenotypic plasticity can be modulated by their associated microbiota. The widespread mycorrhizal symbioses modify plant responses to external stimuli, generally improving the resilience of the symbiotic system to environmental stresses. Phytohormones, central regulators of plant development and immunity, are instrumental in orchestrating plant responses to the fluctuating environment, but also in the regulation of mycorrhizal symbioses. Exciting advances in the molecular regulation of phytohormone signalling are providing mechanistic insights into how plants coordinate their responses to environmental cues and mycorrhizal functioning. Here, we summarize how these mechanisms permit the fine-tuning of the symbiosis according to the ever-changing environment.

mycorrhizal symbiosis: !modifies! plant responses
phytohormones: !regulate! plant development and immunity
