Biotic and abiotic cues can trigger priming in plants, which enables plants to respond to subsequent challenge with stronger and/or faster responses. It is well known that herbivory activates defense-related responses in systemic leaves. However, little is known about whether insect feeding activates priming in systemic leaves. To determine whether and how herbivory induces priming in maize systemic leaves, a combination of insect bioassays, phytohormone and defense metabolite quantification, and genetic and transcriptome analyses were performed. Actual and simulated Mythimna separata herbivory in maize local leaves primed the systemic leaves for enhanced accumulation of jasmonic acid and benzoxazinoids and increased resistance to M. separata. Activation of priming in maize systemic leaves depends on both the duration of simulated herbivory and perception of M. separata oral secretions in the local leaves, and genetic analysis indicated that jasmonic acid and benzoxazinoids mediate the primed defenses in systemic leaves. Consistently, in response to simulated herbivory, the primed systemic leaves exhibited a large number of genes that were uniquely regulated or showed further up- or down-regulation compared with the non-primed systemic leaves. This study provides new insight into the regulation and ecological function of priming in maize.
