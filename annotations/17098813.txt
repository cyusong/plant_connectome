['17098813', 'S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) is formed exclusively in the cytosol but plays a major  role in plastids; SAM can either act as a methyl donor for the biogenesis of  small molecules such as prenyllipids and macromolecules or as a regulator of the  synthesis of aspartate-derived amino acids. Because the biosynthesis of SAM is  restricted to the cytosol, plastids require a SAM importer. However, this  transporter has not yet been identified. Here, we report the molecular and  functional characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana gene designated SAM  TRANSPORTER1 (SAMT1), which encodes a plastid metabolite transporter required for  the import of SAM from the cytosol. Recombinant SAMT1 produced in yeast cells,  when reconstituted into liposomes, mediated the counter-exchange of SAM with SAM  and with S-adenosylhomocysteine, the by-product and inhibitor of transmethylation  reactions using SAM. Insertional mutation in SAMT1 and virus-induced gene  silencing of SAMT1 in Nicotiana benthamiana caused severe growth retardation in  mutant plants. Impaired function of SAMT1 led to decreased accumulation of  prenyllipids and mainly affected the chlorophyll pathway. Biochemical analysis  suggests that the latter effect represents one prominent example of the multiple  events triggered by undermethylation, when there is decreased SAM flux into  plastids.', '2006 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.040741', 'Camara']
