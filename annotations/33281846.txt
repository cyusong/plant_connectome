Accurate phenotype prediction of quantitative traits is paramount to enhanced plant research and breeding. Here, we report the accurate prediction of cotton fiber length, a typical quantitative trait, using 474 cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> ssp.) fiber length (<i>GFL</i>) genes and nine prediction models. When the SNPs/InDels contained in 226 of the <i>GFL</i> genes or the expressions of all 474 <i>GFL</i> genes was used for fiber length prediction, a prediction accuracy of <i>r</i> = 0.83 was obtained, approaching the maximally possible prediction accuracy of a quantitative trait. This has improved by 116%, the prediction accuracies of the fiber length thus far achieved for genomic selection using genome-wide random DNA markers. Moreover, analysis of the <i>GFL</i> genes identified 125 of the <i>GFL</i> genes that are key to accurate prediction of fiber length, with which a prediction accuracy similar to that of all 474 <i>GFL</i> genes was obtained. The fiber lengths of the plants predicted with expressions of the 125 key <i>GFL</i> genes were significantly correlated with those predicted with the SNPs/InDels of the above 226 SNP/InDel-containing <i>GFL</i> genes (<i>r</i> = 0.892, <i>P</i> = 0.000). The prediction accuracies of fiber length using both genic datasets were highly consistent across environments or generations. Finally, we found that a training population consisting of 100-120 plants was sufficient to train a model for accurate prediction of a quantitative trait using the genes controlling the trait. Therefore, the genes controlling a quantitative trait are capable of accurately predicting its phenotype, thereby dramatically improving the ability, accuracy, and efficiency of phenotype prediction and promoting gene-based breeding in cotton and other species.
