['15695432', 'We characterized the pcb2 (pale-green and chlorophyll b reduced 2) mutant. We  found through electron microscopic observation that chloroplasts of pcb2  mesophyll cells lacked distinctive grana stacks. High-performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the pcb2 mutant accumulated divinyl  chlorophylls, and the relative amount of divinyl chlorophyll b was remarkably  less than that of divinyl chlorophyll a. The responsible gene was mapped in an  area of 190 kb length at the upper arm of the 5th chromosome, and comparison of  DNA sequences revealed a single nucleotide substitution causing a nonsense  mutation in At5g18660. Complementation analysis confirmed that the wild-type of  this gene suppressed the phenotypes of the mutation. Antisense transformants of  the gene also accumulated divinyl chlorophylls. The genes homologous to At5g18660  are conserved in a broad range of species in the plant kingdom, and have  similarity to reductases. Our results suggest that the PCB2 product is divinyl  protochlorophyllide 8-vinyl reductase.', '2005 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pci053', 'Hayashida']
