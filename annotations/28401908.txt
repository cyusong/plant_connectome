['28401908', 'Small RNAs are important regulators for a variety of biological processes,  including leaf development, flowering-time, embryogenesis and defense responses.  miR163 is a non-conserved miRNA and its locus has evolved recently through  inverted duplication of its target genes to which they belong to the SABATH  family of related small-molecule methyltransferases (MTs). In Arabidopsis  thaliana, previous study demonstrated that miR163 accumulation was induced by  alamethicin treatment, suggesting its roles in defense response pathways.  Enhanced resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) was observed in  the mir163 mutant, whereas transgenic lines overexpressing miR163 showed increase  sensitivity to Pst, suggesting that miR163 is a negative regulator of defense  response. Elevated level of miR163 and its targets in A. thaliana were observed  upon Pst treatment, suggesting a modulating relationship between miR163 and its  targets. In addition, miR163 and histone deacetylase were found to act  cooperatively in mediating defense against Pst. Transgenic plants overexpressing  miR163-resistant targets suggested their different contributions in defense.  Results from this study revealed that the stress-inducible miR163 and its targets  act in concert to modulate defense responses against bacterial pathogen in A.  thaliana.', '2017 Apr 12', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep46433', 'Ng']
