Secondary metabolites are produced by plants and are classified based on their chemical structure or the biosynthetic routes through which they are synthesized. Among them, flavonoids, including anthocyanins and pro-anthocyanidins (PAs), are abundant in leaves, flowers, fruits, and seed coats in plants. The anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway has been intensively studied, but the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin transport from the synthesis site to the storage site needs attention. Although the major transporters are well defined yet, the redundancy of these transporters for structurally similar or dis-similar anthocyanins motivates additional research. Herein, we reviewed the role of membrane transporters involved in anthocyanin transport, including ATP-binding cassette, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE), Bilitranslocase-homolog (BTL), and vesicle-mediated transport. We also highlight the ability of transporters to cater distinct anthocyanins or their chemically-modified forms with overlapping transport mechanisms and sequestration into the vacuoles. Our understanding of the anthocyanin transporters could provide anthocyanin-rich crops and fruits with a benefit on human health at a large scale.
