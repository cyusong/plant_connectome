['10417387', 'Plants produce new appendages reiteratively from groups of stem cells called  shoot apical meristems. LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) are pivotal for the switch  to the reproductive phase, where instead of leaves the shoot apical meristem  produces flowers. Use of steroid-inducible activation of LFY demonstrated that  early expression of AP1 is a result of transcriptional induction by LFY. This AP1  induction is independent of protein synthesis and occurs specifically in the  tissues and at the developmental stage in which floral fate is assumed. Later  expression of AP1 appears to be only indirectly affected by LFY.', '1999 Jul 23', 'Science', '10.1126/science.285.5427.582', 'Meyerowitz']
