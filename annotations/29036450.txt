The participation of nitric oxide (NO) in the responses of plants towards biotic and abiotic stresses is well established. However, the mechanism involved particularly in cold acclimation-induced chilling tolerance remains elusive. Here we show the cold acclimation induced-chilling tolerance was associated with inductions of nitrate reductase (NR)-dependent NO production, S-nitrosylated glutathione reductase (GSNOR) activity and mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK1/2 activation in tomato plants. Silencing of NR resulted in decreased GSNOR activity and MPK1/2 activation, which subsequently compromised cold acclimation-induced chilling tolerance. By contrast, silencing of GSNOR caused decreased NR activity, increased NO accumulation and MPK1/2 activation, and enhanced cold acclimation-induced chilling tolerance. Furthermore, co-silencing of MPK1 and MPK2 attenuated the NR-dependent NO production and cold acclimation-induced tolerance to chilling. Results from present study suggest the importance of MPK1/2 for the induction of NR-dependent NO generation, while the accumulation of nitrosylated glutathione from NO-derived reactive nitrogen species could potentially S-nitrosylate NR. These findings provide new insight into the crosstalk of NO and MPK1/2 in cold acclimation-induced chilling tolerance in tomato plants.
