The relationship between coleoptile elongation and ethanolic fermentation was investigated in rice (Oryza sativa L.) coleoptiles of four cultivars subjected to a 48-h anoxic stress. The coleoptile elongation of all cultivars was suppressed by anoxic stress; however, the elongation of cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare was much greater than that of cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi. The stress did not significantly increase lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity or lactate concentration, but increased alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activities, as well as ethanol concentration in the coleoptiles of all cultivars. The elevated ADH and PDC activities and ethanol concentration in cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare were much greater than those of cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi, suggesting that ethanolic fermentation is likely more active in cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare than in cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi. ATP concentration in cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare in anoxia was also greater than that in cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi in anoxia. The ethanol concentration in the coleoptiles was correlated with anoxia tolerance with respect to the ATP concentration and coleoptile elongation. These results suggest that the ability to increase ethanolic fermentation may be one of the determinants in anoxia tolerance of rice coleoptiles.
