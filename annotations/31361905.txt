Differentiated sex chromosomes are thought to develop through the accumulation of polymorphisms at loci subject to opposing selection between males and females, and/or between haploids and diploids. As sex chromosomes differentiate, reduced recombination becomes favored between selected loci and the sex-determining region, strengthening genetic associations between alleles favored in a sex and the corresponding sex chromosome. Here a model is analyzed to explore whether polymorphism at one sexually or ploidally antagonistic locus facilitates the spread of rare alleles at other loci experiencing antagonistic selection, promoting further differentiation of the sex chromosomes. It is found that antagonistic polymorphisms can spread and capture other such loci, building 'genomic islands' of differentiation on sex chromosomes, but the conditions are very restrictive, requiring the loci to be strongly selected, tightly linked and distant from the sex-determining region. Epistatic interactions can facilitate the promotion of polymorphism among selected loci, but only if preferentially favoring heterozygotes. Although these results apply to any taxa, plants provide a fertile ground for testing these and related theories given the recurrent evolutionary transitions to dioecy, which provide multiple opportunities to track the early evolution of sex chromosomes.

Opposing selection: !facilitates! Spread of rare alleles
Selected loci: !build! 'Genomic islands' of differentiation
Strongly selected loci: !required for! Spread of polymorphism
Epistatic interactions: !favor! Heterozygotes 
Dioecy: !provides! Multiple opportunities to track early evolution of sex chromosomes
