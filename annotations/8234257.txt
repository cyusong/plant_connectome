['8234257', 'By screening an Arabidopsis expression library with an antiserum against  chloroplast envelope proteins, we have isolated a partial cDNA with an open  reading frame that encodes a polypeptide similar to P-type cation-transporting  ATPases. The corresponding genomic clone was isolated and the complete coding  sequence was deduced after identification and mapping of introns. The gene has  been designated PEA1 (plastid envelope ATPase) and the predicted polypeptide  PEA1p. PEA1p has 946 amino acids and a molecular mass of 104 kDa. This protein is  40-44% identical to various mammalian plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases but lacks  the C-terminal calmodulin binding domain present in the mammalian polypeptides.  When aligned with mammalian plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases, PEA1p has a 70- to  80-amino acid N-terminal region that extends beyond the N terminus of these  enzymes. This extension has some similarity to the transit peptide of the plastid  envelope phosphate translocator and may function to target the protein to the  plastid. Antibodies raised against a portion of PEA1p recognize a single 90- to  95-kDa polypeptide in chloroplast inner envelope preparations. Transcript  abundance as determined by RNase protection was found to be 7- to 9-fold higher  in roots than in leaves. Possible roles for a plastid envelope calcium pump are  suggested.', '1993 Nov 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.90.21.10066', 'Hoffman']
