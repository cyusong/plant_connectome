Rice (Oryza sativa) is a leading source of dietary cadmium (Cd), a non-essential heavy metal that poses a serious threat to human health. There are significant variations in grain-Cd levels in natural rice populations, which make the breeding of low-Cd rice a cost-effective way to mitigate grain-Cd accumulation. However, the genetic factors that regulate grain-Cd accumulation have yet to be fully established, thereby hindering the development of low-Cd varieties. Here, we reported a low-Cd quantitative trait locus, CF1, that has the potential to reduce Cd accumulation in rice grains. CF1 is allelic to the metal transporter OsYSL2, which transports Fe from the roots to the shoots. However, it is incapable of binding Cd, and thus, reduces grain-Cd levels indirectly rather than directly in the form of upward delivery. Further analysis showed that high expression levels of CF1 improve Fe nutrition in the shoots, subsequently inhibiting Cd uptake by systemically inhibiting expression of the main Cd uptake gene OsNramp5 in the roots. Compared with the CF1 allele from '02428' (CF1<sup>02428</sup> ), higher expression levels of CF1 from 'TQ' (CF1<sup>TQ</sup> ) increased the Fe contents and decreased Cd levels in rice grains. In natural rice populations, CF1<sup>TQ</sup> was found to be a minor allele, while CF1<sup>02428</sup> is present in most japonica rice, suggesting that CF1<sup>TQ</sup> could be widely integrated into the japonica rice genome to generate low-Cd varieties. Overall, these results broaden our mechanistic understanding of the natural variation in grain-Cd accumulation, supporting marker-assisted selection of low-Cd rice.
