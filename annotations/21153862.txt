Glycine max L. Merr. (soybean) resistance to Heterodera glycines Ichinohe occurs at the site of infection, a nurse cell known as the syncytium. Resistance is classified into two cytologically-defined responses, the G. max ([Peking])- and G. max ([PI 88788])-types. Each type represents a cohort of G. max genotypes. Resistance in G. max ([Peking]) occurs by a potent and rapid localized response, affecting parasitic second stage juveniles (p-J2). In contrast, resistance occurs by a potent but more prolonged reaction in the genotype G. max ([PI 88788]) that affects nematode development at the J3 and J4 stages. Microarray analyses comparing these cytologically and developmentally distinct resistant reactions reveal differences in gene expression in pericycle and surrounding cells even before infection. The differences include higher relative levels of the differentially expressed in response to arachidonic acid 1 gene (DEA1 [Gm-DEA1]) (+224.19-fold) and a protease inhibitor (+68.28-fold) in G. max ([Peking/PI 548402]) as compared to G. max ([PI 88788]). Gene pathway analyses compare the two genotypes (1) before, (2) at various times during, (3) constitutively throughout the resistant reaction and (4) at all time points prior to and during the resistant reaction. The amplified levels of transcriptional activity of defense genes may explain the rapid and potent reaction in G. max ([Peking/PI 548402]) as compared to G. max ([PI 88788]). In contrast, the shared differential expression levels of genes in G. max ([Peking/PI 548402]) and G. max ([PI 88788]) may indicate a conserved genomic program underlying the G. max resistance on which the genotype-specific gene expression programs are built off.
