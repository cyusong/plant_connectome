['16616142', 'We report the biochemical characterization in Xenopus oocytes of the Arabidopsis  thaliana membrane protein, STP13, as a high affinity, hexose-specific  H(+)-symporter. Studies with kinase activators suggest that it is negatively  regulated by phosphorylation. STP13 promoter GFP reporter lines show GFP  expression only in the vascular tissue in emerging petals under non-stressed  conditions. Quantitative PCR and the pSTP13-GFP plants show induction of STP13 in  programmed cell death (PCD) obtained by treatments with the fungal toxin  fumonisin B1 and the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. A role for STP13 in PCD is  supported by microarray data from e.g. plants undergoing senescence and a strong  correlation between STP13 transcripts and the PCD phenotype in different  accelerated cell death (acd11) mutants.', '2006 Apr 17', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.03.064', 'Halkier']
