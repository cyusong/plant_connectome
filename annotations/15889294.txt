['15889294', 'A T-DNA tagged mutant line of Arabidopsis thaliana, produced with a promoter trap  vector carrying a promoterless gus (uidA) as a reporter gene, showed GUS  induction in response to mechanical wounding. Cloning of the chromosomal DNA  flanking the T-DNA revealed that the insert had caused a knockout mutation in a  PTR-type peptide transporter gene named At5g46050 in GenBank, here renamed  AtPTR3. The gene and the deduced protein were characterized by molecular  modelling and bioinformatics. Molecular modelling of the protein with fold  recognition identified 12 transmembrane spanning regions and a large loop between  the sixth and seventh helices. The structure of AtPTR3 resembled the other  PTR-type transporters of plants and transporters in the major facilitator  superfamily. Computer analysis of the AtPTR3 promoter suggested its expression in  roots, leaves and seeds, complex hormonal regulation and induction by abiotic and  biotic stresses. The computer-based hypotheses were tested experimentally by  exposing the mutant plants to amino acids and several stress treatments. The  AtPTR3 gene was induced by the amino acids histidine, leucine and phenylalanine  in cotyledons and lower leaves, whereas a strong induction was obtained in the  whole plant upon exposure to salt. Furthermore, the germination frequency of the  mutant line was reduced on salt-containing media, suggesting that the AtPTR3  protein is involved in stress tolerance in seeds during germination.', '2005 Jun', 'J Mol Model', '10.1007/s00894-005-0257-6', 'Pirhonen']
