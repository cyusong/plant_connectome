Cold stress is an adverse stimulus that affects plant growth and development, and the C-repeat binding factor (CBF) cold-regulatory cascade has been regarded as a master regulator in the plant response to cold stress. Here, we showed that a NAC transcription factor modulated low-temperature tolerance. MdNAC029/MdNAP, an apple NAC gene was isolated and its role in regulating cold tolerance was investigated. MdNAC029 was responsive to low-temperature treatment, and over-expression of MdNAC029 reduced cold tolerance in apple calli and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, EMSA assays and transient expression assays demonstrated that MdNAC029 directly repressed the expression of MdCBF1 and MdCBF4 by binding to their promoters. Taken together, our data suggest that MdNAC029 functions as a negative regulator in regulating plant cold tolerance in a CBF-dependent manner, providing a deeper understanding of NAC transcription-factor-mediated cold tolerance.
