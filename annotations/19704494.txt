A common fate of post-mitotic interphase plant nuclei is morphological differentiation into an array of shapes and sizes. Development of nuclear morphology occurs in a cell-specific manner and is influenced by cell shape and nuclear DNA content. The LINC (LITTLE NUCLEI) proteins are plant-specific nuclear coiled-coil proteins that appear to couple nuclear development to cellular (shape) and nuclear (DNA content) cues. linc mutations cause a variety of defects, including smaller more spherical nuclei and whole-plant dwarfing. Supplementing our previous results, we constructed transgenic plants expressing LINC1-GFP from the native promoter and found that LINC1 is predominantly expressed in proliferating tissues. Moreover, LINC1-GFP signal was found to be concentrated at the nuclear periphery. These results suggest that LINC1 plays an important structural role at an early stage in nuclear development.
