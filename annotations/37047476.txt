Lupin is a high-protein legume crop that grows in a wide range of edaphoclimatic conditions where other crops are not viable. Its unique seed nutrient profile can promote health benefits, and it has been proposed as a phytoremediation plant. Most rhizobia nodulating <i>Lupinus</i> species belong to the genus <i>Bradyrhizobium,</i> comprising strains that are phylogenetically related to <i>B. cytisi, B. hipponenese, B. rifense, B. iriomotense/B. stylosanthis, B. diazoefficiens, B. japonicum, B. canariense/B. lupini</i>, and <i>B. retamae/B. valentinum</i>. Lupins are also nodulated by fast-growing bacteria within the genera <i>Microvirga</i>, <i>Ochrobactrum</i>, <i>Devosia</i>, <i>Phyllobacterium, Agrobacterium, Rhizobium</i>, and <i>Neorhizobium</i>. Phylogenetic analyses of the <i>nod</i> and <i>nif</i> genes, involved in microbial colonization and symbiotic nitrogen fixation, respectively, suggest that fast-growing lupin-nodulating bacteria have acquired their symbiotic genes from rhizobial genera other than <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>. Horizontal transfer represents a key mechanism allowing lupin to form symbioses with bacteria that were previously considered as non-symbiotic or unable to nodulate lupin, which might favor lupin's adaptation to specific habitats. The characterization of yet-unstudied <i>Lupinus</i> species, including microsymbiont whole genome analyses, will most likely expand and modify the current lupin microsymbiont taxonomy, and provide additional knowledge that might help to further increase lupin's adaptability to marginal soils and climates.
