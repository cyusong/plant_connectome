High mobility group (HMG) proteins of the HMGB family containing a highly conserved HMG box are chromatin-associated proteins that interact with DNA and nucleosomes and catalyze changes in DNA topology, thereby facilitating important DNA-dependent processes. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes 15 different HMG-box proteins that are further subdivided into four groups: HMGB-type proteins, ARID-HMG proteins, 3xHMG proteins that contain three HMG boxes and the structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1). Typically, HMGB proteins are localized exclusively to the nucleus, like Arabidopsis HMGB1 and B5. However, these Arabidopsis HMGB proteins showed a very high mobility within the nuclear compartment. Recent studies revealed that Arabidopsis HMGB2/3 and B4 proteins are predominantly nuclear but also exist in the cytoplasm, suggesting an as yet unknown cytoplasmic function of these chromosomal HMG proteins.
