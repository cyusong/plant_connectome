The crinkled leaves8 (cls8) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana displays a developmental phenotype of abnormal leaf and flower morphology, reduced root growth and bleached leaf sections. Map-based cloning identified the mutation as being within the gene encoding the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR1), the enzyme that catalyses the rate-limiting step in the production of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) for DNA synthesis and repair. Levels of dTTP and dATP were significantly reduced in cls8. Two further mutant cls8 alleles and cls8::RNAi plants show similar or more severe phenotypes. The cls8-1 mutant has fewer copies of the chloroplast genome, and fewer, larger chloroplasts than wild-type plants. The ultrastructure of the chloroplast, however, appears normal in cls8-1 leaves. We present evidence that, under conditions of limited dNTP supply, the inhibition of chloroplast DNA replication may be the primary factor in inducing aberrant growth.
