Understanding how the distinct cell types of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) withstand ultraviolet radiation (UVR) stress can improve cultivation of plants in high-UVR environments. Here, we show that UV-B irradiation selectively kills epidermal and niche cells in the shoot apex. Plants harboring a mutation in <i>DECREASE WAX BIOSYNTHESIS</i> (<i>DEWAX</i>) are tolerant to UV-B. Our data show that DEWAX negatively regulates genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) binds to the <i>DEWAX</i> promoter elements and represses its expression to promote the anthocyanin biosynthesis. The HY5-DEWAX regulatory network regulates anthocyanin content in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and influences the survivability of plants under UV-B irradiation stress. Our cell sorting-based study of the epidermal cell layer transcriptome confirms that core UV-B stress signaling pathway genes are conserved and upregulated in response to UV-B irradiation of the SAM. Furthermore, we show that UV-B induces genes involved in shoot development and organ patterning. We propose that the HY5-DEWAX regulatory relationship is conserved; however, changes in the expression levels of these genes can determine anthocyanin content in planta and, hence, fitness under UV-B irradiation stress.
