['22033332', "Ribonuclease J is an essential enzyme, and the Bacillus subtilis ortholog  possesses both endoribonuclease and 5' --> 3' exoribonuclease activities.  Chloroplasts also contain RNase J, which has been postulated to participate, as  both an exo- and endonuclease, in the maturation of polycistronic mRNAs. Here we  have examined recombinant Arabidopsis RNase J and found both 5' --> 3'  exoribonuclease and endonucleolytic activities. Virus-induced gene silencing was  used to reduce RNase J expression in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana,  leading to chlorosis but surprisingly few disruptions in the cleavage of  polycistronic rRNA and mRNA precursors. In contrast, antisense RNAs accumulated  massively, suggesting that the failure of chloroplast RNA polymerase to terminate  effectively leads to extensive symmetric transcription products that are normally  eliminated by RNase J. Mung bean nuclease digestion and polysome analysis  revealed that this antisense RNA forms duplexes with sense strand transcripts and  prevents their translation. We conclude that a major role of chloroplast RNase J  is RNA surveillance to prevent overaccumulation of antisense RNA, which would  otherwise exert deleterious effects on chloroplast gene expression.", '2011 Dec', 'RNA', '10.1261/rna.028043.111', 'Stern']
