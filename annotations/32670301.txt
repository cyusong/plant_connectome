Nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule, participates in defense responses during plant-pathogen interactions. <i>S</i>-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is found to be an active intracellular NO storage center and regulated by <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in plants. However, the role of GSNOR in NO-induced disease resistance is not clear. In this research, the effects of NO and GSNOR inhibitor (N6022) on the defense response of harvested peach fruit to <i>Monilinia fructicola</i> infection were investigated. It was found that the disease incidence and lesion diameter of peach fruits were markedly (<i>P</i> < 0.05) reduced by NO and GSNOR inhibitor. However, the expression of <i>GSNOR</i> was significantly inhibited (<i>P</i> < 0.05) by NO only during 2-6 h. Analyses using iodo-TMT tags to detect the nitrosylation sites of GSNOR revealed that the sulfhydryl group of the 85-cysteine site was nitrosylated after NO treatment in peach fruit at 6 and 12 h, suggesting that exogenous NO enhances disease resistance via initial inhibition of gene expression and the <i>S</i>-nitrosylation of GSNOR, thereby inhibiting GSNOR activity. Moreover, NO and GSNOR inhibitor enhanced the expression of systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-related genes, such as pathogenesis-related gene 1 (<i>PR1</i>), nonexpressor of <i>PR1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), and TGACG-binding factor 1 (<i>TGA1</i>). These results demonstrated that <i>S</i>-nitrosylation of GSNOR protein and inhibition of GSNOR activity contributed to the enhanced disease resistance in fruit.
