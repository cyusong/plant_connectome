['19452453', 'In eukaryotes, 14-3-3 dimers regulate hundreds of functionally diverse proteins  (clients), typically in phosphorylation-dependent interactions. To uncover new  clients, 14-3-3 omega (At1g78300) from Arabidopsis was engineered with a "tandem  affinity purification" tag and expressed in transgenic plants. Purified complexes  were analyzed by tandem MS. Results indicate that 14-3-3 omega can dimerize with  at least 10 of the 12 14-3-3 isoforms expressed in Arabidopsis. The  identification here of 121 putative clients provides support for in vivo 14-3-3  interactions with a diverse array of proteins, including those involved in: (i)  Ion transport, such as a K(+) channel (GORK), a Cl(-) channel (CLCg), Ca(2+)  channels belonging to the glutamate receptor family (1.2, 2.1, 2.9, 3.4, 3.7);  (ii) hormone signaling, such as ACC synthase (isoforms ACS-6, -7 and -8 involved  in ethylene synthesis) and the brassinolide receptors BRI1 and BAK1; (iii)  transcription, such as 7 WRKY family transcription factors; (iv) metabolism, such  as phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase; and (v) lipid signaling, such as  phospholipase D (beta and gamma). More than 80% (101) of these putative clients  represent previously unidentified 14-3-3 interactors. These results raise the  number of putative 14-3-3 clients identified in plants to over 300.', '2009 Jun', 'Proteomics', '10.1002/pmic.200800445', 'Harper']
