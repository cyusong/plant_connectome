['23576511', 'One striking feature of viruses with RNA genomes is the modification of the host  membrane structure during early infection. This process requires both virus- and  host-encoded proteins; however, the host factors involved and their role in this  process remain largely unknown. On infection with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a  positive-strand RNA virus, the filamentous and tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  converts to aggregations at the early stage and returns to filamentous at the  late infectious stage, termed the ER transition. Also, membrane- or  vesicle-packaged viral replication complexes (VRCs) are induced early during  infection. We used microarray assays to screen the Arabidopsis thaliana gene(s)  responding to infection with TMV in the initial infection stage and identified an  Arabidopsis gene, PAP85 (annotated as a vicilin-like seed storage protein), with  upregulated expression during 0.5 to 6 h of TMV infection. TMV accumulation was  reduced in pap85-RNA interference (RNAi) Arabidopsis and restored to wild-type  levels when PAP85 was overexpressed in pap85-RNAi Arabidopsis. We did not observe  the ER transition in TMV-infected PAP85-knockdown Arabidopsis protoplasts. In  addition, TMV accumulation was reduced in PAP85-knockdown protoplasts. VRC  accumulation was reduced, but not significantly (P = 0.06), in PAP85-knockdown  protoplasts. Coexpression of PAP85 and the TMV main replicase (P126), but not  their expression alone in Arabidopsis protoplasts, could induce ER aggregations.', '2013 Jun', 'J Virol', '10.1128/JVI.00268-13', 'Yeh']
