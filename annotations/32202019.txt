The above original article, first published online on 01 March 2002 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), and in volume 29, pp. 555-567, has been retracted by agreement between the following authors: Patrice Dunoyer, Sébastien Pfeffer, Christiane Fritsch, Odile Hemmer, Olivier Voinnet and K. E. Richards, the journal Editor-in-Chief, Lee Sweetlove, and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. This notice updates and replaces the article and its correction notice, published on 10 June 2015 and in volume 82, pp. 1076-1077. In the correction notice, updated versions of Figures 2, 3 and 6 were published. It has since come to light that an image provided for the correction notice (Fig 2C) contained evidence of inappropriate manipulation. Additional inconsistencies in the representation of the data shown in Figures 3 and 4 have also become apparent. Patrice Dunoyer and Sébastien Pfeffer take full responsibility for the described manipulation and inconsistencies that were made without the consent or knowledge of any of the other co-authors. The authors consider that the integrity of the paper has been compromised and that the most appropriate course of action is a retraction of the article.
