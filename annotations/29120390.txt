A previous report showed that both <i>Pyruvate</i><i>decarboxylase</i> (<i>PDC</i>) genes were significantly upregulated in kiwifruit after waterlogging treatment using Illumina sequencing technology, and that the kiwifruit <i>AdPDC1</i> gene was required during waterlogging, but might not be required during other environmental stresses. Here, the function of another <i>PDC</i> gene, named <i>AdPDC2</i>, was analyzed. The expression of the <i>AdPDC2</i> gene was determined using qRT-PCR, and the results showed that the expression levels of <i>AdPDC2</i> in the reproductive organs were much higher than those in the nutritive organs. Waterlogging, NaCl, and heat could induce the expression of <i>AdPDC2</i>. Overexpression of kiwifruit <i>AdPDC2</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> enhanced resistance to waterlogging and heat stresses in five-week-old seedlings, but could not enhance resistance to NaCl and mannitol stresses at the seed germination stage and in early seedlings. These results suggested that the kiwifruit <i>AdPDC2</i> gene may play an important role in waterlogging resistance and heat stresses in kiwifruit.
