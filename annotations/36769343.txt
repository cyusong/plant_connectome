To explore changes in proteins and metabolites under stress circumstances, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics methods are used. In-depth research over the previous ten years has gradually revealed the fundamental processes of plants' responses to environmental stress. Abiotic stresses, which include temperature extremes, water scarcity, and metal toxicity brought on by human activity and urbanization, are a major cause for concern, since they can result in unsustainable warming trends and drastically lower crop yields. Furthermore, there is an emerging reliance on agrochemicals. Stress is responsible for physiological transformations such as the formation of reactive oxygen, stomatal opening and closure, cytosolic calcium ion concentrations, metabolite profiles and their dynamic changes, expression of stress-responsive genes, activation of potassium channels, etc. Research regarding abiotic stresses is lacking because defense feedbacks to abiotic factors necessitate regulating the changes that activate multiple genes and pathways that are not properly explored. It is clear from the involvement of these genes that plant stress response and adaptation are complicated processes. Targeting the multigenicity of plant abiotic stress responses caused by genomic sequences, transcripts, protein organization and interactions, stress-specific and cellular transcriptome collections, and mutant screens can be the first step in an integrative approach. Therefore, in this review, we focused on the genomes, proteomics, and metabolomics of tomatoes under abiotic stress.
