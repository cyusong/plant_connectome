Phosphorus is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. However, the network that affects phosphate (Pi) accumulation in crops is not well established. It is reported here that OsCSLF6, a member of the cellulose synthase-like family (CSLF), which is found only in grasses, is involved in Pi accumulation. The oscslf6 mutants (oscslf6-1 and oscslf6-2) display Pi toxic symptoms and increased Pi accumulation in both roots and shoots under the Pi-sufficient condition, which correlate with the induced expression of Pi transporters in the knockout mutants. Consistent with the over-accumulation of Pi, a significant decrease in primary root length, adventitious root length, and adventitious root number were observed in the oscslf6 mutants when compared with the wild type (WT) under Pi-sufficient conditions. In addition, the sucrose (Suc) level was increased in the oscslf6 mutants and the expression of sucrose synthases (OsSUS4/5) and sucrose transporters (OsSUT1/2/4/OsSweet14) genes were also induced in the shoots of oscslf6 mutants, suggesting that OsCSLF6 may play a role in affecting Pi accumulation by affecting the level of carbon metabolism.
