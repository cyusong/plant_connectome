This response to a recent Commentary article by de Vries et al. highlights critical errors in the annotation and identification of Ycf1 homologs in the sequenced chloroplast genomes. Contrary to what is reported by de Vries et al., the majority of chloroplast genomes sequenced to date appear to have retained a typical Ycf1 sequence (i.e., including the N-terminal 6TM domain and a variable hydrophilic C-terminal domain) as my group previously reported. Our evidence continues to support the model that Ycf1 forms an essential component of a "green TIC" that is largely conserved among the Chlorophyta and land plants. Since the establishment of this green TIC with Tic20 as the core component, some cases of loss of Ycf1 during the evolution of the green lineages might be regarded as modifications or alterations of the complex. Here, I discuss our working model that the presence of an alternative "nonphotosynthetic-type" or "ancestral-type" TIC might explain other (or specific) cases of the lack of Ycf1, not only in early lineages, including Glaucophyta and Rhodophyta, but also in the grasses.

Ycf1: !forms! Essential Component 
Tic20: !is core component of! Green TIC 
Ycf1: !lost during evolution of! Green Lineages 
Nonphotosynthetic-type/Ancestral-type TIC: !explains lack of! Ycf1
