The expression of HaHB4® transcription factor reduces soybean sensitivity to abiotic stresses, such as water deficit. Studies that quantify the tolerance of HaHB4® soybean to the soil water content in comparison with cultivars currently sown in Brazil are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the level of drought tolerance of soybean genotypes expressing the HaHB4® transcription factor (TS18-6-610108 and TS18-6-610084) and commercial cultivars (TMG 7063 IPRO and BS IRGA 1642 IPRO) subjected to water deficit during the vegetative phase. We used the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) approach. Parameters related to leaf transpiration, dry matter accumulation, water use efficiency (WUE), and transpiration coefficient (TC) were evaluated in the four soybean genotypes and two treatments (T1-100% replacement of transpired water and T2-without replacement of transpired water). The FTSW threshold for the decline in transpiration was evaluated to identify the onset of water stress in soybean. TS18-6-610108 and BS IRGA 1642 IPRO maintains potential transpiration at low FTSW values. The TS18-6-610108 genotype has 14% higher WUE than the sensitive cultivar under water deficit. Under well-irrigated conditions, the HaHB4® genotypes showed the highest TC values, which indicate well-functioning physiological processes.
