A defining challenge of the 21st century is meeting the nutritional demands of the growing human population, under a scenario of limited land and water resources and under the specter of climate change. The Vavilov seed bank contains numerous landraces collected nearly a hundred years ago, and thus may contain 'genetic gems' with the potential to enhance modern breeding efforts. Here, we analyze 407 landraces, sampled from major historic centers of chickpea cultivation and secondary diversification. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) conducted on both phenotypic traits and bioclimatic variables at landraces sampling sites as extended phenotypes resulted in 84 GWAS hits associated to various regions. The novel haploblock-based test identified haploblocks enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with phenotypes and bioclimatic variables. Subsequent bi-clustering of traits sharing enriched haploblocks underscored both non-random distribution of SNPs among several haploblocks and their association with multiple traits. We hypothesize that these clusters of pleiotropic SNPs represent co-adapted genetic complexes to a range of environmental conditions that chickpea experienced during domestication and subsequent geographic radiation. Linking genetic variation to phenotypic data and a wealth of historic information preserved in historic seed banks are the keys for genome-based and environment-informed breeding intensification.
