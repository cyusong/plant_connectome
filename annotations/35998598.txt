Strigolactones are small molecules secreted by plants into the soil to attract symbiotic fungal partners. Two studies describe how plants can predict future competition from neighbours by sensing the levels of strigolactones in the root zone.

Strigolactones: !secreted by! plants 
Strigolactones: !attract! fungal partners 
Plants: !predict! competition from neighbours 
Plants: !sense! levels of strigolactones
