['16600915', 'Floral development at the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem occurs in response to  environmental cues that are perceived in different tissues. Photoperiod is  detected in the vascular tissue of the leaf (phloem) and promotes production of a  systemic signal that induces flowering at the meristem. Vernalization, the  response to winter temperatures, overcomes a block on photoperiodic floral  induction. In Arabidopsis, this block is caused by inhibitors of flowering that  comprise several related MADS-box transcription factors, the most prominent of  which is FLC. We show that FLC delays flowering by repressing production in the  leaf of at least two systemic signals, one of which is controlled by the RAF  kinase inhibitor-like protein FT. Reducing expression of these signals indirectly  represses expression of genes involved in floral induction at the meristem. In  addition, FLC expression in the meristem impairs response to the FT signal by  directly repressing expression of the SOC1 MADS-box transcription factor and  preventing up-regulation of the bZIP transcription factor FD. Repression of genes  acting at multiple levels in this hierarchy is required for the extreme delay in  flowering caused by FLC. An FLC:HA fusion protein binds directly in vivo to the  promoter regions of FD and SOC1 and to the first intron of FT. Thus vernalization  relieves transcriptional repression of key regulatory genes in both the leaf and  meristem, allowing production of systemic signals in the leaves and conferring  competence on the meristem to respond to these signals.', '2006 Apr 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.373506', 'Coupland']
