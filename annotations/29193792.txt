During embryogenesis, plants are thought to use a mechanism that allows the suspensor to maintain its identity. Here, we reported that RPL18aB is involved in this mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. The suspensor cells proliferated in rpl18aB and formed a multicellular structure rather than undergo programmed cell death, as in wild type. Suspensors of rpl18aB expressed the embryo proper marker, DRN::GFP, but not the suspensor marker, WOX8::GFP. In addition, auxin accumulated throughout the suspensors of rpl18aB proembryos. Suspensor-specific expression of RPL18aB could rescue the cell proliferation defects in rpl18aB suspensors. These findings supported a role for RPL18aB in maintaining suspensor identity.
