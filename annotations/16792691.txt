['16792691', 'Cullins are central scaffolding subunits in eukaryotic E3 ligases that facilitate  the ubiquitination of target proteins. Arabidopsis contains at least 11 cullin  proteins but only a few of them have been assigned biological roles. In this work  Arabidopsis cullin 4 is shown to assemble with DDB1, RBX1, DET1 and DDB2 in vitro  and in planta. In addition, by using T-DNA insertion and CUL4 antisense lines we  demonstrate that corresponding mutants are severely affected in different aspects  of development. Reduced CUL4 expression leads to a reduced number of lateral  roots, and to abnormal vascular tissue and stomatal development. Furthermore,  cul4 mutants display a weak constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype. These  results therefore assign an important function to CUL4 during plant development  and provide strong evidence that CUL4 assembles together with RBX1 and DDB1  proteins to form a functional E3 ligase in Arabidopsis.', '2006 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02810.x', 'Hellmann']
