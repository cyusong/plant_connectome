Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a widely planted vegetable crop that suffers from various pathogen infections. Powdery mildew (PM) is typical disease caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea infection and destroys the production of cucumber. However, the metabolic responses to S. fuliginea infection are largely unknown. In our study, a PM resistant variety 'BK2' and a susceptible variety 'H136' were used to screen differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under S. fuliginea infection. Most of DEGs and DAMs were enriched in several primary and secondary metabolic pathways, including flavonoid, hormone, fatty acid and diterpenoid metabolisms. Our data showed that many flavonoid-related metabolites were significantly accumulated in BK2 rather than H136, suggesting an essential role of flavonoids in formation of resistant quality. Changes in expression of CYP73A, CYP81E1, CHS, F3H, HCT and F3'M genes provided a probable explanation for the differential accumulation of flavonoid-related metabolites. Interestingly, more hormone-related DEGs were detected in BK2 compared to H136, suggesting a violent response of hormone signaling pathways in the PM-resistant variety. The number of fatty acid metabolism-related DAMs in H136 was larger than that in BK2, indicating an active fatty acid metabolism in the PM-susceptible variety. Many differentially expressed transcription factor genes were identified under S. fuliginea infection, providing some potential regulators for the improvement of PM resistance. PM resistance of cucumber was controlled by a complex network consisting of various hormonal and metabolic pathways.
