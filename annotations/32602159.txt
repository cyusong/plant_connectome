Light is a key resource for plants as it fuels photosynthesis. It also provides essential information about their habitat. Thus, light tracking is of great importance to plants throughout their life cycle. To gain information about their light environment, plants possess light receptors that cover the perception of the complete light spectrum, including light invisible to the human eye (far-red and ultra-violet light). The information sensed by these photoreceptors is utilized for optimal growth during day-night cycles and in sub-optimal light conditions, such as shaded areas and high-light sun flecks. Plant photobiology research focuses on the perception of light by plants, their developmental adaptations to a changing light environment and the mechanistic and genetic basis of these adaptations. The International Symposium on Plant Photobiology (ISPP) is a biannual meeting where the world's leaders, as well as upcoming talents in the field, gather to share their latest results and discuss future directions. The past edition was held between June 3 and 8 of 2019 in the beautiful PRBB research park building on the seafront of the city of Barcelona (Spain). The ISPP2019 was organized by a gender-balanced committee formed by two junior (Lot Gommers and Jordi Moreno-Romero) and two senior researchers (Jamie F. Martínez-Garcia and Elena Monte).
