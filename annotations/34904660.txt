The ability to engineer plant form will enable the production of novel agricultural products designed to tolerate extreme stresses, boost yield, reduce waste, and improve manufacturing practices. While historically, plants were altered through breeding to change their size or shape, advances in our understanding of plant development and our ability to genetically engineer complex eukaryotes are leading to the direct engineering of plant structure. In this review, I highlight the central role of auxin in plant development and the synthetic biology approaches that could be used to turn auxin-response regulators into powerful tools for modifying plant form. I hypothesize that recoded, gain-of-function auxin response proteins combined with synthetic regulation could be used to override endogenous auxin signaling and control plant structure. I also argue that auxin-response regulators are key to engineering development in nonmodel plants and that single-cell -omics techniques will be essential for characterizing and modifying auxin response in these plants. Collectively, advances in synthetic biology, single-cell -omics, and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning development have set the stage for a new era in the engineering of plant structure.
