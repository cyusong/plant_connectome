Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) functions as an important signaling molecule in plants during biotic interactions. However, the extent to which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulates during these interactions and its implications in the development of disease symptoms is unclear. In this work, we provide a step-by-step optimized protocol for <i>in situ</i> quantification of relative H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in wheat leaves infected with the pathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>atrofaciens</i> (<i>Psa</i>), either alone or in the presence of the beneficial bacterium <i>Herbaspirillum seropedicae</i> (RAM10). This protocol involved the use of 3-3'diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining method combined with image processing to conduct deconvolution and downstream analysis of the digitalized leaf image. The application of a linear regression model allowed to relate the intensity of the pixels resulting from DAB staining with a given concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Decreasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation patterns were detected at increasing distances from the site of pathogen infection, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were different depending on the bacterial combinations tested. Notably, <i>Psa</i>-challenged plants in presence of RAM10 accumulated less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the leaf and showed reduced necrotic symptoms, pointing to a potential role of RAM10 in reducing pathogen-triggered H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in young wheat plants.
