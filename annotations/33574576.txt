Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans greatly constrains potato production. Many Resistance (R) genes were cloned from wild Solanum species and/or introduced into potato cultivars by breeding. However, individual R genes have been overcome by P. infestans evolution; durable resistance remains elusive. We positionally cloned a new R gene, Rpi-amr1, from Solanum americanum, that encodes an NRC helper-dependent CC-NLR protein. Rpi-amr1 confers resistance in potato to all 19 P. infestans isolates tested. Using association genomics and long-read RenSeq, we defined eight additional Rpi-amr1 alleles from different S. americanum and related species. Despite only ~90% identity between Rpi-amr1 proteins, all confer late blight resistance but differentially recognize Avramr1 orthologues and paralogues. We propose that Rpi-amr1 gene family diversity assists detection of diverse paralogues and alleles of the recognized effector, facilitating durable resistance against P. infestans.
