The variations of stem diameter as they can be accurately measured by Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) reflect the addition of four components: irreversible radial growth, reversible living-cell dehydration/rehydration, thermal expansion and contraction, and expansion of dead conducting elements due to the increase and relaxation of internal tensions. The correct interpretation of LVDT signals, with respect to the practical applications, should make an exact distinction between these four components. This paper describes a set of two experiments with potted hybrid walnut trees. Double girdling, water stress, and duration of the day versus night periods were used in the phytotron as experimental factors to induce variations of the carbon and water status of plant tissues. The latter were assessed, respectively, by water potential and transpiration, and by local stem respiration and carbohydrate content. The results are interpreted in terms of carbon or water limitation effects on stem diameter variations where radial growth and tissue elasticity could be distinguished. Moreover, they suggest no or very low involvement of CO2 originating from a distance, i.e. carried by the transpirational flux of xylem sap, in the total stem CO2 efflux rate.
