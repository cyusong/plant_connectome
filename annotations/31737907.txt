Betanin has been widely used as an additive for many centuries, and its use has increased because of its market application as an additive, high free radical scavenging activity, and safety, health-promoting properties. The main source of betanin is red beet, but many factors notably affect the yield of betanin from red beets. Betanin is not produced in cereal grains. Thus, developing biofortified crops with betanin is another alternative to health-promoting food additives. Here, rice endosperm was bioengineered for betanin biosynthesis by introducing three synthetic genes (meloS, BvDODA1S, and BvCYP76AD1S). The overexpression of these genes driven by rice endosperm-specific promoter established the betanin biosynthetic pathways in the endosperm, resulting in new types of germplasm - 'Betanin Rice' (BR). The BR grains were enriched with betanin and had relatively high antioxidant activity. Our results proved that betanin can be biosynthesized de novo in rice endosperm by introducing three genes in the committed betanin biosynthetic pathway. The betanin-fortified rice in this study can be used as a functional grain to promote health and as a raw material to process dietary supplements.
