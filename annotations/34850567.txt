Although the genetic basis for endosperm development in maize (Zea mays) has been well studied, the mechanism for coordinating grain filling with increasing kernel size remains elusive. Here, we report that increased kernel size was selected during modern breeding and identify a novel DELLA-like transcriptional regulator, ZmGRAS11, which positively regulates kernel size and kernel weight in maize. We find that Opaque2, a core transcription factor for zein protein and starch accumulation, transactivates the expression of ZmGRAS11. Our data suggest that the Opaque2-ZmGRAS11 module mediates synergistic endosperm enlargement with grain filling.
