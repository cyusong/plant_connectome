Salinity adversity has been a major environmental stressor for plant growth and reproduction worldwide. Semi-mangrove <i>Clerodendrum inerme</i>, a naturally salt-tolerant plant, can be studied as a successful example to understand the biological mechanism of saline resistance. Since it is a sophisticated and all-round scale process for plants to react to stress, our greenhouse study interpreted the response of <i>C. inerme</i> to salt challenge in the following aspects: morphology, osmotic protectants, ROS production and scavenging, ion homeostasis, photosynthetic efficiency, and transcriptome reprogramming. The results drew an overview picture to illustrate the tolerant performance of <i>C. inerme</i> from salt acclimatization (till medium NaCl level, 0.3 mol/L) to salinity stress (high NaCl level, 0.5 mol/L). The overall evaluation leads to a conclusion that the main survival strategy of <i>C. inerme</i> is globally reshaping metabolic and ion profiles to adapt to saline adversity. These findings uncover the defense mechanism by which <i>C. inerme</i> moderates its development rate to resist the short- and long-term salt adversity, along with rebalancing the energy allocation between growth and stress tolerance.
