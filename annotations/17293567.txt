['17293567', 'Chromatin remodeling is emerging as a central mechanism for patterning and  differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPases  are conserved in the animal and plant kingdom and regulate transcriptional  programs in response to endogenous and exogenous cues. In contrast with their  metazoan orthologs, null mutants in two Arabidopsis thaliana SWI/SNF ATPases,  BRAHMA (BRM) and SPLAYED (SYD), are viable, facilitating investigation of their  role in the organism. Previous analyses revealed that syd and brm null mutants  exhibit both similar and distinct developmental defects, yet the functional  relationship between the two closely related ATPases is not understood. Another  central question is whether these proteins act as general or specific  transcriptional regulators. Using global expression studies, double mutant  analysis, and protein interaction assays, we find overlapping functions for the  two SWI/SNF ATPases. This partial diversification may have allowed expansion of  the SWI/SNF ATPase regulatory repertoire, while preserving essential ancestral  functions. Moreover, only a small fraction of all genes depends on SYD or BRM for  expression, indicating that these SWI/SNF ATPases exhibit remarkable regulatory  specificity. Our studies provide a conceptual framework for understanding the  role of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling in regulation of Arabidopsis development.', '2007 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048272', 'Wagner']
