Open Stomata 1 (OST1)/SnRK2.6 is a critical component connecting abscisic acid (ABA) receptor complexes and downstream components, including anion channels and transcription factors. Because OST1 is a serine/threonine kinase, several autophosphorylation sites have been identified, and S175 is known to be critical for its kinase activity. We previously reported that BAK1 interacts with and phosphorylates OST1 to regulate ABA signaling. Here, we mapped additional phosphosites of OST1 generated by autophosphorylation and BAK1-mediated transphosphorylation in Arabidopsis. Many phosphosites serve as both auto- and transphosphorylation sites, especially those clustered in the activation loop region. Phospho-mimetic transgenic plants containing quadruple changes in Y163, S164, S166, and S167 rescued ost1 mutant phenotypes, activating ABA signaling outputs. Moreover, we found that OST1 is an active tyrosine kinase, autophosphorylating the Y182 site. ABA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Y182 in OST1; this event is catalytically important for OST1 activity in plants. ABA-Insensitive 1 (ABI1) and its homologs ABI2 and HAB1, PP2C serine/threonine phosphatases that are known to dephosphorylate OST1 at S175, function as tyrosine phosphatases acting on the phosphorylated Y182 site. Our results indicate that phosphorylation cycles between OST1 and ABI1, which have dual specificity for tyrosine and serine/threonine, coordinately control ABA signaling in Arabidopsis.
