['17804481', "Cellular DNA, RNA and their precursor nucleotides are at high risk of being  oxidized by reactive oxygen species. An oxidized base,  8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-(deoxy)guanosine, can pair with both adenine and cytosine,  and thus would cause both replicational and translational errors. Previously, we  have reported that an Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolase, AtNUDX1, acts to hydrolyze an  oxidized deoxyribonucleotide, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  (8-oxo-dGTP). Here we showed that 8-oxo-dGTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity is not  exhibited by any other Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolase. AtNUDX1 acted on an oxidized  ribonucleotide, 8-oxo-GTP, with high affinity (K(m) 28.1 microM). In a  transcriptional mutational analysis using the lacZ reporter gene, the phenotypic  suppression of the lacZ amber mutation in a mutT-deficient Escherichia coli  strain caused by the misincorporation of 8-oxo-GTP into the mRNA was  significantly diminished by expression of AtNUDX1. These findings suggest that  AtNUDX1 prevents transcriptional errors in vivo. A confocal microscopic analysis  using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein demonstrated that AtNUDX1  is distributed in the cytosol, where the main pool of nucleotides in the cells  exists. The level of 8-oxo-guanosine in genomic DNA was significantly increased  in knockout nudx1 plants compared with wild-type plants under normal and  oxidative stress (3 microM paraquat) conditions. The results obtained here  indicate that AtNUDX1 functions in cellular defense against oxidative DNA and RNA  damage through the sanitization of their precursor pools in the cytosol in  Arabidopsis cells.", '2007 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcm112', 'Shigeoka']
