Androgenesis and genetic characterization of androgenic progeny from Lolium perenne x Festuca pratensis cultivars (2n = 4x = 28) were investigated in order to develop a novel grass that combines favourable attributes of parent plants. A successful androgenesis was obtained using PG-96 medium. The green plant regeneration was 46%, 35% and 17% for Bx350, Bx351 and Prior, respectively, and over 800 green plants have been obtained. Androgenic progeny showed a large variation in freezing tolerance, 7% of 292 progeny exceeding that of freezing hardy F. pratensis despite containing chromosomes of L. perenne. More than 60% of 175 flowering progeny produced dehiscent anthers with pollens. Androgenic plants contained 14 or 28 chromosomes. There were 188 (56%), 204 (77%) and 114 (81%) dihaploids from Bx350, Bx351 and Prior, respectively. The nuclear DNA content varied significantly even between plants with the same chromosome number. High levels of chromosome pairing and recombination were observed by genomic in situ hybridization analysis because of close homology between two genomes. The results indicated that androgenic progeny of Festulolium showed high level of genetic variation, and provide potential for accelerating selection efficiency.
