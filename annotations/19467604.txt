['19467604', 'We report here the localisation and properties of a new membrane-bound isoform of  caleosin and its putative role as a peroxygenase involved in oxylipin metabolism  during biotic and abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis. Caleosins are a family  of lipid-associated proteins that are ubiquitous in plants and true fungi.  Previous research has focused on lipid-body associated, seed-specific caleosins  that have peroxygenase activity. Here, we demonstrate that a separate  membrane-bound constitutively expressed caleosin isoform (Clo-3) is highly  upregulated following exposure to abiotic stresses, such as salt and drought, and  to biotic stress such as pathogen infection. The Clo-3 protein binds one atom of  calcium per molecule, is phosphorylated in response to stress, and has a similar  peroxygenase activity to the seed-specific Clo-1 isoform. Clo-3 is present in  microsomal and chloroplast envelope fractions and has a type I membrane  orientation with about 2 kDa of the C terminal exposed to the cytosol. Analysis  of Arabidopsis ABA and related mutant lines implies that Clo-3 is involved in the  generation of oxidised fatty acids in stress related signalling pathways  involving both ABA and salicylic acid. We propose that Clo-3 is part of an  oxylipin pathway induced by multiple stresses and may also generate fatty acid  derived anti-fungal compounds for plant defence.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2009.04.005', 'Murphy']
