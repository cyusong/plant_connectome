In plants, phytosterols and triterpenes are major secondary metabolites. In an attempt to reveal the mechanism for synthesis and storage of these compounds, we isolated and characterized cDNA clones for squalene epoxidase (SE), from a succulent shrub, Euphorbia tirucalli. Southern-blot analysis of total DNA using cDNA fragment as a probe showed that the E. tirucalli squalene epoxidase gene (EtSE) is single-copy type in terms of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Deduced amino-acid sequence of the cDNA showed 83 and 75% identity to those of rice and ginseng, respectively, in an area excluding a less homologous putative transmembrane region in the N-terminal end. Functional characterization with heterologous expression using an erg1-disrupted yeast mutant KLN1 indicated that the EtSE recovered ergosterol auxotrophy of the mutant, and gave rise to an ergosterol accumulation in the EtSE transformant. RT-PCR analysis showed the EtSE transcripts in leaves and stem internodes accumulated in almost equal amounts, which were more abundant than those in roots. In situ hybridization using EtSE antisense probe revealed prominent EtSE expression on a parenchyma cell adjacent to primary laticifers that were located in a rosary orientation in the inner region of cortex. This is the first report of expression of a gene for a rate-limiting enzyme in mevalonate pathway in organs and tissues of a plant.
