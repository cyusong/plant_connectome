['19825612', 'The Calvin cycle enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and  phosphoribulokinase (PRK) can form under oxidizing conditions a supramolecular  complex with the regulatory protein CP12. Both GAPDH and PRK activities are  inhibited within the complex, but they can be fully restored by reduced  thioredoxins (TRXs). We have investigated the interactions of eight different  chloroplast thioredoxin isoforms (TRX f1, m1, m2, m3, m4, y1, y2, x) with GAPDH  (A(4), B(4), and B(8) isoforms), PRK and CP12 (isoform 2), all from Arabidopsis  thaliana. In the complex, both A(4)-GAPDH and PRK were promptly activated by TRX  f1, or more slowly by TRXs m1 and m2, but all other TRXs were ineffective. Free  PRK was regulated by TRX f1, m1, or m2, while B(4)- and B(8)-GAPDH were  absolutely specific for TRX f1. Interestingly, reductive activation of PRK caged  in the complex was much faster than reductive activation of free oxidized PRK,  and activation of A(4)-GAPDH in the complex was much faster (and less demanding  in terms of reducing potential) than activation of free oxidized B(4)- or  B(8)-GAPDH. It is proposed that CP12-assembled supramolecular complex may  represent a reservoir of inhibited enzymes ready to be released in fully active  conformation following reduction and dissociation of the complex by TRXs upon the  shift from dark to low light. On the contrary, autonomous redox-modulation of  GAPDH (B-containing isoforms) would be more suited to conditions of very active  photosynthesis.', '2009 Mar', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssn061', 'Trost']
