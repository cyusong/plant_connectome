Rice false smut (RFS), caused by <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>, has become a major disease in recent years, and mycotoxins produced by <i>U. virens</i> often threaten food safety. To study fungal pathogenesis and identify potential targets for developing new fungicides, gap-free nuclear and complete mitochondrial genomes of <i>U. virens</i> JS60-2 were sequenced and assembled. Using the second and third generation sequencing data, we assembled a 38.02-Mb genome that consists of seven contigs with the contig N<sub>50</sub> being 6.32-Mb. In total, 8,486 protein-coding genes were annotated in the genome, including 21 secondary metabolism gene clusters. We also assembled the complete mitochondrial genome, which is 102,498 bp, with 28% GC content. The JS60-2 genomes assembled in this study will facilitate research on <i>U. virens</i> and contribute to RFS control. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
