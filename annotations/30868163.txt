The sulfur metabolism pathway in plants produces a variety of compounds that are central to the acclimation response to oxidative stresses such as drought and high light. Primary sulfur assimilation provides the amino acid cysteine, which is utilized in protein synthesis and as a precursor for the cellular redox buffer glutathione. In contrast, the secondary sulfur metabolism pathway produces sulfated compounds such as glucosinolates and sulfated peptides, as well as a corresponding by-product 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). Emerging evidence over the past decade has shown that secondary sulfur metabolism also has a crucial engagement during oxidative stress. This occurs across various cellular, tissue, and organismal levels including chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signalling events mediated by PAP, modulation of hormonal signalling by sulfated compounds and PAP, control of physiological responses such as stomatal closure, and potential regulation of plant growth. In this review, we examine the contribution of the different components of plant secondary metabolism to oxidative stress homeostasis, and how this pathway is metabolically regulated. We further outline the key outstanding questions in the field that are necessary to understand how and why this 'specialized' metabolic pathway plays significant roles in plant oxidative stress tolerance.
