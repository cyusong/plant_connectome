['11701879', 'In higher plants, the formation of the cell plate during cytokinesis requires  coordinated microtubule (MT) reorganization and vesicle transport in the  phragmoplast. MT-based kinesin motors are important players in both processes. To  understand the mechanisms underlying plant cytokinesis, we have identified  AtPAKRP2 (for Arabidopsis thaliana phragmoplast-associated kinesin-related  protein 2). AtPAKRP2 is an ungrouped N-terminal motor kinesin. It first appeared  in a punctate pattern among interzonal MTs during late anaphase. When the  phragmoplast MT array appeared in a mirror pair, AtPAKRP2 became more  concentrated near the division site, and additional signal could be detected  elsewhere in the phragmoplast. In contrast, the previously identified AtPAKRP1  protein is associated specifically with bundles of MTs in the phragmoplast at or  near their plus ends. Localization of the tobacco homolog(s) of AtPAKRP2 was  altered by treatment of brefeldin A in BY-2 cells. We discuss the possibility  that AtPAKRP1 plays a role in establishing and/or maintaining the phragmoplast MT  array, and AtPAKRP2 may contribute to the transport of Golgi-derived vesicles in  the phragmoplast.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010225', 'Liu']
