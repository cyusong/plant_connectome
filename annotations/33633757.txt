The bulk of plant biomass is comprised of plant cell walls, which are complex polymeric networks, composed of diverse polysaccharides, proteins, polyphenolics, and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs). Glycosyltransferases (GTs) work together to synthesize the saccharide components of the plant cell wall. The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> fucosyltransferases (FUTs), <i>At</i>FUT4, and <i>At</i>FUT6, are members of the plant-specific GT family 37 (GT37). <i>At</i>FUT4 and <i>At</i>FUT6 transfer fucose (Fuc) onto arabinose (Ara) residues of arabinogalactan (AG) proteins (AGPs) and have been postulated to be non-redundant AGP-specific FUTs. <i>At</i>FUT4 and <i>At</i>FUT6 were recombinantly expressed in mammalian HEK293 cells and purified for biochemical analysis. We report an updated understanding on the specificities of <i>At</i>FUT4 and <i>At</i>FUT6 that are involved in the synthesis of wall localized AGPs. Our findings suggest that they are selective enzymes that can utilize various arabinogalactan (AG)-like and non-AG-like oligosaccharide acceptors, and only require a free, terminal arabinofuranose. We also report with GUS promoter-reporter gene studies that <i>AtFUT4</i> and <i>AtFUT6</i> gene expression is sub-localized in different parts of developing <i>A. thaliana</i> roots.
