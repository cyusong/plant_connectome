Aluminum (Al<sup>3+</sup> ) toxicity in acidic soils limits crop productivity worldwide. In this study, we found that putrescine (PUT) significantly alleviates Al toxicity in rice roots. The addition of 0.1 mM PUT promoted root elongation and reduced the Al content in the root apices of Nipponbare (Nip) and Kasalath (Kas) rice under Al toxicity conditions. Exogenous treatment with PUT reduced the cell wall Al content by reducing polysaccharide (pectin and hemicellulose) levels and pectin methylesterase (PME) activity in roots and decreased the translocation of Al from the external environment to the cytoplasm by downregulating the expression of OsNRAT1, which responsible to encode an Al transporter protein Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1). The addition of PUT under Al toxicity conditions significantly inhibited ethylene emissions and suppressed the expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis. Treatment with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocylopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) significantly improved ethylene emission, inhibited root elongation, increased the Al accumulation in root tips and the root cell wall, and increased cell wall pectin and hemicellulose contents in both rice cultivars under Al toxicity conditions. The ethylene biosynthesis antagonist aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG, inhibitor of the ACC synthase) had the opposite effect and reduced PME activity. Together, our results show that PUT decreases the cell wall Al contents by suppressing ethylene emissions and decreases the symplastic Al levels by downregulating OsNRAT1 in rice.
