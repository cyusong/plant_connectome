['29576453', 'Following a previous microbial inoculation, plants can induce broad-spectrum  immunity to pathogen infection, a phenomenon known as systemic acquired  resistance (SAR). SAR establishment in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by the  Lys catabolite pipecolic acid (Pip) and flavin-dependent-monooxygenase1 (FMO1).  Here, we show that elevated Pip is sufficient to induce an FMO1-dependent  transcriptional reprogramming of leaves that is reminiscent of SAR. In planta and  in vitro analyses demonstrate that FMO1 functions as a pipecolate N-hydroxylase,  catalyzing the biochemical conversion of Pip to N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP).  NHP systemically accumulates in plants after microbial attack. When exogenously  applied, it overrides the defect of NHP-deficient fmo1 in acquired resistance and  acts as a potent inducer of plant immunity to bacterial and oomycete infection.  Our work has identified a pathogen-inducible L-Lys catabolic pathway in plants  that generates the N-hydroxylated amino acid NHP as a critical regulator of  systemic acquired resistance to pathogen infection.', '2018 Apr 5', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.049', 'Zeier']
