HOPs (HSP70-HSP90 organizing proteins) are a highly conserved family of HSP70 and HSP90 co-chaperones whose role in assisting the folding of various hormonal receptors has been extensively studied in mammals. In plants, HOPs are mainly associated with stress response, but their potential involvement in hormonal networks remains completely unexplored. In this article we describe that a member of the HOP family, HOP3, is involved in the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway and is linked to plant defense responses not only to pathogens, but also to a generalist herbivore. The JA pathway regulates responses to Botrytis cinerea infection and to Tetranychus urticae feeding; our data demonstrate that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hop3-1 mutant shows an increased susceptibility to both. The hop3-1 mutant exhibits reduced sensitivity to JA derivatives in root growth assays and downregulation of different JA-responsive genes in response to methyl jasmonate, further revealing the relevance of HOP3 in the JA pathway. Interestingly, yeast two-hybrid assays and in planta co-immunoprecipitation assays found that HOP3 interacts with COI1, suggesting that COI1 is a target of HOP3. Consistent with this observation, COI1 activity is reduced in the hop3-1 mutant. All these data strongly suggest that, specifically among HOPs, HOP3 plays a relevant role in the JA pathway by regulating COI1 activity in response to JA and, consequently, participating in defense signaling to biotic stresses.
