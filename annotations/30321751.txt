The treatment of the cotyledons of pepper plants with vanillyl nonanoate (VNT), a synthetic capsinoid similar to capsiate, protected systemically the plant against a root pathogen (the hemibiotrophic oomycete Phytophthora capsici) and an aerial pathogen (the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea). VNT treatment reduced both the symptoms and the colonization by these pathogens. VNT induced systemically two PR (Pathogenesis-related) genes and a gene involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis. VNT also induced systemically the reinforcement of cell walls with lignin both in the roots and the leaves. The increase in lignin was correlated with an increase in peroxidase gene expression and activity, pointing to the role of this enzyme in lignin polymerization. The results suggest that VNT induces systemic resistance at least in part by means of lignification.
