To date, CRISPR/Cas9 RNP editing tools have not been applied to the genetic modification of banana. Here, the establishment of a PEG-mediated banana protoplast transformation system makes it possible to build an efficient DNA-free method for a site-directed mutagenesis system. Protoplasts constitute a versatile platform for transient expression in plant science. In this study, we established a PEG-mediated banana protoplast transformation system. This system was further optimized for successfully delivering CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas12a plasmids and CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for targeted delivery of the PDS gene into banana protoplasts. Specific bands were observed in PCR-Restriction Enzyme Digestion (PCR-RE) assays, and Sanger sequencing of single clones further confirmed the occurrence of indels at target sites. Deep amplicon sequencing results showed that the editing efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system was higher than that of the other two systems. The PEG-mediated banana protoplast transformation system can serve as a rapid and effective tool for transient expression assays and sgRNA validation in banana. The application of the CRISPR/Cas9 RNP system enables the generation of banana plants engineered by DNA-free gene editing.
