['16246292', 'The investigation of hormone-receptor interaction normally needs isolation and  extensive purification of the receptor protein or a particular  receptor-containing fraction. To bypass these time- and resource-consuming  procedures, we have established a live cell-based assay using transgenic bacteria  expressing single eukaryotic receptors. Here we describe some biochemical  features of the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptor CRE1/AHK4 expressed in Escherichia  coli. The data show that the main characteristics of the ligand-receptor  interaction, including binding affinity and ligand specificity, can be determined  using intact bacteria expressing a functional receptor.', '2005 Dec 1', 'Anal Biochem', '10.1016/j.ab.2005.09.012', 'Schmulling']
