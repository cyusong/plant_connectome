Tomato is the crop with the greatest economic importance in the world and salinity stress causes a reduction in the quantity and quality of crop production. The objective of this work is to verify if the accumulation of proline and glycine betaine (GB) and their metabolisms improve tolerance to salt stress. Two commercial genotypes of Solanum Lycopersicum L., Grand Brix and Marmande RAF were used for this work. The analyzed parameters were growth parameters, proline concentration and its metabolism, GB and its above betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) synthesis and some related amino acids. Saline stress reduced biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) in both genotypes, this effect being greater in Marmande RAF. These results, together with the proline accumulation indicate that Grand Brix is more tolerant to saline stress. The proline increase in Grand Brix came by the ornithine pathway, leaving the glutamate pathway repressed. On the other hand, it was found in both genotypes a BADH and GB decreases as a salinity tolerance mechanism. We propose that, unlike proline, GB synthesis can produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> thereby, GB not act as compatible solute and salt tolerance does not improve.
