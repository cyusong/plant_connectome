['16040647', 'The actin-related proteins (ARPs) that are localized to the nucleus are present  as components of various chromatin-modifying complexes involved in chromatin  dynamics and transcriptional regulation. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ARP7  is a constitutively expressed nuclear protein belonging to a novel plant-specific  ARP class. In this study, we demonstrate a vital role for ARP7 protein in  embryogenesis and plant development. Knocking out the expression of ARP7 in an  arp7-1 T-DNA mutant produced morphologically aberrant, homozygous embryos that  were arrested at or before the torpedo stage of development. Hence, the arp7-1  null mutation is homozygous lethal. Knocking down the expression levels of ARP7  protein with RNA interference produced viable Arabidopsis lines affected in  multiple developmental pathways and induced dosage-dependent, heritable defects  in plant architecture. The transgenic plants containing greatly reduced levels of  ARP7 in the nucleus were severely dwarfed with small rosette leaves that are  defective in cell expansion and trichome morphology. Moreover, the ARP7-deficient  RNA interference plants exhibited retarded root growth, altered flower  development, delayed perianth abscission, and reduced fertility. These  pleiotropic phenotypic changes suggest a critical role for the Arabidopsis ARP7  protein in the regulation of various phases of plant development through  chromatin-mediated, global regulation of gene expression.', '2005 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.065326', 'Meagher']
