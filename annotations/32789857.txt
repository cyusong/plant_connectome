Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<sub>2</sub> ]) is increasing, which increases leaf-scale photosynthesis and intrinsic water-use efficiency. These direct responses have the potential to increase plant growth, vegetation biomass, and soil organic matter; transferring carbon from the atmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems (a carbon sink). A substantial global terrestrial carbon sink would slow the rate of [CO<sub>2</sub> ] increase and thus climate change. However, ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> responses are complex or confounded by concurrent changes in multiple agents of global change and evidence for a [CO<sub>2</sub> ]-driven terrestrial carbon sink can appear contradictory. Here we synthesize theory and broad, multidisciplinary evidence for the effects of increasing [CO<sub>2</sub> ] (iCO<sub>2</sub> ) on the global terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence suggests a substantial increase in global photosynthesis since pre-industrial times. Established theory, supported by experiments, indicates that iCO<sub>2</sub> is likely responsible for about half of the increase. Global carbon budgeting, atmospheric data, and forest inventories indicate a historical carbon sink, and these apparent iCO<sub>2</sub> responses are high in comparison to experiments and predictions from theory. Plant mortality and soil carbon iCO<sub>2</sub> responses are highly uncertain. In conclusion, a range of evidence supports a positive terrestrial carbon sink in response to iCO<sub>2</sub> , albeit with uncertain magnitude and strong suggestion of a role for additional agents of global change.
