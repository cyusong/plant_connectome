['12837955', 'Proper control of the floral transition is critical for reproductive success in  flowering plants. In Arabidopsis, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a floral repressor  upon which multiple floral regulatory pathways converge. Mutations in  PHOTOPERIOD-INDEPENDENT EARLY FLOWERING1 (PIE1) suppress the FLC-mediated delay  of flowering as a result of the presence of FRIGIDA or of mutations in autonomous  pathway genes. PIE1 is required for high levels of FLC expression in the shoot  apex, but it is not required for FLC expression in roots. PIE1 is similar to  ATP-dependent, chromatin-remodeling proteins of the ISWI and SWI2/SNF2 family.  The role of PIE1 as an activator of FLC is consistent with the general role of  ISWI and SWI2/SNF2 family genes as activators of gene expression. The pie1  mutation also causes early flowering in noninductive photoperiods independently  of FLC; thus, PIE1 appears to be involved in multiple flowering pathways. PIE1  also plays a role in petal development, as revealed by the suppression of petal  defects of the curly leaf mutant by the pie1 mutation.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.012161', 'Amasino']
