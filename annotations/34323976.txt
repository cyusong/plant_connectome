Carbohydrate partitioning from leaves to sink tissues is essential for plant growth and development. The maize (Zea mays) recessive carbohydrate partitioning defective28 (cpd28) and cpd47 mutants exhibit leaf chlorosis and accumulation of starch and soluble sugars. Transport studies with 14C-sucrose (Suc) found drastically decreased export from mature leaves in cpd28 and cpd47 mutants relative to wild-type siblings. Consistent with decreased Suc export, cpd28 mutants exhibited decreased phloem pressure in mature leaves, and altered phloem cell wall ultrastructure in immature and mature leaves. We identified the causative mutations in the Brittle Stalk2-Like3 (Bk2L3) gene, a member of the COBRA family, which is involved in cell wall development across angiosperms. None of the previously characterized COBRA genes are reported to affect carbohydrate export. Consistent with other characterized COBRA members, the BK2L3 protein localized to the plasma membrane, and the mutants condition a dwarf phenotype in dark-grown shoots and primary roots, as well as the loss of anisotropic cell elongation in the root elongation zone. Likewise, both mutants exhibit a significant cellulose deficiency in mature leaves. Therefore, Bk2L3 functions in tissue growth and cell wall development, and this work elucidates a unique connection between cellulose deposition in the phloem and whole-plant carbohydrate partitioning.
