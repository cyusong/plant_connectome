<i>Coprinopsis cinerea</i> lectin 2 (CCL2) is a fucoside-binding lectin from the basidiomycete <i>C. cinerea</i> that is toxic to the bacterivorous nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as well as animal-parasitic and fungivorous nematodes. We expressed <i>CCL2</i> in Arabidopsis to assess its protective potential toward plant-parasitic nematodes. Our results demonstrate that expression of <i>CCL2</i> enhances host resistance against the cyst nematode <i>Heterodera schachtii</i>. Surprisingly, CCL2-expressing plants were also more resistant to fungal pathogens including <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and the phytopathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. In addition, <i>CCL2</i> expression positively affected plant growth indicating that CCL2 has the potential to improve two important agricultural parameters namely biomass production and general disease resistance. The mechanism of the CCL2-mediated enhancement of plant disease resistance depended on fucoside-binding by CCL2 as transgenic plants expressing a mutant version of CCL2 (Y92A), compromised in fucoside-binding, exhibited wild type (WT) disease susceptibility. The protective effect of CCL2 did not seem to be direct as the lectin showed no growth-inhibition toward <i>B. cinerea</i> in <i>in vitro</i> assays. We detected, however, a significantly enhanced transcriptional induction of plant defense genes in CCL2- but not CCL2-Y92A-expressing lines in response to infection with <i>B. cinerea</i> compared to WT plants. This study demonstrates a potential of fungal defense lectins in plant protection beyond their use as toxins.
