['11669580', 'Mammalian E2F transcription factors are composed of E2F and DP subunits, and with  their negative regulators, Rb-related proteins, govern expression of  cell-division-related genes. Six E2Fs and two DPs are present in mammals, but  only single E2F genes are known from wheat, tobacco and carrot. Here we show that  E2Fs are a multigene family in Arabidopsis, and report isolation of three  E2F-like clones AtE2F1-3, with 45-62% identity to wheat, tobacco and carrot E2Fs.  Sequence analysis reveals that AtE2F1 and AtE2F3 are closely related to  previously identified plant E2Fs, whereas AtE2F2 is related to human E2F6 and  Drosophila dE2F2 which are unusual in lacking transcriptional activation  potential. Consistent with this, we show that AtE2FI and AtE2F3 activate  transcription in yeast cells and bind a plant Rb protein, but AtE2F2 cannot  activate transcription or bind Rb. Consensus E2F-binding sites were identified in  promoters of several cell cycle related genes, including the D-type cyclin CycD3  and the Arabidopsis homologue of the replication origin protein CDC6.  Accumulation of AtE2F1-3 was observed in partially synchronised Arabidopsis cells  re-entering the cell cycle, before induction of CycD3 and CDC6 expression in late  G1. AtE2F1 complexes bound to consensus E2F sequences and to the AtCDC6 promoter  in vitro. We conclude that Arabidopsis contains a family of functionally distinct  E2F genes, most probably involved in the G1-to-S phase progression.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1011848528377', 'Murra']
