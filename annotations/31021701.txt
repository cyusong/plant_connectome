Scaffold protein Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) is a negative regulator of plant stress hormone - abscisic acid (ABA) mediated pathways. RACK1 has been reported to regulate global miRNA biogenesis pathway in C. elegans, humans, and in Arabidopsis. RACK1 regulates different steps of miRNA biogenesis and stability in response to different stimuli in plants. miR393s is implicated in salt stress response pathway through an antagonistic response between the stress hormone ABA-mediated salt stress and growth hormone auxin. Specifically, the known auxin receptor clade transcripts TIR1/AFB2 are the target for the miR393s. By down-regulating the auxin signaling pathways, the miR393s inhibit the regulation of salt tolerance by auxin. Here we show that genetic loss of RACK1A- the predominant member of the three genes family of RACK1 in Arabidopsis, results in the inhibition of miR393 level causing the same salt sensitivities as the individual mir393a or mir393b or the double mutant mir393ab phenotypes. We propose that down-regulation of auxin signaling through RACK1A induced miR393 biogenesis potentially regulates the Arabidopsis acclimation to salinity. Our findings fill up a molecular gap in our understanding of the role of miR393 mediated ABA and auxin-regulated salt stress responses.
