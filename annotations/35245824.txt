A total of 11 potential plant growth promoting rhizobacteria previously isolated from naturally stressed environments were evaluated for various traits of interest for a beneficial symbiosis with plants, including colonization ability, biofilm formation, motility, exopolysaccharide production and salt tolerance. The vast majority of the strains were found to possess multiple plant growth promoting traits. Nevertheless, the intensity varied among isolates, with those originated from tomato plants being more efficient colonizers. The strain SAESo11, genetically characterized as a Pseudomonas putida member was selected for further investigation of its potential to alleviate drought stress in tomato seedlings. Inoculation with SAESo11 mitigated the negative effects of drought stress as indicated by growth and photosynthetic indices. Furthermore, bacterial inoculation enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content and malondialdehyde levels in colonized plants. Drought treatment did not further alter the oxidative status of these plants. Similarly, total phenolic content and antioxidant enzyme activity were induced in plant tissues in response to drought stress only at the absence of inoculum. These results indicated that inoculation with the selected strain imposed plants at a priming state, that enabled them to respond more robustly at the exposure to drought stress and efficiently attenuated the drought-induced injury. This state of plant alertness mediated by SAESo11 occurred at no cost to growth, highlighting its role as a potential plant priming agent.
