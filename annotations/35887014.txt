Salt stress impairs plant growth and development, thereby causing low yield and inferior quality of crops. In this study, tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L. 'Micro-Tom') seedlings treated with different concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) were investigated in terms of decreased plant height, stem diameter, dry weight, fresh weight, leaves relative water content and root activity. To reveal the response mechanism of tomato seedlings to salt stress, the transcriptome of tomato leaves was conducted. A total of 6589 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and classified into different metabolic pathways, especially photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Of these, approximately 42 DEGs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway, most of which mainly included plant hormone, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), wounding and pathogen infection signaling pathways. To further explore the roles of MAPK under salt stress, MAPK phosphorylation inhibitor SB203580 (SB) was applied. We found that SB further decreased endogenous jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and ethylene levels under salt stress condition. Additionally, in comparison with NaCl treatment alone, SB + NaCl treatment reduced the content of O<sup>2-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the activities of antioxidant enzyme and downregulated the expression levels of genes related to pathogen infection. Together, the results revealed that MAPK might be involved in the salinity response of tomato seedlings by regulating hormone balance, ROS metabolism, antioxidant capacity and plant immunity.
