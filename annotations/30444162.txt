Maize, <i>Zea mays</i>, the second-most-widely-grown crop, yields 20 % of all consumed calories worldwide.<sup>1</sup> Despite its agronomic importance, research progress is limited by costly transformation. We recently described the Trojan horse method as a useful tool to study maize proteins <i>in situ</i> that circumvents time- and space-consuming whole plant transformation. The Trojan horse approach uses the protein-folding and secretory properties of the corn smut fungus <i>Ustilago maydis</i> to secrete maize proteins from fungal cells into the maize apoplast. Here, we discuss the timing and location of <i>U. maydis</i> during infection and the protein secretion site in relation to anther anatomy. This spatiotemporal analysis enables the study of apoplastic anther proteins in various premeiotic anther developmental stages, and could be adapted for larger screens.
