['18930958', 'The Arabidopsis gene At5g21040 encodes a protein containing both WD40 and F-box  motifs, termed FBX2. A T-DNA insertional mutant in this gene was obtained.  Analysis of this mutant line showed that FBX2 is a negative regulator of several  P(i) starvation responses. FBX2 interacts with BHLH32, another negative regulator  of P(i) starvation responses. We suggest that FBX2 may be part of an SCF-like  complex that recruits BHLH32 and its partners, potentially targeting the latter  for proteolysis.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcn157', 'Nimmo']
