Endoreduplication plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation, but the mechanisms regulating endoreduplication are still elusive. We have previously reported that UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE14 (UBP14) encoded by DA3 interacts with ULTRAVIOLETB INSENSITIVE4 (UVI4) to influence endoreduplication and cell growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The da3-1 mutant possesses larger cotyledons and flowers with higher ploidy levels than the wild-type. Here, we identify the suppressor of da3-1 (SUPPRESSOR OF da3-1 3; SUD3), which encodes SNW/SKI-INTERACTING PROTEIN (SKIP). Biochemical studies demonstrate that SUD3 physically interacts with UBP14/DA3 and UVI4 in vivo and in vitro. Genetic analyses support that SUD3 acts in a common pathway with UBP14/DA3 and UVI4 to control endoreduplication. Our findings reveal an important genetic and molecular mechanism by which SKIP/SUD3 associates with UBP14/DA3 and UVI4 to modulate endoreduplication.
