['15060584', 'Telomere-binding proteins participate in forming a functional nucleoprotein  structure at chromosome ends. Using a genomic approach, two Arabidopsis thaliana  genes coding for candidate Myb-like telomere binding proteins were cloned and  expressed in E. coli. Both proteins, termed AtTBP2 (accession Nos. T46051  (protein database) and GI:638639 (nucleotide database); 295 amino acids, 32 kDa,  pI 9.53) and AtTBP3 (BAB08466, GI:9757879; 299 amino acids, 33 kDa, pI 9.88),  contain a single Myb-like DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus, and a histone  H1/H5-like DNA-binding domain in the middle of the protein sequence. Both  proteins are expressed in various A. thaliana tissues. Using the two-hybrid  system interaction between the proteins AtTBP2 and AtTBP3 and self interactions  of each of the proteins were detected. Gel-retardation assays revealed that each  of the two proteins is able to bind the G-rich strand and double-stranded DNA of  plant telomeric sequence with an affinity proportional to a number of telomeric  repeats. Substrates bearing a non-telomeric DNA sequence positioned between two  telomeric repeats were bound with an efficiency depending on the length of  interrupting sequence. The ability to bind variant telomere sequences decreased  with sequence divergence from the A. thaliana telomeric DNA. None of the proteins  alone or their mixture affects telomerase activity in vitro. Correspondingly, no  interaction was observed between any of two proteins and the Arabidopsis  telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit TERT (accession No. AF172097)  using two-hybrid assay.', '2004 Apr', 'Genome', '10.1139/g03-136', 'Fajkus']
