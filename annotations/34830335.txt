The food industry is still searching for novel solutions to effectively ensure the microbiological safety of food, especially fresh and minimally processed food products. Nowadays, the use of bacteriophages as potential biological control agents in microbiological food safety and preservation is a promising strategy. The aim of the study was the isolation and comprehensive characterization of novel bacteriophages with lytic activity against saprophytic bacterial microflora of minimally processed plant-based food products, such as mixed leaf salads. From 43 phages isolated from municipal sewage, four phages, namely <i>Enterobacter</i> phage KKP 3263, <i>Citrobacter</i> phage KKP 3664, <i>Enterobacter</i> phage KKP 3262, and <i>Serratia</i> phage KKP 3264 have lytic activity against <i>Enterobacter ludwigii</i> KKP 3083, <i>Citrobacter freundii</i> KKP 3655, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> KKP 3082, and <i>Serratia fonticola</i> KKP 3084 bacterial strains, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) identified <i>Enterobacter</i> phage KKP 3263 as an <i>Autographiviridae</i>, and <i>Citrobacter</i> phage KKP 3664, <i>Enterobacter</i> phage KKP 3262, and <i>Serratia</i> phage KKP 3264 as members of the <i>Myoviridae</i> family. Genome sequencing revealed that these phages have linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with sizes of 39,418 bp (KKP 3263), 61,608 bp (KKP 3664), 84,075 bp (KKP 3262), and 148,182 bp (KKP 3264). No antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, integrase, recombinase, or repressors, which are the main markers of lysogenic viruses, were annotated in phage genomes. <i>Serratia</i> phage KKP 3264 showed the greatest growth inhibition of <i>Serratia fonticola</i> KKP 3084 strain. The use of MOI 1.0 caused an almost 5-fold decrease in the value of the specific growth rate coefficient. The phages retained their lytic activity in a wide range of temperatures (from -20 °C to 50 °C) and active acidity values (pH from 4 to 11). All phages retained at least 70% of lytic activity at 60 °C. At 80 °C, no lytic activity against tested bacterial strains was observed. <i>Serratia</i> phage KKP 3264 was the most resistant to chemical factors, by maintaining high lytic activity across a broader range of pH from 3 to 11. The results indicated that these phages could be a potential biological control agent against saprophytic bacterial microflora of minimally processed plant-based food products.
