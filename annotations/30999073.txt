Functions of domains or motifs, which are encoded by the transit peptide (TP) of the precursor of the small subunit of Rubisco (prSSU), have been investigated intensively in dicots. Functional characterization of the prSSU TP, however, is still understudied in maize. In this study, we found that the TP of maize prSSU1 did not function fully in chloroplast targeting in Arabidopsis or vice versa, indicating the divergent function of TPs in chloroplast targeting between maize and Arabidopsis. Through deletion or substitution assays, we found that the N-terminal region of maize or Arabidopsis prSSU1 was necessary and sufficient for importing specifically the fused-green fluorescent protein (GFP) into each corresponding chloroplast. Finally, we found that the first-five amino acids and MM motif in the N-terminal domain of the maize TP played an essential role in maize chloroplast targeting. Thus, our analyses demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of the prSSU1 TP is the key determinant in chloroplast targeting between maize and Arabidopsis. Our study highlights the unique properties of the maize prSSU1 TP in chloroplast targeting, thus helping to understand the role of N-terminal domain in chloroplast targeting across species. It will help to manipulate chloroplast transit peptides (cTPs) for crop bioengineering.
