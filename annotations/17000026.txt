A study was conducted, using rapid time course of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence parameters, and light-response curves of Chl fluorescence parameters, to determine the induction requirements and response of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry and non-photochemical reactions after changes in irradiance in greenhouse mulberry plants. The induction of PSII photochemistry rapidly approached to steady state after leaves were treated from darkness to low irradiance (LI). When irradiance of leaves changed from darkness to high irradiance (HI), a biphasic induction was observed. A slight photoinhibition occurred in the leaves exposed to sunlight coming to the greenhouse, whereas a chronic photoinhibition occurred in the leaves fully exposed to sunlight outside the greenhouse. The chronic photoinhibition was demonstrated by sustained reduction of maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm). Moreover, the leaves of mulberry plants in greenhouse were sensitive to abrupt changes in irradiance and the sensitivity of leaves suffered in a short-term (1h) high light treatment was reduced, based on the changes in photosynthetic quantum conversion. These results demonstrated an inducible response of photosynthetic quantum conversion to changes in irradiance in mulberry.

PSII photochemistry: !induction rapidly approaches! steady state
Irradiance: !induces! PSII photochemistry
Irradiance: !causes! photoinhibition
High light treatment: !reduces sensitivity of! leaves 
Photosynthetic quantum conversion: !responds to! changes in irradiance
