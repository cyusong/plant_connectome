CG and CHG methylation levels in the rapid shoot growth stages (ST2-ST4) of woody bamboos were obviously decreased, which might regulate the internode elongation during rapid shoot growth, while CHH methylation was strongly associated with shoot developmental time or age. DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of plant growth and development. Woody bamboos have a unique trait of rapid stem growth resulted from internode elongation at the shooting period. However, it is still unclear whether DNA methylation significantly controls the bamboo rapid stem growth. Here we present whole-genome DNA methylation profiles of the paleotropical woody bamboo Bonia amplexicaulis at five newly defined stages of shoot growth, named ST1-ST5. We found that CG and CHG methylation levels in the rapid shoot growth stages (ST2-ST4) were significantly lower than in the incubation (ST1) and plateau stages (ST5). The changes in methylation levels mainly occurred in flanking regions of genes and gene body regions, and 23647 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between ST1 and rapid shoot growth stages (ST2-ST4). Combined with transcriptome analysis, we found that DMR-related genes enriched in the auxin and jasmonic acid (JA) signal transduction, and other pathways closely related to plant growth. Intriguingly, CHH methylation was not involved in the rapid shoot growth, but strongly associated with shoot developmental time by gradually accumulating in transposable elements (TEs) regions. Overall, our results reveal the importance of DNA methylation in regulating the bamboo rapid shoot growth and suggest a role of DNA methylation associated with development time or age in woody bamboos.
