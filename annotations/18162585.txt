['18162585', 'Adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMK; adenylate kinase) catalyses the reversible  formation of ADP by the transfer of one phosphate group from ATP to AMP, thus  equilibrating adenylates. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains  10 genes with an adenylate/cytidylate kinase signature; seven of these are  identified as putative adenylate kinases. Encoded proteins of at least two  members of this Arabidopsis adenylate kinase gene family are targeted to  plastids. However, when the individual genes are disrupted, the phenotypes of  both mutants are strikingly different. Although absence of AMK2 causes only 30%  reduction of total adenylate kinase activity in leaves, there is loss of  chloroplast integrity leading to small, pale-looking plantlets from embryo to  seedling development. In contrast, no phenotype for disruption of the second  plastid adenylate kinase was found. From this analysis, we conclude that AMK2 is  the major activity for equilibration of adenylates and de novo synthesis of ADP  in the plastid stroma.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.114702', 'Zrenner']
