['23444343', 'Jasmonates are oxylipin signals that play important roles in the development of  fertile flowers and in defense against pathogens and herbivores in leaves. The  aim of this work was to understand the synthesis and function of jasmonates in  roots. Grafting experiments with a jasmonate-deficient mutant demonstrated that  roots produce jasmonates independently of leaves, despite low expression of  biosynthetic enzymes. Levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, jasmonic acid, and its  isoleucine derivative increased in roots upon osmotic and drought stress.  Wounding resulted in a decrease of preformed 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid concomitant  with an increase of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine. 13-Lipoxygenases  catalyze the first step of lipid oxidation leading to jasmonate production.  Analysis of 13-lipoxygenase-deficient mutant lines showed that only one of the  four 13-lipoxygenases, LOX6, is responsible and essential for stress-induced  jasmonate accumulation in roots. In addition, LOX6 was required for production of  basal 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid in leaves and roots. Loss-of-function mutants of  LOX6 were more attractive to a detritivorous crustacean and more sensitive to  drought, indicating that LOX6-derived oxylipins are important for the responses  to abiotic and biotic factors.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.214544', 'Berger']
