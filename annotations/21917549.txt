The Polycomb Group (PcG) pathway represses transcription through a mechanism conserved among plants and animals. PcG-mediated repression can determine spatial territories of gene expression, but it remains unclear whether PcG-mediated repression is a regulatory requirement for all targets. Here, we show the role of PcG proteins in the spatial regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a main activator of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana exclusively expressed in the vasculature. Strikingly, the loss of PcG repression causes down-regulation of FT. In addition, our results show how the effect of PcG-mediated regulation differs for target genes and that, for FT expression, it relies primarily on tissue differentiation.
