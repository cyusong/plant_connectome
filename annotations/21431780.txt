The constituents of plasma membrane proteins, particularly the integral membrane proteins, are closely associated with the differentiation of plant cells. Secondary vascular differentiation, which gives rise to the increase in plant stem diameter, is the key process by which the volume of the plant body grows. However, little is known about the plasma membrane proteins that specifically function in the vascular differentiation process. Proteomic analysis of the membrane proteins in poplar differentiating secondary vascular tissues led to the identification 226 integral proteins in differentiating xylem and phloem tissues. A majority of the integral proteins identified were receptors (55 proteins), transporters (34 proteins), cell wall formation related (27 proteins) or intracellular trafficking (17 proteins) proteins. Gene expression analysis in developing vascular cells further demonstrated that cambium differentiation involves the expression of a group of receptor kinases which mediate an array of signaling pathways during secondary vascular differentiation. This paper provides an outline of the protein composition of the plasma membrane in differentiating secondary vascular tissues and sheds light on the role of receptor kinases during secondary vascular development.
