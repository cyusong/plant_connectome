['24420572', 'A new gene, SG1, was identified in a slow-greening mutant (sg1) isolated from an  ethylmethanesulphonate-mutagenized population of Arabidopsis thaliana. The newly  formed leaves of sg1 were initially albino, but gradually became pale green.  After 3 weeks, the leaves of the mutant were as green as those of the wild-type  plants. Transmission electron microscopic observations revealed that the mutant  displayed delayed proplastid to chloroplast transition. The results of map-based  cloning showed that SG1 encodes a chloroplast-localized tetratricopeptide  repeat-containing protein. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR data  demonstrated the presence of SG1 gene expression in all tissues, particularly  young green tissues. The sg1 mutation disrupted the expression levels of several  genes associated with chloroplast development, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll  biosynthesis. The results of genetic analysis indicated that gun1 and gun4  partially restored the expression patterns of the previously detected  chloroplast-associated genes, thereby ameliorating the slow-greening phenotype of  sg1. Taken together, the results suggest that the newly identified protein, SG1,  is required for chloroplast development in Arabidopsis.', '2014 Mar', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ert463', 'Hou']
