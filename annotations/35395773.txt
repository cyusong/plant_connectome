['35395773', 'BACKGROUND: Many regulatory circuits in plants contain steps of targeted  proteolysis, with the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) as the mediator of these  proteolytic events. In order to decrease ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, we  inducibly expressed a ubiquitin variant with Arg at position 48 instead of Lys  (ubK48R). This variant acts as an inhibitor of proteolysis via the UPS, and  allowed us to uncover processes that are particularly sensitive to UPS  perturbation. RESULTS: Expression of ubK48R during germination leads to seedling  death. We analyzed the seedling transcriptome, proteome and metabolome 24 h post  ubK48R induction and confirmed defects in chloroplast development. We found that  mutations in single genes can suppress seedling lethality, indicating that a  single process in seedlings is critically sensitive to decreased performance of  the UPS. Suppressor mutations in phototropin 2 (PHOT2) suggest that a  contribution of PHOT2 to chloroplast protection is compromised by proteolysis  inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results reveal protein turnover as an  integral part of a signal transduction chain that protects chloroplasts during  development.', '2022 Apr 8', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-022-03536-6', 'Bachmair']
