['15647902', 'A T-DNA insertion in the Arabidopsis thaliana DEK1 gene, encoding a calpain-like  cysteine proteinase with a predicted membrane anchor, causes unorganized embryo  development displaying irregular mitotic divisions in the embryo proper and  suspensor. Embryo development is arrested at the globular stage, and the embryo  proper lacks a defined protoderm. In the endosperm, the aleurone-like peripheral  cell layer is partly or completely lacking. The Arabidopsis DEK1 wild-type  transcript is expressed evenly throughout the endosperm and the embryo in  developing seed as determined using in situ hybridization. The conclusion that  the observed phenotype is caused by a T-DNA insertion in the Arabidopsis DEK1  gene is confirmed by complementation with the Arabidopisis DEK1 genomic sequence,  as well as analysis of a second T-DNA insertion allele. Over-expression of the  Arabidopsis DEK1 gene coding sequence under the control of the 35S promoter  causes a number of developmental phenotypes, including a global lack of  trichomes, leaves exhibiting improper dorsiventral symmetry and aberrant cell  organization in flowers. We interpret the data to suggest a role for DEK1 in  providing cells with positional clues for an appropriate developmental context  within plant tissues.', '2005 Jun', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-004-1448-6', 'Olsen']
