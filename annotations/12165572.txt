['12165572', 'Susceptibility to chilling injury prevents the cultivation of many important  crops and limits the extended storage of horticultural commodities. Although  freezing tolerance is acquired through cold-induced gene expression changes  mediated in part by the CBF family of transcriptional activators, whether plant  chilling resistance or sensitivity involves the CBF genes is not known. We report  here that an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant impaired in the cold-regulated  expression of CBF genes and their downstream target genes is sensitive to  chilling stress. Expression of CBF3 under a strong constitutive promoter restores  chilling resistance to the mutant plants. The mutated gene was cloned and found  to encode a nuclear localized RNA helicase. Our results identify a regulator of  CBF genes, and demonstrate the importance of gene regulation and the CBF  transcriptional activators in plant chilling resistance.', '2002 Aug 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.172399299', 'Zhu']
