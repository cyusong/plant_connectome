['10717008', 'Despite the recognition of H(2)O(2) as a central signaling molecule in stress and  wounding responses, pathogen defense, and regulation of cell cycle and cell  death, little is known about how the H(2)O(2) signal is perceived and transduced  in plant cells. We report here that H(2)O(2) is a potent activator of  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in Arabidopsis leaf cells. Using  epitope tagging and a protoplast transient expression assay, we show that  H(2)O(2) can activate a specific Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase  kinase kinase, ANP1, which initiates a phosphorylation cascade involving two  stress MAPKs, AtMPK3 and AtMPK6. Constitutively active ANP1 mimics the H(2)O(2)  effect and initiates the MAPK cascade that induces specific stress-responsive  genes, but it blocks the action of auxin, a plant mitogen and growth hormone. The  latter observation provides a molecular link between oxidative stress and auxin  signal transduction. Finally, we show that transgenic tobacco plants that express  a constitutively active tobacco ANP1 orthologue, NPK1, display enhanced tolerance  to multiple environmental stress conditions without activating previously  described drought, cold, and abscisic acid signaling pathways. Thus, manipulation  of key regulators of an oxidative stress signaling pathway, such as ANP1/NPK1,  provides a strategy for engineering multiple stress tolerance that may greatly  benefit agriculture.', '2000 Mar 14', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.97.6.2940', 'Sheen']
