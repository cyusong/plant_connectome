['24237140', 'Pseudomonas syringae delivers a plethora of effector proteins into host cells to  sabotage immune responses and modulate physiology to favor infection. The  P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 effector HopF2 suppresses Arabidopsis innate  immunity triggered by multiple microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP) at  the plasma membrane. We show here that HopF2 possesses distinct mechanisms for  suppression of two branches of MAMP-activated MAP kinase (MAPK) cascades. In  addition to blocking MKK5 (MAPK kinase 5) activation in the MEKK1 (MAPK kinase  kinase 1)/MEKKs-MKK4/5-MPK3/6 cascade, HopF2 targets additional component(s)  upstream of MEKK1 in the MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 cascade and the plasma  membrane-localized receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 and its homologs. We  further show that HopF2 directly targets BAK1, a plasma membrane-localized  receptor-like kinase that is involved in multiple MAMP signaling. The interaction  between BAK1 and HopF2 and between two other P. syringae effectors, AvrPto and  AvrPtoB, was confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Consistent with BAK1 as a  physiological target of AvrPto, AvrPtoB and HopF2, the strong growth defects or  lethality associated with ectopic expression of these effectors in wild-type  Arabidopsis transgenic plants were largely alleviated in bak1 mutant plants.  Thus, our results provide genetic evidence to show that BAK1 is a physiological  target of AvrPto, AvrPtoB and HopF2. Identification of BAK1 as an additional  target of HopF2 virulence not only explains HopF2 suppression of multiple MAMP  signaling at the plasma membrane, but also supports the notion that pathogen  virulence effectors act through multiple targets in host cells.', '2014 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12381', 'He']
