(1) Background: The growth of plants is impacted by salinity and alkali, <i>Lilium pumilum</i> (<i>L. pumilum</i>) is an ornamental plant with strong resistance to salinity and alkali, while the <i>LpPsbP</i> gene is helpful to fully understand the Saline-Alkali tolerance of <i>L. pumilum</i>. (2) Methods: Gene cloning, bioinformatics analysis, expression of fusion protein, determination of physiological indices of plant after Saline-Alkali stress, yeast two-hybrid screening, luciferase complementation assay, chromosome walking to obtain the promoter sequence, and then analyzed by PlantCARE. (3) Results: The <i>LpPsbP</i> gene was cloned and the fusion protein was purified. The transgenic plants had higher Saline-Alkali resistance than the wild type. A total of eighteen proteins interacting with LpPsbP were screened, and nine sites in the promoter sequence were analyzed. (4) Conclusion: Under Saline-Alkali or oxidative stress, <i>L. pumilum</i> will promote the expression of LpPsbP, which will then directly scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in order to protect its photosystem II, reduce its damage, and thus improve the Saline-Alkali resistance of the plant. Moreover, according to some of the literature and the following experiments, two additional speculations are developed on the mechanisms of how two newly found objects, namely jasmonic acid (JA) and FoxO protein, could be involved in ROS scavenging processes were made.

LpPsbP: !enhances! Saline-Alkali resistance
LpPsbP: !interacts with! 18 proteins
LpPsbP: !synthesizes! ROS scavenging
JA: !may interact with! LpPsbP
FoxO protein: !may interact with! LpPsbP
