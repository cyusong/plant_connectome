In this review, emphasis is given to the most recent updates about morpho-anatomical, physiological, biochemical and molecular responses adopted by plants to cope with B excess. Boron (B) is a unique micronutrient for plants given that the range of B concentration from its essentiality to toxicity is extremely narrow, and also because it occurs as an uncharged molecule (boric acid) which can pass lipid bilayers without any degree of controls, as occurs for other ionic nutrients. Boron frequently exceeds the plant's requirement in arid and semiarid environments due to poor drainage, and in agricultural soils close to coastal areas due to the intrusion of B-rich seawater in fresh aquifer or because of dispersion of seawater aerosol. Global releases of elemental B through weathering, volcanic and geothermal processes are also relevant in enriching B concentration in some areas. Considerable progress has been made in understanding how plants react to B toxicity and relevant efforts have been made to investigate: (I) B uptake and in planta partitioning, (II) physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes induced by B excess, with particular emphasis to the effects on the photosynthetic process, the B-triggered oxidative stress and responses of the antioxidant apparatus to B toxicity, and finally (III) mechanisms of B tolerance. Recent findings addressing the effects of B toxicity are reviewed here, intending to clarify the effect of B excess and to propose new perspectives aimed at driving future researches on the topic.
