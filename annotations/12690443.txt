['12690443', 'The control of the directionality of cell expansion was investigated using a  class of eight genes, the so-called DISTORTED (DIS) genes, that are required for  proper expansion of leaf trichomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. By tracing the  separation of latex beads placed on the trichome surface, we demonstrate that  trichomes grow by diffuse rather than tip growth, and that in dis mutants  deviations from the normal orientation of growth can occur in all possible  directions. We could not detect any differences in intracellular organization  between wild-type and dis-group mutants by electron microscopy. The analysis of  double mutants showed that although the expression of the dis phenotype is  generally independent of branching and endoreduplication, dis mutations act  synthetically in combination lesions in the ZWI gene, which encodes a kinesin  motor protein. Using a MAP4:GFP marker line, we show that the organization of  cortical microtubules is affected in dis-group mutants. The finding that most  dis-group mutants have actin defects suggested to us that actin is involved in  organizing the orientation of microtubules. By analyzing the microtubule  organization in plants treated with drugs that bind to actin, we verified that  actin is involved in the positioning of cortical microtubules and thereby in  plant cell expansion.', '2003 Jun', 'Mol Genet Genomics', '10.1007/s00438-003-0843-1', 'Hulskamp']
