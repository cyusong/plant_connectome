miR390s is an ancient family with a high level of conservation among plant miRNAs. Through the auxin signal transduction pathway, miR390 participates in diverse biological processes of plant growth and development. As an important Chinese traditional orchid, Cymbidium goeringii has unique flower shape and elegant fragrance. But its development has been greatly restricted because of the low flower bud differentiation and the difficult reproduction. This study aims to provide guidance for the role of cgo-miR390 in reproductive organ development to enhance the ornamental and economic value of Cymbidium. MIR390a, MIR390b and MIR390c of C. goeringii were cloned, and their length ranged from 130 to 150 nt. Each precursor sequence of cgo-miR390 contains 2 to 3 mature miRNAs. Three kinds of cgo-miR390s displayed distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns during floral development in C. goeringii. The overexpression of MIR390s alters morphology and function of stamens and pistils in Arabidopsis, such as enlargement of anther aspect ratio and separation of stylar and stigmas, which affects the development of fruits and seeds. In particular, the pollen amount decreased and the seed abortion rate increased in cgo-MIR390c-overexpressed plants. cgo-miR390 family affected the development of reproductive organs in transgenic Arabidopsis. The study provides references for the genetic improvement for orchid with potentially great economic benefit.
