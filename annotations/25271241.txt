In plant cells, soluble proteins are directed to vacuoles because they contain vacuolar sorting determinants (VSDs) that are recognized by vacuolar sorting receptors (VSR). To understand how a VSR recognizes its cargo, we present the crystal structures of the protease-associated domain of VSR isoform 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (VSR1PA) alone and complexed with a cognate peptide containing the barley (Hordeum vulgare) aleurain VSD sequence of 1ADSNPIRPVT10. The crystal structures show that VSR1PA binds the sequence, Ala-Asp-Ser, preceding the NPIR motif. A conserved cargo binding loop, with a consensus sequence of 95RGxCxF100, forms a cradle that accommodates the cargo-peptide. In particular, Arg-95 forms a hydrogen bond to the Ser-3 position of the VSD, and the essential role of Arg-95 and Ser-3 in receptor-cargo interaction was supported by a mutagenesis study. Cargo binding induces conformational changes that are propagated from the cargo binding loop to the C terminus via conserved residues in switch I-IV regions. The resulting 180° swivel motion of the C-terminal tail is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Glu-24 and His-181. A mutagenesis study showed that these two residues are essential for cargo interaction and trafficking. Based on our structural and functional studies, we present a model of how VSRs recognize their cargos.
