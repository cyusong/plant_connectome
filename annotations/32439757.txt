Plants are capable of regenerating new organs after mechanical injury. The regeneration process involves genome-wide reprogramming of transcription, which usually requires dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape. We show that the histone 3 variant HISTONE THREE RELATED 15 (H3.15) plays an important role in cell fate reprogramming during plant regeneration in <i>Arabidopsis</i> H3.15 expression is rapidly induced upon wounding. Ectopic overexpression of H3.15 promotes cell proliferation to form a larger callus at the wound site, whereas <i>htr15</i> mutation compromises callus formation. H3.15 is distinguished from other <i>Arabidopsis</i> histones by the absence of the lysine residue 27 that is trimethylated by the POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2) in constitutively expressed H3 variants. Overexpression of H3.15 promotes the removal of the transcriptional repressive mark H3K27me3 from chromatin, which results in transcriptional de-repression of downstream genes, such as <i>WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX 11</i> (<i>WOX11</i>). Our results reveal a new mechanism for a release from PRC2-mediated gene repression through H3.15 deposition into chromatin, which is involved in reprogramming cell fate to produce pluripotent callus cells.
