It has been shown that multidrug and toxic compound extrusion/detoxification (MATE/DTX) family transporters are involved in the regulation of plant development and stress response. Here, we characterized the <i>mini body1</i> (<i>mib1</i>) mutants in mungbean, which gave rise to increased branches, pentafoliate compound leaves, and shortened pods. Map-based cloning revealed that <i>MIB1</i> encoded a MATE/DTX family protein in mungbean. qRT-PCR analysis showed that <i>MIB1</i> was expressed in all tissues of mungbean, with the highest expression level in the young inflorescence. Complementation assays in <i>Escherichia coli</i> revealed that MIB1 potentially acted as a MATE/DTX transporter in mungbean. It was found that overexpression of the <i>MIB1</i> gene partially rescued the shortened pod phenotype of the <i>Arabidopsis dtx54</i> mutant. Transcriptomic analysis of the shoot buds and young pods revealed that the expression levels of several genes involved in the phytohormone pathway and developmental regulators were altered in the <i>mib1</i> mutants. Our results suggested that <i>MIB1</i> plays a key role in the control of plant architecture establishment in mungbean.
