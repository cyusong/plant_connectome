Plants are exposed to a plethora of abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, heavy metal and temperature stresses at different stages of their life cycle, from germination to seedling till the reproductive phase. As protective mechanisms, plants release signaling molecules that initiate a cascade of stress-signaling events, leading either to programmed cell death or plant acclimation. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S) and nitric oxide (NO) are considered as new 'gasotransmitter' molecules that play key roles in regulating gene expression, posttranslational modification (PTM), as well as cross-talk with other hormones. Although the exact role of NO in plants remains unclear and is species dependent, various studies have suggested a positive correlation between NO accumulation and environmental stress in plants. These molecules are also involved in a large array of stress responses and act synergistically or antagonistically as signaling components, depending on their respective concentration. This study provides a comprehensive update on the signaling interplay between H<sub>2</sub> S and NO in the regulation of various physiological processes under multiple abiotic stresses, modes of action and effects of exogenous application of these two molecules under drought, salt, heat and heavy metal stresses. However, the complete picture of the signaling cascades mediated by H<sub>2</sub> S and NO is still elusive. Recent researches indicate that during certain plant processes, such as stomatal closure, H<sub>2</sub> S could act upstream of NO signaling or downstream of NO in response to abiotic stresses by improving antioxidant activity in most plant species. In addition, PTMs of antioxidative pathways by these two molecules are also discussed.
