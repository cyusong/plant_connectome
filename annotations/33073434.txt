Lotus (family: Nelumbonaceae) are perennial aquatic plants that represent one of the most ancient basal dicots. In the present study, we resequenced 296 lotus accessions from various geographical locations and germplasms to explore their genomic diversity and population structure. This germplasm set consisted of four accessions of American wild lotus and 292 accessions of Asian lotus, which were divided into four subgroups: wild, rhizome, flower and seed. Total single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) suggested that the wild lotus had the highest variant number (7 191 010). Population structure and genome diversity analysis indicated that the American wild lotus demonstrated a distant genetic relationship with the Asian lotus. Furthermore, the seed and rhizome lotus groups had not originated from a single source but rather had a more complex multisource origin. Besides that, the seed lotus showed higher genetic diversity, which might have been due to the gene flow from the flower lotus to seed lotus by artificial crossing, and the rhizome lotus showed a much lower genetic diversity than the other groups. The present study provides SNP markers for lotus genomic diversity analysis, which will be useful for guiding lotus breeding.
