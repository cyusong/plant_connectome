Wheat production is increasingly threatened by the fungal disease, Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by <i>Fusarium</i> spp. The introduction of resistant varieties is considered to be an effective measure for containment of this disease. Mapping of FHB-resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) has promoted marker-assisted breeding for FHB resistance, which has been difficult through traditional breeding due to paucity of resistance genes and quantitative nature of the resistance. The lab of Ma previously cloned <i>Fhb1</i>, which inhibits FHB spread within spikes, and fine mapped <i>Fhb4</i> and <i>Fhb5</i>, which condition resistance to initial infection of <i>Fusarium</i> spp., from FHB-resistant indigenous line Wangshuibai (WSB). In this study, these three QTLs were simultaneously introduced into five modern Chinese wheat cultivars or lines with different ecological adaptations through marker-assisted backcross in early generations. A total of 14 introgression lines were obtained. All these lines showed significantly improved resistance to the fungal infection and disease spread in 2-year field trials after artificial inoculation. In comparison with the respective recipient lines, the <i>Fhb1, Fhb4</i>, and <i>Fhb5</i> pyramiding could reduce the disease severity by 95% and did not systematically affect plant height, productive tiller number, kernel number per spike, thousand grain weight, flowering time, and unit yield (without <i>Fusarium</i> inoculation). These results indicated the great value of FHB-resistance QTLs <i>Fhb1, Fhb4</i>, and <i>Fhb5</i> derived from WSB, and the feasibility and effectiveness of early generation selection for FHB resistance solely based on linked molecular markers.
