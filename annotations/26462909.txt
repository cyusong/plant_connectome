['26462909', 'The mitochondria of flowering plants have considerably larger and more complex  genomes than the mitochondria of animals or fungi, mostly due to recombination  activities that modulate their genomic structures. These activities most probably  participate in the repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lesions by  recombination-dependent processes. Rare ectopic recombination across short  repeats generates new genomic configurations that contribute to mtDNA  heteroplasmy, which drives rapid evolution of the sequence organization of plant  mtDNAs. We found that Arabidopsis thaliana RECG1, an ortholog of the bacterial  RecG translocase, is an organellar protein with multiple roles in mtDNA  maintenance. RECG1 targets to mitochondria and plastids and can complement a  bacterial recG mutant that shows defects in repair and replication control.  Characterization of Arabidopsis recG1 mutants showed that RECG1 is required for  recombination-dependent repair and for suppression of ectopic recombination in  mitochondria, most likely because of its role in recovery of stalled replication  forks. The analysis of alternative mitotypes present in a recG1 line and of their  segregation following backcross allowed us to build a model to explain how a new  stable mtDNA configuration, compatible with normal plant development, can be  generated by stoichiometric shift.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00680', 'ORCID:']
