The mediator complex is highly conserved in eukgaryotes and is integral for transcriptional responses. Mediator subunits associate with signal-responsive transcription factors (TF) to activate expression of specific signal-responsive genes. As the key TF of Arabidopsis thaliana senescence, ORESARA1 (ORE1) is required for nitrogen deficiency (-N) induced senescence; however, the mediator subunit that associates with ORE1 remains unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis MED19a associates with ORE1 to activate -N senescence-responsive genes. Disordered MED19a forms inducible nuclear condensates under -N that is regulated by decreasing MED19a lysine acetylation. MED19a carboxyl terminus (cMED19a) harbors a mixed-charged intrinsically disordered region (MC-IDR) required for ORE1 interaction and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Plant and human cMED19 are sufficient to form heterotypic condensates with ORE1. Human cMED19 MC-IDR, but not yeast cMED19 IDR, partially complements med19a suggesting functional conservation in evolutionarily distant eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic cMED19 revealed that the MC-IDR could arise through convergent evolution. Our result of MED19 MC-IDR suggests that plant MED19 is regulated by phase separation during stress responses.
