['9422718', 'We have identified and sequenced a cDNA containing a complete open reading frame  for a putative 340-amino acid precursor of the thylakoidal processing peptidase  from Arabidopsis thaliana. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein  includes regions highly conserved among Type I leader peptidases and indicates  that the enzyme uses a serine-lysine catalytic dyad mechanism. Phylogenetic  analysis indicated a common ancestry of the enzyme with those from oxygenic  photosynthetic prokaryotes, suggesting that the cDNA encoded the chloroplast  enzyme. The catalytic domain was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, generating a  product capable of cleaving the thylakoid-transfer domain from a chloroplast  protein. Antibodies to the overexpressed polypeptide cross-reacted with a 30-kDa  thylakoid membrane protein.', '1998 Jan 9', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.273.2.689', 'Howe']
