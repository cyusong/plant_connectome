In aerobes, anoxia impairs mitochondrial energy generation as well as biosynthesis and degradation of essential cell components. In a recent analysis we have shown that the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii responds to anaerobiosis in the dark by significant changes of the transcriptome, which, in summary, were directed at saving and economizing energy. Several of the transcriptional changes were related to photosynthesis and were accompanied by reduced amounts of chlorophylls and plastid lipids as well as lowered photosystem 2 quantum yields. A further noticeable pattern was a transcriptional upregulation of various genes encoding O 2 dependent enzymes of central biosynthetic pathways. However, cells do not divide in dark-anoxia, indicating that C. reinhardtii cannot compensate for the lack of O 2 and light. Upon return to aeration and light, cultures show severe photo-bleaching, which might be a stress reaction, but also part of an acclimation process or its disturbance.
