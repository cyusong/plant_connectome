Like bacteria, plastids contain sigma factors for promoter binding and transcription initiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that members of the plant sigma factor family can have specialized non-redundant roles in terms of promoter preference in various developmental and environmental situations. To specify regulatory determinants, we have chosen pairwise exchange of portions of Arabidopsis sigma coding regions, followed by transformation of the chimeric constructs into a sigma 6 knockout line. The resulting phenotypes and plastid RNA patterns point to an important though not exclusive role for the highly variable N-terminal portion of plant sigma proteins.
