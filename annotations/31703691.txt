Starch is the main storage substance in rice caryopsis and its properties will determine the quality of rice. Super rice has been extensively studied due to its high-yield characteristics, but the knowledge of amyloplast development and starch quality in caryopsis of super rice especially with large panicle is limited. To address this, large panicle typed and normal panicle typed super rice cultivar Yongyou2640 (YY2640) and Nangeng9108 (NG9108) were investigated in this study. The development of amyloplast in YY2640 caryopsis was better than NG9108, showing faster degradation rate of pericarp amyloplast and better filling degree of endosperm amyloplast. Meanwhile, the starch granule of YY2640 presented as polyhedral shape with smooth surface and the granule size was slightly larger than NG9108. The starch of YY2640 exhibited the lower amylose content, ratio of amylose to amylopectin and the higher level of amylopectin short and long branch-chains compared with NG9108, but there was no significant difference in amylopectin branching degree between them. Two rice starches both showed the characteristics of A-type crystal, and the relative crystallinity and external ordered degree of YY2640 starch were higher than those of NG9108. Furthermore, YY2640 starch showed better pasting properties with lower pasting temperature, shorter pasting time, higher peak viscosity, trough viscosity, breakdown value and lower setback value because of lower apparent amylose content. Overall, the development and filling of amyloplast in YY2640 caryopsis were better than those of NG9108, thus leading to better starch quality of YY2640.
