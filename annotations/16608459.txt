Here, we investigate fine-root production, mortality and standing crop of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings exposed to elevated atmospheric CO(2) and elevated air temperature. We hypothesized that these treatments would increase fine-root production, but that mortality would be greater under elevated temperature, leading to a smaller increase in standing crop. Seedlings were grown in outdoor, sun-lit controlled-environment chambers containing native soil. They were exposed in a factorial design to two levels of atmospheric CO(2) and two levels of air temperature. Minirhizotron methods were used to measure fine-root length production, mortality and standing crop every 4 wk for 36 months. Neither elevated atmospheric CO(2) nor elevated air temperature affected fine-root production, mortality, or standing crop. Fine roots appeared to root deeper in the soil profile under elevated CO(2) and elevated temperature. Low soil nitrogen (N) levels apparently limited root responses to the treatments. This suggests that forests on nutrient-poor soils may exhibit limited fine-root responses to elevated atmospheric CO(2) and elevated air temperature.
