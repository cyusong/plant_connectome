['18532976', 'In higher plants, multiple nuclear-encoded sigma factors activate select subsets  of plastid gene promoters in a partially redundant manner. We analysed the light  induction profiles of transcripts from six Arabidopsis sigma factor (AtSIG) genes  in mature leaves, focusing on the effects of wavelength and intensity. Red-light  illumination (660 nm) of dark-adapted plants strongly induced AtSIG1 transcripts,  while blue-light illumination (470 nm) caused strong and rapid induction of  AtSIG1 and AtSIG5 transcripts. The fluence response differed in  blue-light-responsive rapid induction in AtSIG1 and AtSIG5. AtSIG1 transcripts  increased to plateau with a threshold of 2 micromol m(-2) sec(-1) under all  fluences examined (1-50 micromol m(-2) sec(-1)), and AtSIG5 transcripts were  induced with a distinct two-phase profile, with the lower-fluence induction  similar to that of AtSIG1 and further enhancement with increasing fluences  greater than 10 micromol m(-2) sec(-1). Blue-light-receptor mutational analysis  revealed that AtSIG5-specific two-phase induction is mediated through  cryptochrome 1 and cryptochrome 2 at lower fluences and more significantly  through cryptochrome 1 at higher fluences. In mature chloroplasts, the promoters  of psbA and psbD are predominantly recognized by AtSIG5 among six sigma factors.  Using a protoplast transient expression assay with AtSIG5-AtSIG1 chimeric genes,  we present evidence that AtSIG5 contains determinants for activating the psbD  blue-light-responsive promoter (BLRP) in region 4.2 rather than region 2.4. Amino  acid scanning within AtSIG5 region 4.2 revealed that Asn484, but not Arg493,  functions as a key residue for psbD BLRP activation. Arginine 493 may be involved  in psbA promoter recognition.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03567.x', 'Toyoshima']
