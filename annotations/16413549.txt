['16413549', 'Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is a fundamental mechanism for  controlling a wide range of cellular functions. Cleavage of membrane embedded  proteins results in soluble fragments exerting their function, e.g., as  transcription factors and thereby regulating gene expression. This process is  highly conserved throughout all kingdom of life as are the involved proteases.  RIP has been described in eukaryotes, bacteria and archea though until recently  not in plant organelles. Here we describe a chloroplastic membrane protease which  belongs to the conserved S2P family of membrane metallo proteases. We show that  this protease is localized in the inner envelope membrane and is essential for  plant development. It could function in a RIP like process regulating the  concordant action in the plant cytosol, nucleus and plastids.', '2006 Feb 6', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.12.098', 'Soll']
