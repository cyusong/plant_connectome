Sugar signaling pathways have been evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes and are postulated to help regulate plant growth, development and responses to environmental cues. Forward genetic screens have identified sugar signaling or response mutants. Here we report the identification and characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana sugar insensitive8 (sis8) mutants, which display a sugar-resistant seedling development phenotype. Unlike many other sugar insensitive mutants, sis8 mutants exhibit wild-type responses to the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid and paclobutrazol (an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis) on seed germination. Positional cloning of the SIS8 gene revealed that it encodes a putative mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK; At1g73660). SIS8mRNA is expressed ubiquitously among Arabidopsis organs. A UDP-glucosyltransferase, UGT72E1 (At3g50740), was identified as an interacting partner of SIS8 based on a yeast two-hybrid screen and in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Both SIS8-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and UGT72E1-YFP fusion proteins localize to the nucleus when transiently expressed in tobacco leaf cells. T-DNA insertions in At3g50740 cause a sugar-insensitive phenotype. These results indicate that SIS8, a putative MAPKKK, is a regulator of sugar response in Arabidopsis and interacts with a UDP-glucosyltransferase in the nucleus.
