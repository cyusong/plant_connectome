To complete their life cycles, plants require several minerals that are found in soil. Plant growth and development can be affected by nutrient shortages or high nutrient availability. Several adaptations and evolutionary changes have enabled plants to cope with inappropriate growth conditions and low or high nutrient levels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized for transcript cleavage and translational reduction, and can be used for post-transcriptional regulation. Aside from regulating plant growth and development, miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating plant's adaptations to adverse environmental conditions. Additionally, miRNAs are involved in plants' sensory functions, nutrient uptake, long-distance root transport, and physiological functions related to nutrients. It may be possible to develop crops that can be cultivated in soils that are either deficient in nutrients or have extreme nutrient supplies by understanding how plant miRNAs are associated with nutrient stress. In this review, an overview is presented regarding recent advances in the understanding of plants' responses to nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, copper, iron, boron, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and calcium deficiencies via miRNA regulation. We conclude with future research directions emphasizing the modification of crops for improving future food security.
