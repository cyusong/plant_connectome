The timing of emergence of weed species has critical ecological and agronomical implications. In several species, emergence patterns largely depend on the level of dormancy of the seedbank, which is modulated by specific environmental factors. In addition, environmental conditions during seed maturation on the mother plant can have marked effects on the dormancy level at the time of seed dispersal. Hence, the maternal environment has been suggested to affect seedbank dormancy dynamics and subsequent emergence; however, this modulation has not been adequately examined under field conditions, and the mechanisms involved are only partly understood. Combining laboratory and field experiments with population-based models, we investigated how dormancy level and emergence in the field are affected by the sowing date and photoperiod experienced by the mother plant in Amaranthus hybridus, a troublesome weed worldwide. The results showed that an earlier sowing date and a longer photoperiod enhanced the level of dormancy by increasing the dormancy imposed by both the embryo and the seed coat. However, this did not affect the timing and extent of emergence in the field; on the contrary, the variations in dormancy level contributed to synchronizing the emergence of the next generation of plants with the time period that maximized population fitness. Our results largely correspond with effects previously observed in other species such as Polygonum aviculare and Arabidopsis, suggesting a common effect exists within different species.
