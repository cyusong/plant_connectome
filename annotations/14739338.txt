['14739338', 'The light environment is a key factor that governs a multitude of developmental  processes during the entire life cycle of plants. An important and increasing  part of the incident sunlight encompasses a segment of the UV-B region (280-320  nm) that is not entirely absorbed by the ozone layer in the stratosphere of the  earth. This portion of the solar radiation, which inevitably reaches the sessile  plants, can act both as an environmental stress factor and an informational  signal. To identify Arabidopsis genes involved in the UV response, we monitored  the gene expression profile of UV-B-irradiated seedlings by using high-density  oligonucleotide microarrays comprising almost the full Arabidopsis genome  (>24,000 genes). A robust set of early low-level UV-B-responsive genes, 100  activated and 7 repressed, was identified. In all cases analyzed, UV-B induction  was found to be independent of known photoreceptors. This group of genes is  suggested to represent the molecular readout of the signaling cascade triggered  by the elusive UV-B photoreceptor(s). Moreover, our analysis identified  interactions between cellular responses to different UV-B ranges that led us to  postulate the presence of partially distinct but interacting UV-B perception and  signaling mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that the bZIP transcription factor  HY5 is required for UV-B-mediated regulation of a subset of genes.', '2004 Feb 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0308044100', 'Nagy']
