The BRI1-EMS suppressor 1 (BES1)/brassinazole-resistant 1(BZR1) transcription factors play crucial roles in plant growth, development, and stress response. However, little is known about the function of maize's BES1/BZR1s. In this study, the <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-3</i> and <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-9</i> genes were cloned from maize's inbred line, B73, and they were functionally evaluated by analyzing their expression pattern, subcellular localization, transcriptional activation activity, as well as their heterologous expression in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, respectively. The results of the qRT-PCR showed that the <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-3</i> and <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-9</i> genes were predominantly expressed in the root, and their expression was significantly down-regulated by drought stress. The ZmBES1/BZR1-3 and ZmBES1/BZR1-9 proteins localized in the nucleus but showed no transcriptional activation activity as a monomer. Subsequently, it was found that the heterologous expression of the <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-3</i> and <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-9</i> genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> decreased drought tolerance, respectively. The transgenic lines showed a more serious wilting phenotype, shorter root length, lower fresh weight, and higher relative electrolyte leakage (REL) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content compared to the control under drought stress. The RNA-sequencing data showed that the 70.67% and 93.27% differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly down-regulated in <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-3</i> and <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-9</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>, respectively. The DEGs of <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-3</i> gene's expressing lines were mainly associated with oxidative stress response and amino acid metabolic process and enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. But the DEGs of the <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-9</i> gene's expressing lines were predominantly annotated with water deprivation, extracellular stimuli, and jasmonic acid and enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, <i>ZmBES1/BZR1-9</i> increased stomatal aperture in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> under drought stress. This study indicates that ZmBES1/BZR1-3 and ZmBES1/BZR1-9 negatively regulate drought tolerance via different pathways in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and it provides insights into the underlying the function of BES1/BZR1s in crops.
