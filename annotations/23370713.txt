<b>Summary:</b> By aligning QTLs from many populations and several species, this study increases knowledge of the genetic control of agriculturally and developmentally important traits in the Saccharinae clade of grasses, expedites translation of knowledge from better-studied to less-studied species, and facilitates investigation of fundamental questions across the genomes and paleoduplicated “subgenomes” of divergent taxa.
