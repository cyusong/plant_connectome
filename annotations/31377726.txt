NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2 (NAC) domain transcription factors function as master switches in regulating secondary cell wall (SCW) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stems. Despite the importance of these NACs in fiber development, the upstream signal is still elusive. Using a large-scale mutant screening, we identified a dominant activation-tagging mutant, <i>fiberless-d</i> (<i>fls-d</i>), showing defective SCW development in stem fibers, similar to that of the <i>nac secondary wall thickening promoting factor1-1</i> (<i>nst1-1</i>)<i>nst3-3</i> double mutant. Overexpression of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN29</i> (<i>LBD29</i>) is responsible for the <i>fls-d</i> mutant phenotypes. By contrast, loss-of-function of <i>LBD29</i>, either in the dominant repression transgenic lines or in the transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant <i>lbd29-1</i>, enhanced SCW development in fibers. Genetic analysis and transgenic studies demonstrated <i>LBD29</i> depends on master regulators in mediating SCW biosynthesis, specifically <i>NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1</i> (<i>NST1</i>), <i>NST</i>2, and <i>NST</i>3. Increasing indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels, either in stem tissues above a <i>N</i>-1-naphthylphthalamic acid-treated region or in plants directly sprayed with IAA, inhibits fiber wall thickening. The inhibition effect of naphthylphthalamic acid treatment and exogenous IAA application depends on a known auxin signaling pathway involving AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and LBD29. These results demonstrate auxin is upstream of LBD29 in repressing NAC master regulators, and therefore shed new light on the regulation of SCW biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
