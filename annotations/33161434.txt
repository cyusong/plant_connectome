Nitro-fatty acids are generated from the interaction of unsaturated fatty acids and nitric oxide (NO)-derived molecules. The endogenous occurrence and modulation throughout plant development of nitro-linolenic acid (NO2-Ln) and nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) suggest a key role for these molecules in initial development stages. In addition, NO2-Ln content increases significantly in stress situations and induces the expression of genes mainly related to abiotic stress, such as genes encoding members of the heat shock response family and antioxidant enzymes. The promoter regions of NO2-Ln-induced genes are also involved mainly in stress responses. These findings confirm that NO2-Ln is involved in plant defense processes against abiotic stress conditions via induction of the chaperone network and antioxidant systems. NO2-Ln signaling capacity lies mainly in its electrophilic nature and allows it to mediate a reversible post-translational modification called nitroalkylation, which is capable of modulating protein function. NO2-Ln is a NO donor that may be involved in NO signaling events and is able to generate S-nitrosoglutathione, the major reservoir of NO in cells and a key player in NO-mediated abiotic stress responses. This review describes the current state of the art regarding the essential role of nitro-fatty acids as signaling mediators in development and abiotic stress processes.
