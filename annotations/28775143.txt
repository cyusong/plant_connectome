Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signaling components to regulate their development. Among the light signaling components identified to date, HY5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, has been investigated extensively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), a dicot. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we identified three homologs of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 homolog) homologs are absent in the monocots analyzed. Out of the three homologs identified in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we have functionally characterized <i>OsbZIP48</i><i>OsbZIP48</i> was able to complement the <i>Athy5</i> mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in rice. Moreover, the OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark-grown rice and <i>Athy5</i> seedlings complemented with <i>OsbZIP48</i>, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison with <i>AtHY5</i>, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the overexpression of full-length <i>OsbZIP48</i> in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that <i>OsKO2</i>, which encodes <i>ent</i>-kaurene oxidase 2 of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>OE</sup></i> and up-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>KD</sup></i> transgenics as compared with the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 binds directly to the <i>OsKO2</i> promoter. The RNA interference lines and the T-DNA insertional mutant of <i>OsbZIP48</i> showed seedling-lethal phenotypes despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development in the T-DNA insertional mutant. These data provide credible evidence that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot system like rice in comparison with its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.
