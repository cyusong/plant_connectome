Maize is an important feed and industrial cereal crop and is crucial for global food security. The development of drought-tolerant genotypes is a major aim of breeding programs to fight water scarcity and maintain sustainable maize production. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a family of proteins related to osmotic regulation that widely exist in organisms. Here, we implemented a previously generated maize transcriptomic dataset to identify a drought-responsive gene designated ZmNHL1. Bioinformatics analysis of ZmNHL1 showed that the protein encoded by ZmNHL1 belongs to the LEA-2 protein family. Tissue specific expression analysis showed that ZmNHL1 is relatively abundant in stems and leaves, highly expressed in tassels and only slightly expressed in roots, pollens and ears. Moreover, the activity of SOD and POD of plants from three 35S::ZmNHL1 transgenic lines under either the induced drought stress conditions (by 20% PEG6000) or the natural water deficit treatment (by water withholding) were higher than that of the WT plants, while the electrolyte leakage of the 35S::ZmNHL1 transgenic plants was lower than that of the WT plants under both drought treatments. Our data further revealed that ZmNHL1 promotes maize tolerance to drought stress in 35S::ZmNHL1 transgenic plants by improving ROS scavenging and maintaining the cell membrane permeability. Overall, our data revealed that ZmNHL1 promotes maize tolerance to drought stress and contributes to provide elite germplasm resources for maize drought tolerance breeding programs.
