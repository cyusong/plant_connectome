['10205894', 'The physiological acclimation of plants to osmotic stresses involves a complex  programme of gene regulation. In one signalling pathway, elevated levels of  abscisic acid (ABA) activate a subset of stress genes. Because ABA responses lack  a definable morphological phenotype, we have screened for mutants that exhibit  deregulated ABA-responsive gene expression. To monitor this ABA response, a line  of Arabidopsis thaliana carrying a transgene composed of the ABA-responsive  Arabidopsis kin2 promoter fused to the coding sequence for the firefly luciferase  gene, kin2::luc, was generated. Patterns of ABA-responsive luciferase activity  were monitored by photon counting. In contrast to wild-type plants which display  a transient activation of kin2::luc, an ABA deregulated gene expression mutant  (ade1) exhibits both sustained and enhanced levels of transgene activity. Levels  of kin2, cor47 and rab18 expression in ade1 plants are also enhanced and  prolonged indicating that the molecular mechanism(s) altered in ade1 plants  affects the regulation of other ABA-responsive genes. The mutant phenotype is  specific for the ABA response as cold-inducible kin2 expression is unaltered in  ade1 plants. Genetic analyses indicate that the ade1 mutant is a monogenic  recessive trait. A role for negative regulator function in ABA signalling is  discussed.', '1999 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00384.x', 'Chua']
