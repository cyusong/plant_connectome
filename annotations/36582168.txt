High yield and stress resistance are the major prerequisites for successful crop cultivation, and can be achieved by modifying plant architecture. Evolutionarily conserved growth-regulating factors (GRFs) control the growth of different tissues and organs of plants. Here, we provide a systematic overview of the expression patterns of GRF genes and the structural features of GRF proteins in different plant species. Moreover, we illustrate the conserved and divergent roles of GRFs, microRNA396 (miR396), and GRF-interacting factors (GIFs) in leaf, root, and flower development. We also describe the molecular networks involving the miR396-GRF-GIF module, and illustrate how this module coordinates with different signaling molecules and transcriptional regulators to control development of different plant species. GRFs promote leaf growth, accelerate grain filling, and increase grain size and weight. We also provide some molecular insight into how coordination between GRFs and other signaling modules enhances crop productivity; for instance, how the GRF-DELLA interaction confers yield-enhancing dwarfism while increasing grain yield. Finally, we discuss how the GRF-GIF chimera substantially improves plant transformation efficiency by accelerating shoot formation. Overall, we systematically review the conserved and divergent roles of GRFs and the miR396-GRF-GIF module in growth regulation, and also provide insights into how GRFs can be utilized to improve the productivity and nutrient content of crop plants.
