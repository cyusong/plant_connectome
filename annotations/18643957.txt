Higher water use efficiency (WUE) in C(4) plants may allow for greater xylem safety because transpiration rates are reduced. To evaluate this hypothesis, stem hydraulics and anatomy were compared in 16 C(3), C(3)-C(4) intermediate, C(4)-like and C(4) species in the genus Flaveria. The C(3) species had the highest leaf-specific conductivity (K(L)) compared with intermediate and C(4) species, with the perennial C(4) and C(4)-like species having the lowest K(L) values. Xylem-specific conductivity (K(S)) was generally highest in the C(3) species and lower in intermediate and C(4) species. Xylem vessels were shorter, narrower and more frequent in C(3)-C(4) intermediate, C(4)-like and C(4) species compared with C(3) species. WUE values were approximately double in the C(4)-like and C(4) species relative to the C(3)-C(4) and C(3) species. C(4)-like photosynthesis arose independently at least twice in Flaveria, and the trends in WUE and K(L) were consistent in both lineages. These correlated changes in WUE and K(L) indicate WUE increase promoted K(L) decline during C(4) evolution; however, any involvement of WUE comes late in the evolutionary sequence. C(3)-C(4) species exhibited reduced K(L) but little change in WUE compared to C(3) species, indicating that some reduction in hydraulic efficiency preceded increases in WUE.
