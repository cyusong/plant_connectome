Meristem fate is regulated by trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatases (TPPs), but their mechanism of action remains mysterious. Loss of the maize TPPs RAMOSA3 and TPP4 leads to reduced meristem determinacy and more inflorescence branching. However, analysis of an allelic series revealed no correlation between enzymatic activity and branching, and a catalytically inactive version of RA3 complements the ra3 mutant. Together with their nuclear localization, these findings suggest a moonlighting function for TPPs.

TPPs: !regulate! Meristem fate
Loss of TPPs: !leads to! Reduced meristem determinacy and more inflorescence branching
RA3: !localizes to! Nuclear
RA3: !complements! ra3 mutant
