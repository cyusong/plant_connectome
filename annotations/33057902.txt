Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 8004 secretes several effector proteins that interfere with plant phosphorylation. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) can infect cruciferous plants and cause black rot. The strain Xcc8004 secretes effector proteins that interfere with plant cellular processes into host cells using a type III secretion (T3S) system. Several of the 24 predicted T3S effectors in the Xcc8004 genome have been implicated in the suppression of the Arabidopsis thaliana pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) response. We used an A. thaliana mesophyll protoplast-based assay to identify Xcc8004 T3S effectors that effectively interfere with PTI signalling induced by the bacterial peptide flg22. 11 of the 24 tested effector proteins (XopK, XopQ, HrpW, XopN, XopAC, XopD, XopZ1, XopAG, AvrBs2, XopL and XopX-1) inhibited expression of the flg22-inducible gene FRK1, and five effectors (XopK, XopG, XopQ, XopL and XopX-1) inhibited the expression of the flg22-inducible gene WRKY33. Therefore, there are 12 effector proteins that can inhibit the expression of relevant flg22-inducible genes. It was further investigated whether the 12 effector proteins affect the phosphorylation activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases MPK3/MPK6, and four effector proteins (XopK, XopQ, XopZ1 and XopX-1) were found to markedly inhibit MPK3/MPK6 activation. Moreover, a subcellular localisation analysis revealed that the tested effectors were localised within various subcellular compartments. These results indicate that multiple T3S effectors in the Xcc8004 genome interfere with flg22-induced PTI signalling via various molecular mechanisms.
