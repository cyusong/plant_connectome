The importance of the glutathione pool in the development of reproductive tissues and in pollen tube growth was investigated in wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis thaliana, a reporter line expressing redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP2), and a glutathione-deficient cad2-1 mutant (cad2-1/roGFP2). The cad2-1/roGFP2 flowers had significantly less reduced glutathione (GSH) and more glutathione disulfide (GSSG) than WT or roGFP2 flowers. The stigma, style, anther, germinated pollen grains, and pollen tubes of roGFP2 flowers had a low degree of oxidation. However, these tissues were more oxidized in cad2-1/roGFP2 flowers than the roGFP2 controls. The ungerminated pollen grains were significantly more oxidized than the germinated pollen grains, indicating that the pollen cells become reduced upon the transition from the quiescent to the metabolically active state during germination. The germination percentage was lower in cad2-1/roGFP2 pollen and pollen tube growth arrested earlier than in roGFP2 pollen, demonstrating that increased cellular reduction is essential for pollen tube growth. These findings establish that ungerminated pollen grains exist in a relatively oxidized state compared with germinating pollen grains. Moreover, failure to accumulate glutathione and maintain a high GSH/GSSG ratio has a strong negative effect on pollen germination.
