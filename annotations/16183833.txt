['16183833', 'Plant acclimation to environmental stress is controlled by a complex network of  regulatory genes that compose distinct stress-response regulons. In contrast to  many signaling and regulatory genes that are stress specific, the zinc-finger  protein Zat12 responds to a large number of biotic and abiotic stresses. Zat12 is  thought to be involved in cold and oxidative stress signaling in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana); however, its mode of action and regulation are largely  unknown. Using a fusion between the Zat12 promoter and the reporter gene  luciferase, we demonstrate that Zat12 expression is activated at the  transcriptional level during different abiotic stresses and in response to a  wound-induced systemic signal. Using Zat12 gain- and loss-of-function lines, we  assign a function for Zat12 during oxidative, osmotic, salinity, high light, and  heat stresses. Transcriptional profiling of Zat12-overexpressing plants and  wild-type plants subjected to H(2)O(2) stress revealed that constitutive  expression of Zat12 in Arabidopsis results in the enhanced expression of  oxidative- and light stress-response transcripts. Under specific growth  conditions, Zat12 may therefore regulate a collection of transcripts involved in  the response of Arabidopsis to high light and oxidative stress. Our results  suggest that Zat12 plays a central role in reactive oxygen and abiotic stress  signaling in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.068254', 'Mittler']
