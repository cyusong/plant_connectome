The aurea mutants of tomato have been widely used as phytochrome-deficient mutants for photomorphogenetic and photobiological studies. By expressed sequence tag (EST)-based screening of sequence databases, we found a tomato gene that encodes a protein homologous to Arabidopsis HY2 for phytochromobilin synthase catalyzing the last step of phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. The tomato protein expressed in Escherichia coli showed phytochromobilin synthase activity. The corresponding loci in all aurea mutants tested have nucleotide substitutions, deletions or DNA rearrangements. These results indicate that aurea is a mutant of phytochromobilin synthase in tomato. We also discuss a phylogenetic analysis of phytochromobilin synthases in the bilin reductase family.
