Auxin-autonomous growth in vitro may be related to the integration and expression of the aux and rol genes from the root-inducing (Ri) plasmid in plant cells infected by agropine-type Agrobacterium rhizogenes. To elucidate the functions of the aux and rol genes in plant cell division, plant cell lines transformed with the aux1 and aux2 genes or with the rolABCD genes were established using tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells. The introduction of the aux1 and aux2 genes enabled the auxin-autonomous growth of BY-2 cells, but the introduction of the rolABCD genes did not affect the auxin requirement of the BY-2 cells. The results clearly show that the aux genes are necessary for auxinautotrophic cell division, and that the rolABCD genes are irrelevant in auxin autotrophy.

aux1: !enables! auxin-autonomous growth
aux2: !enables! auxin-autonomous growth
rolABCD: !irrelevant in! auxin autotrophy
