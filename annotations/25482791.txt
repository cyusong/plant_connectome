Externally supplied protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) affects root development of Arabidopsis, increasing root biomass, root hair length, and root thickness. While these changes in root morphology may enhance access to soil microenvironments rich in organic matter, we show here that the presence of protein in the growth medium increases the plant's resilience to the root pathogen Cylindrocladium sp.
