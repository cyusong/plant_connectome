A multilocus genome-wide association study of a panel of 369 diverse wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes was carried out in order to examine the genetic basis of variations in nutrient mineral concentrations in the grains. The panel was grown under field conditions for three consecutive years and the concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, and S were determined. Wide ranges of natural variation were detected among the genotypes. Strong positive correlations were found among the minerals except for K, which showed negative correlation trends with the other minerals. Genetic association analysis detected 86 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) underlying the natural variations in mineral concentrations in grains. The major MTA was detected on the long arm of chromosome 5A and showed a pleiotropic effect on Ca, K, Mg, Mn, and S. Further significant MTAs were distributed among the whole genome except for chromosomes 3D and 6D. We identified putative candidate genes that are potentially involved in metal uptake, transport, and assimilation, including TraesCS5A02G542600 on chromosome 5A, which was annotated as a Major Facilitator Superfamily transporter and acted on all the minerals except K. TraesCS5A02G542600 was highly expressed in seed coat, and to a lesser extent in the peduncle, awns, and lemma. Our results provide important insights into the genetic basis of enhancement of nutrient mineral concentrations that can help to inform future breeding studies in order to improve human nutrition.
