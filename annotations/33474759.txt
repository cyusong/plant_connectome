Plants display remarkable developmental flexibility as they continuously sense and respond to changes in their environment. This flexibility allows them to select the optimal timing for critical developmental decisions such as when to flower. Ambient temperature is a major environmental factor that influences flowering; the mechanisms involved in ambient temperature-responsive flowering have attracted particular attention as a consequence of the effects of global climate change on temperature. PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 and alternative splicing of FLOWERING LOCUS M affect temperature-responsive flowering; however, the exact temperature-sensing mechanism in plants remains elusive. Further study of these molecular mechanisms will contribute to our understanding of how plants sense ambient temperature and respond via diverse biological signaling cascades.
