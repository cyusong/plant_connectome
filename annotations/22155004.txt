['22155004', 'D-Lactate negatively affects Arabidopsis thaliana seedling development in a  concentration-dependent manner. At media D-lactate concentrations greater than  5-10mM the development of wild-type plants is arrested shortly after germination  whereas plants overexpressing the endogenous D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH)  detoxify D-lactate to pyruvate and survive. When the transgenic plants are  further transferred to normal growth conditions they develop indistinguishably  from the wild type. Thus, D-LDH was successfully established as a new marker in  A. thaliana allowing selecting transgenic plants shortly after germination. The  selection on D-lactate containing media adds a new optional marker system, which  is especially useful if the simultaneous selection of multiple constructs is  desired.', '2012 Jan 2', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2011.11.020', 'Maurino']
