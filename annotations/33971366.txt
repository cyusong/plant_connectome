Light is a critical environmental cue that regulates a variety of diverse plant developmental processes. Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) is the major photoreceptor that mediates blue light-dependent photomorphogenic responses such as the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Gibberellin (GA) participates in the repression of photomorphogenesis and promotes hypocotyl elongation. However, the antagonistic interaction between blue light and GA is not well understood. Here, we report that blue light represses GA-induced degradation of the DELLA proteins (DELLAs), which are key negative regulators in the GA signaling pathway, via CRY1, thereby inhibiting the GA response during hypocotyl elongation. Both in vitro and in vivo biochemical analyses demonstrated that CRY1 physically interacts with GA receptors-GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 proteins (GID1s)-and DELLAs in a blue light-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that CRY1 inhibits the association between GID1s and DELLAs. Genetically, CRY1 antagonizes the function of GID1s to repress the expression of cell elongation-related genes and thus hypocotyl elongation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CRY1 coordinates blue light and GA signaling for plant photomorphogenesis by stabilizing DELLAs through the binding and inactivation of GID1s, providing new insights into the mechanism by which blue light antagonizes the function of GA in photomorphogenesis.
