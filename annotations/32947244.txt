MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding molecules that modulate gene expression through targeting mRNA by specific-sequence cleavage, translation inhibition, or transcriptional regulation. miRNAs are key molecules in regulatory networks in abiotic stresses such as salt stress and water deficit in plants. Throughout the world, soybean is a critical crop, the production of which is affected by environmental stress conditions. In this study, RNA-Seq libraries from leaves of soybean under salt treatment were analyzed. 17 miRNAs and 31 putative target genes were identified with inverse differential expression patterns, indicating miRNA-target interaction. The differential expression of six miRNAs, including miR482bd-5p, and their potential targets, were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The miR482bd-5p expression was repressed, while its potential HEC1 and BAK1 targets were increased. Polyethylene glycol experiment was used to simulate drought stress, and miR482bd-5p, HEC1, and BAK1 presented a similar expression pattern, as found in salt stress. Histone modifications occur in response to abiotic stress, where histone deacetylases (HDACs) can lead to gene repression and silencing. The miR482bd-5p epigenetic regulation by histone deacetylation was evaluated by using the SAHA-HDAC inhibitor. The miR482bd-5p was up-regulated, and HEC1 was down-regulated under SAHA-salt treatment. It suggests an epigenetic regulation, where the miRNA gene is repressed by HDAC under salt stress, reducing its transcription, with an associated increase in the HEC1 target expression.
