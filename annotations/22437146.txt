An efficient micropropagation protocol has been developed for Dendrobium officinale, through protocorm-like bodies (PLBs). A correlation between enhanced differentiation of PLBs of D. officinale by ultrasound and changes in the levels of endogenous hormones and the antioxidant enzyme activities was described. Ultrasound treatments improved the conversion of PLBs of D. officinale to shoots. The highest conversion frequency of PLBs to shoots was obtained following the ultrasound treatment at 300 W for 5 min. Compared to the control, the enhanced conversion of PLBs to shoots following the ultrasound treatment was accompanied by an increase in the ratio of total cytokinins (CTKs) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which was due to a decrease in the endogenous level of IAA and an increase in the endogenous level of total CTKs. Analysis of enzyme activities indicated that the increased endogenous level of total CTKs driven by ultrasound was associated with the inhibition of CTK decomposition by CTK oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6), while the decreased endogenous level of IAA was associated with the promotion of IAA decomposition by IAA oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3). In addition, ultrasound treatment increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) and peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) in the conversion process of PLBs to shoots.
