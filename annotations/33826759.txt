Drought stress alters gene expression and causes cellular damage in crop plants. Drought inhibits photosynthesis by reducing the content and the activity of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, ultimately decreasing the crop yield. The role of aquaporins (AQP) in improving the growth and adaptation of crop plants under drought stress is of importance. AQP form channels and control water transport in and out of the cells and are associated with drought tolerance mechanisms. The current review addresses: (1) the evolution of AQPs in plants, (2) the classification of plant AQPs, (3) the role of AQPs in drought alleviation in crop plants, and (4) the phytohormone crosstalk with AQPs in crops exposed to drought stress.
