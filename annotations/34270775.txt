Multiprotein complexes execute and coordinate diverse cellular processes such as organelle biogenesis, vesicle trafficking, cell signaling, and metabolism. Knowledge about their composition and localization provides useful clues about the mechanisms of cellular homeostasis and system-level control. This is of great biological importance and practical significance in heterotrophic rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm and aleurone-subaleurone tissues, which are a primary source of seed vitamins and stored energy. Dozens of protein complexes have been implicated in the synthesis, transport, and storage of seed proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. Mutations in protein complexes that control RNA transport result in aberrant endosperm with shrunken and floury phenotypes, significantly reducing seed yield and quality. The purpose of this study was to broadly predict protein complex composition in the aleurone-subaleurone layers of developing rice seeds using co-fractionation mass spectrometry. Following orthogonal chromatographic separations of biological replicates, thousands of protein elution profiles were subjected to distance-based clustering to enable large-scale multimerization state measurements and protein complex predictions. The predicted complexes had predicted functions across diverse functional categories, including novel heteromeric RNA binding protein complexes that may influence seed quality. This effective and open-ended proteomics pipeline provides useful clues about system-level posttranslational control during the early stages of rice seed development.
