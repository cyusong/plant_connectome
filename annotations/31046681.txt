Following publication of the original article [1], a reader spotted an incorrect citation of the reference 14 [2] in the 'Background'. The male meiocyte isolation work described in this article [2] was carried out in rice and not in Brassica as originally stated in the 'Background' [1]. Thus, the following amendment to the Background section should be noted.

Gene: !affects! Process 
Reference 14: !incorrectly cited in! Background section
