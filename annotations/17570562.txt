The expression of the maize polyubiquitin gene promoter UBI1 in rice cells has been used to study the involvement of ubiquitin in cell protection responses to dehydration caused by osmotic, saline or freezing stress. The effect of these stresses on UBI1 activity was investigated by the use of stably transformed rice calli (UBI1:GUS), as well as by transient expression experiments performed with cell lines with high or low tolerance to each type of stress. The theoretical analysis of the UBI1 promoter shows several putative stress-regulated boxes that could account for the stress-related UBI1 induction pattern described in this work. We suggest that the study of the differential UBI1 promoter-driven expression in rice cell lines with different level of tolerance to stress might be useful to elucidate complex signal transduction pathways in response to dehydration stresses in monocots.
