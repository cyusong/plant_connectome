['14726522', 'Plants produce the common isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and  dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) through the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP)  pathway in plastids and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol. To assess  which pathways contribute DMAPP for cytokinin biosynthesis, metabolites from each  isoprenoid pathway were selectively labeled with (13)C in Arabidopsis seedlings.  Efficient (13)C labeling was achieved by blocking the endogenous pathway  genetically or chemically during the feed of a (13)C labeled precursor specific  to the MEP or MVA pathways. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis  demonstrated that the prenyl group of trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine is  mainly produced through the MEP pathway. In comparison, a large fraction of the  prenyl group of cis-zeatin (cZ) derivatives was provided by the MVA pathway. When  expressed as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis cells,  four adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferases (AtIPT1, AtIPT3, AtIPT5, and  AtIPT8) were found in plastids, in agreement with the idea that the MEP pathway  primarily provides DMAPP to tZ and isopentenyladenine. On the other hand, AtIPT2,  a tRNA isopentenyltransferase, was detected in the cytosol. Because the  prenylated adenine moiety of tRNA is usually of the cZ type, the formation of cZ  in Arabidopsis seedlings might involve the transfer of DMAPP from the MVA pathway  to tRNA. Distinct origins of large proportions of DMAPP for tZ and cZ  biosynthesis suggest that plants are able to separately modulate the level of  these cytokinin species.', '2004 Apr 2', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M314195200', 'Sakakibara']
