Iron (Fe) deficiency in alkaline calcium soil is a problem that needs to be solved urgently as Fe is an essential and commonly limiting nutrient for plants. Endophytic fungus, <i>Phomopsis liquidambaris</i> (<i>P. liquidambaris</i>), has been reported to promote Fe absorption in peanuts (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.), however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Under prolonged Fe deficiency, an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) often triggers a series of signaling events and leads to the inhibition of Fe acquisition. The main purpose of this study was to explore whether and how the endophytic fungus <i>P. liquidambaris</i> promote Fe absorption in peanut through regulating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and assisting in resisting oxidative stress. In this study, we detected the Fe deficiency-induced transcription factor (<i>FIT</i>), Fe<sup>2+</sup> transporter (<i>IRT</i>1), and ferric reduction oxidase 2 (<i>FRO2</i>) of peanuts, and confirmed that they were negatively related to Fe concentration. Similarly, <i>FIT, IRT</i>1, and <i>FRO2</i> were also inhibited by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The addition of <i>P. liquidambaris</i> reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under Fe-deficiency with an increase in Fe content, while the exogenous addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> further decreases it, and the addition of catalase (CAT) under Fe-deficiency reverses this phenomenon. Through transcriptome analysis, we proved that the expression of <i>FIT, IRT</i>1, <i>FRO2</i> and CAT are consistent with our hypothesis, and <i>P. liquidambaris</i> has a stress-mitigating effect on peanuts mainly via CAT, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde. Our study proved the Fe-absorption promoting effect and stress mitigation effect of <i>P. liquidambaris</i> under Fe-deficiency in peanuts, and their combined usage may help peanuts grow better.
