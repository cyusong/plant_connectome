Concomitant adjustments in photosynthetic capacity and size, composition, and/or density of minor foliar veins in response to growth environment were previously described primarily for winter annuals that load sugars into foliar phloem apoplastically. Here, common trends, differences associated with phloem-loading mechanism, and species-dependent differences are identified for summer annuals (loading sugars either symplastically [cucumber, pumpkin, and basil] or apoplastically [tomato and sunflower]) that were grown in low and high light. Photosynthetic capacity per leaf area was significantly positively correlated with leaf-level volume of phloem-loading cells (LCs), sugar-export conduits (sieve elements), and water conduits (tracheary elements) irrespective of phloem-loading mechanism. The relative contribution to leaf-level volume of LC numbers versus individual LC size was greater in apoplastic loaders than in symplastic loaders. Species-dependent differences included different vein density within each loading group and either greater or lower numbers of cells per minor vein (especially of tracheary elements in the symplastic loaders basil versus cucumber, respectively), which may be due to genetic adaptation to different environmental conditions. These results indicate considerable plasticity in foliar vascular features in summer annuals as well as some loading-mechanism-dependent trends.
