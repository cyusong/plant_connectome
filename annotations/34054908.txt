Despite growing interest in humic products as crop amendments, very few field evaluations have considered environmental factors of humic product efficacy. We determined the spatial and temporal variability in the efficacy of a micronized humic product on maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) growth and grain yield in two rainfed fields supporting a maize-soybean [<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr.] rotation in 2012-2014, and 2016 in central Iowa, U.S. Crop management in both fields otherwise followed conventional farmer practices. In two dry growing seasons, mechanized combine measurements of grain yield increased significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.10) with humic product application on an eroded hilltop soil, amounting for two application rates to 930 and 1,600 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (11 and 19% of the control grain yield) in 2012, the droughtiest season, and 700 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (7% of the control) for the higher application rate in the somewhat droughty 2013 season. On a fertile side slope soil in the 2012 field, though, only a faint numeric response occurred in 2012, while on a toe slope soil the sole significant increase was in 2012, 870 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> (14% increase above the control) for one application rate. With favorable rainfall in 2014 and 2016, significant grain yield increases with product application were small in the upland soil of 2014 and absent in 2016. Yield components analysis on 1-m row lengths of hand-collected samples attributed these yield boosts primarily to increased ear length, especially of the shorter ears. Combine grain yields, yield components, and total leaf area all demonstrated numerically slightly greater values for humic product treatments compared to the control in the vast majority of comparisons across years and soil types, with better distinction in the upland transects. Statistical significance, though, was reached only in the droughtier settings. The humic product had no consistent effects on nutrient concentrations of the grain, stover, or young leaves. Grain quality parameters showed a slight shift from protein to carbohydrates in the droughtier settings. Fifteen soil properties showed no response to the humic product. This humic product demonstrated the capability to improve maize growth in rainfed conditions in a high-yielding region, and its efficacy varied predictably with environmental conditions. This finding provides one potential explanation for inconsistent reports elsewhere of crop responses to humic products.
