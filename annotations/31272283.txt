<i>Ilyonectria mors-panacis</i> is the cause of a serious disease hampering the production of <i>Panax notoginseng</i>, an important Chinese medicinal herb, widely used for its anti-inflammatory, antifatigue, hepato-protective, and coronary heart disease prevention effects. Here, we report the first Illumina-Pacbio hybrid sequenced draft genome assembly of <i>I</i>. <i>mors-panacis</i> strain G3B and its annotation. The availability of this genome sequence not only represents an important tool toward understanding the genetics behind the infection mechanism of <i>I</i>. <i>mors-panacis</i> strain G3B but also will help illuminate the complexities of the taxonomy of this species.
