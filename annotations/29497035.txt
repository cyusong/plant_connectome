DNA methylation in the promoters of plant genes sometimes leads to transcriptional repression, and the loss of DNA methylation in methyltransferase mutants results in altered gene expression and severe developmental defects. However, many cases of naturally occurring DNA methylation variations have been reported, whereby altered expression of differentially methylated genes is responsible for agronomically important traits. The ability to manipulate plant methylomes to generate epigenetically distinct individuals could be invaluable for breeding and research purposes. Here, we describe "epimutagenesis," a method to rapidly generate DNA methylation variation through random demethylation of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. This method involves the expression of a human ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme, and results in widespread hypomethylation that can be inherited to subsequent generations, mimicking mutants in the maintenance of DNA methyltransferase met1. Application of epimutagenesis to agriculturally significant plants may result in differential expression of alleles normally silenced by DNA methylation, uncovering previously hidden phenotypic variations.
