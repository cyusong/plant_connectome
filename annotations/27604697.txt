['27604697', "Pheophytin a is an essential component of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms  because the primary charge separation between chlorophyll a and pheophytin a is  the first step in the conversion of light energy. In addition, conversion of  chlorophyll a to pheophytin a is the first step of chlorophyll degradation.  Pheophytin is synthesized by extracting magnesium (Mg) from chlorophyll; the  enzyme Mg-dechelatase catalyzes this reaction. In this study, we report that  Mendel's green cotyledon gene, STAY-GREEN (SGR), encodes Mg-dechelatase. The  Arabidopsis thaliana genome has three SGR genes, SGR1, SGR2, and STAY-GREEN LIKE  (SGRL). Recombinant SGR1/2 extracted Mg from chlorophyll a but had very low or no  activity against chlorophyllide a; by contrast, SGRL had higher dechelating  activity against chlorophyllide a compared with chlorophyll a All SGRs could not  extract Mg from chlorophyll b Enzymatic experiments using the photosystem and  light-harvesting complexes showed that SGR extracts Mg not only from free  chlorophyll but also from chlorophyll in the chlorophyll-protein complexes.  Furthermore, most of the chlorophyll and chlorophyll binding proteins disappeared  when SGR was transiently expressed by a chemical induction system. Thus, SGR is  not only involved in chlorophyll degradation but also contributes to photosystem  degradation.", '2016 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00428', 'Tanaka']
