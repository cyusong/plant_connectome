['17158913', 'In plants one bona fide Galpha subunit has been identified, as well as a single  Gbeta and two Ggamma subunits. To study the roles of lipidation motifs in the  regulation of subcellular location and heterotrimer formation in living plant  cells, GFP-tagged versions of the Arabidopsis thaliana heterotrimeric G protein  subunits were constructed. Mutational analysis showed that the Arabidopsis Galpha  subunit, GPalpha1, contains two lipidation motifs that were essential for plasma  membrane localization. The Arabidopsis Gbeta subunit, AGbeta1, and the Ggamma  subunit, AGG1, were dependent upon each other for tethering to the plasma  membrane. The second Ggamma subunit, AGG2, did not require AGbeta1 for  localization to the plasma membrane. Like AGG1, AGG2 contains two putative  lipidation motifs, both of which were necessary for membrane localization.  Interaction between the subunits was studied using fluorescence resonance energy  transfer (FRET) imaging by means of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy  (FLIM). The results suggest that AGbeta1 and AGG1 or AGbeta1 and AGG2 can form  heterodimers independent of lipidation. In addition, FLIM-FRET revealed the  existence of GPalpha1-AGbeta1-AGG1 heterotrimers at the plasma membrane.  Importantly, rendering GPalpha1 constitutively active did not cause a FRET  decrease in the heterotrimer, suggesting no dissociation upon GPalpha1  activation.', '2006 Dec 15', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.03284', 'Gadella']
