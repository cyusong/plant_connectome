The term “red herring” is commonly used to oppose a proposed hypothesis considered a logical fallacy. Pointing to problems in hypotheses is essential to science, and the use of the title red herring stimulates people to think. However, some hypotheses are later proven to be true, losing their red herring status. Others remain with the red herring tag.   A very famous and currently broadly accepted (sometimes with specific reservations) evolutionary signaling hypothesis that faced a very strong opposition was Zahavi's “handicap principle.”<sup>1</sup> One of the most significant scientists in theoretical ecology and evolution, the late John Maynard Smith strongly opposed it,<sup>2</sup> and only with the passing years gradually accepted it.<sup>3</sup> Only 15 y later, when a mathematical solution for the problem was demonstrated,<sup>4</sup> its status was changed. The case of Zahavi's handicap principle is an important lesson that the herring may not always be so red, but rather pink.
