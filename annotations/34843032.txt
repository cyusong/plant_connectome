Chemical defenses are imperative for plant survival, but their production is often associated with growth restrictions. Here we review the most recent theories to explain this complex dilemma of plants. Plants are a nutritional source for a myriad of pests and pathogens that depend on green tissues to complete their life cycle. Rather than remaining passive victims, plants utilize an arsenal of chemical defenses to fend off biotic attack. While the deployment of such barriers is imperative for survival, the production of these chemical defenses is typically associated with negative impacts on plant growth. Here we discuss the most recent theories which explain this highly dynamic growth versus defense dilemma. Firstly, we discuss the hypothesis that the antagonism between the accumulation of chemical defenses and growth is rooted in the evolutionary history of plants and may be a consequence of terrestrialization. Then, we revise the different paradigms available to explain the growth versus chemical defense antagonism, including recent findings that update these into more comprehensive and plausible theories. Finally, we highlight state-of-the-art strategies that are now allowing the activation of growth and the concomitant production of chemical barriers in plants. Growth versus chemical defense antagonism imposes large ecological and economic costs, including increased crop susceptibility to pests and pathogens. In a world where these plant enemies are the main problem to increase food production, we believe that this review will summarize valuable information for future studies aiming to breed highly defensive plants without the typical accompanying penalties to growth.
