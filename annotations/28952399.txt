Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a human enteric pathogen, has the ability to multiply and survive endophytically in plants. Genes encoding the type III secretion system (T3SS) or its effectors (T3Es) may contribute to its colonization. Two reporter plasmids for T3E translocation into plant cells that are based on hypersensitive response domains of avirulence proteins from the Pantoea agglomerans-beet and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria-pepper pathosystems were employed in this study to investigate the role of T3Es in the interaction of Salmonella ser. Typhimurium 14028 with plants. The T3Es of Salmonella ser. Typhimurium, SipB and SifA, which are translocated into animal cells, could not be delivered by Salmonella ser. Typhimurium into cells of beet roots or pepper leaves. In contrast, these effectors were translocated into plant cells by the phytopathogenic bacteria P. agglomerans pv. betae, Erwinia amylovora, and X. euvesicatoria. Similarly, HsvG, a T3E of P. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae, and XopAU of X. euvesicatoria could be translocated into beet roots and pepper leaves, respectively, by the plant pathogens but not by Salmonella ser. Typhimurium. Mutations in Salmonella ser. Typhimurium T3SS genes invA, ssaV, sipB, or sifA, did not affect its endophytic colonization of lettuce leaves, supporting the notion that S. enterica cannot translocate T3Es into plant cells.
