The gene CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT-1 (CKI-1), previously isolated by enhancer trap screening, has been hypothesised to play a role in cytokinin perception. Alternative hypotheses suggest that it is required for the production of cytokinins or that it has no direct role in cytokinin signalling but simply interferes with the pathway when overexpressed. These hypotheses were investigated by producing transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing CKI-1 cDNA in antisense orientation. In standard conditions, the phenotype of the plants was similar to wild type. Significantly higher amounts of the free base and riboside forms of cytokinin and lower amounts of membrane-impermeable cytokinins were found in the antisense lines. This supports the hypothesis that CKI-1 is involved in cytokinin perception and demonstrates the existence of a feedback loop altering cytokinin metabolism in response to the level of receptor abundance. An elevation in the content of free bases and ribosides of zeatin and isopentenyladenine, along with a reduction in the content of ribotide forms, suggests that a cytokinin ribotide 5'-ribonucleotidase may be a site at which CKI-1 exerts feedback control. When seed homozygous for the transgene was germinated on medium with reduced total mineral nutrient levels, the cotyledons of seedlings with reduced levels of CKI-1 failed to expand and green, and vegetative growth was inhibited. A similar phenotype was observed on low-phosphate media, suggesting that this failure resulted from an interaction between phosphate and cytokinins.
