['14630970', 'Auxin is an important plant hormone that plays significant roles in plant growth  and development. Although numerous auxin-response mutants have been identified,  auxin signal transduction pathways remain to be fully elucidated. We isolated  ibr5 as an Arabidopsis indole-3-butyric acid-response mutant, but it also is less  responsive to indole-3-acetic acid, synthetic auxins, auxin transport inhibitors,  and the phytohormone abscisic acid. Like certain other auxin-response mutants,  ibr5 has a long root and a short hypocotyl when grown in the light. In addition,  ibr5 displays aberrant vascular patterning, increased leaf serration, and reduced  accumulation of an auxin-inducible reporter. We used positional information to  determine that the gene defective in ibr5 encodes an apparent dual-specificity  phosphatase. Using immunoblot and promoter-reporter gene analyses, we found that  IBR5 is expressed throughout the plant. The identification of IBR5 relatives in  other flowering plants suggests that IBR5 function is conserved throughout  angiosperms. Our results suggest that IBR5 is a phosphatase that modulates  phytohormone signal transduction and support a link between auxin and abscisic  acid signaling pathways.', '2003 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.017046', 'Bartel']
