Male sterility is a valuable trait for watermelon breeding, as watermelon hybrids exhibit obvious heterosis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still largely unknown, especially regarding the related non-coding genes. In the present study, approximately 1035 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), as well as 80 DE-lncRNAs and 10 DE-miRNAs, were identified, with the overwhelming majority down-regulated in male-sterile floral buds. Enrichment analyses revealed that the general phenylpropanoid pathway as well as its related metabolisms was predicted to be altered in a mutant compared to its fertile progenitor. Meanwhile, the conserved genetic pathway <i>DYT1</i>-<i>TDF1</i>-<i>AMS</i>-<i>MS188</i>-<i>MS1</i>, as well as the causal gene <i>ClAMT1</i> for the male-sterile mutant Se18, was substantially disrupted during male reproductive development. In addition, some targets of the key regulators <i>AMS</i> and <i>MS188</i> in tapetum development were also down-regulated at a transcriptional level, such as <i>ABCG26</i> (<i>Cla004479</i>), <i>ACOS5</i> (<i>Cla022956</i>), <i>CYP703A2</i> (<i>Cla021151</i>), <i>PKSA</i> (<i>Cla021099</i>), and <i>TKPR1</i> (<i>Cla002563</i>). Considering lncRNAs may act as functional endogenous target mimics of miRNAs, competitive endogenous RNA networks were subsequently constructed, with the most complex one containing three DE-miRNAs, two DE-lncRNAs, and 21 DEGs. Collectively, these findings not only contribute to a better understanding of genetic regulatory networks underlying male sterility in watermelon, but also provide valuable candidates for future research.
