RNA processing and decay pathways have important impacts on RNA viruses, particularly animal-infecting bunyaviruses, which utilize a cap-snatching mechanism to translate their mRNAs. However, their effects on plant-infecting bunyaviruses have not been investigated. The roles of mRNA degradation and non-sense-mediated decay components, including DECAPPING 2 (DCP2), EXORIBONUCLEASE 4 (XRN4), ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) and UP-FRAMESHIFT 1 (UPF1) were investigated in infection of Arabidopsis thaliana by several RNA viruses, including the bunyavirus, tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). TSWV infection on mutants with decreased or increased RNA decapping ability resulted in increased and decreased susceptibility, respectively. By contrast, these mutations had the opposite, or no, effect on RNA viruses that use different mRNA capping strategies. Consistent with this, the RNA capping efficiency of TSWV mRNA was higher in a dcp2 mutant. Furthermore, the TSWV N protein partially colocalized with RNA processing body (PB) components and altering decapping activity by heat shock or coinfection with another virus resulted in corresponding changes in TSWV accumulation. The present results indicate that TSWV infection in plants depends on its ability to snatch caps from mRNAs destined for decapping in PBs and that genetic or environmental alteration of RNA processing dynamics can affect infection outcomes.
