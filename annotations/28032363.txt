In Arabidopsis cell culture, we have shown that flavonol metabolite accumulation depends on expression of the flavonol pathway genes (FPGs), which are up-regulated by UV-B irradiation but repressed during microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) -triggered immunity (MTI) induced by the bacterial elicitor flg22. The suppression of flavonoid production during MTI is believed to allow the plant focusing its metabolism on the pathogen defense by directing phenylalanine resources from UV-B protective flavonol production towards production of phytoalexins and cell wall fortification by lignin incorporation. Here, we show that UV-B-induced FPGs are also suppressed by flg22 in Arabidopsis seedlings, demonstrating that this kind of 'crosstalk' is fully functional in planta. We believe that this system based on seedlings of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana constitutes a valuable tool for further dissection of the underlying molecular mechanism, for example, by deploying gain/loss-of-function mutants. Furthermore, we observed some differences in the expression patterns of MYB transcription factors (TFs) as compared to data from the cell culture system. The new data suggest that in planta the TF MYB111 might play a more dominant role than the TF MYB12, which was strongly regulated in cell cultures. Thus, we can present an updated working model how this crosstalk might function.

UV-B: !up-regulates! FPGs 
flg22: !represses! FPGs 
UV-B: !suppressed by! flg22 
MYB111: !plays more dominant role than! MYB12
