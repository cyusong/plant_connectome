Cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup> ) is highly harmful to plant growth. Although Cd<sup>2+</sup> induces programmed cell death (PCD) in plant cells, Cd<sup>2+</sup> stress in whole plants during later developmental stages and the mechanism underlying Cd<sup>2+</sup> -mediated toxicity are poorly understood. Here, we showed that Cd<sup>2+</sup> limits plant growth, causes intense redness in leaf vein, leaf yellowing, and chlorosis during the R1 reproductive stage of soybean (Glycine max). These symptoms were associated with Cd<sup>2+</sup> -induced PCD, as Cd<sup>2+</sup> -stressed soybean leaves displayed decreased number of nuclei, enhanced cell death, DNA damage, and caspase 1 activity compared to unstressed leaves. Accordingly, Cd<sup>2+</sup> -induced NRPs, GmNAC81, GmNAC30 and VPE, the DCD/NRP-mediated cell death signalling components, which execute PCD via caspase 1-like VPE activity. Furthermore, overexpression of the positive regulator of this cell death signalling GmNAC81 enhanced sensitivity to Cd<sup>2+</sup> stress and intensified the hallmarks of Cd<sup>2+</sup> -mediated PCD. GmNAC81 overexpression enhanced Cd<sup>2+</sup> -induced H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production, cell death, DNA damage, and caspase-1-like VPE expression. Conversely, BiP overexpression negatively regulated the NRPs/GmNACs/VPE signalling module, conferred tolerance to Cd<sup>2+</sup> stress and reduced Cd<sup>2+</sup> -mediated cell death. Collectively, our data indicate that Cd<sup>2+</sup> induces PCD in plants via activation of the NRP/GmNAC/VPE regulatory circuit that links developmentally and stress-induced cell death.
