Shoot branching is an important adaptive trait that determines plant architecture. In a previous study, the <i>Early bud-break 1</i> (<i>EBB1</i>) gene in peach (<i>Prunus persica</i> var. <i>nectarina</i>) cultivar Zhongyou 4 was transformed into poplar (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i>). <i>PpEBB1-oe</i> poplar showed a more branched phenotype. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying the EBB1-mediated branching, transcriptomic and proteomics analyses were used. The results showed that a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)/differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with light response, sugars, brassinosteroids (BR), and nitrogen metabolism were significantly enriched in <i>PpEBB1-oe</i> poplar. In addition, contents of sugars, BR, and amino acids were measured. Results showed that PpEBB1 significantly promoted the accumulation of fructose, glucose, sucrose, trehalose, and starch. Contents of brassinolide (BL), castasterone (CS), and 6-deoxocathasterone (6-deoxoCS) were all significantly changed with overexpressing <i>PpEBB1</i>. Various types of amino acids were measured and four of them were significantly improved in <i>PpEBB1-oe</i> poplar, including aspartic acid (Asp), arginine (Arg), cysteine (Cys), and tryptohpan (Trp). Taken together, shoot branching is a process controlled by a complex regulatory network, and PpEBB1 may play important roles in this process through the coordinating multiple metabolic pathways involved in shoot branching, including light response, phytohormones, sugars, and nitrogen.
