Research in recent years on the biology of guard cells has shown that these specialized cells integrate both extra- and intra-cellular signals in the control of stomatal apertures. Among the phytohormones, abscisic acid (ABA) is one of the key players regulating stomatal function. In addition, auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, brassinosteroids, jasmonates, and salicylic acid also contribute to stomatal aperture regulation. The interaction of multiple hormones can serve to determine the size of stomatal apertures in a condition-specific manner. Here, we discuss the roles of different phytohormones and the effects of their interactions on guard cell physiology and function.
