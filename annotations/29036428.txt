Brassicaceae pollen-stigma interactions have been extensively studied in Brassica and Arabidopsis species to identify cellular events triggered in the stigmatic papillae by pollen contact. Compatible pollinations are linked to the activation of basal cellular responses in the stigmatic papillae, which include calcium gradients, actin networks, and polarized secretion. The occurrence of these cellular events in stigmatic papillae coincides with the stages of pollen hydration and pollen tube entry into the stigmatic papillar cell wall. However, the form of the vesicle trafficking appears to differ between species, with vesicle-like structures detected in Arabidopsis species while exosomes were found to be secreted in Brassica species. Around the same timeframe, self-incompatible pollen recognition leads altered cellular responses in the stigmatic papillae to interfere with basal compatible pollen responses and disrupt regulated secretion, causing self-pollen rejection. Here, the literature on the changing cellular dynamics in the stigmatic papillae following pollination is reviewed and discussed in the context of other well-characterized examples of polarized secretion in plants.
