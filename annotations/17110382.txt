['17110382', 'Nitric oxide (NO) regulates a number of signaling functions in both animals and  plants under several physiological and pathophysiological conditions.  S-Nitrosylation linking a nitrosothiol on cysteine residues mediates NO signaling  functions of a broad spectrum of mammalian proteins, including caspases, the main  effectors of apoptosis. Metacaspases are suggested to be the ancestors of  metazoan caspases, and plant metacaspases have previously been shown to be  genuine cysteine proteases that autoprocess in a manner similar to that of  caspases. We show that S-nitrosylation plays a central role in the regulation of  the proteolytic activity of Arabidopsis thaliana metacaspase 9 (AtMC9) and  hypothesize that this S-nitrosylation affects the cellular processes in which  metacaspases are involved. We found that AtMC9 zymogens are S-nitrosylated at  their active site cysteines in vivo and that this posttranslational modification  suppresses both AtMC9 autoprocessing and proteolytic activity. However, the  mature processed form is not prone to NO inhibition due to the presence of a  second S-nitrosylation-insensitive cysteine that can replace the S-nitrosylated  cysteine residue within the catalytic center of the processed AtMC9. This  cysteine is absent in caspases and paracaspases but is conserved in all reported  metacaspases.', '2007 Jan 12', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M608931200', 'Van']
