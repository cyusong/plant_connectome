Sugarcane is an economically important crop contributing to the sugar and ethanol production of the world with 80 and 40%, respectively. Despite its importance as the main crop for sugar production, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of sucrose accumulation in sugarcane culms are still poorly understood. The aim of this work was to compare the quantitative changes of proteins in juvenile and maturing internodes at three stages of plant development. Label-free shotgun proteomics was used for protein profiling and quantification in internodes 5 (I<sub>5</sub>) and 9 (I<sub>9</sub>) of 4-, 7-, and 10-month-old-plants (4M, 7M, and 10M, respectively). The I<sub>9</sub>/I<sub>5</sub> ratio was used to assess the differences in the abundance of common proteins at each stage of internode development. I<sub>9</sub> of 4M plants showed statistically significant increases in the abundance of several enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and proteoforms of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). The changes in content of the enzymes were followed by major increases of proteins related to O<sub>2</sub> transport like hemoglobin 2, ROS scavenging enzymes, and enzymes involved in the ascorbate/glutatione system. Besides, intermediates from tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were reduced in I<sub>9</sub>-4M, indicating that the increase in abundance of several enzymes involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate cycle, and TCA, might be responsible for higher metabolic flux, reducing its metabolites content. The results observed in I<sub>9</sub>-4M indicate that hypoxia might be the main cause of the increased flux of glycolysis and ethanolic fermentation to supply ATP and reducing power for plant growth, mitigating the reduction in mitochondrial respiration due to the low oxygen availability inside the culm. As the plant matured and sucrose accumulated to high levels in the culms, the proteins involved in glycolysis, ethanolic fermentation, and primary carbon metabolism were significantly reduced.
