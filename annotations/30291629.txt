Three genes encode catalase in Arabidopsis. Although the role of CAT2 in photorespiration is well established, the importance of the different catalases in other processes is less clear. Analysis of cat1, cat2, cat3, cat1 cat2, and cat2 cat3 T-DNA mutants revealed that cat2 had the largest effect on activity in both roots and leaves. Root growth was inhibited in all cat2-containing lines, but this inhibition was prevented by growing plants at high CO<sub>2</sub> , suggesting that it is mainly an indirect effect of stress at the leaf level. Analysis of double mutants suggested some overlap between CAT2 and CAT3 functions in leaves and CAT1 and CAT2 in seeds. When plants had been grown to a similar developmental stage in short days or long days, equal-time exposure to oxidative stress caused by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of catalase produced a much stronger induction of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> marker genes in short day plants. Together, our data (a) underline the importance of CAT2 in basal H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> processing in Arabidopsis; (b) suggest that CAT1 and CAT3 are mainly "backup" or stress-specific enzymes; and (c) establish that day length-dependent responses to catalase deficiency are independent of the duration of oxidative stress.
