Hundreds of naturally occurring specialized fatty acids (FAs) have potential as desirable chemical feedstocks if they could be produced at large scale by crop plants; however, transgenic expression of their biosynthetic genes has generally been accompanied by dramatic reductions in oil yield. For example, expression of castor (Ricinus communis) FA hydroxylase (FAH) in the Arabidopsis thaliana FA elongation mutant fae1 resulted in a 50% reduction of FA synthesis rate that was attributed to inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) by an undefined mechanism. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the ricinoleic acid-dependent decrease in ACCase activity is mediated by biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins. BADCs are inactive homologs of biotin carboxy carrier protein that lack a biotin cofactor and can inhibit ACCase. Arabidopsis contains three BADC genes. To reduce expression levels of BADC1 and BADC3 in fae1/FAH plants, a homozygous badc1,3/fae1/FAH line was created. The rate of FA synthesis in badc1,3/fae1/FAH seeds doubled relative to fae1/FAH, restoring it to fae1 levels, increasing both native FA and HFA accumulation. Total FA per seed, seed oil content, and seed yield per plant all increased in badc1,3/fae1/FAH, to 5.8 µg, 37%, and 162 mg, respectively, relative to 4.9 µg, 33%, and 126 mg, respectively, for fae1/FAH. Transcript levels of FA synthesis-related genes, including those encoding ACCase subunits, did not significantly differ between badc1,3/fae1/FAH and fae1/FAH. These results demonstrate that BADC1 and BADC3 mediate ricinoleic acid-dependent inhibition of FA synthesis. We propose that BADC-mediated FAS inhibition as a general mechanism that limits FA accumulation in specialized FA-accumulating seeds.
