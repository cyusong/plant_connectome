['19165148', "The ultraviolet-B (UV-B) portion of the solar radiation functions as an  environmental signal for which plants have evolved specific and sensitive UV-B  perception systems. The UV-B-specific UV RESPONSE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) and the  multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) are  key regulators of the UV-B response. We show here that uvr8-null mutants are  deficient in UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and hypersensitive to UV-B stress,  whereas overexpression of UVR8 results in enhanced UV-B photomorphogenesis,  acclimation and tolerance to UV-B stress. By using sun simulators, we provide  evidence at the physiological level that UV-B acclimation mediated by the  UV-B-specific photoregulatory pathway is indeed required for survival in  sunlight. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that the wild type but not the  mutant UVR8 and COP1 proteins directly interact in a UV-B-dependent, rapid manner  in planta. These data collectively suggest that UV-B-specific interaction of COP1  and UVR8 in the nucleus is a very early step in signalling and responsible for  the plant's coordinated response to UV-B ensuring UV-B acclimation and protection  in the natural environment.", '2009 Mar 4', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2009.4', 'Ulm']
