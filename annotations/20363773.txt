['20363773', 'Cytokinin signaling is mediated by a multiple-step phosphorelay. Key components  of the phosphorelay consist of the histidine kinase (HK)-type receptors,  histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HP), and response regulators (RRs). Whereas  overexpression of a nonreceptor-type HK gene CYTOKININ-INDEPENDENT1 (CKI1)  activates cytokinin signaling by an unknown mechanism, mutations in CKI1 cause  female gametophytic lethality. However, the function of CKI1 in cytokinin  signaling remains unclear. Here, we characterize a mutant allele, cki1-8, that  can be transmitted through female gametophytes with low frequency (approximately  0.17%). We have recovered viable homozygous cki1-8 mutant plants that grow larger  than wild-type plants, show defective megagametogenesis and rarely set enlarged  seeds. We found that CKI1 acts upstream of AHP (Arabidopsis HP) genes,  independently of cytokinin receptor genes. Consistently, an ahp1,2-2,3,4,5  quintuple mutant, which contains an ahp2-2 null mutant allele, exhibits severe  defects in megagametogenesis, with a transmission efficiency of <3.45% through  female gametophytes. Rarely recovered ahp1,2-2,3,4,5 quintuple mutants are  seedling lethal. Finally, the female gametophytic lethal phenotype of cki1-5 (a  null mutant) can be partially rescued by IPT8 or ARR1 (a type-B Arabidopsis RR)  driven by a CKI1 promoter. These results define a genetic pathway consisting of  CKI1, AHPs, and type-B ARRs in the regulation of female gametophyte development  and vegetative growth.', '2010 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.065128', 'Zuo']
