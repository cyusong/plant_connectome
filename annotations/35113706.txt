Although much is known about plant traits that function in nonhost resistance against pathogens, little is known about nonhost resistance against herbivores, despite its agricultural importance. <i>Empoasca</i> leafhoppers, serious agricultural pests, identify host plants by eavesdropping on unknown outputs of jasmonate (JA)-mediated signaling. Forward- and reverse-genetics lines of a native tobacco plant were screened in native habitats with native herbivores using high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic tools to reveal an <i>Empoasca</i>-elicited JA-JAZi module. This module induces an uncharacterized caffeoylputrescine-green leaf volatile compound, catalyzed by a polyphenol oxidase in a Michael addition reaction, which we reconstitute in vitro; engineer in crop plants, where it requires a berberine bridge enzyme-like 2 (BBL2) for its synthesis; and show that it confers resistance to leafhoppers. Natural history-guided forward genetics reveals a conserved nonhost resistance mechanism useful for crop protection.
