['28827453', 'The activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is one of  the earliest responses triggered by the recognition of several microbe-associated  molecular patterns (MAMPs) in plants. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members. Previous studies suggested a role  for PLC2 in MAMP-triggered immunity, as it is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon  treatment with the bacterial MAMP flg22. Here, we analyzed the role of PLC2 in  plant immunity using an artificial microRNA to silence PLC2 expression in  Arabidopsis. We found that PLC2-silenced plants are more susceptible to the type  III secretion system-deficient bacterial strain Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  (Pst) DC3000 hrcC(-) and to the nonadapted pea (Pisum sativum) powdery mildew  Erysiphe pisi However, PLC2-silenced plants display normal susceptibility to  virulent (Pst DC3000) and avirulent (Pst DC3000 AvrRPM1) P. syringae strains,  conserving typical hypersensitive response features. In response to flg22,  PLC2-silenced plants maintain wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase  activation and PHI1, WRKY33, and FRK1 immune marker gene expression but have  reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent responses such as callose  deposition and stomatal closure. Accordingly, the generation of ROS upon flg22  treatment is compromised in the PLC2-defficient plants, suggesting an effect of  PLC2 in a branch of MAMP-triggered immunity and nonhost resistance that involves  early ROS-regulated processes. Consistently, PLC2 associates with the NADPH  oxidase RBOHD, suggesting its potential regulation by PLC2.', '2017 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00173', 'ORCID:']
