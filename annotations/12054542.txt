['12054542', 'Arabidopsis ARR4/ATRR1/IBC7 and ARR8/ATRR3 are homologous genes of prokaryotic  response regulators that are involved in the His-Asp phosphorelay signal  transduction. We analyzed the function of these genes as response regulators  using transgenic plants. Overexpression of ARR4 in cultured stems of the  transgenics markedly promoted shoot formation in the presence of cytokinin, while  overexpression of ARR8 repressed shoot formation and greening of calli. The  expression level of cytokinin-inducible genes, cycD3 and cab increased in the  ARR4 overexpressor but decreased in the ARR8 overexpressor. By contrast, two  drought stress-inducible genes, rd29A and erd1, were expressed in both  overexpressors as that in control plants. These results suggest that ARR4 and  ARR8 are involved in cytokinin signal transduction, and that ARR4 functions as a  positive-regulator, whereas ARR8 functions as a negative-regulator. Furthermore,  microarray analysis showed that several genes were up-regulated in the ARR4  overexpressor. Consistent with these results, ARR4 and ARR8 might play important  roles in the sensoring system of cytokinin signal transduction pathway in various  developmental and environmental conditions and the regulation of gene expression.', '2002 May 3', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00286-3', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
