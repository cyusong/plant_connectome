['9300811', 'A cDNA clone At.MAMI (Arabidopsis thaliana membrane-associated mannitol-induced)  was isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA expression library by immunoselection. The  cDNA was full-length (1.18 kb) with an open reading frame of 798 nucleotides  encoding a 265 amino acid protein. The sequence of At.MAMI did not show any  significant identity with other genes, as well as the deduced amino acid sequence  with other proteins. However, prediction methods for the secondary structure of  MAMI-30, together with homologous domains revealed some identity with VAP-33, a  protein involved in membrane trafficking in neuronal tissues. In contrast to  VAP-33, MAMI-30 did not exhibit a transmembrane domain, but positively charged  loop regions could be involved in membrane anchoring. Indeed, MAMI-30 was  immunodetected in purified plasma membrane from Arabidopsis cells. The gene was  responsive to low turgor in Arabidopsis and its expression regulated  developmentally. In addition, reduction of turgor caused a higher accumulation of  mRNAs.', '1997 Aug 15', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/s0167-4838(97)00063-0', 'Pont-Lezica']
