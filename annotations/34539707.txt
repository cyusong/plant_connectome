Sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> subsp. <i>vulgaris</i>) is the exclusive source of sugar in the form of sucrose in temperate climate zones. Sugar beet is grown there as an annual crop from spring to autumn because of the damaging effect of freezing temperatures to taproot tissue. A collection of hybrid and non-hybrid sugar beet cultivars was tested for winter survival rates and freezing tolerance. Three genotypes with either low or high winter survival rates were selected for detailed study of their response to frost. These genotypes differed in the severity of frost injury in a defined inner region in the upper part of the taproot, the so-called pith. We aimed to elucidate genotype- and tissue-dependent molecular processes during freezing and combined analyses of sugar beet anatomy and physiology with transcriptomic and metabolite profiles of leaf and taproot tissues at low temperatures. Freezing temperatures induced strong downregulation of photosynthesis in leaves, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS-related gene expression in taproots. Simultaneously, expression of genes involved in raffinose metabolism, as well as concentrations of raffinose and its intermediates, increased markedly in both leaf and taproot tissue at low temperatures. The accumulation of raffinose in the pith tissue correlated with freezing tolerance of the three genotypes. We discuss a protective role for raffinose and its precursors against freezing damage of sugar beet taproot tissue.
