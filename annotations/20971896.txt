Multidrug resistance ABC transporters in plants are required for polar transport of the hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid). They are studied in animals primarily because their overexpression confers resistance to anticancer agents. Immunophilins are studied in both plants and animals for their roles in folding and trafficking of proteins, particularly those with signal transducing functions and susceptibility to immunosuppressant drugs. Previous genetic and molecular studies in Arabidopsis thaliana established a physical and functional interaction between some ABCB transporters and the TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1) immunophilin. In this work, confocal microscopy of fluorescently tagged TWD1 shows it to reside at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in TWD1 caused mislocalization of ABCB1, ABCB4, and ABCB19 to the ER instead of the plasma membrane as shown by confocal microscopy of fluorescently tagged fusion proteins and transmission electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled samples in the case of ABCB19. Localization of the unrelated PIN-FORMED2 auxin transporter or plasma membrane marker proteins was not affected by loss of TWD1. Abnormal spread of auxin signaling into the elongation zone of twd1 roots, attributable to mislocalized ABCB transporters and suppressed by an auxin transport inhibitor, appeared to cause the twisted cell files characteristic of twd1 roots.
