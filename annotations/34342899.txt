Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup> ) transport in plants is important to limit the entry of its radioisotopes from contaminated areas into the food chain. The potentially toxic element Cs<sup>+</sup> , which is not involved in any biological process, is chemically closed to the macronutrient potassium (K<sup>+</sup> ). Among the multiple K<sup>+</sup> carriers, the high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporters family HAK/KT/KUP is thought to be relevant in mediating opportunistic Cs<sup>+</sup> transport. Of the 13 KUP identified in A. thaliana, only HAK5, the major contributor to root K<sup>+</sup> acquisition under low K<sup>+</sup> supply, has been functionally demonstrated to be involved in Cs<sup>+</sup> uptake in planta. In the present study, we showed that accumulation of Cs<sup>+</sup> increased by up to 30% in two A. thaliana mutant lines lacking KUP9 and grown under low K<sup>+</sup> supply. Since further experiments revealed that Cs<sup>+</sup> release from contaminated plants to the external medium is proportionally lower in the two kup9 mutant alleles, we proposed that KUP9 disruption could impair Cs<sup>+</sup> efflux. By contrast, K<sup>+</sup> status in kup9 mutants is not affected, suggesting that KUP9 disruption does not alter substantially K<sup>+</sup> transport in experimental conditions used. The putative primary role of KUP9 in plants is further discussed.
