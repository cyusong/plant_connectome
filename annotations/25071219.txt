['25071219', 'To incorporate the far-red light (FR) signal into a strategy for optimizing plant  growth, FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL1 (FHY1) mediates the nuclear translocation of  the FR photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) and facilitates the association of phyA  with the promoters of numerous associated genes crucial for the response to  environmental stimuli. However, whether FHY1 plays additional roles after FR  irradiation remains elusive. Here, through the global identification of FHY1  chromatin association sites through ChIP-seq analysis and by the comparison of  FHY1-associated sites with phyA-associated sites, we demonstrated that nuclear  FHY1 can either act independently of phyA or act in association with phyA to  activate the expression of distinct target genes. We also determined that phyA  can act independently of FHY1 in regulating phyA-specific target genes.  Furthermore, we determined that the independent FHY1 nuclear pathway is involved  in crucial aspects of plant development, as in the case of inhibited seed  germination under FR during salt stress. Notably, the differential presence of  cis-elements and transcription factors in common and unique FHY1- and/or  phyA-associated genes are indicative of the complexity of the independent and  coordinated FHY1 and phyA pathways. Our study uncovers previously unidentified  aspects of FHY1 function beyond its currently recognized role in phyA-dependent  photomorphogenesis.', '2014 Aug 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1412528111', 'Deng']
