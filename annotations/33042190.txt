Tolerance to metribuzin, a broad-spectrum herbicide, is an important trait for weed control in wheat breeding. However, the genetics of metribuzin tolerance in relation to the underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes is limited. This study developed F<sub>8</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between a highly resistant genotype (Chuan Mai 25) and highly susceptible genotype (Ritchie), which were used for QTL mapping of metribuzin tolerance. Genotyping was done using a diversity arrays technology sequencing (DArTseq) platform, and phenotyping was done in controlled environments. Herbicide tolerance was measured using three traits, visual score (VS), reduction of chlorophyll content (RCC), and mean value of chlorophyll content for metribuzin-treated plants (MCC). A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using 2,129 DArTseq markers. Inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) identified seven QTL, one each on chromosomes 2A, 2D, 3A, 3B, 4A, 5A, and 6A. Three major QTL-<i>Qrcc.uwa.2AS</i>, <i>Qrcc.uwa.5AL</i>, and <i>Qrcc.uwa.6AL-</i>explained 11.39%, 11.06%, and 11.45% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. The 5A QTL was further validated using kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays in an F<sub>3</sub> validation population developed from Chuan Mai 25 × Dagger. Blasting the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking the QTL in the wheat reference genome RefV1.0 revealed SNP markers within or very close to annotated genes which could be candidate genes responsible for metribuzin tolerance. Most of the candidate genes were related to metabolic detoxification, especially those of P450 pathway and xenobiotic transmembrane transporter activity, which are reportedly key molecules responsible for herbicide tolerance. This study is the first to use specially developed populations to conduct QTL mapping on the metribuzin tolerance trait. The three major QTL and candidate genes identified in this study could facilitate marker-assisted metribuzin breeding in wheat. The QTL could be fine-mapped to locate the genes responsible for metribuzin tolerance, which could be introgressed into elite wheat cultivars.
