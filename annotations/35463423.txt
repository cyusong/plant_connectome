<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> and <i>Gossypium barbadense</i> are the widely cultivated tetraploid cottons around the world, which evolved great differences in the fiber yield and quality due to the independent domestication process. To reveal the genetic basis of the difference, we integrated 90 samples from ten time points during the fiber developmental period for investigating the dynamics of gene expression changes associated with fiber in <i>G. hirsutum</i> acc. TM-1 and <i>G. barbadense</i> cv. Hai7124 and acc. 3-79. Globally, 44,484 genes expressed in all three cultivars account for 61.14% of the total genes. About 61.39% (<i>N</i> = 3,412) of the cotton transcription factors were involved in fiber development, which consisted of 58 cotton TF families. The differential analysis of intra- and interspecies showed that 3 DPA had more expression changes. To discover the genes with temporally changed expression profiles during the whole fiber development, 1,850 genes predominantly expressed in <i>G. hirsutum</i> and 1,050 in <i>G. barbadense</i> were identified, respectively. Based on the weighted gene co-expression network and time-course analysis, several candidate genes, mainly involved in the secondary cell wall synthesis and phytohormones, were identified in this study, underlying possibly the transcriptional regulation and molecular mechanisms of the fiber quality differences between <i>G. barbadense</i> and <i>G. hirsu</i>tum. The quantitative real-time PCR validation of the candidate genes was consistent with the RNA-seq data. Our study provides a strong rationale for the analysis of gene function and breeding of high-quality cotton.
