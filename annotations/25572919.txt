['25572919', 'ANAC069 encodes a plasma membrane-bound NAC protein that integrates auxin and  salt signals to regulate Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination. However, the  regulatory network of ANAC069 has not been revealed. Here, we report that ANAC069  is a direct target gene of the ATDOF5.8 transcription factor. There are seven DOF  motifs in the promoter of ANAC069, which is highly enriched in the promoter.  Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays showed that a Dof protein, ATDOF5.8, binds to the  DOF motifs. The interaction between ATDOF5.8 and the promoter of ANAC069 was  further confirmed by transient expression assays in tobacco leaves. Chromatin  Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) results suggested that the binding of ATDOF5.8 to DOF  motifs in the promoter of ANAC069 occurs in vivo in Arabidopsis to regulate the  expression of ANAC069. Moreover, ATDOF5.8 and ANAC069 share similar expression  patterns in response to salt, drought and ABA treatment. Taken together, the  results suggested a regulatory network model mediated by ANAC069, under abiotic  stress conditions, ATDOF5.8 regulates the expression of ANAC069, and the  activated ANAC069 binds to NAC recognition sequences or other motifs to regulate  the expression of genes containing these motifs in their promoters.', '2015 Mar', 'Biochimie', '10.1016/j.biochi.2014.12.017', 'Wei']
