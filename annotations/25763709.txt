CAM7, a member of CaM family in Arabidopsis, acts as a transcriptional regulator and enhances photomorphogenic growth and light regulated gene expression under various light conditions. HY5, a bZIP transcription factor, promotes photomorphogenesis at multiple wavelengths of light including far red, red, and blue light. Very recently, it has been shown that CAM7 and HY5 directly interact with the HY5 promoter to regulate the transcriptional activity of HY5 during Arabidopsis seedling development. In this study, we have investigated the root phenotype of cam7 hy5 double mutants and shown that CAM7 and HY5 genetically interact to control the root growth. We have further shown an interdependent function of HY5 and CAM7 in abscisic acid (ABA) responsiveness.
