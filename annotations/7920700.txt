['7920700', 'Glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) synthetase, GAR transformylase and  aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) synthetase are the second, third and fifth  enzymes in the 10-step de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. From a cDNA library  of Arabidopsis thaliana, cDNAs encoding the above three enzymes were cloned by  functional complementation of corresponding Escherichia coli mutants. Each of the  cDNAs encode peptides comprising the complete enzymatic domain of either GAR  synthetase, GAR transformylase or AIR synthetase. Comparisons of the three  Arabidopsis purine biosynthetic enzymes with corresponding  enzymes/polypeptide-fragments from procaryotic and eucaryotic sources indicate a  high degree of conserved homology at the amino acid level, in particular with  procaryotic enzymes. Assays from extracts of E. coli expressing the complementing  clones verified the specific enzymatic activity of Arabidopsis GAR synthetase and  GAR transformylase. Sequence analysis, as well as Northern blot analysis indicate  that Arabidopsis has single and monofunctional enzymes. In this respect the  organization of these three plant purine biosynthesis genes is fundamentally  different from the multifunctional purine biosynthesis enzymes characteristic of  other eucaryotes and instead resembles the one gene, one enzyme relationship  found in procaryotes.', '1994 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1994.6010113.x', 'Laloue']
