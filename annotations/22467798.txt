['22467798', 'In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ethylene is perceived by a receptor family  consisting of five members. Subfamily 1 members ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) and  ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 (ERS1) have histidine kinase activity, unlike the  subfamily 2 members ETR2, ERS2, and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4), which lack  amino acid residues critical for this enzymatic activity. To resolve the role of  histidine kinase activity in signaling by the receptors, we transformed an  etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant with wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of the  receptor ETR1. Both wild-type and kinase-inactive ETR1 rescue the constitutive  ethylene-response phenotype of etr1-9;ers1-3, restoring normal growth to the  mutant in air. However, the lines carrying kinase-inactive ETR1 exhibit reduced  sensitivity to ethylene based on several growth response assays. Microarray and  real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of gene expression support a role  for histidine kinase activity in eliciting the ethylene response. In addition,  protein levels of the Raf-like kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), which  physically associates with the ethylene receptor ETR1, are less responsive to  ethylene in lines containing kinase-inactive ETR1. These data indicate that the  histidine kinase activity of ETR1 is not required for but plays a modulating role  in the regulation of ethylene responses. Models for how enzymatic and  nonenzymatic regulation may facilitate signaling from the ethylene receptors are  discussed.', '2012 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.196790', 'Schaller']
