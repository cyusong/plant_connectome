The centromere is a unique part of the chromosome combining a conserved function with an extreme variability in its DNA sequence. Most of our knowledge about the functional centromere organization is obtained from species with small and medium genome/chromosome sizes while the progress in plants with big genomes and large chromosomes is lagging behind. Here, we studied the genomic organization of the functional centromere in <i>Allium fistulosum</i> and <i>A. cepa</i>, both species with a large genome (13 Gb and 16 Gb/1C, 2<i>n</i> = 2<i>x</i> = 16) and large-sized chromosomes. Using low-depth DNA sequencing for these two species and previously obtained CENH3 immunoprecipitation data we identified two long (1.2 Kb) and high-copy repeats, AfCen1K and AcCen1K. FISH experiments showed that AfCen1K is located in all centromeres of <i>A. fistulosum</i> chromosomes while no AcCen1K FISH signals were identified on <i>A. cepa</i> chromosomes. Our molecular cytogenetic and bioinformatics survey demonstrated that these repeats are partially similar but differ in chromosomal location, sequence structure and genomic organization. In addition, we could conclude that the repeats are transcribed and their RNAs are not polyadenylated. We also observed that these repeats are associated with insertions of retrotransposons and plastidic DNA and the landscape of <i>A. cepa</i> and <i>A. fistulosum</i> centromeric regions possess insertions of plastidic DNA. Finally, we carried out detailed comparative satellitome analysis of <i>A. cepa</i> and <i>A. fistulosum</i> genomes and identified a new chromosome- and <i>A. cepa</i>-specific tandem repeat, TR2CL137, located in the centromeric region. Our results shed light on the <i>Allium</i> centromere organization and provide unique data for future application in <i>Allium</i> genome annotation.
