Concluding remarks 72 Acknowledgements 72 References 72 SUMMARY: The view that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi commonly participate in the enzymatic liberation of nitrogen (N) from soil organic matter (SOM) has recently been invoked as a key mechanism governing the biogeochemical cycles of forest ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence that not all evolutionary lineages of ECM have retained the genetic potential to produce extracellular enzymes that degrade SOM, calling into question the ubiquity of the proposed mechanism. Further, we discuss several untested conditions that must be empirically validated before it is certain that any lineage of ECM fungi actively expresses extracellular enzymes in order to degrade SOM and transfer N contained therein to its host plant.
