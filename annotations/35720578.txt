Senescence is a necessary stage of plant growth and development, and the early senescence of rice will lead to yield reduction and quality decline. However, the mechanisms of rice senescence remain obscure. In this study, we characterized an early-senescence rice mutant, designated <i>zj-es</i> (<i>ZheJing-early senescence</i>), which was derived from the japonica rice cultivar Zhejing22. The mutant <i>zj-es</i> exhibited obvious early-senescence phenotype, such as collapsed chloroplast, lesions in leaves, declined fertility, plant dwarf, and decreased agronomic traits. The <i>ZJ-ES</i> gene was mapped in a 458 kb-interval between the molecular markers RM5992 and RM5813 on Chromosome 3, and analysis suggested that <i>ZJ-ES</i> is a novel gene controlling rice early senescence. Subsequently, whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing was performed on <i>zj-es</i> and its wild-type rice to dissect the underlying molecular mechanism for early senescence. Totally, 10,085 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), 1,253 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), and 614 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified, respectively, in different comparison groups. Based on the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), the co-expression turquoise module was found to be the key for the occurrence of rice early senescence. Furthermore, analysis on the competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) network revealed that 14 lncRNAs possibly regulated 16 co-expressed mRNAs through 8 miRNAs, and enrichment analysis showed that most of the DEmRNAs and the targets of DElncRNAs and DEmiRNAs were involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered autophagy-related pathways. Further analysis showed that, in <i>zj-es</i>, ROS-related enzyme activities were markedly changed, ROS were largely accumulated, autophagosomes were obviously observed, cell death was significantly detected, and lesions were notably appeared in leaves. Totally, combining our results here and the remaining research, we infer that ROS-triggered autophagy induces the programmed cell death (PCD) and its coupled early senescence in <i>zj-es</i> mutant rice.
