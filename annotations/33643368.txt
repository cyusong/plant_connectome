The specific variation in the functional ionome was studied in <i>Brassica napus</i> and <i>Triticum aestivum</i> plants subjected to micronutrient or beneficial mineral nutrient deprivation. Effects of these deprivations were compared to those of macronutrient deprivation. In order to identify early events, plants were harvested after 22 days, i.e., before any significant reduction in growth relative to control plants. Root uptake, tissue concentrations and relative root nutrient contents were analyzed revealing numerous interactions with respect to the 20 elements quantified. The assessment of the functional ionome under individual mineral nutrient deficiency allows the identification of a large number of interactions between elements, although it is not totally exhaustive, and gives access to specific ionomic signatures that discriminate among deficiencies in N, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, Na, Si, and Se in both species, plus Mg, Cl, Cu, and Mo in wheat. Ionome modifications and components of ionomic signatures are discussed in relation to well-known mechanisms that may explain crosstalks between mineral nutrients, such as between Na and K, V, Se, Mo and S or Fe, Zn and Cu. More surprisingly, when deprived of beneficial nutrients such as Na, Si, Co, or Se, the plant ionome was strongly modified while these beneficial nutrients contributed greatly to the leaf ionomic signature of most mineral deficiencies.
