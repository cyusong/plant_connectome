Epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes drive strong consumer interest in plant-based low-calorie sweeteners. Trilobatin is a sweetener found at high concentrations in the leaves of a range of crabapple (<i>Malus</i>) species, but not in domesticated apple (<i>Malus</i> × <i>domestica</i>) leaves, which contain trilobatin's bitter positional isomer phloridzin. Variation in trilobatin content was mapped to the <i>Trilobatin</i> locus on LG 7 in a segregating population developed from a cross between domesticated apples and crabapples. <i>Phloretin glycosyltransferase2</i> (<i>PGT2</i>) was identified by activity-directed protein purification and differential gene expression analysis in samples high in trilobatin but low in phloridzin. Markers developed for <i>PGT2</i> cosegregated strictly with the <i>Trilobatin</i> locus. Biochemical analysis showed PGT2 efficiently catalyzed 4'-o-glycosylation of phloretin to trilobatin as well as 3-hydroxyphloretin to sieboldin. Transient expression of double bond reductase, chalcone synthase, and <i>PGT2</i> genes reconstituted the apple pathway for trilobatin production in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> Transgenic <i>M.</i> × <i>domestica</i> plants overexpressing <i>PGT2</i> produced high concentrations of trilobatin in young leaves. Transgenic plants were phenotypically normal, and no differences in disease susceptibility were observed compared to wild-type plants grown under simulated field conditions. Sensory analysis indicated that apple leaf teas from <i>PGT2</i> transgenics were readily discriminated from control leaf teas and were perceived as significantly sweeter. Identification of <i>PGT2</i> allows marker-aided selection to be developed to breed apples containing trilobatin, and for high amounts of this natural low-calorie sweetener to be produced via biopharming and metabolic engineering in yeast.
