Knowledge about environmental and biological rhythms can lead to more sustainable agriculture in a climate crisis and resource scarcity scenario. When rhythms are considered, more efficient and cost-effective management practices can be designed for food production. The circadian clock is used to anticipate daily and seasonal changes, organize the metabolism during the day, integrate internal and external signals, and optimize interaction with other organisms. Plants with a circadian clock in synchrony with the environment are more productive and use fewer resources. In medicine, chronotherapy is used to increase drug efficacy, reduce toxicity, and understand the health effects of circadian clock disruption. Here, I show evidence of why circadian biology can be helpful in agriculture. However, as evidence is scattered among many areas, they frequently lack field testing, integrate poorly with other rhythms, or suffer inconsistent results. These problems can be mitigated if researchers of different areas start collaborating under a new study area-circadian agriculture.
