Predicted interactions are a valuable complement to experimentally reported interactions in molecular mechanism studies, particularly for higher organisms, for which reported experimental interactions represent only a small fraction of their total interactomes. With careful engineering consideration of the lessons from previous efforts, the predicted arabidopsis interactome resource (PAIR; ) presents 149,900 potential molecular interactions, which are expected to cover approximately 24% of the entire interactome with approximately 40% precision. This study demonstrates that, although PAIR still has limited coverage, it is rich enough to capture many significant functional linkages within and between higher-order biological systems, such as pathways and biological processes. These inferred interactions can nicely power several network topology-based systems biology analyses, such as gene set linkage analysis, protein function prediction, and identification of regulatory genes demonstrating insignificant expression changes. The drastically expanded molecular network in PAIR has considerably improved the capability of these analyses to integrate existing knowledge and suggest novel insights into the function and coordination of genes and gene networks.
