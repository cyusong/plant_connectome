Although seed oil content and its fatty acid compositions in soybean were affected by environment, QTN-by-environment (QEIs) and gene-by-environment interactions (GEIs) were rarely reported in genome-wide association studies. The 3VmrMLM method was used to associate the trait phenotypes, measured in five to seven environments, of 286 soybean accessions with 106,013 SNPs for detecting QTNs and QEIs. Seven oil metabolism genes (<i>GmSACPD-A, GmSACPD-B, GmbZIP123, GmSWEET39, GmFATB1A, GmDGAT2D</i>, and <i>GmDGAT1B</i>) around 598 QTNs and one oil metabolism gene GmFATB2B around 54 QEIs were verified in previous studies; 76 candidate genes and 66 candidate GEIs were predicted to be associated with these traits, in which 5 genes around QEIs were verified in other species to participate in oil metabolism, and had differential expression across environments. These genes were found to be related to soybean seed oil content in haplotype analysis. In addition, most candidate GEIs were co-expressed with drought response genes in co-expression network, and three KEGG pathways which respond to drought were enriched under drought stress rather than control condition; six candidate genes were hub genes in the co-expression networks under drought stress. The above results indicated that GEIs, together with drought response genes in co-expression network, may respond to drought, and play important roles in regulating seed oil-related traits together with oil metabolism genes. These results provide important information for genetic basis, molecular mechanisms, and soybean breeding for seed oil-related traits.
