Leaf CO<sub>2</sub> uptake (A) in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is limited by the maximum apparent rate of PEPc carboxylation (V<sub>pmax</sub> ) at low intercellular [CO<sub>2</sub> ] (c<sub>i</sub> ) with a sharp transition to a c<sub>i</sub> -saturated rate (V<sub>max</sub> ) due to co-limitation by ribulose-1:5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and regeneration of PEP. The response of A to c<sub>i</sub> has been widely used to determine these two parameters. V<sub>max</sub> and V<sub>pmax</sub> depend on different enzymes but draw on a shared pool of leaf resources, such that resource distribution is optimized, and A maximized, when V<sub>max</sub> and V<sub>pmax</sub> are co-limiting. We collected published A/c<sub>i</sub> curves in 49 C<sub>4</sub> species and assessed variation in photosynthetic traits between phylogenetic groups, and as a function of atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub> ]. The balance of V<sub>max</sub> -V<sub>pmax</sub> varied among evolutionary lineages and C<sub>4</sub> subtypes. Operating A was strongly V<sub>max</sub> -limited, such that re-allocation of resources from V<sub>pmax</sub> towards V<sub>max</sub> was predicted to improve A by 12% in C<sub>4</sub> crops. This would not require additional inputs but rather altered partitioning of existing leaf nutrients, resulting in increased water and nutrient-use efficiency. Optimal partitioning was achieved only in plants grown at pre-industrial atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub> ], suggesting C<sub>4</sub> crops have not adjusted to the rapid increase in atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub> ] of the past few decades.
