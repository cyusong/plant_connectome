['21275995', '* Villin is one of the major actin filament bundling proteins in plants. The  function of Arabidopsis VILLINs (AtVLNs) is still poorly understood in living  cells. In this report, the biochemical activity and cellular function of AtVLN4  were examined. * The biochemical property of AtVLN4 was characterized by  co-sedimentation assays, fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy of pyrene  fluorescence. The in vivo function of AtVLN4 was analysed by ectopically  expressing it in tobacco pollen and examining the phenotypes of its T-DNA  insertional plants. * Recombinant AtVLN4 protein exhibited multiple activities on  actin, including actin filament bundling, calcium (Ca(2+))-dependent filament  severing and barbed end capping. Expression of AtVLN4 in tobacco pollen induced  the formation of supernumerary actin cables and reduced pollen tube growth. Loss  of function of AtVLN4 resulted in slowing of root hair growth, alteration in  cytoplasmic streaming routes and rate, and reduction of both axial and apical  actin bundles. * Our results demonstrated that AtVLN4 is involved in root hair  growth through regulating actin organization in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner.', '2011 May', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03632.x', 'Ren']
