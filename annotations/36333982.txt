Karrikins (KARs) are a class of butenolide compounds found in smoke that were first identified as seed germination stimulants for fire-following species. Early studies of KARs classified the germination and postgermination responses of many plant species and investigated crosstalk with plant hormones that regulate germination. The discovery that Arabidopsis thaliana responds to KARs laid the foundation for identifying mutants with altered KAR responses. Genetic analysis of KAR signalling revealed an unexpected link to strigolactones (SLs), a class of carotenoid-derived plant hormones. Substantial progress has since been made towards understanding how KARs are perceived and regulate plant growth, in no small part due to advances in understanding SL perception. KAR and SL signalling systems are evolutionarily related and retain a high degree of similarity. There is strong evidence that KARs are natural analogues of an endogenous signal(s), KAI2 ligand (KL), which remains unknown. KAR/KL signalling regulates many developmental processes in plants including germination, seedling photomorphogenesis, and root and root hair growth. KAR/KL signalling also affects abiotic stress responses and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Here, we summarise the current knowledge of KAR/KL signalling and discuss current controversies and unanswered questions in this field.
