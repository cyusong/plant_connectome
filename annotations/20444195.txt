Low-pH and Al(3+) stresses are the major causes of poor plant growth in acidic soils. However, there is still a poor understanding of plant responses to low-pH and Al(3+) toxicity. Low-pH or combined low-pH and Al(3+) stress was imposed in order to measure rhizosphere pH, ion fluxes, plasma membrane potential and intracellular H(+) concentration in distal elongation and mature zones (MZs) along the longitudinal axis of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Low-pH stress facilitated H(+) influx into root tissues and caused cytoplasmic acidification; by contrast, combined low-pH/Al(3+) treatment either decreased H(+) influx in the distal elongation zone (DEZ) or induced H(+) efflux in the MZ, leading to cytoplasmic alkalinization in both zones. Low-pH stress induced an increase in rhizosphere pH in the DEZ, whereas combined low-pH/Al(3+) stress resulted in lower rhizosphere pH in both root zones compared with the low-pH treatment alone. Low-pH stress facilitated K(+) efflux; the presence of Al(3+) diminished K(+) efflux or favored K(+) influx into root tissues. In both zones, low-pH treatment induced plasma membrane (PM) depolarization, which was significantly diminished (P<or= 0.05) when combined stresses (low-pH/100 microM Al(3+)) were imposed. After 60 min of exposure, low pH caused PM depolarization, whereas low pH/100 microM Al(3+) caused PM hyperpolarization. Thus, low pH and Al(3+) toxicity differentially affect root tissues and, consequently, the rhizosphere, which might underpin the differential mechanisms of plant adaptation to these abiotic stresses.
