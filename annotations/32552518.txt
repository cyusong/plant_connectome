Here, we report a chromosome-level genome assembly of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> Fo47 (12 pseudomolecules; contig N<sub>50</sub>: 4.52 Mb), generated using a combination of PacBio long-read, Illumina paired end, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture sequencing data. Although <i>F. oxysporum</i> causes vascular wilt to over 100 plant species, the strain Fo47 is classified as an endophyte and is widely used as a biocontrol agent for plant disease control. The Fo47 genome carries a single accessory chromosome of 4.23 Mb, compared with the reference genome of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> Fol4287. The high-quality assembly and annotation of the Fo47 genome will be a valuable resource for studying the mechanisms underlying the endophytic interactions between <i>F. oxysporum</i> and plants as well as for deciphering the genome evolution of the <i>F. oxysporum</i> species complex.
