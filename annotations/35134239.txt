Biochemical and genetic approaches have been extensively used to study transcription factor (TF) functions, but their dynamic behaviors and the complex ways in which they regulate transcription in plant cells remain unexplored, particularly behaviors such as translocation and binding to DNA. Recent developments in labeling and imaging techniques provide the necessary sensitivity and resolution to study these behaviors in living cells. In this review, we present an up-to-date portrait of the dynamics and regulation of TFs under physiologically relevant conditions and then summarize recent advances in fluorescent labeling strategies and imaging techniques. We then discuss future prospects and challenges associated with the application of these techniques to examine TFs' intricate dance in living plants.
