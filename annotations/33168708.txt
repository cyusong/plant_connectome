Production and expression of RNA requires the action of multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). New RBPs are most often created by novel combinations of dedicated RNA-binding modules. However, recruiting existing genes to create new RBPs is also an important evolutionary strategy. In this report, we analyzed the eight-member uL18 ribosomal protein family in <i>Arabidopsis</i> uL18 proteins share a short structurally conserved domain that binds the 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and allows its incorporation into ribosomes. Our results indicate that <i>Arabidopsis</i> uL18-Like proteins are targeted to either mitochondria or chloroplasts. While two members of the family are found in organelle ribosomes, we show here that two uL18-type proteins function as factors necessary for the splicing of certain mitochondrial and plastid group II introns. These two proteins do not cosediment with mitochondrial or plastid ribosomes but instead associate with the introns whose splicing they promote. Our study thus reveals that the RNA-binding capacity of uL18 ribosomal proteins has been repurposed to create factors that facilitate the splicing of organellar introns.
