Tocopherol (vitamin E) is widely recognized as a cellular antioxidant. It is essential for human and animal health, but only synthesized in photosynthetic organisms, where it is localized in chloroplast membranes. While many studies have investigated non-antioxidative effects of tocopherol on phospholipid membranes, nothing is known about its effects on membranes containing chloroplast glycolipids. Here, liposomes resembling plant chloroplast membranes were used to investigate the effects of alpha-tocopherol on vesicle stability during freezing and on lipid dynamics. alpha-Tocopherol had a pronounced influence on membrane dynamics and showed strong interactions in its effects on membrane stability during freezing with the cryoprotectant sucrose. alpha-Tocopherol showed maximal effects at low concentrations (around 2mol%), close to its contents in chloroplast membranes.
