Calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals occur as intravacuolar deposits in most angiosperm species. Different functions have been attributed to these crystals, some of which are very speculative, until now. Calcium regulation and homeostasis seem to be the most widespread function of CaOx crystals. Being rich in calcium, these crystals constitute a reserve of calcium for plants. However, despite being bioavailable, this reserve is functional in just a few situations due to the low mobility of calcium for phloem translocation. Therefore, CaOx crystals as a calcium reserve is a paradox because in most cases the reserve cannot be used. However, in most plants, these crystals occur in organs or tissues that will be discarded, which allows the elimination of excess calcium. This suggests that CaOx crystals have a functional role in excess calcium excretion. There is some evidence that, for calcium, this excretory function is relevant for plants since they lack an excretory system dedicated to discarding solid wastes, such as calcium salts.
