Double-stranded RNA-binding proteins are small molecules in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway that form the RNAi machinery together with the Dicer-like protein (DCL) as a cofactor. This machinery cuts double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to form multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Our goal was to clarify the function of <i>DRB</i> in tomato resistant to TYLCV. In this experiment, the expression of the <i>SlDRB1</i> and <i>SlDRB4</i> genes was analyzed in tomato leaves by qPCR, and the function of <i>SlDRB1</i> and <i>SlDRB4</i> in resistance to TYLCV was investigated by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Then, peroxidase activity was determined. The results showed that the expression of <i>SlDRB1</i> gradually increased after inoculation of 'dwarf tomato' plants with tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), but this gene was suppressed after 28 days. Resistance to TYLCV was significantly weakened after silencing of the <i>SlDRB1</i> gene. However, there were no significant expression differences in <i>SlDRB4</i> after TYLCV inoculation. Our study showed that silencing <i>SlDRB1</i> attenuated the ability of tomato plants to resist virus infection; therefore, <i>SlDRB1</i> may play a key role in the defense against TYLCV in tomato plants, whereas <i>SlDRB4</i> is likely not involved in this defense response. Taken together, These results suggest that the <i>DRB</i> gene is involved in the mechanism of antiviral activity.
