The activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) by extracellular ligands constitutes the first step of heterotrimeric G-protein signalling in animals. In plants, canonical GPCRs have been known for over 25 years, often in association with agronomically important functions. But their role in plant G-protein signalling and even their annotation as GPCR was contested in the last decade, only to be revisited in the light of more recent evidences. In this first ever review on plant GPCRs, we catalogue all the plant GPCRs described to date and discuss the evidences for and against their role in plants in general and G-protein signalling in particular. We argue against writing off GPCRs and point to the missing links to be investigated to establish firm conclusions either way.
