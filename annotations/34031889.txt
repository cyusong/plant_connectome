Photoperiod-dependent male fertility is a critical enabler of modern hybrid breeding. A MYB transcription factor, CSA, is a key regulator of sugar partitioning in rice anthers, disruption of which causes photoperiod-sensitive male sterility. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing plant fertility in response to photoperiod. Here, we have obtained another rice photoperiod-sensitive male sterile mutant, csa2, which exhibits semi-sterility under long-day (LD) conditions, with normal fertility under short-day (SD) conditions. CSA2 specifically expressed in anthers, and here is shown to be indispensable for sugar partitioning to anthers under LD conditions. The CSA2 protein can restore the fertility of csa mutants under SD conditions when expressed in a CSA-specific pattern, indicating that the two proteins share common downstream regulatory targets. Transcriptomic analyses also reveal discrete regulatory targets in anthers. Furthermore, the regulatory role of CSA2 in sugar transport was influenced by the photoperiod conditions during floral initiation, not simply during anther development. Collectively, we propose that rice evolved at least two MYB proteins, CSA2 and CSA, that regulate sugar transport in anthers under LD and SD conditions, respectively. This finding provides insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate male fertility in response to photoperiod.
