['24606192', 'The U12-dependent introns have been identified in a wide range of eukaryotes and  are removed from precursor-mRNAs by U12 intron-specific minor spliceosome.  Although several proteins unique to minor spliceosome have been identified, the  nature of their effect on U12 intron splicing as well as plant growth and  development remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the functional role of  an U12-type spliceosomal protein, U11/U12-65K in Arabidopsis thaliana. The  transgenic knockdown plants generated by artificial miRNA-mediated silencing  strategy exhibited severe defect in growth and development, such as severely  arrested primary inflorescence stems, serrated leaves, and the formation of many  rosette leaves after bolting. RNA sequencing and reverse transcription polymerase  chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that splicing of 198 out of the 234  previously predicted U12 intron-containing genes and 32 previously unidentified  U12 introns was impaired in u11/u12-65k mutant. Moreover, the U11/U12-65K  mutation affected alternative splicing, as well as U12 intron splicing, of many  introns. Microarray analysis revealed that the genes involved in cell wall  biogenesis and function, plant development, and metabolic processes are  differentially expressed in the mutant plants. U11/U12-65K protein bound  specifically to U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which is necessary for  branch-point site recognition. Taken together, these results provide clear  evidence that U11/U12-65K is an indispensible component of minor spliceosome and  involved in U12 intron splicing and alternative splicing of many introns, which  is crucial for plant development.', '2014 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12498', 'Kang']
