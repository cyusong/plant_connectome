Although fleshy fruit is mainly made up of water, little is known about the impact of its water status on sugar metabolism and its composition. In order to verify whether fruit water status is an important driver of carbohydrate composition in tomato fruit, an adaptation of the SUGAR model proposed previously by M. Génard and M. Souty was used. Two versions of the model, with or without integrating the influence of fruit water content on carbohydrate metabolism, were proposed and then assessed with the data sets from two genotypes, Levovil and Cervil, grown under different conditions. The results showed that, for both genotypes, soluble sugars and starch were better fitted by the model when the effects of water content on carbohydrate metabolism were taken into consideration. Water content might play a regulatory role in the carbon metabolism from sugars to compounds other than sugars and starch in Cervil fruit, and from sugars to starch in Levovil fruit. While water content influences tomato fruit carbohydrate concentrations by both metabolism and dilution/dehydration effects in the early developmental stage, it is mainly by dilution/dehydration effects in the late stage. The possible mechanisms underlying the effect of the fruit water content on carbohydrate metabolism are also discussed.
