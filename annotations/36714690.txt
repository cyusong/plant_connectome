Wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world and drought can severely impact on wheat productivity. The identification and deployment of genes for improved water use efficiency (WUE) can help alleviate yield loss under water limitation. In this study, a high-density genetic linkage map of wheat recombinant inbred lines (Ningchun 4 x Ningchun 27) containing 8751 specific locus amplified fragment (SLAF) tags (including 14757 SNPs), with a total map distance of 1685 cM and an average inter-marker map distance of 0.19 cM was constructed by SLAF-seq technology. The economic yield WUE and nine related traits under three water treatments was monitored over four years. The results showed that loci conditioning WUE were also associated with grain carbon isotope discrimination (CID), flag leaf chlorophyll content, plant height, 1000-grain weight, grain weight per spike and grain number per spike. One locus on chromosome 2B explained 26.3% WUE variation in multiple environments. Under good soil moisture conditions before flowering, the high CID genotype <i>QWue.acn-2B</i> <sup>Ningchun 27</sup>, was associated with WUE, high grain weight per spike, and kilo-grain weight. Under rain-fed conditions, the low CID genotype <i>QWue.acn-2B</i> <sup>Ningchun 4</sup> tended to maintain more spike number and was associated with improved WUE and yield. The introduction of good chromosome fragments of <i>QWue.acn-2B</i> into elite lines by molecular marker assisted selection will boost up the cultivation of high-yield and water-saving wheat varieties.
