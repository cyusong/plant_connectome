Brassinosteroids have been implicated in the differentiation of vascular cell types in herbaceous plants, but their roles during secondary growth and wood formation are not well defined. Here we pharmacologically and genetically manipulated brassinosteroid levels in poplar trees and assayed the effects on secondary growth and wood formation, and on gene expression within stems. Elevated brassinosteroid levels resulted in increases in secondary growth and tension wood formation, while inhibition of brassinosteroid synthesis resulted in decreased growth and secondary vascular differentiation. Analysis of gene expression showed that brassinosteroid action is positively associated with genes involved in cell differentiation and cell-wall biosynthesis. The results presented here show that brassinosteroids play a foundational role in the regulation of secondary growth and wood formation, in part through the regulation of cell differentiation and secondary cell wall biosynthesis.
