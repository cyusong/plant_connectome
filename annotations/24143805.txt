['24143805', 'The evolution of lignin biosynthesis was critical in the transition of plants  from an aquatic to an upright terrestrial lifestyle. Lignin is assembled by  oxidative polymerization of two major monomers, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl  alcohol. Although two recently discovered laccases, LAC4 and LAC17, have been  shown to play a role in lignin polymerization in Arabidopsis thaliana, disruption  of both genes only leads to a relatively small change in lignin content and only  under continuous illumination. Simultaneous disruption of LAC11 along with LAC4  and LAC17 causes severe plant growth arrest, narrower root diameter, indehiscent  anthers, and vascular development arrest with lack of lignification. Genome-wide  transcript analysis revealed that all the putative lignin peroxidase genes are  expressed at normal levels or even higher in the laccase triple mutant,  suggesting that lignin laccase activity is necessary and nonredundant with  peroxidase activity for monolignol polymerization during plant vascular  development. Interestingly, even though lignin deposition in roots is almost  completely abolished in the lac11 lac4 lac17 triple mutant, the Casparian strip,  which is lignified through the activity of peroxidase, is still functional.  Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lignin laccase genes have no orthologs in  lower plant species, suggesting that the monolignol laccase genes diverged after  the evolution of seed plants.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.117770', 'Dixon']
