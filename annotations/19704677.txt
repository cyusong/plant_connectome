Plants can interact with other plants through the release of chemical compounds or allelochemicals. These compounds released by donor plants influence germination, growth, development, and establishment of receptor plants; having an important role on the pattern of vegetation, i.e as invasive strategy, and on crop productivity. This phytotoxic or negative effect of the released allelochemicals (allelochemical stress) is caused by modifying or altering diverse metabolic processes, having many molecular targets in the receptor plants. Recently, using an aggressive and allelopathic plant Sicyos deppei as the donor plant, and Lycopersicon esculentum as the receptor plant, we showed that the allelochemicals released by S. deppei caused oxidative damage through an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation or modification of antioxidant enzymes. Based on this study, we proposed that oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms, among others, by which an allelopathic plant causes phytotoxicity to other plants.
