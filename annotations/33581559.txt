Zygotic and somatic embryogenesis in plants is a fascinating event that is finely regulated through the expression of a specific group of genes and dynamic levels of plant hormones whose concerted action determines the fate that specific cells follow towards zygotic or somatic embryo development. This work studied different stages of Capsicum chinense Jacq. zygotic and somatic embryogenesis. HPLC quantification determined that the levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) increase as the zygotic or somatic embryogenesis progresses, being higher at maturity, thus supporting a positive correlation between embryo cell differentiation and IAA increase. A monoclonal anti-IAA-antibody was used to detect IAA levels. Findings revealed a dynamic pattern of auxin distribution along the different embryogenic embryonic stages. In the early stages of zygotic embryos, the IAA gradient was observed in the basal cells of the suspensor and the hypostases, suggesting that they are the initial source of the IAA hormone. As embryogenesis proceeds, the dynamic of the IAA gradient is displaced to the embryo and endosperm cells. In the case of induced somatic embryogenesis, the IAA gradient was detected in the dividing cells of the endodermis, from where pre-embryogenic cells emerge. However, the analysis of somatic embryos revealed that IAA was homogeneously distributed. This study shows evidence supporting a correlation between IAA levels during zygotic or somatic embryogenesis in Capsicum chinense species.
