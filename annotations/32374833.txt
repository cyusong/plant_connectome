Chromatin is the main carrier of genetic information and is non-randomly distributed within the nucleus. Next-generation sequence-based chromatin conformation capture technologies have enabled us to directly examine its three-dimensional organization at an unprecedented scale and resolution. In the best-studied mammalian models, chromatin folding can be broken down into three hierarchical levels, compartment, domains, and loops, which play important roles in transcriptional regulation. Although similar structures have now been identified in plants, they might not possess exactly the same functions as the mammalian ones. Here, we review recent Hi-C studies in plants, compare plant chromatin structures with their mammalian counterparts, and discuss the differences between plants with different genome sizes.
