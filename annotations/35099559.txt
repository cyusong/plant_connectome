Cuscuta species (dodders) are agriculturally destructive, parasitic angiosperms. These parasitic plants use haustoria as physiological bridges to extract nutrients and water from hosts. Cuscuta campestris has a broad host range and wide geographical distribution. While some wild tomato relatives are resistant, cultivated tomatoes are generally susceptible to C. campestris infestations. However, some specific Heinz tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) hybrid cultivars exhibit resistance to dodders in the field, but their defense mechanism was previously unknown. Here, we discovered that the stem cortex in these resistant lines responds with local lignification upon C. campestris attachment, preventing parasite entry into the host. Lignin Induction Factor 1 (LIF1, an AP2-like transcription factor), SlMYB55, and Cuscuta R-gene for Lignin-based Resistance 1, a CC-NBS-LRR (CuRLR1) are identified as factors that confer host resistance by regulating lignification. SlWRKY16 is upregulated upon C. campestris infestation and potentially negatively regulates LIF1 function. Intriguingly, CuRLR1 may play a role in signaling or function as an intracellular receptor for receiving Cuscuta signals or effectors, thereby regulating lignification-based resistance. In summary, these four regulators control the lignin-based resistance response in specific Heinz tomato cultivars, preventing C. campestris from parasitizing resistant tomatoes. This discovery provides a foundation for investigating multilayer resistance against Cuscuta species and has potential for application in other essential crops attacked by parasitic plants.
