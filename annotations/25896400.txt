In yeast and mammals, prohibitins (PHBs) are considered as structural proteins that form a scaffold-like structure for interacting with a set of proteins involved in various processes occurring in the mitochondria. The role of PHB in plant mitochondria is poorly understood. In the study, the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana was used to identify the possible roles of type-II PHBs (homologs of yeast Phb2p) in plant mitochondria. The obtained results suggest that the plant PHB complex participates in the assembly of multisubunit complexes; namely, respiratory complex I and enzymatic complexes carrying lipoic acid as a cofactor (pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and glycine decarboxylase). PHBs physically interact with subunits of these complexes. Knockout of two Arabidopsis type-II prohibitins (AtPHB2 and AtPHB6) results in a decreased abundance of these complexes along with a reduction in mitochondrial acyl carrier proteins. Also, the absence of AtPHB2 and AtPHB6 influences the expression of the mitochondrial genome and leads to the activation of alternative respiratory pathways, namely alternative oxidase and external NADH-dependent alternative dehydrogenases.
