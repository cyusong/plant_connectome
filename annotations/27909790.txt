Exogenously applied GR24 affected somatic embryo formation and morphogenesis of strigolactone-deficient tomato mutant through cross-talk with auxins and cytokinins indicating involvement of SLs in the embryogenic process. Strigolactones (SLs) mediate the regulation of plant responses to the environment through cross-talk with other plant hormones, especially auxins. Auxins play a crucial role in coordinating the morphogenesis and development of plant reproductive organs, including the signal-transduction cascade leading to the reprogramming of gene-expression patterns before embryo formation. SLs' role in these processes is unknown, in contrast to their proven involvement in auxin transport and distribution. We used tomato cv. M82 and its SL-deficient mutant SL-ORT1 to study the influence of SLs on hormone profile in tomato roots and shoots, and their involvement in somatic embryogenesis (SE) and morphogenesis (adventitious root formation). The synthetic SL GR24 had different effects on SE of M82 and SL-ORT1, indicating that SLs influence the cytokinin-to-auxin ratio in tomato SE.
