Tomato leaf curl virus-Australia (ToLCV) C4 protein has been shown to be associated with virus pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that C4 acts as a suppressor of gene silencing. To understand the multifunctional role of C4, a novel shaggy-like kinase (SlSK) from tomato, which interacts with ToLCV C4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, was isolated and interaction between these proteins was confirmed in vitro and in planta. Using deletion analysis of C4, a 12 amino acid region in the C-terminal part of C4 was identified which was shown to be essential for its binding to SlSK. We further demonstrate that this region is not only important for the interaction of C4 with SlSK, but is also required for C4 function to suppress gene silencing activity and to induce virus symptoms in a PVX system. The potential significance of ToLCV C4 and SlSK interaction is discussed.
