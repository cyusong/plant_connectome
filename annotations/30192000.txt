Chloroplasts retain part of their ancestral genomes and the machinery for expression of those genomes. The nucleus-encoded chloroplast RNA helicase INCREASED SIZE EXCLUSION LIMIT2 (ISE2) is required for chloroplast ribosomal RNA processing and chloro-ribosome assembly. To further elucidate ISE2's role in chloroplast translation, two independent approaches were used to identify its potential protein partners. Both a yeast two-hybrid screen and a pull-down assay identified plastid ribosomal protein L15, uL15c (formerly RPL15), as interacting with ISE2. The interaction was confirmed in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, we found that rpl15 null mutants do not complete embryogenesis, indicating that RPL15 is an essential gene for autotrophic growth of Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana plants with reduced expression of RPL15 developed chlorotic leaves, had reduced photosynthetic capacity and exhibited defective chloroplast development. Processing of chloroplast ribosomal RNAs and assembly of ribosomal subunits were disrupted by reduced expression of RPL15. Chloroplast translation was also decreased, reducing accumulation of chloroplast-encoded proteins, in such plants compared to wild-type plants. Notably, knockdown of RPL15 expression increased intercellular trafficking, a phenotype also observed in plants with reduced ISE2 expression. This finding provides further evidence for chloroplast function in modulating intercellular trafficking via plasmodesmata.
