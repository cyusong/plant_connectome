A deeper understanding of the drought response and genetic improvement of the cultivated crops for better tolerance requires attention because of the complexity of the drought response syndrome and the loss of genetic diversity during domestication. We initially screened about 200 wild emmer wheat genotypes and then focused on 26 of these lines, which led to the selection of two genotypes with contrasting responses to water deficiency. Six subtractive cDNA libraries were constructed, and over 13 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced using leaf and root tissues of wild emmer wheat genotypes TR39477 (tolerant) and TTD-22 (sensitive), and modern wheat variety Kiziltan drought stressed for 7 d. Clustering and assembly of ESTs resulted in 2376 unique sequences (1159 without hypothetical proteins and no hits), 75% of which were represented only once. At this level of EST sampling, each tissue shared a very low percentage of transcripts (13-26%). The data obtained indicated that the genotypes shared common elements of drought stress as well as distinctly differential expression patterns that might be illustrative of their contrasting ability to tolerate water deficiencies. The new EST data generated here provide a highly diverse and rich source for gene discovery in wheat and other grasses.
