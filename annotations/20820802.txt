Plant root-associated bacteria (rhizobacteria) elicit plant basal immunity referred to as induced systemic resistance (ISR) against multiple pathogens. Among multi-bacterial determinants involving such ISR, the induction of ISR and promotion of growth by bacterial volatile compounds was previously reported. To exploit global de novo expression of plant proteins by bacterial volatiles, proteomic analysis was performed after exposure of Arabidopsis plants to the rhizobacterium Bacillus subtilis GB03. Ethylene biosynthesis enzymes were significantly up-regulated. Analysis by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed that ethylene biosynthesis-related genes SAM-2, ACS4, ACS12, and ACO2 as well as ethylene response genes, ERF1, GST2, and CHIB were up-regulated by the exposure to bacterial volatiles. More interestingly, the emission of bacterial volatiles significantly up-regulated both key defense mechanisms mediated by jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathways. In addition, high accumulation of antioxidant proteins also provided evidence of decreased sensitivity to reactive oxygen species during the elicitation of ISR by bacterial volatiles. The present results suggest that the proteomic analysis of plant defense responses in bacterial volatile-mediated ISR can reveal the mechanisms of plant basal defenses orchestrated by endogenous ethylene production pathways and the generation of reactive oxygen species.
