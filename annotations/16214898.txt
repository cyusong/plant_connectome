['16214898', 'In plants, secondary wall thickenings play important roles in various biological  processes, although the factors regulating these processes remain to be  characterized. We show that expression of chimeric repressors derived from NAC  SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (NST1) and NST2 in Arabidopsis  thaliana resulted in an anther dehiscence defect due to loss of secondary wall  thickening in anther endothecium. Plants with double, but not single,  T-DNA-tagged lines for NST1 and NST2 had the same anther-indehiscent phenotype as  transgenic plants that expressed the individual chimeric repressors, indicating  that NST1 and NST2 are redundant in regulating secondary wall thickening in  anther walls. The activity of the NST2 promoter was particularly strong in anther  tissue, while that of the NST1 promoter was detected in various tissues in which  lignified secondary walls develop. Ectopic expression of NST1 or NST2 induced  ectopic thickening of secondary walls in various aboveground tissues. Epidermal  cells with ectopic thickening of secondary walls had structural features similar  to those of tracheary elements. However, among genes involved in the  differentiation of tracheary elements, only those related to secondary wall  synthesis were clearly upregulated. None of the genes involved in programmed cell  death were similarly affected. Our results suggest NAC transcription factors as  possible regulators of secondary wall thickening in various tissues.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.036004', 'Ohme-Takagi']
