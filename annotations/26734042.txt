['26734042', 'Although a wide range of physiological information on Universal Stress Proteins  (USPs) is available from many organisms, their biochemical, and molecular  functions remain unidentified. The biochemical function of AtUSP (At3g53990) from  Arabidopsis thaliana was therefore investigated. Plants over-expressing AtUSP  showed a strong resistance to heat shock and oxidative stress, compared with  wild-type and Atusp knock-out plants, confirming the crucial role of AtUSP in  stress tolerance. AtUSP was present in a variety of structures including  monomers, dimers, trimers, and oligomeric complexes, and switched in response to  external stresses from low molecular weight (LMW) species to high molecular  weight (HMW) complexes. AtUSP exhibited a strong chaperone function under stress  conditions in particular, and this activity was significantly increased by heat  treatment. Chaperone activity of AtUSP was critically regulated by the redox  status of cells and accompanied by structural changes to the protein.  Over-expression of AtUSP conferred a strong tolerance to heat shock and oxidative  stress upon Arabidopsis, primarily via its chaperone function.', '2015', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2015.01141', 'Lee']
