Biomolecular condensates are dynamic nonmembranous structures that seclude and concentrate molecules involved in related biochemical and molecular processes. Recent studies have revealed that a surprisingly large number of fundamentally important cellular processes are driven and regulated by this potentially ancient biophysical principle. Here, we summarize critical findings and new insights from condensate studies that are related to plant immunity. We discuss the role of stress granules and newly identified biomolecular condensates in coordinating plant immune responses and plant-microbe interactions.
