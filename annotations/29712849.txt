Plant cell infection is tightly controlled by cell surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs). Like other RLKs, the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> entry receptor LYK3 laterally segregates into membrane nanodomains in a stimulus-dependent manner. Although nanodomain localization arises as a generic feature of plant membrane proteins, the molecular mechanisms underlying such dynamic transitions and their functional relevance have remained poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that actin and the flotillin protein FLOT4 form the primary and indispensable core of a specific nanodomain. Infection-dependent induction of the remorin protein and secondary molecular scaffold SYMREM1 results in subsequent recruitment of ligand-activated LYK3 and its stabilization within these membrane subcompartments. Reciprocally, the majority of this LYK3 receptor pool is destabilized at the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid endocytosis in <i>symrem1</i> mutants on rhizobial inoculation, resulting in premature abortion of host cell infections. These data reveal that receptor recruitment into nanodomains is indispensable for their function during host cell infection.
