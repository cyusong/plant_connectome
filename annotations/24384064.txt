Traditionally, it was believed that C(4) photosynthesis required two types of chlorenchyma cells to concentrate CO(2) within the leaf. However, several species have been identified that perform C(4) photosynthesis using dimorphic chloroplasts within an individual cell. The goal of this research was to determine how growth under limited light affects leaf structure, biochemistry and efficiency of the single-cell CO(2) -concentrating mechanism in Bienertia sinuspersici. Measurements of rates of CO(2) assimilation and CO(2) isotope exchange in response to light intensity and O(2) were used to determine the efficiency of the CO(2) -concentrating mechanism in plants grown under moderate and low light. In addition, enzyme assays, chlorophyll content and light microscopy of leaves were used to characterize acclimation to light-limited growth conditions. There was acclimation to growth under low light with a decrease in capacity for photosynthesis when exposed to high light. This was associated with a decreased investment in biochemistry for carbon assimilation with only subtle changes in leaf structure and anatomy. The capture and assimilation of CO(2) delivered by the C(4) cycle was lower in low-light-grown plants. Low-light-grown plants were able to acclimate to maintain structural and functional features for the performance of efficient single-cell C(4) photosynthesis.
