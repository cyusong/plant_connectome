['19410546', 'DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic mark in plants and mammals. In  Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be triggered by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)  through an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Here, we report the  identification of an RdDM effector, KTF1. Loss-of-function mutations in KTF1  reduce DNA methylation and release the silencing of RdDM target loci without  abolishing the siRNA triggers. KTF1 has similarity to the transcription  elongation factor SPT5 and contains a C-terminal extension rich in GW/WG repeats.  KTF1 colocalizes with ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) in punctate nuclear foci and binds AGO4  and RNA transcripts. Our results suggest KTF1 as an adaptor protein that binds  scaffold transcripts generated by Pol V and recruits AGO4 and AGO4-bound siRNAs  to form an RdDM effector complex. The dual interaction of an effector protein  with AGO and small RNA target transcripts may be a general feature of  RNA-silencing effector complexes.', '2009 May 1', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.028', 'Zhu']
