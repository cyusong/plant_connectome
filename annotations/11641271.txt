['11641271', 'Auxins represent an important class of plant hormone that regulate plant  development. Plants use specialized carrier proteins to transport the auxin  indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to target tissues. To date, efflux carrier-mediated  polar auxin transport has been assumed to represent the sole mode of long  distance IAA movement. Localization of the auxin permease AUX1 in the Arabidopsis  root apex has revealed a novel phloem-based IAA transport pathway. AUX1,  asymmetrically localized to the plasma membrane of root protophloem cells, is  proposed to promote the acropetal, post-phloem movement of auxin to the root  apex. MS analysis shows that IAA accumulation in aux1 mutant root apices is  impaired, consistent with an AUX1 phloem unloading function. AUX1 localization to  columella and lateral root cap tissues of the Arabidopsis root apex reveals that  the auxin permease regulates a second IAA transport pathway. Expression studies  using an auxin-regulated reporter suggest that AUX1 is necessary for root  gravitropism by facilitating basipetal auxin transport to distal elongation zone  tissues.', '2001 Oct 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.210501', 'Bennett']
