['11884679', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an essential role in adaptive stress  responses. The hormone regulates, among others, the expression of numerous  stress-responsive genes. From various promoter analyses, ABA-responsive elements  (ABREs) have been determined and a number of ABRE binding factors have been  isolated, although their in vivo roles are not known. Here we report that the  ABRE binding factors ABF3 and ABF4 function in ABA signaling. The constitutive  overexpression of ABF3 or ABF4 in Arabidopsis resulted in ABA hypersensitivity  and other ABA-associated phenotypes. In addition, the transgenic plants exhibited  reduced transpiration and enhanced drought tolerance. At the molecular level,  altered expression of ABA/stress-regulated genes was observed. Furthermore, the  temporal and spatial expression patterns of ABF3 and ABF4 were consistent with  their suggested roles. Thus, our results provide strong in vivo evidence that  ABF3 and ABF4 mediate stress-responsive ABA signaling.', '2002 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010362', 'Kim']
