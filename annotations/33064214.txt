Molecular function ofRING E3 ligase SbHCI1is involved in ABA-mediated basal heat stress tolerancein sorghum. Global warming generally reduces plant survival, owing to the negative effects of high temperatures on plant development. However, little is known about the role of Really Interesting New Gene (RING) E3 ligase in the heat stress responses of plants. As such, the aim of the present study was to characterize the molecular functions of the Sorghum bicolor ortholog of the Oryza sativa gene for Heat- and Cold-Induced RING finger protein 1 (SbHCI1). Subcellular localization revealed that SbHCI1 was mainly associated with the cytosol and that it moved to the Golgi apparatus under heat stress conditions. The fluorescent signals of SbHCI1 substrate proteins were observed to migrate to the cytoplasm under heat stress conditions. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays revealed that SbHCI1 physically interacted with OsHCI1 ortholog partner proteins in the cytoplasm. Moreover, an in vitro ubiquitination assay revealed that SbHCI1 polyubiquitinated each of the three interacting proteins. The ectopic overexpression of SbHCI1 in Arabidopsis revealed that the protein was capable of inducing abscisic acid (ABA)-hypersensitivity and basal heat stress tolerance. Therefore, SbHCI1 possesses E3 ligase activity and may function as a positive regulator of heat stress responses through the modulation of interacting proteins.
