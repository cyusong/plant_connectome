Recent reports suggest that exposure to stress is capable of influencing the frequency and pattern of inherited changes in various parts of the genome. In this review, we will discuss the influence of viral pathogens on somatic and meiotic genome stability of Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants infected with a compatible pathogen generate a systemic recombination signal that precedes the spread of pathogens and results in changes in the somatic and meiotic recombination frequency. The progeny of infected plants exhibit changes in global and locus-specific DNA methylation patterns, genomic rearrangements at transgenic reporter loci and resistance gene-like-loci, and even tolerance to pathogen infection and abiotic stress. Here, we will discuss the contribution of environmental stresses to genome evolution and will focus on the role of heritable epigenetic changes in response to pathogen infection.
