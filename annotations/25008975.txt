Among secondary metabolites, flavonoids are particularly important for the plant life cycle and could be beneficial for human health. The study of Arabidopsis thaliana transparent testa mutants showed that seed flavonoids are important for environmental adaptation, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, dormancy and longevity. Compared with Arabidopsis and maize (Zea mays L.), far less research has been conducted on rice (Oryza sativa L.) particularly for cultivars with non-pigmented seeds. In this study, we describe the localization, nature and relative abundance of flavonoids in mature and germinated non-pigmented Nipponbare seeds using a combination of confocal microscopy, mass spectrometry and gene expression analysis. The mature seed exclusively accumulates flavones mostly in the embryo and to a lesser extent in the pericarp/testa. Due to the variety of flavone conjugation patterns, 21 different flavones were identified, including sulfated flavones never mentioned before in cereals. Schaftoside (apigenin-6-C-glucoside-8-C-arabinoside) and its two isomers represent nearly 50% of all rice seed flavones and are the only flavonoids accumulated in the pericarp/testa seed compartment. These 21 conjugated flavones showed a very stable profile during rice seed germination sensu stricto, while expression of key flavone synthesis genes strongly increases before the completion of germination. We discuss the potential roles of these rice seed flavones in a seed biology context.
