Plant small RNAs (sRNAs) are a heterogeneous group of noncoding RNAs with a length of 20-24 nucleotides that are widely studied due to their importance as major regulators in various biological processes. sRNAs are divided into two main classes-microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)-which differ in their biogenesis and functional pathways. Their identification and enrichment with new structural variants would not be possible without the use of various high-throughput sequencing (NGS) techniques, allowing for the detection of the total population of sRNAs in plants. Classifying sRNAs and predicting their functional role based on such high-performance datasets is a nontrivial bioinformatics task, as plants can generate millions of sRNAs from a variety of biosynthetic pathways. Over the years, many computing tools have been developed to meet this challenge. Here, we review more than 35 tools developed specifically for plant sRNAs over the past few years and explore some of their basic algorithms for performing tasks related to predicting, identifying, categorizing, and quantifying individual sRNAs in plant samples, as well as visualizing the results of these analyzes. We believe that this review will be practical for biologists who want to analyze their plant sRNA datasets but are overwhelmed by the number of tools available, thus answering the basic question of how to choose the right one for a particular study.
