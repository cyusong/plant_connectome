Photosynthetic organisms have evolved numerous photoprotective mechanisms and alternative electron sinks/pathways to fine-tune the photosynthetic apparatus under dynamic environmental conditions, such as varying carbon supply or fluctuations in light intensity. In cyanobacteria flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage under fluctuating light (FL). In Arabidopsis thaliana, which does not possess FDPs, the PGR5-related pathway enables FL photoprotection. The direct comparison of the pgr5, pgrl1 and flv knockout mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown under ambient air demonstrates that all three proteins contribute to the survival of cells under FL, but to varying extents. The FDPs are crucial in providing a rapid electron sink, with flv mutant lines unable to survive even mild FL conditions. In contrast, the PGRL1 and PGR5-related pathways operate over relatively slower and longer time-scales. Whilst deletion of PGR5 inhibits growth under mild FL, the pgrl1 mutant line is only impacted under severe FL conditions. This suggests distinct roles, yet a close relationship, between the function of PGR5, PGRL1 and FDP proteins in photoprotection.
