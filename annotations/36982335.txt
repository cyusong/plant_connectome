The MYB (v-MYB avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) transcription factor (TF) family has numerous members with complex and diverse functions, which play an indispensable role in regulating the response of plants to stress. In this study, a new 1R-MYB TF gene was obtained from <i>Fragaria vesca</i> (a diploid strawberry) by cloning technology and given a new name, <i>FvMYB114</i>. According to the subcellular localization results, FvMYB114 protein was a nuclear localization protein. Overexpression of <i>FvMYB114</i> greatly enhanced the adaptability and tolerance of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to salt and low temperature. Under salt and cold stress, the transgenic plants had greater proline and chlorophyll contents and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) than the wild-type (WT) and unloaded-line (UL) <i>A. thaliana</i>. However, malondialdehyde (MDA) was higher in the WT and UL lines. These results suggested that <i>FvMYB114</i> may be involved in regulating the response of <i>A. thaliana</i> to salt stress and cold stress. <i>FvMYB114</i> can also promote the expression of genes, such as the genes <i>AtSOS1/3</i>, <i>AtNHX1</i> and <i>AtLEA3</i> related to salt stress and the genes <i>AtCCA1</i>, <i>AtCOR4</i> and <i>AtCBF1/3</i> related to cold stress, further improving the tolerance of transgenic plants to salt and cold stress.
