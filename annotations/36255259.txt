When exposed to pathogen infection or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, grapevine (Vitis vinifera) plants rapidly accumulate the stilbenoid resveratrol (Res) with concomitant increase of stilbene synthase (STS), the key enzyme in stilbene biosynthesis. Although a few transcription factors have been shown to regulate STSs, the molecular mechanism governing the regulation of STSs is not well elucidated. Our previous work showed that a VvMYB14-VvWRKY8 regulatory loop fine-tunes stilbene biosynthesis in grapevine through protein-protein interaction; overexpression of VvWRKY8 down-regulates VvMYB14 and VvSTS15/21; and application of exogenous Res up-regulates WRKY8 expression. Here, we identified an R2R3-MYB repressor, VvMYB30, which competes with the activator VvMYB14 for binding to the common binding sites in the VvSTS15/21 promoter. Similar to VvMYB14, VvMYB30 physically interacts with VvWRKY8 through their N-termini, forming a complex that does not bind DNA. Exposure to UV-B/C stress induces VvMYB14, VvWRKY8, and VvSTS15/21, but represses VvMYB30 in grapevine leaves. In addition, MYB30 expression is up-regulated by VvWRKY8-overexpression or exogenous Res. These findings suggest that the VvMYB14-VvWRKY8-VvMYB30 regulatory circuit allows grapevine to respond to UV stress by producing Res and prevents over-accumulation of Res to balance metabolic costs. Our work highlights the stress-mediated induction and feedback inhibition of stilbene biosynthesis through a complex regulatory network involving multiple positive and negative transcriptional regulators.
