['26721386', 'Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1) belongs to the Rad2 family of structure-specific  nucleases. It is required for several DNA metabolic pathways, including DNA  replication and DNA damage repair. Here, we have identified a shade avoidance  mutant, sav6, which reduces the mRNA splicing efficiency of SAV6. We have  demonstrated that SAV6 is an FEN1 homologue that shows double-flap endonuclease  and gap-dependent endonuclease activity, but lacks exonuclease activity. sav6  mutants are hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by ultraviolet (UV)-C radiation  and reagents that induce double-stranded DNA breaks, but exhibit normal responses  to chemicals that block DNA replication. Signalling components that respond to  DNA damage are constitutively activated in sav6 mutants. These data indicate that  SAV6 is required for DNA damage repair and the maintenance of genome integrity.  Mutant sav6 plants also show reduced root apical meristem (RAM) size and  defective quiescent centre (QC) development. The expression of SMR7, a cell cycle  regulatory gene, and ERF115 and PSK5, regulators of QC division, is increased in  sav6 mutants. Their constitutive induction is likely due to the elevated DNA  damage responses in sav6 and may lead to defects in the development of the RAM  and QC. Therefore, SAV6 assures proper root development through maintenance of  genome integrity.', '2016 Feb 18', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkv1474', 'Tao']
