['12244266', 'Arabidopsis trichomes are branched, single-celled epidermal hairs. These  specialized cells provide a convenient model for investigating the specification  of cell fate in plants. Two key genes regulating the initiation of trichome  development are GLABROUS1 (GL1) and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA (TTG). GL1 is a  member of the myb gene family. The maize R gene, which can functionally  complement the Arabidopsis ttg mutation, encodes a basic helix-loop-helix  protein. We used constitutively expressed copies of the GL1 and R genes to test  hypotheses about the roles of GL1 and TTG in trichome development. The results  support the hypothesis that TTG and GL1 cooperate at the same point in the  trichome developmental pathway. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of both  GL1 and R in the same plant caused trichomes to develop on all shoot epidermal  surfaces. Results were also obtained indicating that TTG plays an additional role  in inhibiting neighboring cells from becoming trichomes.', '1994 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.6.8.1065', 'Marks']
