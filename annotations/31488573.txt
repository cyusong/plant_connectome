Chloroplast size varies considerably in nature, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. By exploiting a near-isogenic line population derived from a cross between the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi-1), which has larger chloroplasts, and Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>-0), with smaller chloroplasts, we determined that the large-chloroplast phenotype in Cvi-1 is associated with allelic variation in the gene encoding the chloroplast-division protein FtsZ2-2, a tubulin-related cytoskeletal component of the contractile FtsZ ring inside chloroplasts. Sequencing revealed that the Cvi-1 <i>FtsZ2-2</i> allele encodes a C-terminally truncated protein lacking a region required for FtsZ2-2 interaction with inner-envelope proteins, and functional complementation experiments in a Columbia-0 <i>ftsZ2-2</i> null mutant confirmed this allele as causal for the increased chloroplast size in Cvi-1. Comparison of <i>FtsZ2-2</i> coding sequences in the 1001 Genomes database showed that the Cvi-1 allele is rare and identified additional rare loss-of-function alleles, including a natural null allele, in three other accessions, all of which had enlarged-chloroplast phenotypes. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions was higher among the <i>FtsZ2-2</i> genes than among the two other <i>FtsZ</i> family members in Arabidopsis, <i>FtsZ2-1</i>, a close paralog of <i>FtsZ2-2</i>, and the functionally distinct <i>FtsZ1-1</i>, indicating more relaxed constraint on the <i>FtsZ2-2</i> coding sequence than on those of <i>FtsZ2-1</i> or <i>FtsZ1-1</i> Our results establish that allelic variation in <i>FtsZ2-2</i> contributes to natural variation in chloroplast size in Arabidopsis, and they also demonstrate that natural variation in Arabidopsis can be used to decipher the genetic basis of differences in fundamental cell biological traits, such as organelle size.
