The complete genome sequence of <i>Xanthomonas arboricola</i> pv. <i>corylina</i> A7 was obtained by a hybrid approach combining PacBio and Illumina HiSeq sequence data. A single circular chromosome of 5.1 mb with 65.47% G + C content was obtained, including 4,344 coding sequences identified as well as some genes involved in copper resistance. The information obtained corresponds to the first report of a high-quality whole genome of <i>X. arboricola</i> pv. <i>corylina</i>, isolated from infected hazelnut trees in southern Chile.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
