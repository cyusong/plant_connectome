The role of an endophytic Zygomycete Mucor sp. in growth promotion and adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to increased energy demands of its hosts Arabidopsis arenosa and Arabidopsis thaliana was evaluated. Inoculation with the fungus improved the water use efficiency of the plants and allowed for them to utilize incident light for photochemistry more effectively by upregulating the expression of several photosystem I- and II-related genes and their respective proteins, proteins involved in light harvesting in PSII and PSI and carbon assimilation. This effect was independent of the ability of the plants to acquire nutrients from the soil. We hypothesize that the accelerated growth of the symbiotic plants resulted from an increase in their demand for carbohydrates and carbohydrate turnover (sink strength) that triggered a simultaneous upregulation of carbon assimilation. Arabidopsis plants inoculated with Mucor sp. exhibited upregulated expression in several genes encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate catabolism, sugar transport, and smaller starch grains that indicate a significant upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism.
