RNA exosome complexes provide the main 3'-5'-exoribonuclease activities in eukaryotic cells and contribute to the maturation and degradation of virtually all types of RNA. RNA exosomes consist of a conserved core complex that associates with exoribonucleases and with multimeric cofactors that recruit the enzyme to its RNA targets. Despite an overall high level of structural and functional conservation, the enzymatic activities and compositions of exosome complexes and their cofactor modules differ among eukaryotes. This review highlights unique features of plant exosome complexes, such as the phosphorolytic activity of the core complex, and discusses the exosome cofactors that operate in plants and are dedicated to the maturation of ribosomal RNA, the elimination of spurious, misprocessed, and superfluous transcripts, or the removal of mRNAs cleaved by the RNA-induced silencing complex and other mRNAs prone to undergo silencing.
