['1518831', 'Studies of chloroplast DNA variations, and several direct experimental  observations, indicate the existence of recombination ability in algal and higher  plant plastids. However, no studies have been done of the biochemical pathways  involved. Using a part of a cyanobacterial recA gene as a probe in Southern  blots, we have found homologous sequences in total DNA from Pisum sativum and  Arabidopsis thaliana and in a cDNA library from Arabidopsis. A cDNA was cloned  and sequenced, and its predicted amino acid sequence is 60.7% identical to that  of the cyanobacterial RecA protein. This finding is consistent with our other  results showing both DNA strand transfer activity and the existence of a protein  of the predicted molecular mass crossreactive with antibodies to Escherichia coli  RecA in the stroma of pea chloroplasts.', '1992 Sep 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.89.17.8068', 'Jagendorf']
