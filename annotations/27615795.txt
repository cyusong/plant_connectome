Anionic lipids, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), are major classes of the thylakoid membrane lipids in cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts. PG is essential for growth and photosynthesis of cyanobacteria, algae and plants, but the requirement for SQDG differs even among cyanobacterial species. Although SQDG and PG can compensate each other in part presumably to maintain proper balance of anionic charge in lipid bilayers, the functional relationship of these lipids is largely unknown. In this study, we inactivated the sqdB gene, encoding a UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase and involved in SQDG biosynthesis, in Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1. In wild-type cells, PG accounted for only approximately 3.5 mol% of total membrane lipids, but its content was substantially increased along with complete loss of SQDG in the sqdB mutant. Under phosphate (Pi)-sufficient conditions, the growth rate and PSII activity were slightly lower in sqdB than in wild-type cells. In addition, the formation of PSI trimers and PSII dimers and energy transfer in phycobilisomes were perturbed in the mutant. Under Pi-deficient conditions, the growth of sqdB cells was severely impaired, with a decrease in PSII activity. PG supplementation could partially rescue the defective growth and PSII activity of Pi-deficient sqdB cells but fully recovered the impaired growth of the pgsA mutant of T. elongatus, which is deficient in PG biosynthesis. These data suggest that SQDG has a specific role in the growth and photosynthesis of T. elongatus, which cannot be complemented by PG, particularly under Pi-deficient conditions.
