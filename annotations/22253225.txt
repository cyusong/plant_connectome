['22253225', 'Vacuoles perform a multitude of functions in plant cells, including the storage  of amino acids and sugars. Tonoplast-localized transporters catalyze the import  and release of these molecules. The mechanisms determining the targeting of these  transporters to the tonoplast are largely unknown. Using the paralogous  Arabidopsis thaliana inositol transporters INT1 (tonoplast) and INT4 (plasma  membrane), we performed domain swapping and mutational analyses and identified a  C-terminal di-leucine motif responsible for the sorting of higher plant INT1-type  transporters to the tonoplast in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. We  demonstrate that this motif can reroute other proteins, such as INT4, SUCROSE  TRANSPORTER2 (SUC2), or SWEET1, to the tonoplast and that the position of the  motif relative to the transmembrane helix is critical. Rerouted INT4 is  functionally active in the tonoplast and complements the growth phenotype of an  int1 mutant. In Arabidopsis plants defective in the beta-subunit of the AP-3 adaptor  complex, INT1 is correctly localized to the tonoplast, while sorting of the  vacuolar sucrose transporter SUC4 is blocked in cis-Golgi stacks. Moreover, we  demonstrate that both INT1 and SUC4 trafficking to the tonoplast is sensitive to  brefeldin A. Our data show that plants possess at least two different  Golgi-dependent targeting mechanisms for newly synthesized transporters to the  tonoplast.', '2012 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.090415', 'Sauer']
