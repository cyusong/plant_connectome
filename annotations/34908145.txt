Direct delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins into the shoot apical meristem via particle bombardment enabled introduction of a semidwarf1-orthologous mutation into an elite wheat variety.

CRISPR/Cas9: !introduces! semidwarf1-orthologous mutation
particle bombardment: !delivers! CRISPR/Cas9
shoot apical meristem: !receives! CRISPR/Cas9
