Epothilones, macrocyclic lactones from culture filtrates of the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, are known as taxol-like microtubular drugs in human medicine. To date, nothing is known about the effect of epothilones on microtubules (MTs) in plant cells and/or on the plant cell cycle. As shown in this report, the treatment of tomato cell suspension cultures with epothilone D produced a continuous increase in the mitotic index. Dose-response curves revealed that epothilone D alters the mitotic index at concentrations as low as 1.5 microM. Mitotic arrest was already visible after only 2 h of treatment, and 55% of the cells were arrested after 24 h. As shown by immunocytological methods, abnormal spindles are formed during metaphase, which leads to a random distribution of chromosomes in the whole cell and prevents the formation of a metaphase plate. The process of chromosome decondensation does not seem to be affected, because micronuclei form at the same place with the distributed chromosomes. This suggests that epothilone D influences the stability of plant MTs mainly during metaphase of the mitotic cycle. In metaphase, the effects of epothilone D seem to be irreversible, because cells with an abnormal spindle could not be recovered after removal of the drug.
