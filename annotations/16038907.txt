['16038907', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana metal tolerance protein 1 (MTP1) of the cation diffusion  facilitator family of membrane transport proteins can mediate the detoxification  of Zn in Arabidopsis and yeast. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing AtMTP1  accumulate more Zn than oocytes expressing the AtMTP1(D94A) mutant or  water-injected oocytes. An AtMTP1-GFP fusion protein localizes to the vacuolar  membrane in root and leaf cells. The analysis of Arabidopsis transformed with a  promoter-GUS construct suggests that AtMTP1 is not produced throughout the plant,  but primarily in the subpopulation of dividing, differentiating and expanding  cells. RNA interference-mediated silencing of AtMTP1 causes Zn hypersensitivity  and a reduction in Zn concentrations in vegetative plant tissues.', '2005 Aug 1', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.06.046', 'Kramer']
