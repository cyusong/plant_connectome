['27824150', "MDN1/Rea1, as an AAA-type ATPase, is predicted to be the largest protein involved  in pre-ribosome maturation in most organisms. However, its function in plant  growth and development is poorly understood. Here, we characterized a novel  Arabidopsis mutant, dwarf &short root (dsr) 1, which shows pleiotropic  developmental phenotypes, such as slow germination, short root, dwarf shoot, and  reduced seed set under normal growth conditions. Using positional cloning, we  revealed that the AtMDN1 function is impaired by a 'glutamic acid' to 'lysine'  change at position 3838 of the amino acid sequence in dsr1. Multiple sequence  alignment analysis revealed that the mutated Glu residue, which located in the  linker domain of AtMDN1, is extremely conserved among organisms. AtMDN1 is  expressed in various tissues, particularly in the shoot apex and root tip.  Moreover, the results of transcript profile analyses showed that the dysfunction  of AtMDN1 in dsr1 impairs the expression of genes related to plant growth and  development, which is tightly associated with the pleiotropic phenotypes of dsr1.  Thus, we concluded that the Glu residue plays a vital role in maintaining AtMDN1  functions, which are essential for plant growth and development.", '2016 Nov 8', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep36446', 'Zheng']
