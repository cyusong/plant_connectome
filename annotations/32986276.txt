Organs such as hypocotyls and petioles rapidly elongate in response to shade and temperature cues, contributing to adaptive responses that improve plant fitness. Growth plasticity in these organs is achieved through a complex network of molecular signals. Besides conveying information from the environment, this signaling network also transduces internal signals, such as those associated with the circadian clock. A number of studies performed in Arabidopsis hypocotyls, and to a lesser degree in petioles, have been informative for understanding the signaling networks that regulate elongation of aerial plant organs. In particular, substantial progress has been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate responses to light, the circadian clock, and temperature. Signals derived from these three stimuli converge on the BAP module, a set of three different types of transcription factors that interdependently promote gene transcription and growth. Additional key positive regulators of growth that are also affected by environmental cues include the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins. In this review we summarize the key signaling pathways that regulate the growth of hypocotyls and petioles, focusing specifically on molecular mechanisms important for transducing signals derived from light, the circadian clock, and temperature. While it is clear that similarities abound between the signaling networks at play in these two organs, there are also important differences between the mechanisms regulating growth in hypocotyls and petioles.
