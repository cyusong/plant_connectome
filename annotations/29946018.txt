Angiosperms germinated in the dark develop etioplasts, the chloroplast precursors, in cotyledon cells. Etioplasts contain lattice membrane structures called prolamellar bodies (PLBs) and lamellar prothylakoids as internal membrane systems. PLBs accumulate the chlorophyll intermediate protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) in a complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductase (LPOR). Two galactolipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), are major constituents of etioplast membranes. We previously reported that monogalactosyldiacylglycerol facilitates the synthesis of Pchlide and the formation of the Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex in etioplasts, but the importance of DGDG in etioplasts is still unknown. To determine the role of DGDG in etioplast development and functions, we characterized a knockout mutant (<i>dgd1</i>) of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>DGD1</i>, which encodes the major isoform of DGDG synthase, in the etioplast development stage. In etiolated <i>dgd1</i> seedlings, DGDG content decreased to 20% of the wild-type level, the lattice structure of PLBs was disordered, and the development of prothylakoids was impaired. In addition, membrane-associated processes of Pchlide biosynthesis, formation of the Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex, and dissociation of the complex after the photoconversion of Pchlide to chlorophyllide were impaired in <i>dgd1</i>, although the photoconversion reaction by LPOR was not affected by the DGDG deficiency. Total carotenoid content also decreased in etiolated <i>dgd1</i> seedlings, but the carotenoid composition was unchanged. Our data demonstrate a deep involvement of DGDG in the formation of the internal membrane structures in etioplasts as well as in membrane-associated processes of pigment biosynthesis and pigment-protein complex organization.
