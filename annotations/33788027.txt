White-fleshed grape cv. 'Gamay' and its two teinturier variants presented distinct spatial-temporal accumulation of anthocyanins, with uncoupled accumulation of sugars and anthocyanins in 'Gamay Fréaux'. In most red grape cultivars, anthocyanins accumulate exclusively in the berry skin, while 'teinturier' cultivars also accumulate anthocyanins in the pulp. Here, we investigated the teinturier cvs. 'Gamay de Bouze' and 'Gamay Fréaux' (two somatic variants of the white-fleshed cv. 'Gamay') through metabolic and transcript analysis to clarify whether these two somatic variants have the same anthocyanin accumulation pattern in the skin and pulp, and whether primary metabolites are also affected. The skin of the three cultivars and the pulp of 'Gamay de Bouze' begun to accumulate anthocyanins at the onset of berry ripening. However, the pulp of 'Gamay Fréaux' exhibited a distinct anthocyanin accumulation pattern, starting as early as fruit set with very low level of sugars. The highest level of anthocyanins was found in 'Gamay Fréaux' skin, followed by 'Gamay de Bouze' and 'Gamay'. Consistently, the transcript abundance of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were in line with the anthocyanin levels in the three cultivars. Despite no evident differences in pulp sugar content, the concentration of glucose and fructose in the skin of 'Gamay Fréaux' was only half of those in the skin of 'Gamay' and 'Gamay de Bouze' throughout all berry ripening, suggesting an uncoupled accumulation of sugars and anthocyanins in 'Gamay Fréaux'. The study provides a comprehensive view of metabolic consequences in grape somatic variants and the three almost isogenic genotypes can serve as ideal reagents to further uncover the mechanisms underlying the linkage between sugar and anthocyanin accumulation.
