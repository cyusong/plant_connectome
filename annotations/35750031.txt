Plant immune receptors often contain TIR domains, which can oligomerize to form active enzyme complexes in response to pathogen infections. In this issue of Cell, Yu and colleagues discover that some plant TIR domains possess a novel 2',3'-cAMP/cGMP synthetase activity that cleaves double-stranded RNA/DNA, triggering cell death during plant immune responses.
