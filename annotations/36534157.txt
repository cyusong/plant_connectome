The loss of TaGAMYB function in Arabidopsis results in abnormal pollen development and leads to decreased fertility. This process may be regulated by microRNAs, which suppress the expression of fatty acid pathway genes. Development of the anthers and pollen is significantly influenced by the transcription factor GAMYB. However, our knowledge of GAMYB in wheat is limited. Here, under fertility and sterility conditions, we identified the distinct transcripts TaGAMYB-d and TaGAMYB-g in thermosensitive genic sterile wheat YanZhan 4110S and confirmed their functions. TaGAMYB-g overexpression decreased the pollen vigor and germination rates, thereby reducing fertility. TaGAMYB-d overexpression lines exhibited early flowering. Due to aberrant pollen germination, the mutant homologous TaGAMYB genes in Arabidopsis thaliana also resulted in lower fertility. Our findings indicate that TaGAMYB controls the fertility and flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana.
