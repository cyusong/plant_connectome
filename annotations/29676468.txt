Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> from the leaf intercellular air space to the site of carboxylation (g<sub>m</sub> ) is a potential trait for increasing net rates of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (A<sub>net</sub> ), photosynthetic efficiency, and crop productivity. Leaf anatomy plays a key role in this process; however, there are few investigations into how cell wall properties impact g<sub>m</sub> and A<sub>net</sub> . Online carbon isotope discrimination was used to determine g<sub>m</sub> and A<sub>net</sub> in Oryza sativa wild-type (WT) plants and mutants with disruptions in cell wall mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) production (CslF6 knockouts) under high- and low-light growth conditions. Cell wall thickness (T<sub>cw</sub> ), surface area of chloroplast exposed to intercellular air spaces (S<sub>c</sub> ), leaf dry mass per area (LMA), effective porosity, and other leaf anatomical traits were also analyzed. The g<sub>m</sub> of CslF6 mutants decreased by 83% relative to the WT, with c. 28% of the reduction in g<sub>m</sub> explained by S<sub>c</sub> . Although A<sub>net</sub> /LMA and A<sub>net</sub> /Chl partially explained differences in A<sub>net</sub> between genotypes, the change in cell wall properties influenced the diffusivity and availability of CO<sub>2</sub> . The data presented here indicate that the loss of MLG in CslF6 plants had an impact on g<sub>m</sub> and demonstrate the importance of cell wall effective porosity and liquid path length on g<sub>m</sub> .
