Molybdenum (Mo) is a micronutrient essential for plant growth, as several key enzymes of plant metabolic pathways contain Mo cofactor in their catalytic centres. Mo-containing oxidoreductases include nitrate reductase, sulphite oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase. These are involved in nitrate assimilation, sulphite detoxification, purine metabolism or the synthesis of abscisic acid, auxin and glucosinolates in plants. To understand the effects of Mo deficiency and a mutation in a molybdate transporter, MOT1, on nitrogen and sulphur metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana, transcript and metabolite profiling of the mutant lacking MOT1 was conducted in the presence or absence of Mo. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Mo deficiency had impacts on genes involved in metabolisms, transport, stress responses, and signal transductions. The transcript level of a nitrate reductase NR1 was highly induced under Mo deficiency in mot1-1. The metabolite profiles were analysed further by using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and ultra high performance liquid chromatography. The levels of amino acids, sugars, organic acids, and purine metabolites were altered significantly in the Mo-deficient plants. These results are the first investigation of the global effect of Mo nutrition and MOT1 on plant gene expressions and metabolism.
