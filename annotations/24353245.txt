Root growth and development are of outstanding importance for the plant's ability to acquire water and nutrients from different soil horizons. To cope with fluctuating nutrient availabilities, plants integrate systemic signals pertaining to their nutritional status into developmental pathways that regulate the spatial arrangement of roots. Changes in the plant nutritional status and external nutrient supply modulate root system architecture (RSA) over time and determine the degree of root plasticity which is based on variations in the number, extension, placement, and growth direction of individual components of the root system. Roots also sense the local availability of some nutrients, thereby leading to nutrient-specific modifications in RSA, that result from the integration of systemic and local signals into the root developmental programme at specific steps. An in silico analysis of nutrient-responsive genes involved in root development showed that the majority of these specifically responded to the deficiency of individual nutrients while a minority responded to more than one nutrient deficiency. Such an analysis provides an interesting starting point for the identification of the molecular players underlying the sensing and transduction of the nutrient signals that mediate changes in the development and architecture of root systems.
