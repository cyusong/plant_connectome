Grain size is one of the key determinants of grain yield. Although a number of genes that control grain size in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) have been identified, the overall regulatory networks behind this process remain poorly understood. Here, we report the map-based cloning and functional characterization of the quantitative trait locus <i>GL6</i>, which encodes a plant-specific plant AT-rich sequence- and zinc-binding transcription factor that regulates rice grain length and spikelet number. <i>GL6</i> positively controls grain length by promoting cell proliferation in young panicles and grains. The null <i>gl6</i> mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of <i>GL6</i> results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle. We demonstrate that GL6 participates in RNA polymerase III transcription machinery by interacting with RNA polymerase III subunit C53 and transcription factor class C1 to regulate the expression of genes involved in rice grain development. Our findings reveal a further player involved in the regulation of rice grain size that may be exploited in future rice breeding.
