['23815736', 'WRKY transcription factors (TFs) have been mainly associated with plant defense,  but recent studies have suggested additional roles in the regulation of other  physiological processes. Here, we explored the possible contribution of two  related group III WRKY TFs, WRKY70 and WRKY54, to osmotic stress tolerance. These  TFs are positive regulators of plant defense, and co-operate as negative  regulators of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and senescence. We employed single  and double mutants of wrky54 and wrky70, as well as a WRKY70 overexpressor line,  to explore the role of these TFs in osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol)  responses. Their effect on gene expression was characterized by microarrays and  verified by quantitative PCR. Stomatal phenotypes were assessed by water  retention and stomatal conductance measurements. The wrky54wrky70 double mutants  exhibited clearly enhanced tolerance to osmotic stress. However, gene expression  analysis showed reduced induction of osmotic stress-responsive genes in addition  to reduced accumulation of the osmoprotectant proline. By contrast, the enhanced  tolerance was correlated with improved water retention and enhanced stomatal  closure. These findings demonstrate that WRKY70 and WRKY54 co-operate as negative  regulators of stomatal closure and, consequently, osmotic stress tolerance in  Arabidopsis, suggesting that they have an important role, not only in plant  defense, but also in abiotic stress signaling.', '2013 Oct', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.12378', 'Palva']
