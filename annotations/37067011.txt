The nucleus is a central organelle of eukaryotic cell undergoing dynamic structural changes during cellular fundamental processes such as proliferation and differentiation. These changes rely on the integration of developmental and stress signals at the nuclear envelope (NE), orchestrating responses at the nucleo-cytoplasmic interface for efficient genomic functions such as DNA transcription, replication and repair. While in animals, correlation has been already established between NE dynamics and chromatin remodeling using last generation tools and cutting-edge technologies, this topic is just emerging in plants, especially in response to mechanical cues. This review summarizes recent data obtained in this field with more emphasis on the mechanical stress response. It also highlights similarities/differences between animal and plant cells at multiples scales, from the structural organization of the nucleocytoplasmic continuum to the functional impacts of NE dynamics.
