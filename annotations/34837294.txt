Precise measurements of dynamic changes in free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the lumen of the plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been lacking so far, despite increasing evidence for the contribution of this intracellular compartment to Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and signalling in the plant cell. In the present study, we targeted an aequorin chimera with reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity to the ER membrane and facing the ER lumen. To this aim, the cDNA for a low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> -affinity aequorin variant (AEQmut) was fused to the nucleotide sequence encoding a non-cleavable N-terminal ER signal peptide (fl2). The correct targeting of fl2-AEQmut was confirmed by immunocytochemical analyses in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) seedlings. An experimental protocol well-established in animal cells - consisting of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion during photoprotein reconstitution followed by ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling - was applied to carry out ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in planta. Rapid and transient increases of the ER luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>ER</sub> ) were recorded in response to different environmental stresses, displaying stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures. The comparative analysis of ER and chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics indicates a complex interplay of these organelles in shaping cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during signal transduction events. Our data highlight significant differences in basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>ER</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling by plant ER compared to the animal counterpart. The set-up of an ER-targeted aequorin chimera extends and complements the currently available toolkit of organelle-targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators by adding a reporter that improves our quantitative understanding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in the plant endomembrane system.
