Five winter oilseed rape cultivars (Benefit, Californium, Cortes, Ladoga, Navajo) were subjected to 30 days of cold treatment (4 °C) to examine the effect of cold on acquired frost tolerance (FT), dehydrin (DHN) content, and photosynthesis-related parameters. The main aim of this study was to determine whether there are relationships between FT (expressed as LT50 values) and the other parameters measured in the cultivars. While the cultivar Benefit accumulated two types of DHNs (D45 and D35), the other cultivars accumulated three additional DHNs (D97, D47, and D37). The similar-sized DHNs (D45 and D47) were the most abundant; the others exhibited significantly lower accumulations. The highest correlations were detected between LT50 and DHN accumulation (r=-0.815), intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi; r=-0.643), net photosynthetic rate (r=-0.628), stomatal conductance (r=0.511), and intracellular/intercellular CO2 concentration (r=0.505). Those cultivars that exhibited higher Pn rate in cold (and further a significant increase in WUEi) had higher levels of DHNs and also higher FT. No significant correlation was observed between LT50 and E, PRI, or NDVI. Overall, we have shown the selected physiological parameters to be able to distinguish different FT cultivars of winter oilseed rape.
