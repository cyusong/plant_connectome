Apple is a fleshy fruit distinguished by a climacteric type of ripening, since most of the relevant physiological changes are triggered and governed by the action of ethylene. After its production, this hormone is perceived by a series of receptors to regulate, through a signaling cascade, downstream ethylene related genes. The possibility to control the effect of ethylene opened new horizons to the improvement of the postharvest fruit quality. To this end, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene antagonist, is routinely used to modulate the ripening progression increasing storage life. In a recent work published in The Plant Journal, the whole transcriptome variation throughout fruit development and ripening, with the adjunct comparison between normal and impaired postharvest ripening, has been illustrated. In particular, besides the expected downregulation of ethylene-regulated genes, we shed light on a regulatory circuit leading to de-repressing the expression of a specific set of genes following 1-MCP treatment, such as AUX/IAA, NAC and MADS. These findings suggested the existence of a possible ethylene/auxin cross-talk in apple, regulated by a transcriptional circuit stimulated by the interference at the ethylene receptor level.
