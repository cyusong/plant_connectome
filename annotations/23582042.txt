['23582042', 'The import of proteins into the nucleus in response to drought is critical for  mediating the reprogramming of gene expression that leads to drought tolerance.  However, regulatory mechanisms involved in nuclear protein import remain largely  unknown. Here, we have identified an Arabidopsis gene (AtKPNB1) as a homolog of  human KPNB1 (importin beta1). AtKPNB1 was expressed in multiple organs, and the  protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. AtKPNB1 was able to  facilitate nuclear import of a model protein. Null mutation of AtKPNB1 delayed  development under normal growth conditions and increased sensitivity to abscisic  acid (ABA) during seed germination and cotyledon development. Inactivation of  AtKPNB1 increased stomatal closure in response to ABA, reduced the rate of water  loss, and substantially enhanced drought tolerance. AtKPNB1 interacted with  several importin alpha proteins, nucleoporin AtNUP62, and the Arabidopsis Ran  proteins. Inactivation of AtKPNB1 did not affect the ABA responsiveness or the  expression level or subcellular localization of ABI1, ABI2 or ABI5, key  regulators of the ABA signaling pathway. Moreover, phenotypic analysis of  epistasis revealed that AtKPNB1 modulates the ABA response and drought tolerance  through a pathway that is independent of ABI1 and ABI5. Collectively, our results  show that AtKPNB1 is an Arabidopsis importin beta that functions in ABA signaling.', '2013 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12207', 'Li']
