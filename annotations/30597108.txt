In multi-cellular organisms, cell-to-cell communication is crucial for adapting to changes in the surrounding environment. In plants, plasmodesmata (PD) provide a unique pathway for cell-to-cell communication. PD interconnect most cells and generate a cytoplasmic continuum, allowing the trafficking of various micro- and macromolecules between cells. This molecular trafficking through PD is dynamically regulated by altering PD permeability dependent on environmental changes, thereby leading to an appropriate response to various stresses; however, how PD permeability is dynamically regulated is still largely unknown. Moreover, studies on the regulation of PD permeability have been conducted primarily in a limited number of angiosperms. Here, we studied the regulation of PD permeability in the moss Physcomitrella patens and report that molecular trafficking through PD is rapidly and reversibly restricted by abscisic acid (ABA). Since ABA plays a key role in various stress responses in the moss, PD permeability can be controlled by ABA to adapt to surrounding environmental changes. This ABA-dependent restriction of PD trafficking correlates with a reduction in PD pore size. Furthermore, we also found that the rate of macromolecular trafficking is higher in an ABA-synthesis defective mutant, suggesting that the endogenous level of ABA is also important for PD-mediated macromolecular trafficking. Thus, our study provides compelling evidence that P. patens exploits ABA as one of the key regulators of PD function.
