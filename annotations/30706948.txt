Under future climates, leaf temperature (T<sub>l</sub> ) will be higher and more variable. This will affect plant carbon (C) balance because photosynthesis and respiration both respond to short-term (subdaily) fluctuations in T<sub>l</sub> and acclimate in the longer term (days to months). This study asks the question: To what extent can the potential and speed of photosynthetic acclimation buffer leaf C gain from rising and increasing variable T<sub>l</sub> ? We quantified how increases in the mean and variability of growth temperature affect leaf performance (mean net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates, A<sub>net</sub> ; its variability; and time under near-optimal photosynthetic conditions), as mediated by thermal acclimation. To this aim, the probability distribution of A<sub>net</sub> was obtained by combining a probabilistic description of short- and long-term changes in T<sub>l</sub> with data on A<sub>net</sub> responses to these changes, encompassing 75 genera and 111 species, including both C3 and C4 species. Our results show that (a) expected increases in T<sub>l</sub> variability will decrease mean A<sub>net</sub> and increase its variability, whereas the effects of higher mean T<sub>l</sub> depend on species and initial T<sub>l</sub> , and (b) acclimation reduces the effects of leaf warming, maintaining A<sub>net</sub> at >80% of its maximum under most thermal regimes.
