The influence of cadmium on growth parameters and photosynthetic pigment content was studied in maize leaf segments differing in tissue maturity. Experiments were carried out with maize seedlings Zea mays L. cv. Hidosil treated with 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 microM Cd for 14 days under low light conditions. Tissue age-dependent decrease of fresh mass, dry mass and area of the leaf segments was correlated with Cd concentration in the growth medium. Cd induced changes in chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, and the specific areas and densities of the leaf segments were dependent on age and metal concentration. Results are discussed with respect to the protection mechanisms in the leaf segments.
