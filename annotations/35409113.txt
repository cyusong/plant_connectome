In the course of evolution, both flowering plants and some gymnosperms have developed such an adaptation to winter and unfavorable living conditions as deciduousness. Of particular interest is Siberian larch (<i>Larix sibirica</i> Ledeb.), which is the only species in the pine family (Pinaceae) with a seasonal deciduousness. New generation sequencing technologies make it possible to study this phenomenon at the genomic level and to reveal the genetic mechanisms of leaf and needle aging in angiosperms and gymnosperms. Using a comparative analysis of the genomes of evergreen and deciduous trees, it was found that the genes that control EXORDIUM LIKE 2 (EXL2) and DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1 (DRM1) proteins are most represented in Siberian larch, while an excess of genes that control proteins acting as immune receptors were found in evergreens. Orthologs from the family of genes that control leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLK) contributed mostly to the distinction between evergreens and deciduous plants.
