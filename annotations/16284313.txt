['16284313', 'ABSCISIC ACID-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN1 (AREB1) (i.e., ABF2) is a basic  domain/leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to the abscisic acid  (ABA)-responsive element (ABRE) motif in the promoter region of ABA-inducible  genes. Here, we show that expression of the intact AREB1 gene on its own is  insufficient to lead to expression of downstream genes under normal growth  conditions. To overcome the masked transactivation activity of AREB1, we created  an activated form of AREB1 (AREB1DeltaQT). AREB1DeltaQT-overexpressing plants  showed ABA hypersensitivity and enhanced drought tolerance, and eight genes with  two or more ABRE motifs in the promoter regions in two groups were greatly  upregulated: late embryogenesis abundant class genes and ABA- and drought  stress-inducible regulatory genes. By contrast, an areb1 null mutant and a  dominant loss-of-function mutant of AREB1 (AREB1:RD) with a repression domain  exhibited ABA insensitivity. Furthermore, AREB1:RD plants displayed reduced  survival under dehydration, and three of the eight greatly upregulated genes were  downregulated, including genes for linker histone H1 and AAA ATPase, which govern  gene expression and multiple cellular activities through protein folding,  respectively. Thus, these data suggest that AREB1 regulates novel ABRE-dependent  ABA signaling that enhances drought tolerance in vegetative tissues.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.035659', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
