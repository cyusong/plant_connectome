As an apoplast signal molecule, extracellular ATP (eATP) is involved in the growth regulation of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Recently, RRFT1 was revealed to be involved in eATP- regulated seedling growth. To further verify the role of RRTF1 in seedlings' eATP response, expression of 20 eATP-responsive genes in wild type (Col-0) and RRTF1 null mutant (rrtf1-1) seedlings were investigated by using realtime quantitative PCR. After 0.5 mM ATP stimulation, the response of these genes' expression in rrtf1-1 seedlings was significantly different from that in Col-0 seedlings. Proteins which are encoded by these genes include transcription factors, plasma membrane receptors like kinases, ion influx/efflux transporters and hormone signaling components. The results indicated that RRTF1 may be involved in eATP regulated physiological responses via regulating the expression of some functional genes.
