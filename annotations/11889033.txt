['11889033', 'We previously showed that the ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) gene regulates the width of  leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, by controlling the polar elongation of leaf  cells. In the present study, we found that the abnormal arrangement of cortical  microtubules (MTs) in an leaf cells appeared to account entirely for the abnormal  shape of the cells. It suggested that the AN gene might regulate the polarity of  cell growth by controlling the arrangement of cortical MTs. We cloned the AN gene  using a map-based strategy and identified it as the first member of the CtBP  family to be found in plants. Wild-type AN cDNA reversed the narrow-leaved  phenotype and the abnormal arrangement of cortical MTs of the an-1 mutation. In  the animal kingdom, CtBPs self-associate and act as co-repressors of  transcription. The AN protein can also self-associate in the yeast two-hybrid  system. Furthermore, microarray analysis suggested that the AN gene might  regulate the expression of certain genes, e.g. the gene involved in formation of  cell walls, MERI5. A discussion of the molecular mechanisms involved in the leaf  shape regulation is presented based on our observations.', '2002 Mar 15', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/21.6.1267', 'Tsukaya']
