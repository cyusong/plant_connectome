The retromer is an endosome-localized complex involved in protein trafficking. To better understand its function and regulation in plants, we recently investigated how Arabidopsis retromer subunits assemble and are targeted to endosomal membranes and highlighted original features compared with mammals. We characterized Arabidopsis vps26 null mutant and showed that it displays severe developmental defaults similar to those observed in vps29 mutant. Here, we go further by describing new phenotypic defects associated with loss of VPS26 function, such as inhibition of lateral root initiation. Recently, we showed that VPS35 subunit plays a crucial role in the recruitment of the plant retromer to endosomes, probably through an interaction with the Rab7 homolog RABG3f. In this work, we now show that contrary to mammals, Arabidopsis Rab5 homologs do not seem to be necessary for the recruitment of the core retromer to endosomal membranes, which highlights a new specificity of the plant retromer.
