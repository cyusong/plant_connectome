Haloxylon ammodendron and <i>Haloxylon persicum</i> are important drought-tolerant plants in northwest China. The whole-genome sequencing of <i>H. ammodendron</i> and <i>H. persicum</i> grown in their natural environment is incomplete, and their transcriptional regulatory network in response to drought environment remains unclear. To reveal the transcriptional responses of <i>H. ammodendron</i> and <i>H. persicum</i> to an arid environment, we performed single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and Illumina RNA sequencing. In total, 20,246,576 and 908,053 subreads and 435,938 and 210,334 circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads were identified by SMRT sequencing of <i>H. ammodendron</i> and <i>H. persicum</i>, and 15,238 and 10,135 unigenes, respectively, were successfully obtained. In addition, 9,794 and 7,330 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 838 and 71 long non-coding RNAs were identified. In an arid environment, the growth of <i>H. ammodendron</i> was restricted; plant height decreased significantly; basal and branch diameters became thinner and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) content and peroxidase (POD) activity were increased. Under dry and wet conditions, 11,803 and 15,217 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in <i>H. ammodendron</i> and <i>H. persicum</i>, respectively. There were 319 and 415 DEGs in the signal transduction pathways related to drought stress signal perception and transmission, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal pathway, the ABA signal pathway, and the MAPK signal cascade. In addition, 217 transcription factors (TFs) and 398 TFs of <i>H. ammodendron</i> and <i>H. persicum</i> were differentially expressed, including FAR1, MYB, and AP2/ERF. Bioinformatic analysis showed that under drought stress, the expression patterns of genes related to active oxygen [reactive oxygen species (ROS)] scavenging, functional proteins, lignin biosynthesis, and glucose metabolism pathways were altered. Thisis the first full-length transcriptome report concerning the responses of <i>H. ammodendron</i> and <i>H. persicum</i> to drought stress. The results provide a foundation for further study of the adaptation to drought stress. The full-length transcriptome can be used in genetic engineering research.
