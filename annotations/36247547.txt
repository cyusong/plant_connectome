Folate is commonly synthesized in natural plants and is an essential water-soluble vitamin of great importance inhuman health. Although the key genes involved in folate biosynthesis and transformation pathways have been identified in plants, the genetic architecture of folate in sweet corn kernels remain largely unclear. In this study, an association panel of 295 inbred lines of sweet corn was constructed. Six folate derivatives were quantified in sweet corn kernels at 20 days after pollination and a total of 95 loci were identified for eight folate traits using a genome-wide association study. A peak GWAS signal revealed that natural variation in <i>ZmFCL</i>, encoding a 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase, accounted for 30.12% of phenotypic variation in 5-FTHF content. Further analysis revealed that two adjacent SNPs on the second exon resulting in an AA-to-GG in the gene and an Asn-to-Gly change in the protein could be the causative variant influencing 5-FTHF content. Meanwhile, 5-FTHF content was negatively correlated with <i>ZmFCL</i> expression levels in the population. These results extend our knowledge regarding the genetic basis of folate and provide molecular markers for the optimization of folate levels in sweet corn kernels.
