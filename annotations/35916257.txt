Yatu is a protuberance formed on the base part of 'Yali' pear fruit, near the pedicel, causing a shape like a duck head termed Yatu. It is a typical phenotypic trait to evaluate fruit appearance quality. The mechanism for Yatu formation has not been clear yet. Here, 90.8% of fruits with Yatu generated in outer base part of fruits. Primitive cells of Yatu were found at 10 days after pollination (DAP). There were higher expression levels of <i>PbGA20ox2, PbIPT7a</i>, and <i>PbIPT5a</i>, lower transcription levels of <i>PbGA2ox1, PbNCED1</i>, and <i>PbNCED3</i> in outer base part of fruits at 10 DAP, accompanied with significantly higher levels of GA<sub>3</sub>, ZR, (GA<sub>3</sub>+ ZR)/ABA, and lower ABA content compared to that in the inner base part of fruits. GA<sub>3</sub> + 6-BA promoted Yatu development by increasing GA<sub>3</sub> content at 10 and 20 DAP, and ZR content at 20 DAP. PAC suppressed Yatu morphogenesis and development by increasing ABA level at 10 DAP. These results suggest that Yatu usually generated in outer base part of fruits, relatively higher GA<sub>3</sub> and ZR contents, lower ABA content promoted Yatu morphogenesis and development.
