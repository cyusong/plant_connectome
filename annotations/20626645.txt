Different organisms use gradual seasonal changes in photoperiod to correctly time diverse developmental processes, such as transition to flowering in plants. Florigen is a systemic signal formed in leaves exposed to specific environmental cues, mainly photoperiodic, and capable of triggering flower induction in several species. Here we show that in Passiflora edulis, a perennial climbing vine, flower initiation occurs throughout the year; however, without long photoperiods, flower primordia show arrested growth and differentiation at an early stage. Our results support the existence of a positive, systemic, graft-transmissible signal, produced in mature leaves under LDs, that is required for normal flower development beyond sepal formation. Our results also suggest that Gibberellin acts to inhibit flower development. We provide evidence for genetic variation in the response to short photoperiods. A genotype capable of forming developed flowers under short photoperiods produces a positive graft transmissible signal allowing normal flower development under short days in a cultivar which normally aborts flower development under these conditions. We believe these findings contribute towards discovering the chemical nature of this interesting mobile signal involved in flower development.
