['24578577', 'Auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) was discovered nearly 40 years ago and was shown  to be essential for plant development and morphogenesis, but its mode of action  remains unclear. Here, we report that the plasma membrane-localized transmembrane  kinase (TMK) receptor-like kinases interact with ABP1 and transduce auxin signal  to activate plasma membrane-associated ROPs [Rho-like guanosine triphosphatases  (GTPase) from plants], leading to changes in the cytoskeleton and the shape of  leaf pavement cells in Arabidopsis. The interaction between ABP1 and TMK at the  cell surface is induced by auxin and requires ABP1 sensing of auxin. These  findings show that TMK proteins and ABP1 form a cell surface auxin perception  complex that activates ROP signaling pathways, regulating nontranscriptional  cytoplasmic responses and associated fundamental processes.', '2014 Feb 28', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1245125', 'Yang']
