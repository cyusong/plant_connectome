Free porphyrins and their magnesium complexes, including chlorophylls, are potent photo-sensitizers. Plants usually accumulate these compounds bound to proteins together with protective compounds like carotenoids. Besides their protective role, carotenoids can play a structural role in these complexes. To analyze the effect of impaired carotenogenesis on plastid membranes we applied to barley seedlings the bleaching herbicide 2-(4-chlorophenylthio)triethylamine (CPTA) as a specific inhibitor for the cyclization of lycopene. To avoid interference with photo-oxidation, the essential experiments were performed on seedlings grown in darkness. While the amount of total carotenoids decreased, we found accumulation of more 6-carotene than lycopene in darkness clearly showing that CPTA inhibits the lycopene beta-cyclase more effectively than the lycopene epsilon-cyclase. The CPTA treatment resulted in accumulation of non-photoactive protochlorophyllide a; the amount of photoactive protochlorophyllide and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase remained constant. Further, the level of Mg protophorphyrin and its monomethyl ester increased to an extent similar to that obtained by application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The perturbation of the ultrastructure of etioplast inner membranes, observed after CPTA-treatment, was not found after ALA-treatment; this excluded the accumulated tetrapyrroles as responsible for the perturbation. By contrast, the down-regulation of Lhcb and RbcS genes found after CPTA-treatment was compatible with the presumed role of Mg protophorphyrin as "plastid signal" for regulation of nuclear gene expression. Possible mechanisms for enhancement of tetrapyrrole accumulation by non-cyclic carotenoids are discussed.

CPTA: !inhibits! lycopene beta-cyclase 
CPTA: !increases! Mg protophorphyrin 
ALA: !increases! Mg protophorphyrin 
Mg protophorphyrin: !regulates! nuclear gene expression 
non-cyclic carotenoids: !enhance! tetrapyrrole accumulation
