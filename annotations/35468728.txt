Sucrose synthase (SUS) is a common sugar-base transfer enzyme in plants, and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) is one of the major enzymes in higher plants that regulates sucrose synthesis. However, information of the SPS and SUS gene families in Actinidia, as well as their evolutionary and functional properties, is limited. According to the SPS and SUS proteins conserved domain of Arabidopsis thaliana, we found 6 SPS genes and 6 SUS genes from A. chinensis (cultivar: 'Hongyang'), and 3 SPS genes and 6 SUS genes from A. eriantha (cultivar: 'White'). The novel CDC50 conserved domains were discovered on AcSUS2, and all members of the gene family contain similar distinctive conserved domains. The majority of SUS and SPS proteins were hydrophilic, lipid-soluble enzymes that were expected to be found in the cytoplasm. The tertiary structure of SPS and SUS protein indicated that there were many tertiary structures in SPS, and there were windmill-type and spider-type tertiary structures in SUS. The phylogenetic tree was created using the neighbor-joining method, and members of the SPS and SUS gene families are grouped into three subgroups. Genes with comparable intron counts, conserved motifs, and phosphorylation sites were clustered together first. SPS and SUS were formed through replication among their own family members. AcSPS1, AcSPS2, AcSPS4, AcSPS5, AcSUS5, AcSUS6, AeSPS3, AeSUS3 and AeSUS4 were the important genes in regulating the synthesis and accumulation of sucrose for Actinidia during the fruit growth stages.
