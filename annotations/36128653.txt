Drought limits crop development and yields. bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factors play critical roles in regulating the drought response in many plants, but their roles in this process in sweet potato are unknown. Here, we report that two bHLH proteins, IbbHLH118 and IbbHLH66, play opposite roles in the ABA-mediated drought response in sweet potato. ABA treatment repressed IbbHLH118 expression but induced IbbHLH66 expression in the drought-tolerant sweet potato line Xushu55-2. Overexpressing IbbHLH118 reduced drought tolerance, whereas overexpressing IbbHLH66 enhanced drought tolerance, in sweet potato. IbbHLH118 directly binds to the E-boxes in the promoters of ABA-insensitive 5 (IbABI5), ABA-responsive element binding factor 2 (IbABF2) and tonoplast intrinsic protein 1 (IbTIP1) to suppress their transcription. IbbHLH118 forms homodimers with itself or heterodimers with IbbHLH66. Both of the IbbHLHs interact with the ABA receptor IbPYL8. ABA accumulates under drought stress, promoting the formation of the IbPYL8-IbbHLH66-IbbHLH118 complex. This complex interferes with IbbHLH118's repression of ABA-responsive genes, thereby activating ABA responses and enhancing drought tolerance. These findings shed light on the role of the IbPYL8-IbbHLH66-IbbHLH118 complex in the ABA-dependent drought response of sweet potato and identify candidate genes for developing elite crop varieties with enhanced drought tolerance.
