['18208517', 'In the S-methylmethionine cycle of plants, homocysteine methyltransferase (HMT)  catalyzes the formation of two molecules of methionine from homocysteine and  S-methylmethionine, and methionine methyltransferase (MMT) catalyzes the  formation of methionine from S-methylmethionine using S-adenosylmethionine as a  methyl group donor. Somewhat surprisingly, two independently isolated knockdown  mutations of HMT2 (At3g63250), one of three Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding  homocysteine methyltransferase, increased free methionine abundance in seeds.  Crosses and flower stalk grafting experiments demonstrate that the maternal  genotype at the top of the flower stalk determines the seed S-methylmethionine  and methionine phenotype of hmt2 mutants. Uptake, transport and inter-conversion  of [(13)C]S-methylmethionine and [(13)C]methionine in hmt2, mmt and wild-type  plants show that S-methylmethionine is a non-essential intermediate in the  movement of methionine from vegetative tissue to the seeds. Together, these  results support a model whereby elevated S-methylmethionine in hmt2 vegetative  tissue is transported to seeds and either directly or indirectly results in the  biosynthesis of additional methionine. Manipulation of the S-methylmethionine  cycle may provide a new approach for improving the nutritional value of major  grain crops such as rice, as methionine is a limiting essential amino acid for  mammalian diets.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03419.x', 'Jander']
