['21908722', "Boron (B) is an essential plant micronutrient that is toxic at higher levels.  NIP5;1 is a boric acid channel required for B uptake and growth under B  deficiency. Accumulation of the NIP5;1 transcript is upregulated under B  deficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. To elucidate the mechanism of  regulation, the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of NIP5;1 was tested for its ability  to confer B-dependent regulation using beta-glucuronidase and green fluorescent  protein as reporters. This analysis showed that the 5' UTR was involved in NIP5;1  transcript accumulation in response to B conditions. We also found that high-B  conditions trigger NIP5;1 mRNA degradation and that the sequence from +182 to  +200 bp in the 5' UTR is required for this mRNA destabilization. In the nip5;1-1  mutant background, a NIP5;1 complementation construct without the 5' UTR produced  high levels of mRNA accumulation, increased B concentrations in tissues, and  reduced growth under high-B conditions. These data suggest that the 5' UTR  controls B-dependent NIP5;1 mRNA degradation and that NIP5;1 mRNA degradation is  important for plant acclimation to high-B conditions.", '2011 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.088351', 'Fujiwara']
