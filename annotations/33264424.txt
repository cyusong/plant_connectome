Plant fitness is a measure of the capacity of a plant to survive and reproduce in its particular environment. It is inherently dependent on plant health. Molecular timekeepers like the circadian clock enhance fitness due to their ability to coordinate biochemical and physiological processes with the environment on a daily basis. Central metabolism underlies these events and it is well established that diel metabolite adjustments are intimately and reciprocally associated with the genetically encoded clock. Thus, metabolic pathway activities are time-of-day regulated. Metabolite rhythms are driven by enzymes, a major proportion of which rely on organic coenzymes to facilitate catalysis. The B vitamin complex is the key provider of coenzymes in all organisms. Emerging evidence suggests that B vitamin levels themselves undergo daily oscillations in animals but has not been studied in any depth in plants. Moreover, it is rarely considered that daily rhythmicity in coenzyme levels may dictate enzyme activity levels and therefore metabolite levels. Here we put forward the proposal that B-vitamin-derived coenzyme rhythmicity is intertwined with metabolic and clock derived rhythmicity to achieve a tripartite homeostasis integrated into plant fitness.
