Forisomes in legumes are responsible for fast sieve-element occlusion in response to injury to the vascular system. This prevents uncontrolled leakage of phloem sap and protects against invasion of pathogens. Here we compared forisomes of four different legumes (Pisum sativum, Vicia faba, Trifolium pratense and Medicago sativa) by their location (basal, central, apical) in the sieve element and reactivity to a distant heat stimulus. In each species, the majority of forisomes was located basally. Yet, we found differences in intracellular location: forisomes are distributed more evenly in the sieve elements of Pisum. After burning, basally located forisomes of the four species reacted with dispersion, followed by a spontaneous recondensation with similar reaction times. The results suggest universal forisome behaviour in fabacean species.
