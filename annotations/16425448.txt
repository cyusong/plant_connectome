Germination of lettuce seeds was inhibited by 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA) at concentrations greater than 0.03 mmol/L. MBOA also inhibited the induction of alpha-amylase activity in the lettuce seeds at concentrations greater than 0.03 mmol/L. These two concentration-response curves for the germination and alpha-amylase indicate that the percentage of the germination was positively correlated with the activity of alpha-amylase in the seeds. Lettuce seeds germinated around 18h after incubation and inhibition of alpha-amylase by MBOA occurred within 6h after seed incubation. These results show that MBOA may inhibit the germination of lettuce seeds by inhibiting the induction of alpha-amylase activity.
