['23890153', 'BACKGROUND: Plants have evolved an array of constitutive and inducible defense  strategies to restrict pathogen ingress. However, some pathogens still manage to  invade plants and impair growth and productivity. Previous studies have revealed  several key regulators of defense responses, and efforts have been made to use  this information to develop disease resistant crop plants. These efforts are  often hampered by the complexity of defense signaling pathways. To further  elucidate the complexity of defense responses, we screened a population of T-DNA  mutants in Colombia-0 background that displayed altered defense responses to  virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). RESULTS: In this  study, we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis Purple Acid Phosphatse5 (PAP5) gene,  induced under prolonged phosphate (Pi) starvation, is required for maintaining  basal resistance to certain pathogens. The expression of PAP5 was distinctly  induced only under prolonged Pi starvation and during the early stage of Pst  DC3000 infection (6 h.p.i). T-DNA tagged mutant pap5 displayed enhanced  susceptibility to the virulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000. The pap5 mutation  greatly reduced the expression of pathogen inducible gene PR1 compared to  wild-type plants. Similarly, other defense related genes including ICS1 and  PDF1.2 were impaired in pap5 plants. Moreover, application of BTH (an analog of  SA) restored PR1 expression in pap5 plants. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our  results demonstrate the requirement of PAP5 for maintaining basal resistance  against Pst DC3000. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that PAP5 acts  upstream of SA accumulation to regulate the expression of other defense  responsive genes. We also provide the first experimental evidence indicating the  role PAP5 in plant defense responses.', '2013 Jul 29', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-13-107', 'Prithiviraj']
