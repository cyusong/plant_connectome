Salt stress reduces the ability of mesophyll tissue to respond to light. Potassium outward rectifying channels are responsible for 84 % of Na (+) induced potassium efflux from mesophyll cells. Modulation in ion transport of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) mesophyll to light under increased apoplastic salinity stress was investigated using vibrating ion-selective microelectrodes (the MIFE technique). Increased apoplastic Na(+) significantly affected mesophyll cells ability to respond to light by modulating ion transport across their membranes. Elevated apoplastic Na(+) also induced a significant K(+) efflux from mesophyll tissue. This efflux was mediated predominately by potassium outward rectifying channels (84 %) and the remainder of the efflux was through non-selective cation channels. NaCl treatment resulted in a reduction in photosystem II efficiency in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In particular, reductions in Fv'/Fm' were linked to K(+) homeostasis in the mesophyll tissue. Increased apoplastic Na(+) concentrations induced vanadate-sensitive net H(+) efflux, presumably mediated by the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. It is concluded that the observed pump's activation is essential for the maintenance of membrane potential and ion homeostasis in the cytoplasm of mesophyll under salt stress.
