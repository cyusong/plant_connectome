Flower reproductive development is a complex process involving well-coordinated control of transcriptional regulation cascades. AGAMOUS (AG) plays an instrumental role in the specification and differentiation of reproductive organs in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We recently characterized a downstream target gene of AG, <i>GIANT KILLER (GIK)</i>, which encodes for an AT-hook/plants and prokaryotes conserved (PPC) domain protein. We found that overexpression of GIK leads to severe reproductive defects and downregulation of genes involved in patterning and differentiation of reproductive floral organs. We showed that GIK is a matrix protein, and GIK-mediated gene regulation requires binding of GIK to matrix associated region (MAR) of the target genes. We further showed that GIK-mediated negative regulation of one of the target genes, <i>ETTIN (ETT)</i>, is associated with changes of chromatin histone modification at <i>ETT</i> promoter, suggesting that GIK acts as a gene expression modulator through chromatin organization.
