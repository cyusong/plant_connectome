Strigolactones (SLs) act as plant hormones that inhibit shoot branching and stimulate secondary growth of the stem, primary root growth, and root hair elongation. In the moss Physcomitrella patens, SLs regulate branching of chloronemata and colony extension. In addition, SL-deficient and SL-insensitive mutants show delayed leaf senescence. To explore the effects of SLs on leaf senescence in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we treated leaf segments of rice dwarf mutants with a synthetic SL analogue, GR24, and evaluated their chlorophyll contents, ion leakage, and expression levels of senescence-associated genes. Exogenously applied GR24 restored normal leaf senescence in SL-deficient mutants, but not in SL-insensitive mutants. Most plants highly produce endogenous SLs in response to phosphate deficiency. Thus, we evaluated effects of GR24 under phosphate deficiency. Chlorophyll levels did not differ of in the wild-type between the sufficient and deficient phosphate conditions, but increased in the SL-deficient mutants under phosphate deficiency, leading in the strong promotion of leaf senescence by GR24 treatment. These results indicate that the mutants exhibited increased responsiveness to GR24 under phosphate deficiency. In addition, GR24 accelerated leaf senescence in the intact SL-deficient mutants under phosphate deficiency as well as dark-induced leaf senescence. The effects of GR24 were stronger in d10 compared to d17. Based on these results, we suggest that SLs regulate leaf senescence in response to phosphate deficiency.
