Endoreplication, also known as endoreduplication, is a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division. Endoreplication plays important roles in both normal plant development and in stress responses. The <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that plays a central role in establishing endoreplication, and is the founding member of the <i>SIAMESE</i>-<i>RELATED</i> (<i>SMR</i>) family of plant-specific CDK inhibitor genes. However, there has been conflicting evidence regarding which specific cyclin/CDK complexes are inhibited by SIM in vivo. In this work, we use genetic evidence to show that SIM likely inhibits both CDKA;1- and CDKB1-containing CDK complexes in vivo, thus promoting endoreplication in developing Arabidopsis trichomes. We also show that SIM interacts with CYCA2;3, a binding partner of CDKB1;1, via SIM motif A, which we previously identified as a CDK-binding motif. By contrast, SIM motif C, which has been indicated as a cyclin binding motif in other contexts, appears to be relatively unimportant for interaction between SIM and CYCA2;3. Together with earlier results, our work suggests that SIM and other SMRs likely have a multivalent interaction with CYC/CDK complexes.
