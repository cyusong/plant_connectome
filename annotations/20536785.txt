Saporins are type 1 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs: EC 3.2.2.22) produced in various organs of Saponaria officinalis L. Two distinct saporin types, saporin-L and saporin-S isoforms, were respectively purified from the intra- and extra-cellular fractions of soapwort leaves. The saporin-L isoform was lowly identical, differed for toxicity, molecular mass and amino acid composition from saporin-S proteins forming a new monophyletic group. Genes encoding both L- and S-type isoforms were cloned from leaf-specific cDNA library; the encoded products included the N-terminal diversity observed by protein sequencing and showed compatible weights with those from mass spectra. These genes were intron-less belonging to small gene families. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments evidenced their differential expression during leaf development, wounding and abscisic acid treatment. These results suggest that the saporin-L and -S proteins may play diversified roles during stress responses.
