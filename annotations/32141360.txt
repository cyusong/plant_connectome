Abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure can improve drought tolerance in higher plants. However, the relationship between ABA-related ion flux and improved drought resistance in the roots of woody plants is unclear. To investigate this relationship, we employed a noninvasive micro-test technique (NMT) to detect potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) flux in <i>Catalpa fargesii</i> and <i>C. fargesii f</i>. duclouxii after treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ABA. PEG treatment slightly increased the free proline content in both <i>Catalpa</i> species. However, simultaneous treatment with ABA and PEG resulted in a large increase in free proline content. Treatment with PEG led to a significant increase in K<sup>+</sup> efflux, and both ABA and tetraethylammonium (TEA, a K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibitor) blocked this efflux under short-term (1 d) and long-term (7 d) drought conditions. Furthermore, we detected SKOR (stelar K<sup>+</sup> outward-rectifying channel) gene expression in roots, and the results showed that PEG significantly increased SKOR expression in <i>C. fargesii f</i>. duclouxii, but SKOR expression was inhibited by ABA in <i>Catalpa fargesii</i>. These findings indicate that ABA improves drought tolerance by inhibiting K<sup>+</sup> efflux in <i>Catalpa</i>, but distinct ABA response patterns exist. Drought-tolerant species have better potassium retention are dependent on ABA, and can accumulate more proline than other species. SKOR is also ABA-dependent and sensitive to ABA, and K<sup>+</sup> flux is a target of the ABA-mediated drought response.
