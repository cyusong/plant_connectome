This study aimed to investigate the effect of water stress on the accumulation of proline in the leaves of transgenic potato lines generating fructans. The results of the series of bifactorial experiments in 2002 and 2003 indicated an increase of the proline level in leaves of all potato lines examined under water deficit. In addition, an increase in proline concentration during plant development was observed. The proline content was related to leaf water potential and relative water content (RWC), which indicates that proline could be involved in osmoregulation of potato plants under the experimental conditions. Surprisingly, under water deficit, the proline level was lowest in most of the transgenic SST/FFT-lines, which generate fructan molecules with a high degree of polymerization. Therefore, a pleiotropic effect can not be excluded as the reason for the divergence in behavior of these transgenic lines. The present results suggest that the modification of carbohydrate metabolism, especially the high content of soluble carbohydrates, may affect water stress-induced proline accumulation.
