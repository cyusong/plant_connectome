Plant growth and development are governed by an intricate web of signaling networks controlled by phytohormones, such as auxin and jasmonic acid. Auxin influences all aspects of plant growth and development, ranging from embryogenesis to root and shoot morphogenesis and organ patterning. Three major groups of auxin-responsive genes have been classified as IAA/AUX, GH3 and SAUR families. Some Group I and II GH3 proteins biochemically function in conjugating amino acids to methyl jasmonate and auxin, respectively. We recently demonstrated that GH3.9, a previously uncharacterized Group II GH3 gene family member, influences primary root growth. Whereas several GH3 family members are transcriptionally induced by auxin, GH3.9 was repressed by exogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in whole seedlings. GH3.9 promoter::GUS reporter transgenic seedlings showed expression in several tissues, and application of exogenous IAA led to a shift in promoter activity from primary roots to lateral root tips, supporting the hypothesis that GH3.9 maintains auxin homeostasis by redistribution of active auxin pools in roots. GH3.9 mutations influenced both IAA- and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-mediated root growth inhibition. In this addendum, we expand on a possible role for GH3.9 in crosstalk between auxin and jasmonate signal transduction pathways controlling plant development.
