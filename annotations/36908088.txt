Acclimation of root growth is vital for plants to survive salt stress. Halophytes are great examples of plants that thrive even under severe salinity, but their salt tolerance mechanisms, especially those mediated by root responses, are still largely unknown. We compared root growth responses of the halophyte Schrenkiella parvula with its glycophytic relative species Arabidopsis thaliana under salt stress and performed transcriptomic analysis of S. parvula roots to identify possible gene regulatory networks underlying their physiological responses. Schrenkiella parvula roots do not avoid salt and experience less growth inhibition under salt stress. Salt-induced abscisic acid levels were higher in S. parvula roots compared with Arabidopsis. Root transcriptomic analysis of S. parvula revealed the induction of sugar transporters and genes regulating cell expansion and suberization under salt stress. <sup>14</sup> C-labeled carbon partitioning analyses showed that S. parvula continued allocating carbon to roots from shoots under salt stress while carbon barely allocated to Arabidopsis roots. Further physiological investigation revealed that S. parvula roots maintained root cell expansion and enhanced suberization under severe salt stress. In summary, roots of S. parvula deploy multiple physiological and developmental adjustments under salt stress to maintain growth, providing new avenues to improve salt tolerance of plants using root-specific strategies.
