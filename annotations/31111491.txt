BIR1 is a receptor-like kinase that functions as a negative regulator of basal immunity and cell death in Arabidopsis. Using Arabidopsis thaliana and Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), we investigate the antiviral role of BIR1, the molecular mechanisms of BIR1 gene expression regulation during viral infections, and the effects of BIR1 overexpression on plant immunity and development. We found that SA acts as a signal molecule for BIR1 activation during infection. Inactivating mutations of BIR1 in the bir1-1 mutant cause strong antiviral resistance independently of constitutive cell death or SA defense priming. BIR1 overexpression leads to severe developmental defects, cell death and premature death, which correlate with the constitutive activation of plant immune responses. Our findings suggest that BIR1 acts as a negative regulator of antiviral defense in plants, and indicate that RNA silencing contributes, alone or in conjunction with other regulatory mechanisms, to define a threshold expression for proper BIR1 function beyond which an autoimmune response may occur. This work provides novel mechanistic insights into the regulation of BIR1 homeostasis that may be common for other plant immune components.
