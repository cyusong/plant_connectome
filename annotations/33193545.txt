Some Asiatic hybrid lily cultivars develop bicolor tepals, which consist of anthocyanin-pigmented upper halves and un-pigmented lower halves. <i>MYB12</i>, a subgroup 6 member of R2R3-MYB that positively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis, is downregulated in the lower halves. However, <i>MYB12</i> is usually expressed over entire tepal regions in numerous lily cultivars. Why <i>MYB12</i> of bicolor cultivars exhibits variable expression spatially in a single tepal remains unclear. Since the lily <i>MYB12</i> mRNA harbored a binding site for microRNA828 (miR828), the involvement of miR828 in variable spatial accumulation of <i>MYB12</i> transcripts was evaluated. We analyzed the cleavage of <i>MYB12</i> mRNA, mature miR828 accumulation, and <i>MYB12</i> transcript-derived siRNA generation (microRNA-seq). In the bicolor tepals, mature miR828 was more highly accumulated in the lower halves than in the upper halves, and miR828-directed cleavage of <i>MYB12</i> transcripts was observed predominantly in the lower halves. Moreover, the cleavage triggered the production of secondary siRNA from <i>MYB12</i> transcripts, and the siRNAs were accumulated predominantly in the lower halves. Consequently, miR828 suppressed <i>MYB12</i> transcript accumulation in the white region, and the miR828/MYB12 module participated in the development of bicolor patterns in lily flowers. The results present the first example of a microRNA mediating flower color patterns. Finally, we discuss the potential of miR828 creating flower color variations through suppressing the activity of subgroup 6 R2R3-MYB positive regulators in other species.
