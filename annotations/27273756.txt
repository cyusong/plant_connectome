['27273756', 'Glycosylation of monolignols has been found to be widespread in land plants since  the 1970s. However, whether monolignol glycosylation is crucial for cell wall  lignification and how it exerts effects are still unknown. Here, we report the  identification of a mutant ugt72b1 showing aggravated and ectopic lignification  in floral stems along with arrested growth and anthocyanin accumulation.  Histochemical assays and thioacidolysis analysis confirmed the enhanced  lignification and increased lignin biosynthesis in the ugt72b1 mutant. The loss  of UDP-glycosyltransferase UGT72B1 function was responsible for the lignification  phenotype, as demonstrated by complementation experiments. Enzyme activity  analysis indicated that UGT72B1 could catalyze the glucose conjugation of  monolignols, especially coniferyl alcohol and coniferyl aldehyde, which was  confirmed by analyzing monolignol glucosides of UGT72B1 transgenic plants.  Furthermore, the UGT72B1 gene was strongly expressed in young stem tissues,  especially xylem tissues. However, UGT72B1 paralogs, such as UGT72B2 and UGT72B3,  had weak enzyme activity toward monolignols and weak expression in stem tissues.  Transcriptomic profiling showed that UGT72B1 knockout resulted in extensively  increased transcript levels of genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis, lignin  polymerization and cell wall-related transcription factors, which was confirmed  by quantitative real-time PCR assays. These results provided evidence that  monolignol glucosylation catalyzed by UGT72B1 was essential for normal cell wall  lignification, thus offering insight into the molecular mechanism of cell wall  development and cell wall lignification.', '2016 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13229', 'Hou']
