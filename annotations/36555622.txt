The papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) is a subfamily of cysteine proteases that plays an important role in leaf senescence, and some of its members are involved in the regulation of plant growth and development under stress. In this study, we cloned a new gene, <i>ZmSAG39</i>, from maize. Expression profile analysis showed that <i>ZmSAG39</i> was induced by darkness and drought treatments. In addition, the <i>ZmSAG39</i> overexpression in maize accelerated the senescence of maize leaves under darkness and drought treatments. However, the knockout of <i>ZmSAG39</i> in maize enhanced the resistance of maize to darkness and drought stresses and reduced the degree of senescence of maize leaves. Under drought stress, compared with WT plants, the knockout lines had a higher seed germination rate, seedling survival rate and chlorophyll content, and lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that <i>ZmSAG39</i> negatively regulated some stress-related genes but positively regulated senescence-related genes under darkness and drought stress conditions. To summarize, these results indicate that <i>ZmSAG39</i> is a senescence-related gene and plays a negative role in response to darkness and drought stresses. This study laid a theoretical foundation for the innovation of maize germplasm resources with high quality, high yield and strong stress resistance.
