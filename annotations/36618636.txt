<i>Syringa oblata</i> is a high ornamental value tree owing to its elegant colors, unique aromas and wide adaptability, however, studies on the molecular mechanism underlying the formation of its ornamental traits are still lacking. Here, we presented a chromosome-scale genome assembly of <i>S. oblata</i> and the final genome size was 1.11 Gb with a contig N50 of 4.75 Mb, anchored on 23 chromosomes and was a better reference for <i>S. oblata</i> transcriptome assembly. Further by integrating transcriptomic and metabolic data, it was concluded that <i>F3H, F3'H, 4CL</i> and <i>PAL</i>, especially the <i>F3'H</i>, were important candidates involved in the formation of floral color differences among <i>S. oblata</i> individuals. Genome-wide identification and analysis revealed that the TPS-b subfamily was the most abundant subfamily of TPS family in <i>S. oblata</i>, which together with the CYP76 family genes determined the formation of the major floral volatiles of <i>S. oblata</i>. Overall, our results provide an important reference for mechanistic studies on the main ornamental traits and molecular breeding in <i>S. oblata</i>.
