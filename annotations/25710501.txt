['25710501', 'The domestication of starch crops underpinned the development of human  civilisation, yet we still do not fully understand how plants make starch. Starch  is composed of glucose polymers that are branched (amylopectin) or linear  (amylose). The amount of amylose strongly influences the physico-chemical  behaviour of starchy foods during cooking and of starch mixtures in non-food  manufacturing processes. The GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASE (GBSS) is the  glucosyltransferase specifically responsible for elongating amylose polymers and  was the only protein known to be required for its biosynthesis. Here, we  demonstrate that PROTEIN TARGETING TO STARCH (PTST) is also specifically required  for amylose synthesis in Arabidopsis. PTST is a plastidial protein possessing an  N-terminal coiled coil domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate binding module (CBM).  We discovered that Arabidopsis ptst mutants synthesise amylose-free starch and  are phenotypically similar to mutants lacking GBSS. Analysis of granule-bound  proteins showed a dramatic reduction of GBSS protein in ptst mutant starch  granules. Pull-down assays with recombinant proteins in vitro, as well as  immunoprecipitation assays in planta, revealed that GBSS physically interacts  with PTST via a coiled coil. Furthermore, we show that the CBM domain of PTST,  which mediates its interaction with starch granules, is also required for correct  GBSS localisation. Fluorescently tagged Arabidopsis GBSS, expressed either in  tobacco or Arabidopsis leaves, required the presence of Arabidopsis PTST to  localise to starch granules. Mutation of the CBM of PTST caused GBSS to remain in  the plastid stroma. PTST fulfils a previously unknown function in targeting GBSS  to starch. This sheds new light on the importance of targeting biosynthetic  enzymes to sub-cellular sites where their action is required. Importantly, PTST  represents a promising new gene target for the biotechnological modification of  starch composition, as it is exclusively involved in amylose synthesis.', '2015 Feb', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.1002080', 'Zeeman']
