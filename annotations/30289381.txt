Waterlogging stress has two phases like waterlogging phase and post-waterlogging phase where both are injurious to plants. Susceptible plants normally die at post-waterlogging phase due to damaged root system, sudden rexoygenation, dehydration and photoinhibition of the desubmerged tissues. Formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the main result of reoxygenation stress that can cause oxidative damage of the functional tissues responsible for normal physiological activities. There are almost all types of hormones responsible to recover plants from these destructive phenomenons. Among these hormones ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) are the main regulators to overcome the reoxygenation and drought like stresses in plants at post-waterlogging condition. The balanced crosstalk among the hormones is highly important for the survival of plants at these stresses. So this paper is completely a precise summary of hormonal homeostasis of post-waterlogged plants through physiological, biochemical and signaling pathways.
