Light regulation of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis occurs in several species, but the signaling pathway through which this occurs has not been clearly established. We have isolated a new pea (Pisum sativum) mutant, long1, with a light-dependent elongated phenotype that is particularly pronounced in the epicotyl and first internode. The long1 mutation impairs signaling from phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors and interacts genetically with a mutation in LIP1, the pea ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana COP1. Mutant long1 seedlings show a dramatic impairment in the light regulation of active GA levels and the expression of several GA biosynthetic genes, most notably the GA catabolism gene GA2ox2. The long1 mutant carries a nonsense mutation in a gene orthologous to the ASTRAY gene from Lotus japonicus, a divergent ortholog of the Arabidopsis bZIP transcription factor gene HY5. Our results show that LONG1 has a central role in mediating the effects of light on GA biosynthesis in pea and demonstrate the importance of this regulation for appropriate photomorphogenic development. By contrast, LONG1 has no effect on GA responsiveness, implying that interactions between LONG1 and GA signaling are not a significant component of the molecular framework for light-GA interactions in pea.
