['11074273', 'Formate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.2.1.2) is a mitochondrial-localized NAD-requiring  enzyme in green plants. The enzyme activity and corresponding mRNA in leaves of  Arabidopsis thaliana are induced by treatment with one-carbon metabolites. The  cDNA for the Arabidopsis formate dehydrogenase is similar to that of other plants  except for the N-terminal region, which is predicted to target chloroplasts as  well as mitochondria. The specific of activity of the enzyme in isolated  chloroplasts suggests it is targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts in  Arabidopsis. Formate dehydrogenase from Arabidopsis was partially purified and  K(m) values for formate and NAD(+) were determined to be 10 mM and 65 microM,  respectively; the K(i) for NADH was 17 microM. We conclude that formate dehydrogenase  is normally present in Arabidopsis chloroplasts and that sensitivity to  inhibition by NADH may play a role in whether cellular formate is assimilated or  dissimilated.', '2000 Nov 6', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/s0168-9452(00)00337-x', 'Markwell']
