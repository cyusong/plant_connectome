Rice panicle architecture determines the grain number per panicle and therefore impacts grain yield. The OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway shapes panicle architecture by regulating cytokinin metabolism. However, the specific upstream ligands perceived by the OsER1 receptor are unknown. Here, we report that the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF)/EPF-LIKE (EPFL) small secreted peptide family members OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 synergistically contribute to rice panicle morphogenesis by recognizing the OsER1 receptor and activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Notably, OsEPFL6, OsEPFL7, OsEPFL8, and OsEPFL9 negatively regulate spikelet number per panicle, but OsEPFL8 also controls rice spikelet fertility. A osepfl6 osepfl7 osepfl9 triple mutant had significantly enhanced grain yield without affecting spikelet fertility, suggesting that specifically suppressing the OsEPFL6-OsER1, OsEPFL7-OsER1, and OsEPFL9-OsER1 ligand-receptor pairs can optimize rice panicle architecture. These findings provide a framework for fundamental understanding of the role of ligand-receptor signaling in rice panicle development and demonstrate a potential method to overcome the trade-off between spikelet number and fertility.
