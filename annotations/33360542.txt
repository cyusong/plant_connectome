['33360542', 'Plants experience abiotic stresses throughout their life cycle and accordingly  respond to tide over the unfavorable conditions. Plants adopt to drought stress  through various molecular, biochemical, physiological and cellular processes.  F-box protein subunit of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases plays  crucial role in imparting specificity for selective degradation of target  proteins. Here we report the function of Arabidopsis F-box protein At1g08710 in  drought stress adaptation. F-box protein is a constituent of SCF complex as it is  shown interacting with ASK1 and Cullin 1. F-box protein localizes in both nucleus  and membrane. F-box gene transcript is highly accumulated in root and altered in  response to drought stress conditions. F-box protein interacts with a  transcriptional co-activator protein ADA2b. F-box mutant plants growth is better  under drought stress conditions compared to the wild type. Accumulation of  H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content is reduced in mutant plants. Drought  responsive genes RD29A, RD22, ABI3 expression is induced in F-box mutant plants.  These results indicate F-box protein At1g08710 role in drought stress adaptation  in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2021 Jan 15', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.054', 'Virupapuram']
