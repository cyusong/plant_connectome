['33466520', 'Plants encounter a variety of mechanical stimuli during their growth and  development. It is currently believed that mechanosensitive ion channels play an  essential role in the initial perception of mechanical force in plants. Over the  past decade, the study of Piezo, a mechanosensitive ion channel in animals, has  made significant progress. It has been proved that the perception of mechanical  force in various physiological processes of animals is indispensable. However,  little is still known about the function of its homologs in plants. In this  study, by investigating the function of the AtPiezo gene in the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana, we found that AtPiezo plays a role in the perception of  mechanical force in plant root cap and the flow of Ca(2+) is involved in this  process. These findings allow us to understand the function of AtPiezo from the  perspective of plants and provide new insights into the mechanism of plant root  cap in response to mechanical stimuli.', '2021 Jan 5', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms22010467', 'ORCID:']
