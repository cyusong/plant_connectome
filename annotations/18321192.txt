Elsinochrome pigments produced by many phytopathogenic Elsinoë spp. are nonhost-selective toxins which react with oxygen molecules after light activation to produce highly toxic reactive oxygen species. The structures and chemical properties of four derivatives are well known. However, the biological roles of elsinochromes in fungal pathogenesis are poorly understood. Many isolates of Elsinoë fawcettii causing citrus scab are able to produce elsinochromes under axenic conditions. In this article, we report the cloning, expression, and functional characterization of the polyketide synthase-encoding gene, EfPKS1, which we show is required for the production of elsinochromes and fungal pathogenesis. Targeted disruption of EfPKS1 in E.fawcettii completely abrogated elsinochrome production, drastically reduced conidiation, and significantly decreased lesion formation on rough lemon leaves. All mutant phenotypes were restored to the wild type in fungal strains expressing a functional copy of EfPKS1. Accumulation of the EfPKS1 transcript and elsinochromes by a wild-type strain appears to be coordinately regulated by light, nutrients, and pH. The results indicate that the product of EfPKS1 is involved in the biosynthesis of elsinochromes via a fungal polyketide pathway, and that elsinochromes play an important role in fungal pathogenesis.
