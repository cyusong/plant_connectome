['8612270', 'The cpd mutation localized by T-DNA tagging on Arabidopsis chromosome 5-14.3  inhibits cell elongation controlled by the ecdysone-like brassinosteroid hormone  brassinolide. The cpd mutant displays de-etiolation and derepression of  light-induced genes in the dark, as well as dwarfism, male sterility, and  activation of stress-regulated genes in the light. The CPD gene encodes a  cytochrome P450 (CYP90) sharing homologous domains with steroid hydroxylases. The  phenotype of the cpd mutant is restored to wild type both by feeding with  C23-hydroxylated brassinolide precursors and by ectopic overexpression of the CPD  cDNA. Brassinosteroids also compensate for different cell elongation defects of  Arabidopsis det, cop, fus, and axr2 mutants, indicating that these steroids play  an essential role in the regulation of plant development.', '1996 Apr 19', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81094-6', 'Koncz']
