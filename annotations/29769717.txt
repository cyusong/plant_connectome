['29769717', 'Chromatin remodelling factors (CHRs) typically function to alter chromatin  structure. CHRs also reside in ribonucleoprotein complexes, but little is known  about their RNA-related functions. Here we show that CHR2 (also known as BRM),  the ATPase subunit of the large switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex,  is a partner of the Microprocessor component Serrate (SE). CHR2 promotes the  transcription of primary microRNA precursors (pri-miRNAs) while repressing miRNA  accumulation in vivo. Direct interaction with SE is required for  post-transcriptional inhibition of miRNA accumulation by CHR2 but not for its  transcriptional activity. CHR2 can directly bind to and unwind pri-miRNAs and  inhibit their processing, and this inhibition requires the remodelling and  helicase activity of CHR2 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the secondary  structures of pri-miRNAs differed between wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and chr2  mutants. We conclude that CHR2 accesses pri-miRNAs through SE and remodels their  secondary structures, preventing downstream processing by DCL1 and HYL1. Our  study uncovers pri-miRNAs as a substrate of CHR2, and an additional regulatory  layer upstream of Microprocessor activity to control miRNA accumulation.', '2018 May', 'Nature', '10.1038/s41586-018-0135-x', 'Zhang']
