In the context of global change, the frequency of precipitation pulses is expected to decrease while nitrogen (N) addition is expected to increase, which will have a crucial effect on soil C cycling processes as well as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) fluxes. The interactive effects of precipitation pulses and N addition on ecosystem CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes, however, remain largely unknown in grassland. In this study, a series of precipitation pulses (0, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm) and long-term N addition (0 and 10 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, 10 years) was simulated to investigate their effects on CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes in a semi-arid grassland. The results showed that large precipitation pulses (10 mm, 20 mm, and 50 mm) had a negative pulsing effect on CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes and relatively decreased the peak CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes by 203-362% compared with 0 mm precipitation pulse. The large precipitation pulses significantly inhibited CH<sub>4</sub> absorption and decreased the cumulative CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes by 68-88%, but small precipitation pulses (5 mm) did not significantly alter it. For the first time, we found that precipitation pulse size increased cumulative CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes quadratically in both control and N addition treatments. The increased soil moisture caused by precipitation pulses inhibited CH<sub>4</sub> absorption by suppressing CH<sub>4</sub> uptake and promoting CH<sub>4</sub> release. Nitrogen addition significantly decreased the absorption of CH<sub>4</sub> by increasing NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>-N content and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-N content and increased the production of CH<sub>4</sub> by increasing aboveground biomass, ultimately suppressing CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. Surprisingly, precipitation pulses and N addition did not interact to affect CH<sub>4</sub> uptake because precipitation pulses and N addition had an offset effect on pH and affected CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes through different pathways. In summary, precipitation pulses and N addition were able to suppress the absorption of CH<sub>4</sub> from the atmosphere by soil, reducing the CH<sub>4</sub> sink capacity of grassland ecosystems.
