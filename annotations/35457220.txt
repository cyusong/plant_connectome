In nature, plants develop in complex, adaptive environments. Plants must therefore respond efficiently to environmental stressors to maintain homeostasis and enhance their fitness. Although many coordinated processes remain integral for achieving homeostasis and driving plant development, reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as critical, fast-acting orchestrators that link abiotic and biotic responses to plant homeostasis and development. In addition to the suite of enzymatic and non-enzymatic ROS processing pathways that plants possess, they also rely on their microbiota to buffer and maintain the oxidative window needed to balance anabolic and catabolic processes. Strong evidence has been communicated recently that links ROS regulation to the aggregated function(s) of commensal microbiota and plant-growth-promoting microbes. To date, many reports have put forth insightful syntheses that either detail ROS regulation across plant development (independent of plant microbiota) or examine abiotic-biotic feedbacks in plant microbiomes (independent of clear emphases on ROS regulation). Here we provide a novel synthesis that incorporates recent findings regarding ROS and plant development in the context of both microbiota regulation and plant-associated microbes. Specifically, we discuss various roles of ROS across plant development to strengthen the links between plant microbiome functioning and ROS regulation for both basic and applied research aims.
