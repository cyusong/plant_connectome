['29431629', 'Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major components of the outer membrane of  gram-negative bacteria and are an important microbe-associated molecular pattern  (MAMP) that triggers immune responses in plants and animals. A previous genetic  screen in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) identified  LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION (LORE), a B-type lectin S-domain  receptor kinase, as a sensor of LPS. However, the LPS-activated LORE signaling  pathway and associated immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we  found that LPS trigger biphasic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in  Arabidopsis. The first transient ROS burst was similar to that induced by another  MAMP, flagellin, whereas the second long-lasting burst was induced only by LPS.  The LPS-triggered second ROS burst was found to be conserved in a variety of  plant species. Microscopic observation of the generation of ROS revealed that the  LPS-triggered second ROS burst was largely associated with chloroplasts, and  functional chloroplasts were indispensable for this response. The lipid A moiety,  the most conserved portion of LPS, appears to be responsible for the second ROS  burst. Surprisingly, the LPS- and lipid A-triggered second ROS burst was only  partially dependent on LORE. Together, our findings provide insight on the  LPS-triggered ROS production and the associated signaling pathway.', '2018 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.01637', 'ORCID:']
