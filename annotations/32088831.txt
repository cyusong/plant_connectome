The auxin signaling and root morphogenesis are harmoniously controlled by two counteracted teams including (1) auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA)-histone deacetylase (HDA) and (2) auxin response factor (ARF)-histone acetyltransferase (HAT). The involvement of histone acetylation in the regulation of transcription was firstly reported a few decades ago. In planta, auxin is the first hormone group that was discovered and it is also the most studied phytohormone. Current studies have elucidated the functions of histone acetylation in the modulation of auxin signaling as well as in the regulation of root morphogenesis under both normal and stress conditions. Based on the recent outcomes, this review is to provide a hierarchical view about the functions of histone acetylation in auxin signaling and root morphogenesis. In this report, we suggest that the auxin signaling must be controlled harmoniously by two counteracted teams including (1) auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA)-histone deacetylase (HDA) and (2) auxin response factor (ARF)-histone acetyltransferase (HAT). Moreover, the balance in auxin signaling is very critical to contribute to normal root morphogenesis.
