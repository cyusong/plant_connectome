Under the current atmospheric conditions, oxygenic photosynthesis requires photorespiration to operate. In the presence of low CO2/O2 ratios, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) performs an oxygenase side reaction, leading to the formation of high amounts of 2-phosphoglycolate during illumination. Given that 2-phosphoglycolate is a potent inhibitor of photosynthetic carbon fixation, it must be immediately removed through photorespiration. The core photorespiratory cycle is orchestrated across three interacting subcellular compartments, namely chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria, and thus cross-talks with a multitude of other cellular processes. Over the past years, the metabolic interaction of photorespiration and photosynthetic CO2 fixation has attracted major interest because research has demonstrated the enhancement of C3 photosynthesis and growth through the genetic manipulation of photorespiration. However, to optimize future engineering approaches, it is also essential to improve our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of photorespiration. Here, we summarize recent progress regarding the steps that control carbon flux in photorespiration, eventually involving regulatory proteins and metabolites. In this regard, both genetic engineering and the identification of various layers of regulation point to glycine decarboxylase as the key enzyme to regulate and adjust the photorespiratory carbon flow. Potential implications of the regulation of photorespiration for acclimation to environmental changes along with open questions are also discussed.
