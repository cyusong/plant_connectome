The flower of rice diverged from those of model eudicot species such as Arabidopsis, Antirrhinum, or Petunia, and is thus of great interest in developmental and evolutionary biology. Specific to grass species, including rice, are the structural units of the inflorescence called the spikelet and floret, which comprise grass-specific peripheral organs and conserved sexual organs. Recent advances in molecular genetic studies have provided an understanding of the functions of rapidly increasing numbers of genes involved in rice flower development. The genetic framework of rice flower development is in part similar to that of model eudicots. However, rice also probably recruits specific genetic mechanisms, which probably contribute to the establishment of the specific floral architecture of rice. In this review, the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice flowering are outlined, focusing on recent information and in comparison with those of model eudicots.
