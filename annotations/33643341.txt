S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 1 (GSNOR1) is the key enzyme that regulates cellular homeostasis of <i>S-</i>nitrosylation. Although extensively studied in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the roles of GSNOR1 in tetraploid <i>Nicotiana</i> species have not been investigated previously. To study the function of <i>Nt</i>GSNOR1, we knocked out two <i>NtGSNOR1</i> genes simultaneously in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/caspase 9 (Cas9) technology. To our surprise, spontaneous cell death occurred on the leaves of the CRISPR/Cas9 lines but not on those of the wild-type (WT) plants, suggesting that <i>Nt</i>GSNOR1 negatively regulates cell death. The natural cell death on the CRISPR/Cas9 lines could be a result from interactions between overaccumulated nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). This spontaneous cell death phenotype was not affected by knocking out two <i>Enhanced disease susceptibility 1</i> genes <i>(NtEDS11a/1b)</i> and thus was independent of the salicylic acid (SA) pathway. Unexpectedly, we found that the <i>NtGSNOR1a/1b</i> knockout plants displayed a significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001) enhanced resistance to paraquat-induced cell death compared to WT plants, suggesting that <i>Nt</i>GSNOR1 functions as a positive regulator of the paraquat-induced cell death. The increased resistance to the paraquat-induced cell death of the <i>NtGSNOR1a/1b</i> knockout plants was correlated with the reduced level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation. Interestingly, whereas the <i>N</i> gene-mediated resistance to <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) was significantly enhanced (<i>p</i> < 0.001), the resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 was significantly reduced (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in the <i>NtGSNOR1a/1b</i> knockout lines. In summary, our results indicate that <i>Nt</i>GSNOR1 functions as both positive and negative regulator of cell death under different conditions and displays distinct effects on resistance against viral and bacterial pathogens.
