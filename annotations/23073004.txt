LEC1 acts as a key regulator of embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, but is involved in a wide range of functions, all the way from embryo morphogenesis to seed maturation. New data show that LEC1, partially in conjunction with abscisic acid, affects auxin synthesis, and both brassinosteroid and light signaling. The phenotype of LEC1 overexpressors confirms LEC1's known participation in the regulation of somatic embryogenesis, but also indicates additional roles in embryonic and extra-embryonic cell elongation. Here we present an integrated model of LEC1 function and suggest potential directions to be taken in future research in this important area of plant science.
