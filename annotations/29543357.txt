Sucrose has long been thought to play an osmolytic role in stomatal opening. However, recent evidence supports the idea that the role of sucrose in this process is primarily energetic. Here we used a combination of stomatal aperture assays and kinetic [U-<sup>13</sup> C]-sucrose isotope labelling experiments to confirm that sucrose is degraded during light-induced stomatal opening and to define the fate of the C released from sucrose breakdown. We additionally show that addition of sucrose to the medium did not enhance light-induced stomatal opening. The isotope experiment showed a consistent <sup>13</sup> C enrichment in fructose and glucose, indicating that during light-induced stomatal opening sucrose is indeed degraded. We also observed a clear <sup>13</sup> C enrichment in glutamate and glutamine (Gln), suggesting a concerted activation of sucrose degradation, glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This is in contrast to the situation for Gln biosynthesis in leaves under light, which has been demonstrated to rely on previously stored C. Our results thus collectively allow us to redraw current models concerning the influence of sucrose during light-induced stomatal opening, in which, instead of being accumulated, sucrose is degraded providing C skeletons for Gln biosynthesis.
