['36771626', 'Plants have mechanisms to relocate chloroplasts based on light intensities in  order to maximize photosynthesis and reduce photodamage. Under low light,  chloroplasts move to the periclinal walls to increase photosynthesis  (accumulation) and move to the anticlinal walls under high light to avoid  photodamage, and even cell death (avoidance). Arabidopsis blue light receptors  phot1 and phot2 (phototropins) have been reported to regulate chloroplast  movement. This study discovered that another blue light receptor, FLAVIN-BINDING  KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1), regulates chloroplast photorelocation by physically  interacting with chloroplast unusual positioning protein 1 (CHUP1), a critical  component of the chloroplast motility system. Leaf cross-sectioning and red-light  transmittance results showed that overexpression of FKF1 compromised the  avoidance response, while the absence of FKF1 enhanced chloroplast movements  under high light. Western blot analysis showed that CHUP1 protein abundance is  altered in FKF1 mutants and overexpression lines, indicating a potential  regulation of CHUP1 by FKF1. qPCR results showed that two photorelocation pathway  genes, JAC1 and THRUMIN1, were upregulated in FKF1-OE lines, and overexpression  of FKF1 in the THRUMIN1 mutant weakened its accumulation and avoidance responses,  indicating that JAC1 and THRUMIN1 may play a role in the FKF1-mediated  chloroplast avoidance response. However, the precise functional roles of JAC1 and  THRUMIN1 in this process are not known.', '2023 Jan 25', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants12030542', 'ORCID:']
