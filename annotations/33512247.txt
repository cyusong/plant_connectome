<i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>capsici</i> is the specific pathogen of pepper Fusarium wilt and causes a significant reduction in pepper yield. Its narrow host specificity has led to the concept of formae speciales. This interesting phenomenon has great potential and needs to be analyzed at the molecular level. In this study, we obtained the draft genome sequence of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>capsici</i>, using the Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology. The long read-based assembly consisted of 34 contigs, with a total length of 54,516,562 bp. The contig N<sub>50</sub> was 4,962,668 bp and the GC content was 47.6%. Our genome assembly of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>capsici</i> provides a valuable resource for the study of pepper Fusarium wilt, and the comparative genomic study of <i>F. oxysporum.</i>[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
