Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (pistillody) has been reported in cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that have the cytoplasm of a related wild species, Aegilops crassa. An ectopic ovule differentiates in the pistil-like stamen in the alloplasmic wheat. The SEEDSTICK (STK)-like class D MADS-box gene, wheat STK (WSTK), was expressed in the primordia of ectopic ovules in the pistil-like stamens as well as in the true pistil, suggesting that ectopic ovule formation results from WSTK expression in the pistil-like stamens of alloplasmic wheat. The ectopic ovule is abnormal as it fails to form complete integuments. Based on the expression pattern of WSTK and B(sister) MADS-box gene, WBsis (wheat B ( sister )), we conclude that WSTK plays a role in determination of ovule identity in the pistil-like stamen, but complete ovule development fails due to aberrant expression of WBsis.

WSTK: !affects! ovule identity
WSTK: !interacts with! WBsis
WBsis: !represses! complete ovule development
