Leaf senescence can be triggered and promoted by a large number of developmental and environmental factors. Numerous lines of evidence have suggested an involvement of phytochromes in the regulation of leaf senescence, but the related signaling pathways and physiological mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we initially identified phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) 3, 4, and 5 as putative mediators of leaf senescence. Mutations of the PIF genes resulted in a significantly enhanced leaf longevity in age-triggered and dark-induced senescence, whereas overexpressions of these genes accelerated age-triggered and dark-induced senescence in Arabidopsis. Consistently, loss-of-function of PIF4 attenuated dark-induced transcriptional changes associated with chloroplast deterioration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. ChIP-PCR and Dual-Luciferase assays demonstrated that PIF4 can activate chlorophyll degradation regulatory gene NYE1 and repress chloroplast activity maintainer gene GLK2 by binding to their promoter regions. Finally, dark-induced ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene-induced senescence were both dampened in pif4, suggesting the involvement of PIF4 in both ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway. Our study provides evidence that PIF3, 4, and 5 are novel positive senescence mediators and gains an insight into the mechanism of light signaling involved in the regulation of leaf senescence.
