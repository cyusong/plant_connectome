Protein quality control (PQC) is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by reducing protein misfolding and aggregation. Major PQC mechanisms include protein refolding assisted by molecular chaperones and the degradation of misfolded and aggregated proteins using the proteasome and autophagy. A C-terminus of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70-interacting protein [carboxy-terminal Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP)] is a chaperone-dependent and U-box-containing E3 ligase. CHIP is a key molecule in PQC by recognizing misfolded proteins through its interacting chaperones and targeting their degradation. CHIP also ubiquitinates native proteins and plays a regulatory role in other cellular processes, including signaling, development, DNA repair, immunity, and aging in metazoans. As a highly conserved ubiquitin ligase, plant CHIP plays an important role in response to a broad spectrum of biotic and abiotic stresses. CHIP protects chloroplasts by coordinating chloroplast PQC both outside and inside the important photosynthetic organelle of plant cells. CHIP also modulates the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a crucial component in a network of plant signaling, including abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. In this review, we discuss the structure, cofactors, activities, and biological function of CHIP with an emphasis on both its conserved and unique roles in PQC, stress responses, and signaling in plants.
