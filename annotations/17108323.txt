['17108323', 'Nucleolin is one of the most abundant protein in the nucleolus and is a  multifunctional protein involved in different steps of ribosome biogenesis. In  contrast to animals and yeast, the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana  encodes two nucleolin-like proteins, AtNUC-L1 and AtNUC-L2. However, only the  AtNUC-L1 gene is ubiquitously expressed in normal growth conditions. Disruption  of this AtNUC-L1 gene leads to severe plant growth and development defects.  AtNUC-L1 is localized in the nucleolus, mainly in the dense fibrillar component.  Absence of this protein in Atnuc-L1 plants induces nucleolar disorganization,  nucleolus organizer region decondensation, and affects the accumulation levels of  pre-rRNA precursors. Remarkably, in Atnuc-L1 plants the AtNUC-L2 gene is  activated, suggesting that AtNUC-L2 might rescue, at least partially, the loss of  AtNUC-L1. This work is the first description of a higher eukaryotic organism with  a disrupted nucleolin-like gene and defines a new role for nucleolin in nucleolus  structure and rDNA chromatin organization.', '2007 Feb', 'Mol Biol Cell', '10.1091/mbc.e06-08-0751', 'Saez-Vasquez']
