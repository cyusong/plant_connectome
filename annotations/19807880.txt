['19807880', 'Cells associated with veins of petioles of C(3) tobacco possess high activities  of the decarboxylase enzymes required in C(4) photosynthesis. It is not clear  whether this is the case in other C(3) species, nor whether these enzymes provide  precursors for specific biosynthetic pathways. Here, we investigate the activity  of C(4) acid decarboxylases in the mid-vein of Arabidopsis, identify regulatory  regions sufficient for this activity, and determine the impact of removing  individual isoforms of each protein on mid-vein metabolite profiles. This showed  that radiolabelled malate and bicarbonate fed to the xylem stream were  incorporated into soluble and insoluble material in the mid-vein of Arabidopsis  leaves. Compared with the leaf lamina, mid-veins possessed high activities of  NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD-dependent malic enzyme (NAD-ME) and  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Transcripts derived from both NAD-ME,  one PCK and two of the four NADP-ME genes were detectable in these veinal cells.  The promoters of each decarboxylase gene were sufficient for expression in  mid-veins. Analysis of insertional mutants revealed that cytosolic NADP-ME2 is  responsible for 80% of NADP-ME activity in mid-veins. Removing individual  decarboxylases affected the abundance of amino acids derived from pyruvate and  phosphoenolpyruvate. Reducing cytosolic NADP-ME activity preferentially affected  the sugar content, whereas abolishing NAD-ME affected both the amino acid and the  glucosamine content of mid-veins.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04040.x', 'Hibberd']
