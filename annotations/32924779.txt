The central role of the Arabidopsis <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> gene in response to biotic stress has been well established by an array of workers. So far, the role of <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> in abiotic stresses has not been investigated systematically. Here, we have first investigated a comprehensive <i>in silico</i> survey to explore the regulation, expression pattern in responses to a wide range of abiotic stresses. The present study reveals that the <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> promoter has numerous potential <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs) that are regulated by different stresses. AtGenExpress data elucidate that <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> gene plays a potential role in responses to cold, osmotic, drought, salt, UV-B, heat, wound, and genotoxic compound. The expression profile of the co-expressed genes suggests that Arabidopsis <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> gene might have a potential role in stress responses in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, a probable signal transduction mechanism has been described by using protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset. Moreover, the present data-mining investigations have suggested that <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> gene modulates cellular metabolites and abiotic stress responses.
