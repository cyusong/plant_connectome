['21305057', 'BACKGROUND: Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind to small-interfering (si)RNAs and micro  (mi)RNAs to target RNA silencing against viruses, transgenes and in regulation of  mRNAs. Plants encode multiple AGO proteins but, in Arabidopsis, only AGO1 is  known to have an antiviral role. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To uncover the  roles of specific AGOs in limiting virus accumulation we inoculated turnip  crinkle virus (TCV) to Arabidopsis plants that were mutant for each of the ten  AGO genes. The viral symptoms on most of the plants were the same as on wild type  plants although the ago2 mutants were markedly hyper-susceptible to this virus.  ago2 plants were also hyper-susceptible to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV),  confirming that the antiviral role of AGO2 is not specific to a single virus. For  both viruses, this phenotype was associated with transient increase in virus  accumulation. In wild type plants the AGO2 protein was induced by TCV and CMV  infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these results we propose that there  are multiple layers to RNA-mediated defense and counter-defense in the  interactions between plants and their viruses. AGO1 represents a first layer.  With some viruses, including TCV and CMV, this layer is overcome by viral  suppressors of silencing that can target AGO1 and a second layer involving AGO2  limits virus accumulation. The second layer is activated when the first layer is  suppressed because AGO2 is repressed by AGO1 via miR403. The activation of the  second layer is therefore a direct consequence of the loss of the first layer of  defense.', '2011 Jan 31', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0014639', 'Baulcombe']
