Spikelet number is an important target trait for wheat yield improvement. Thus, the identification and verification of novel quantitative trait locus (QTL)/genes controlling spikelet number are essential for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms and hence for improving grain yield. In the present study, we constructed a high-density genetic map for the Kechengmai1/Chuanmai42 doubled haploid (DH) population using 13,068 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from the Wheat 55K SNP array. A comparison between the genetic and physical maps indicated high consistence of the marker orders. Based on this genetic map, a total of 27 QTLs associated with total spikelet number per spike (TSN) and fertile spikelet number per spike (FSN) were detected on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2B, 2D, 3D, 4A, 4D, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6A, 6B, and 7D in five environments. Among them, five QTLs on chromosome 2D, 3D, 5A, and 7D were detected in multiple environments and combined QTL analysis, explaining the phenotypic variance ranging from 3.64% to 23.28%. Particularly, <i>QTsn/Fsn.cib-3D</i> for TSN and FSN [phenotypic variation explained (PVE) = 5.97-23.28%, limit of detection (LOD) = 3.73-18.51] is probably a novel locus and located in a 4.5-cM interval on chromosome arm 3DL flanking by the markers <i>AX-110914105</i> and <i>AX-109429351.</i> This QTL was further validated in other two populations with different genetic backgrounds using the closely linked Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) marker <i>KASP_AX-110914105</i>. The results indicated that <i>QTsn/Fsn.cib-3D</i> significantly increased the TSN (5.56-7.96%) and FSN (5.13-9.35%), which were significantly correlated with grain number per spike (GNS). We also preliminary analyzed the candidate genes within this locus by sequence similarity, spatial expression patterns, and collinearity analysis. These results provide solid foundation for future fine mapping and cloning of <i>QTsn/Fsn.cib-3D</i>. The developed and validated KASP markers could be utilized in molecular breeding aiming to increase the grain yield in wheat.
