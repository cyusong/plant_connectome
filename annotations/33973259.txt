Artemisinin, isolated from Artemisia annua, is recommended as the preferred drug to fight malaria. Previous research showed that jasmonate (JA)-mediated promotion of artemisinin accumulation depended on light. However, the mechanism underlying the interaction of light and JA in regulating artemisinin accumulation is still unknown. We identified a WRKY transcription factor, AaWRKY9, using transcriptome analysis. The glandular trichome-specific AaWRKY9 positively regulates artemisinin biosynthesis by directly binding to the promoters of AaDBR2 and AaGSW1. The key regulator in the light pathway AaHY5 activates the expression of AaWRKY9 by binding to its promoter. In addition, AaWRKY9 interacts with AaJAZ9, a repressor in the JA signalling pathway. AaJAZ9 represses the transcriptional activation activity of AaWRKY9 in the absence of methyl jasmonate. Notably, in the presence of methyl jasmonate, the transcriptional activation activity of AaWRKY9 is increased. Taken together, our results reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying AaWRKY9 contributes to light-mediated and jasmonate-mediated to regulate the biosynthesis of artemisinin in A. annua. Our study provides new insights into integrating the two signalling pathways to regulate terpene biosynthesis in plants.
