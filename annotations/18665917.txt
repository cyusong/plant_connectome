['18665917', 'In contrast to animal growth, plant growth is largely post-embryonic. Therefore  plants have developed new mechanisms to precisely regulate cell proliferation by  means of internal and external stimuli whilst the general core cell cycle  machinery is conserved between eukaryotes. In this work we demonstrate a role for  the Arabidopsis thaliana DNA-binding-with-one-finger (DOF) transcription factor  OBP1 in the control of cell division upon developmental signalling. Inducible  overexpression of OBP1 resulted in a significant overrepresentation of cell cycle  genes among the upregulated transcripts. Direct targets of OBP1, as verified by  chromatin immunoprecipitation, include at least the core cell cycle gene CYCD3;3  and the replication-specific transcription factor gene AtDOF2;3. Consistent with  our molecular data, short-term activation of OBP1 in cell cultures affected cell  cycle re-entry, shortening the duration of the G(1) phase and the overall length  of the cell cycle, whilst constitutive overexpression of OBP1 in plants  influenced cell size and cell number, leading to a dwarfish phenotype. Expression  during embryogenesis, germination and lateral root initiation suggests an  important role for OBP1 in cell cycle re-entry, operating as a transcriptional  regulator of key cell cycle genes. Our findings provide significant input into  our understanding of how cell cycle activity is incorporated into plant growth  and development.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03641.x', 'Mueller-Roeber']
