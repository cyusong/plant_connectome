In this review, I discuss the possibility that dying cells produce much of the auxin in vascular plants. The natural auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), is derived from tryptophan by a two-step pathway via indole pyruvic acid. The first enzymes in the pathway, tryptophan aminotransferases, have a low affinity for tryptophan and break it down only when tryptophan levels rise far above normal intracellular concentrations. Such increases occur when tryptophan is released from proteins by hydrolytic enzymes as cells autolyse and die. Many sites of auxin production are in and around dying cells: in differentiating tracheary elements; in root cap cells; in nutritive tissues that break down in developing flowers and seeds; in senescent leaves; and in wounds. Living cells also produce auxin, such as those transformed genetically by the crown gall pathogen. IAA may first have served as an exogenous indicator of the presence of nutrient-rich decomposing organic matter, stimulating the production of rhizoids in bryophytes. As cell death was internalized in bryophytes and in vascular plants, IAA may have taken on a new role as an endogenous hormone.
