To study the role of Cd-induced phytochelatins in UV-B tolerance, lipid peroxidation, antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase), glutathione arid phytochelatin contents were measured in buthionine sulphoximine treated and untreated cells of Anabaena doliolum. Cd-pretreatment of the cyanobacterium reduced the lipid peroxidation as well as the antioxidative enzymes in comparison to UV-B treatment alone, whereas the phytochelatin content demonstrated an increase. In contrast to this, buthionine sulphoximine-induced inhibition of phytochelatin synthase, dramatically decreased the Cd-induced co-tolerance against UV-B, hence demonstrating that phytochelatin not only protects the cyanobacterium from heavy metal but participates in UV-B tolerance as well.
