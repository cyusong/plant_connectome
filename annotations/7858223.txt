['7858223', 'A cDNA encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase, an enzyme that synthesizes C15  isoprenoid diphosphate from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl  diphosphate, was cloned from an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library by  complementation of a mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in this enzyme.  The A. thaliana cDNA was also able to complement the lethal phenotype of the  erg20 deletion yeast mutant. As deduced from the full-length 1.22 kb cDNA  nucleotide sequence, the polypeptide contains 343 amino acids and has a relative  molecular mass of 39,689. The predicted amino acid sequence presents about 50%  identity with the yeast, rat and human FPP synthases. Southern blot analyses  indicate that A. thaliana probably contains a single gene for farnesyl  diphosphate synthase.', '1994 Dec', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00019499', 'Karst']
