['9286110', 'We have characterized the gene flowering promoting factor1 (FPF1), which is  expressed in apical meristems immediately after the photoperiodic induction of  flowering in the long-day plants mustard and Arabidopsis. In early transition  stages, expression is only detectable in the peripheral zone of apical meristems;  however, later on, it can also be found in floral meristems and in axillary  meristems that form secondary inflorescences. The FPF1 gene encodes a 12.6-kD  protein that has no homology to any previously identified protein of known  function. Constitutive expression of the gene in Arabidopsis under control of the  cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter resulted in a dominant heritable trait of  early flowering under both short- and long-day conditions. Treatments with  gibberellin (GA) and paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, as well as  crosses with GA-deficient mutants indicate that FPF1 is involved in a  GA-dependent signaling pathway and modulates a GA response in apical meristems  during the transition to flowering.', '1997 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.9.8.1327', 'Melzer']
