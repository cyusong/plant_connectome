Multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations facilitate the genetic dissection of complex quantitative traits in plants and are valuable breeding materials. We report the development of the first eggplant MAGIC population (S3 Magic EGGplant InCanum, S3MEGGIC; 8-way), constituted by the 420 S3 individuals developed from the intercrossing of seven cultivated eggplant (<i>Solanum melongena</i>) and one wild relative (<i>S. incanum</i>) parents. The S3MEGGIC recombinant population was genotyped with the eggplant 5k probes SPET platform and phenotyped for anthocyanin presence in vegetative plant tissues (PA) and fruit epidermis (FA), and for the light-insensitive anthocyanic pigmentation under the calyx (PUC). The 7,724 filtered high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confirmed a low residual heterozygosity (6.87%), a lack of genetic structure in the S3MEGGIC population, and no differentiation among subpopulations carrying a cultivated or wild cytoplasm. Inference of haplotype blocks of the nuclear genome revealed an unbalanced representation of the founder genomes, suggesting a cryptic selection in favour or against specific parental genomes. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis for PA, FA, and PUC detected strong associations with two myeloblastosis (MYB) genes similar to <i>MYB113</i> involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, and with a <i>COP1</i> gene which encodes for a photo-regulatory protein and may be responsible for the PUC trait. Evidence was found of a duplication of an ancestral <i>MYB113</i> gene with a translocation from chromosome 10 to chromosome 1 compared with the tomato genome. Parental genotypes for the three genes were in agreement with the identification of the candidate genes performed in the S3MEGGIC population. Our new eggplant MAGIC population is the largest recombinant population in eggplant and is a powerful tool for eggplant genetics and breeding studies.
