Plant small RNA (sRNA)-mediated gene expression has a conserved role in regulating plant growth, development, and immunity. Heterologous expression of sRNA contributes to determining whether the function of sRNA is conservative or independent. We recently characterized the Tourist-miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE)-derived siR109944 had a conserved function that enhanced susceptibility to <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> infection by affecting auxin homeostasis in rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. To ascertain whether the function of rice siR109944 has a broad-spectrum immunity in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, we infected <i>Arabidopsis</i> with a variety of fungal pathogens. Overexpression of siR109944 in <i>Arabidopsis</i> increased susceptibility to <i>Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotium</i>, and <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection. Further studies found that <i>Arabidopsis</i> auxin-related miRNAs were suppressed in <i>siR109944 OE</i>. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of rice siR109944 in <i>Arabidopsis</i> affected immune responses to multiple pathogens by inhibiting auxin-related miRNA expression <i>in planta</i>.
