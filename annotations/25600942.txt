['25600942', 'Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are plant-specific extracellular glycoproteins  implicated in a variety of processes during growth and development. AGP  biosynthesis involves O-galactosylation of hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues followed  by a stepwise elongation of the complex sugar chains. However, functionally  dominant Hyp O-galactosyltransferases, such that their disruption produces  phenocopies of AGP-deficient mutants, remain to be identified. Here, we purified  and identified three potent Hyp O-galactosyltransferases, HPGT1, HPGT2 and HPGT3,  from Arabidopsis microsomal fractions. Loss-of-function analysis indicated that  approximately 90% of the endogenous Hyp O-galactosylation activity is  attributable to these three enzymes. AGP14 expressed in the triple mutant  migrated much faster on SDS-PAGE than when expressed in wild-type, confirming a  considerable decrease in levels of glycosylation of AGPs in the mutant.  Loss-of-function mutant plants exhibited a pleiotropic phenotype of longer  lateral roots, longer root hairs, radial expansion of the cells in the root tip,  small leaves, shorter inflorescence stems, reduced fertility and shorter  siliques. Our findings provide genetic evidence that Hyp-linked arabinogalactan  polysaccharide chains are critical for AGP function and clues to how  arabinogalactan moieties of AGPs contribute to cell-to-cell communication during  plant growth and development.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12764', 'Matsubayashi']
