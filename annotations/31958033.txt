<i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is a widely distributed soilborne pathogen that causes vascular wilt in more than 200 plant species. Defoliating and nondefoliating symptoms caused by the disease that result in either the loss or retention of leaves in infected plants, respectively, in hosts such as cotton, olive, and okra, divide the causal agent into defoliating and nondefoliating pathotypes. Our goal in this current work was to generate genome resources for the defoliating strain XJ592 and the nondefoliating strain XJ511 of <i>V. dahliae</i> isolated from cotton in China.
