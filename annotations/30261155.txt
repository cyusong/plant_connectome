The emergence of new races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal pathogen of wheat stem rust, has spurred interest in developing durable resistance to this disease in wheat. Nonhost resistance holds promise to help control this and other diseases because it is durable against nonadapted pathogens. However, the genetic and molecular basis of nonhost resistance to wheat stem rust is poorly understood. In this study, the model grass Brachypodium distachyon, a nonhost of P. graminis f. sp. tritici, was used to genetically dissect nonhost resistance to wheat stem rust. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population segregating for response to wheat stem rust was evaluated for resistance. Evaluation of genome-wide cumulative single nucleotide polymorphism allele frequency differences between contrasting pools of resistant and susceptible RILs followed by molecular marker analysis identified six quantitative trait loci (QTL) that cumulatively explained 72.5% of the variation in stem rust resistance. Two of the QTLs explained 31.7% of the variation, and their interaction explained another 4.6%. Thus, nonhost resistance to wheat stem rust in B. distachyon is genetically complex, with both major and minor QTLs acting additively and, in some cases, interacting. These findings will guide future research to identify genes essential to nonhost resistance to wheat stem rust.
