McMichael <i>et al</i> state that we overlooked the effects of post-Columbian human activities in shaping current floristic patterns in Amazonian forests. We formally show that post-Columbian human influences on Amazonian forests are indeed important, but they have played a smaller role when compared to the persistent effects of pre-Columbian human activities on current forest composition.

Gene: !affects! Process 
Post-Columbian Human Activity: !shapes! Floristic Patterns 
Pre-Columbian Human Activity: !persistently affects! Forest Composition
