Soybean transcription factor GmNAC plays important roles in plant resistance to environmental stresses. In this study, <i>GmNAC3</i> was cloned in the drought tolerant soybean variety "Jiyu47", with the molecular properties of GmNAC3 characterized to establish its candidacy as a NAC transcription factor. The yeast self-activation experiments revealed the transcriptional activation activity of GmNAC3, which was localized in the nucleus by the subcellular localization analysis. The highest expression of <i>GmNAC3</i> was detected in roots in the podding stage of soybean, and in roots of soybean seedlings treated with 20% PEG6000 for 12 h, which was 16 times higher compared with the control. In the transgenic soybean hairy roots obtained by the <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated method treated with 20% PEG6000 for 12 h, the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase and the content of proline were increased, the malondialdehyde content was decreased, and the expressions of stress resistance-related genes (i.e., <i>APX2</i>, <i>LEA14</i>, <i>6PGDH</i>, and <i>P5CS</i>) were up-regulated. These expression patterns were confirmed by transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with the overexpression of <i>GmNAC3</i>. This study provided strong scientific evidence to support further investigation of the regulatory function of <i>GmNAC3</i> in plant drought resistance and the molecular mechanisms regulating the plant response to environmental stresses.
