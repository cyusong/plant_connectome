Psb27 has been identified as a lumenal protein associated with photosystem II (PSII). To gain insight into the function of Psb27, we isolated a mutant Arabidopsis plant with a loss of psb27 function. The quantity of PSII complexes and electron transfer within PSII remained largely unaffected in the psb27 mutant. Our results also showed that under high-light-illumination, PSII activity and the content of the PSII reaction center protein D1 decreased more significantly in the psb27 mutant than in wild-type (WT) plant. Treatment of leaves with a chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor resulted in similar light-induced PSII inactivation levels and D1 protein degradation rates in the WT and psb27 mutant plants. Recovery of PSII activity after photoinhibition was delayed in the psb27 mutant, suggesting that Psb27 is required for efficient recovery of the photodamaged PSII complex. Overall, these results demonstrated that Psb27 in Arabidopsis is not essential for oxygenic photosynthesis and PSII formation. Instead, our results provide evidence for the involvement of this lumenal protein in the recovery process of PSII.
