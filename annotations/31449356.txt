['31449356', "RNA capping and decapping tightly coordinate with transcription, translation, and  RNA decay to regulate gene expression. Proteins in the DXO/Rai1 family have been  implicated in mRNA decapping and decay, and mammalian DXO was recently found to  also function as a decapping enzyme for NAD(+) -capped RNAs (NAD-RNA). The  Arabidopsis genome contains a single gene encoding a DXO/Rai1 protein, AtDXO1.  Here we show that AtDXO1 possesses both NAD-RNA decapping activity and 5'-3'  exonuclease activity but does not hydrolyze the m(7) G cap. The atdxo1 mutation  increased the stability of NAD-RNAs and led to pleiotropic phenotypes, including  severe growth retardation, pale color, and multiple developmental defects.  Transcriptome profiling analysis showed that the atdxo1 mutation resulted in  upregulation of defense-related genes but downregulation of  photosynthesis-related genes. The autoimmunity phenotype of the mutant could be  suppressed by either eds1 or npr1 mutation. However, the various phenotypes  associated with the atdxo1 mutant could be complemented by an enzymatically  inactive AtDXO1. The atdxo1 mutation apparently enhances post-transcriptional  gene silencing by elevating levels of siRNAs. Our study indicates that AtDXO1  regulates gene expression in various biological and physiological processes  through its pleiotropic molecular functions in mediating RNA processing and  decay.", '2020 Jul', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12867', 'Xia']
