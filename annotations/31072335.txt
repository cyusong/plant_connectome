BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT (BZR) family genes encode plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that participate in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BZR TFs have vital roles in plant growth, including cell elongation. However, little is known about BZR genes in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Therefore, we performed a genome-wide investigation of BvBZR genes in sugar beet. Through an analysis of the BES1_N conserved domain, six BvBZR gene family members were identified in the sugar beet genome, which clustered into three subgroups according to a phylogenetic analysis. Each clade was well defined by the conserved motifs, implying that close genetic relationships could be identified among the members of each subfamily. According to chromosomal distribution mapping, 2, 1, 1, 1, and 1 genes were located on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8, respectively. The cis-acting elements related to taproot growth were randomly distributed in the promoter sequences of the BvBZR genes. Tissue-specific expression analyses indicated that all BvBZR genes were expressed in all three major tissue types (roots, stems, and leaves), with significantly higher expression in leaves. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that Bv1_fxre and Bv6_nyuw are localized in the nuclei, consistent with the prediction of Wolf PSORT. These findings offer a basis to predict the functions of BZR genes in sugar beet, and lay a foundation for further research of the biological functions of BZR genes in sugar beet.
