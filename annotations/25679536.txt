MPMI has played a leading role in disseminating new insights into plant-microbe interactions and promoting new approaches. Articles in this Focus Issue highlight the power of genomic studies in uncovering novel determinants of plant interactions with microbial symbionts (good), pathogens (bad), and complex microbial communities (unknown). Many articles also illustrate how genomics can support translational research by quickly advancing our knowledge of important microbes that have not been widely studied.
