Bacterial blight, caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), is an overwhelming disease in rice-growing regions worldwide. Our previous studies revealed that the executor <i>R</i> gene <i>Xa23</i> confers broad-spectrum disease resistance to all naturally occurring biotypes of <i>Xoo</i>. In this study, comparative transcriptomic profiling of two near-isogenic lines (NILs), CBB23 (harboring <i>Xa23</i>) and JG30 (without <i>Xa23</i>), before and after infection of the <i>Xoo</i> strain, PXO99<sup>A</sup>, was done by RNA sequencing, to identify genes associated with the resistance. After high throughput sequencing, 1645 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between CBB23 and JG30 at different time points. Gene Ontlogy (GO) analysis categorized the DEGs into biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. KEGG analysis categorized the DEGs into different pathways, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was the most prominent pathway, followed by biosynthesis of plant hormones, flavonoid biosynthesis, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Further analysis led to the identification of differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) and different kinase responsive genes in CBB23, than that in JG30. Besides TFs and kinase responsive genes, DEGs related to ethylene, jasmonic acid, and secondary metabolites were also identified in both genotypes after PXO99<sup>A</sup> infection. The data of DEGs are a precious resource for further clarifying the network of <i>Xa23</i>-mediated resistance.
