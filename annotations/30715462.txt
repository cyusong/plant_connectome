The hypersensitive response (HR) is a plant defence reaction triggered by activation of immune receptors upon pathogen recognition. It results in rapid cell death at the attempted invasion site, confining the pathogen and sending signals to distal parts of the plant that can in turn activate defences for subsequent attacks. HR cell death is a highly controlled phenomenon, requiring the concerted action of diverse plant proteases and regulatory mechanisms to keep it efficient yet confined. Research in the last decade has significantly contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to HR, although our knowledge about the pathways that regulate this form of programmed cell death (PCD) still remains incomplete. In this review, we explore current knowledge of plant proteases as HR regulators. Proteases are key regulatory enzymes that not only serve degradative purposes, but also have very important signalling roles. In animals, caspases have been shown to be the major regulators and executioners of PCD. Plants do not have caspases, and instead PCD is carried out by the activities of caspase-like and other protease belonging to different protease classes. We summarise the mechanistic roles of plant proteases whose roles in HR regulation are relatively well understood, which includes members of the cysteine, threonine, and serine protease families.
