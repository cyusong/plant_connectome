The Striga, particularly S. he rmonthica, problem has become a major threat to food security, exacerbating hunger and poverty in many African countries. A number of Striga control strategies have been proposed and tested during the past decade, however, further research efforts are still needed to provide sustainable and effective solutions to the Striga problem. In this paper, we provide an update on the recent progress and the approaches used in Striga management, and highlight emerging opportunities for developing new technologies to control this enigmatic parasite.
