DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit ripening. Although SlDML2, a DNA demethylase (DML) gene, is critically involved in tomato fruit ripening, little is known about genes that regulate its expression. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we identified a High Mobility Group A protein, named SlHMGA3, and demonstrated its binding activity to the AT-rich region of the SlDML2 promoter. We produced slhmga3 tomato mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 and observed that slhmga3 fruit reached the breaker stage much later than fruit from the wild-type. We further demonstrated that at the initiation stage of fruit ripening, the increased expression of SlDML2 and ethylene biosynthetic and signaling genes was significantly delayed in slhmga3 fruit, along with delays in ethylene production and demethylation and activation of ripening-associated transcription factor genes. Our results demonstrate that SlHMGA3 plays a role in enhancing SlDML2 expression, and its effects on tomato fruit ripening are largely through DNA demethylation of ripening-associated transcription factor genes.
