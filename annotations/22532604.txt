A series of reticulated Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were previously described. All mutants show a reticulate leaf pattern, namely green veins on a pale leaf lamina. They have an aberrant mesophyll structure but an intact layer of bundle sheath cells around the veins. Here, we unravel the function of the previously described reticulated EMS-mutant dov1 (differential development of vascular associated cells 1). By positional cloning, we identified the mutated gene, which encodes glutamine phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate aminotransferase 2 (ATase2), an enzyme catalyzing the first step of purine nucleotide biosynthesis. dov1 is allelic to the previously characterized cia1-2 mutant that was isolated in a screen for mutants with impaired chloroplast protein import. We show that purine-derived total cytokinins are lowered in dov1 and crosses with phytohormone reporter lines revealed differential reporter activity patterns in dov1. Metabolite profiling unraveled that amino acids that are involved in purine biosynthesis are increased in dov1. This study identified the molecular basis of an established mutant line, which has the potential for further investigation of the interaction between metabolism and leaf development.
