Plants have evolved sophisticated immune networks to restrict pathogen colonization. In response, pathogens deploy numerous virulent effectors to circumvent plant immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms by which pathogen-derived effectors suppress plant defenses remain elusive. Here, we report that the nucleus-localized RxLR effector PsAvh110 from the pathogen Phytophthora sojae, causing soybean (Glycine max) stem and root rot, modulates the activity of a transcriptional complex to suppress plant immunity. Soybean like-heterochromatin protein 1-2 (GmLHP1-2) and plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (GmPHD6) form a transcriptional complex with transcriptional activity that positively regulates plant immunity against Phytophthora infection. To suppress plant immunity, the nuclear effector PsAvh110 disrupts the assembly of the GmLHP1-2/GmPHD6 complex via specifically binding to GmLHP1-2, thus blocking its transcriptional activity. We further show that PsAvh110 represses the expression of a subset of immune-associated genes, including BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1-3 (GmBAK1-3) and pathogenesis-related protein 1 (GmPR1), via G-rich elements in gene promoters. Importantly, PsAvh110 is a conserved effector in different Phytophthora species, suggesting that the PsAvh110 regulatory mechanism might be widely utilized in the genus to manipulate plant immunity. Thus, our study reveals a regulatory mechanism by which pathogen effectors target a transcriptional complex to reprogram transcription.
