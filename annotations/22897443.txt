['22897443', "Deoxyribonucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and can be synthesized via de  novo and salvage pathways. Deoxyribonucleoside kinases (EC 2.7.1.145) salvage  deoxyribonucleosides by transfer of a phosphate group to the 5' of a  deoxyribonucleoside. This salvage pathway is well characterized in mammals, but  in contrast, little is known about how plants salvage deoxyribonucleosides. We  show that during salvage, deoxyribonucleosides can be phosphorylated by extracts  of Arabidopsis thaliana into corresponding monophosphate compounds with an  unexpected preference for purines over pyrimidines. Deoxyribonucleoside kinase  activities were present in all tissues during all growth stages. In the A.  thaliana genome, we identified two types of genes that could encode enzymes which  are involved in the salvage of deoxyribonucleosides. Thymidine kinase activity  was encoded by two thymidine kinase 1 (EC 2.7.1.21)-like genes (AtTK1a and  AtTK1b). Deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine and deoxycytidine kinase activities were  encoded by a single AtdNK gene. T-DNA insertion lines of AtTK1a and AtTK1b mutant  genes had normal growth, although AtTK1a AtTK1b double mutants died at an early  stage, which indicates that AtTK1a and AtTK1b catalyze redundant reactions. The  results obtained in the present study suggest a crucial role for the salvage of  thymidine during early plant development.", '2012 Oct', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08747.x', 'Piskur']
