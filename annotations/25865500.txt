['25865500', 'Arabidopsis thaliana HomeoBox 1 (AtHB1) is a homeodomain-leucine zipper  transcription factor described as a transcriptional activator with unknown  function. Its role in A. thaliana development was investigated. AtHB1 expression  was analyzed in transgenic plants bearing its promoter region fused to reporter  genes. Knock-down mutant and overexpressor plant phenotypes were analyzed in  different photoperiod regimes. AtHB1 was mainly expressed in hypocotyls and roots  and up-regulated in seedlings grown under a short-day photoperiod. AtHB1  knock-down mutants and overexpressors showed shorter and longer hypocotyls,  respectively, than wild type (WT). AtHB1 transcript levels were lower in  PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (PIF1) mutants than in controls, suggesting that  AtHB1 is regulated by PIF1 in hypocotyls. beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaves cotransformed with PromAtHB1::GUS and 35S::PIF1  indicated that PIF1 induces AtHB1 expression. Hypocotyl lenght was measured in  seedlings of athb1, pif1, or double athb1/pif1 mutants and PIF1 or AtHB1  overexpressors in WT, athb1 or pif1 backgrounds, both in short- or long-day.  These analyses allowed us to determine that AtHB1 is a factor acting downstream  of PIF1. Finally, a transcriptome analysis of athb1 mutant hypocotyls revealed  that AtHB1 regulates genes involved in cell wall composition and elongation. The  results suggest that AtHB1 acts downstream of PIF1 to promote hypocotyl  elongation, especially in response to short-day photoperiods.', '2015 Aug', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13401', 'Chan']
