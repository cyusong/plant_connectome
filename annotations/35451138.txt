In contrast to seed plants, the gametophytes of seed-free plants develop pluripotent meristems, which promote and sustain their independent growth and development. To date, the cellular basis of meristem development in gametophytes of seed-free ferns remains largely unknown. In this study, we used Woodsia obtusa, the blunt-lobe cliff fern, to quantitatively determine cell growth dynamics in two different types of apical meristems - the apical initial centered meristem and the multicellular apical meristem in gametophytes. Through confocal time-lapse live imaging and computational image analysis and quantification, we determined unique patterns of cell division and growth that sustain or terminate apical initials, dictate the transition from apical initials to multicellular apical meristems, and drive proliferation of apical meristems in ferns. Quantitative results showed that small cells correlated to active cell division in fern gametophytes. The marginal cells of multicellular apical meristems in fern gametophytes undergo division in both anticlinal and periclinal orientations, not only increasing cell numbers but also playing a dominant role in increasing cell layers during gametophyte development. All these findings provide insights into the function and regulation of meristems in gametophytes of seed-free vascular plants, suggesting both conserved and diversified mechanisms underlying meristem cell proliferation across land plants.
