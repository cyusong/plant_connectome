Severe environments disturb the folding or assembly of newly synthesized proteins, resulting in accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as cytotoxic aggregation of abnormal proteins. Therefore, ER stress is evoked due to disturbed ER homeostasis. Alternative oxidase (AOX) plays an important role in coping with various abiotic stresses and plant growth. Our previous study has reported that PpAOX is involved in the regulation of salt tolerance in moss Physcomitrella patens (P. patens), but its biological functions in modulating ER stress remain unknown. Here we report that the gametophyte of P. patens displays severe growth inhibition and developmental deficiency under tunicamycin (Tm, an elicitor of ER stress)-induced ER stress conditions. PpAOX and selected ER stress response-like genes in P. patens were induced under Tm treatment. PpAOX knockout (PpAOX KO) plants exhibited decreased resistance to Tm-induced ER stress, whereas PpAOX-overexpressing lines (PpAOX OX) plants were more tolerant to Tm-induced ER stress. Data showed that PpAOX contributes to redox homeostasis under Tm treatment. In addition, we observed that PpAOX completely restores the Tm-sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis AOX1a mutant (Ataox1a). Taken together, our work reveals a functional link between PpAOX and ER stress tolerance regulation in P. patens.
