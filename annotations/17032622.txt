The cadmium (Cd)-induced changes in protein pattern and identification of metal-stimulated polypeptides were analyzed in soybean cell suspension culture. The cell cultures were treated with various concentrations of Cd(2+) (3-10microM) for 24, 48 and 72h. The synthesis of [(35)S]-labeled proteins and their accumulation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, whereas the identification of selected protein bands was performed by mass spectrometry. It is shown that Cd induced the appearance of the following proteins in soybean cells: superoxide dismutase, histone H2B, chalcone synthase and glutathione transferase.

Cd: !induces! superoxide dismutase
Cd: !induces! histone H2B
Cd: !induces! chalcone synthase
Cd: !induces! glutathione transferase
