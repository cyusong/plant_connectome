Peach encodes 14 INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) transcription factors. PpIDD4, -12 and -13 mediated PpDELLA1 binding to the PpGA20ox1 promoter. Each of these three PpIDD-DELLA1 complexes activated transcription of PpGA20ox1. PpTPR1 and -4 interrupted the interaction of PpIDDs with PpDELLA1. The plant growth regulator gibberellin (GA) plays an important role in the rapid growth of annual shoots in peach. Our previous study showed that the peach cultivar 'FenHuaShouXingTao' (FHSXT), a gibberellic acid receptor (gid1) mutant, accumulates active GAs in annual shoot tips. This mutant enhances GA feedback regulation in peach. The results of this study suggested that the PpIDD-DELLA1 complex is the underlying mechanism of GA feedback regulation in peach. Fourteen IDD genes were identified in peach, and three PpIDDs (PpIDD4, -12 and -13, all from group IV) interacted with PpDELLA1, an important component in GA signaling pathway. Truncation, segmentation and site mutation of the promoter of PpGA20ox1 (a GA biosynthesis gene) showed that all three PpIDD proteins recognized the core motif TTGTC. PpIDD4 and -13 mainly bind to site 3, while PpIDD12 binds to site 5 of the PpGA20ox1 promoter. All three PpIDD-DELLA1 complexes activated the PpGA20ox1 promoter-LUC fusion. These data suggested that PpIDDs bridge PpDELLA1 and the promoter of PpGA20ox1, which then activated the transcription of PpGA20ox1. In addition, PpTPR1 and -4 disrupted the interaction of PpIDDs with PpDELLA1. Our research will be helpful for understanding and possibly modifying the regulation of annual shoot growth and GA biosynthesis.
