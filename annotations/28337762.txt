Plants are often confronted to nutrient limiting conditions, such as inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency, resulting in a reduction in growth and yield. PHO2, encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, is a central component of the Pi-starvation response signalling pathway. A yeast-two-hybrid screen using Oryza sativa (rice) PHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGIGANTEA, a key regulator of flowering time, which was confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Characterization of rice Osgi and Ospho2 mutants revealed that they displayed several similar phenotypic features supporting a physiological role for this interaction. Reduced growth, leaf tip necrosis, delayed flowering and over-accumulation of Pi in leaves compared to wild type were shared features of Osgi and Ospho2 plants. Pi analysis of individual leaves demonstrated that Osgi, similar to Ospho2 mutants, were impaired in Pi remobilization from old to young leaves, albeit to a lesser extent. Transcriptome analyses revealed more than 55% of the genes differentially expressed in Osgi plants overlapped with the set of differentially expressed genes in Ospho2 plants. The interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGI links high-level regulators of Pi homeostasis and development in rice.
