['26795157', 'Xylan is one of the major polymers in lignocellulosic biomass and about 60% of  its xylosyl residues are acetylated at O-2 and/or O-3. Because acetylation of  cell wall polymers contributes to biomass recalcitrance for biofuel production,  it is important to investigate the biochemical mechanism underlying xylan  acetylation, the knowledge of which could be applied to custom-design biomass  composition tailored for biofuel production. In this report, we investigated the  functions of Arabidopsis TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE 34 (TBL34) and TBL35, two  DUF231-containing proteins, in xylan acetylation. The TBL34 gene was found to be  specifically expressed in xylem cells in stems and root-hypocotyls, and both  TBL34 and TBL35 were shown to be localized in the Golgi, where xylan biosynthesis  occurs. Chemical analysis revealed that simultaneous mutations of TBL34 and TBL35  caused a mild decrease in xylan acetyl content and a specific reduction in xylan  3-O-monoacetylation and 2,3-di-O-acetylation. Furthermore, simultaneous mutations  of TBL34, TBL35 and ESKIMO1 (ESK1) resulted in severely collapsed xylem vessels  with altered secondary wall structure, and an extremely retarded plant growth.  These findings indicate that TBL34 and TBL35 are putative acetyltransferases  required for xylan 3-O-monoacetylation and 2,3-di-O-acetylation and that xylan  acetylation is essential for normal secondary wall deposition and plant growth.', '2016 Feb', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.12.007', 'Ye']
