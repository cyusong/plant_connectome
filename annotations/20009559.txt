Light perceived by phytochromes will induce genes of nitrogen assimilation, however, transducing components in the signaling cascades to these genes are hardly known. Recently the bZIP transcription factors HY5 (LONG HYPOCOTYL5) and HYH (HOMOLOG OF HY5) were identified as positive regulators in light activation of NIA2 (nitrate reductase 2). The bHLH transcription factor PIF4 (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4) was revealed as an inhibitor of NIA2 expression. In contrast to NIA2, expression of other genes of nitrogen assimilation, NRT1.1 (dual-affinity nitrate transporter 1.1), NIA1 (nitrate reductase 1), NIR (nitrite reductase), GLN2 (glutamine synthetase 2) and GLU1 (glutamate synthase 1) were not promoted by HY5/HYH or inhibited by PIF4. NIA2 as the outstanding gene of nitrate assimilation regarding HY5/HYH and PIFs may have evolved in connection with the cytosolic leaf localization of nitrate reductase, and adverse effects of the products, nitrite, nitric oxide and active oxygen species formed by the enzyme.
