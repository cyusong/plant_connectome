['17253987', 'Specific disease resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana against the Hyaloperonospora  parasitica isolate Hiks1 (HpHiks1) is mediated by RPP7. Although this disease  resistance gene encodes a typical nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat  (NB-LRR) disease resistance protein, its function is independent of the defense  hormone salicylic acid and most known genes required for plant immune responses.  We identified EDM2 (enhanced downy mildew 2) in a genetic screen for RPP7  suppressors. Mutations of EDM2 phenocopy RPP7 mutations, but do not affect other  tested disease resistance genes. We isolated EDM2 by map-based cloning. The  predicted EDM2 protein is structurally unrelated to previously identified  components of the plant immune system, bears typical features of transcriptional  regulators, including plant homeodomain (PHD)-finger-like domains, and defines a  plant-specific protein family. In edm2 mutants both constitutive and  HpHiks1-induced RPP7 transcript levels are reduced, suggesting that EDM2 is  either a direct or an indirect regulator of RPP7 expression. Microarray analyses  defined a set of defense-associated genes, the expression of which is suppressed  during successful HpHiks1 colonization of either rpp7 or edm2 plants. This  transcriptional phenotype is counteracted by an EDM2/RPP7-dependent mechanism.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02999.x', 'Dangl']
