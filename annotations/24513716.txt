['24513716', "Cytokinins are a major group of phytohormones regulating plant growth,  development and stress responses. However, in contrast to the well-defined polar  transport of auxins, the molecular basis of cytokinin transport is poorly  understood. Here we show that an ATP-binding cassette transporter in Arabidopsis,  AtABCG14, is essential for the acropetal (root to shoot) translocation of the  root-synthesized cytokinins. AtABCG14 is expressed primarily in the pericycle and  stelar cells of roots. Knocking out AtABCG14 strongly impairs the translocation  of trans-zeatin (tZ)-type cytokinins from roots to shoots, thereby affecting the  plant's growth and development. AtABCG14 localizes to the plasma membrane of  transformed cells. In planta feeding of C(14) or C(13)-labelled tZ suggests that  it acts as an efflux pump and its presence in the cells directly correlates with  the transport of the fed cytokinin. Therefore, AtABCG14 is a transporter likely  involved in the long-distance translocation of cytokinins in planta.", '2014', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms4274', 'Liu']
