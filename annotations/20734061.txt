['20734061', 'Phytic acid (inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate or InsP(6)) is the primary  storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. The rice OsLpa1 encodes a novel  protein required for wild-type levels of seed InsP(6) and was identified from a  low phytic acid (lpa) mutant exhibiting a 45-50% reduction in seed InsP(6).  OsLpa1 is highly conserved in plants and Arabidopsis contains two OsLpa1-like  genes, At3g45090 and At5g60760. Analysis of homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants of  At5g60760 revealed significantly reduced levels of seed InsP(6) while no changes  were observed in seeds of At3g45090 mutants. A double knockout mutant of  At5g60760 and At3g45090 was created and its seed InsP(6) content was similar to  that of the At5g60760 mutant indicating that At3g45090 does not provide  functional redundancy. OsLpa1 was confirmed to be the ortholog of At5g60760 by  complementation of a knockout mutant with a cDNA clone corresponding to the  largest of three alternative transcripts of OsLpa1. The spatial and temporal  expression of At5g60760 during seed development is consistent with its  involvement in seed InsP(6) biosynthesis.', '2010 Oct', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1243-5', 'Tai']
