['12904214', 'Plants can regulate levels of the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by conjugation  to amino acids or sugars, and subsequent hydrolysis of these conjugates to  release active IAA. These less active auxin conjugates constitute the majority of  IAA in plants. We isolated the Arabidopsis ilr2-1 mutant as a recessive  IAA-leucine resistant mutant that retains wild-type sensitivity to free IAA.  ilr2-1 is also defective in lateral root formation and primary root elongation.  In addition, ilr2-1 is resistant to manganese- and cobalt-mediated inhibition of  root elongation, and microsomal preparations from the ilr2-1 mutant exhibit  enhanced ATP-dependent manganese transport. We used a map-based positional  approach to clone the ILR2 gene, which encodes a novel protein with no predicted  membrane-spanning domains that is polymorphic among Arabidopsis accessions. Our  results demonstrate that ILR2 modulates a metal transporter, providing a novel  link between auxin conjugate metabolism and metal homeostasis.', '2003 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01826.x', 'Bartel']
