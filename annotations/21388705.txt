Hypothetical chloroplast open reading frames (ycfs) are highly conserved and interspecifically occurring genes in plastomes of plants and algae with significant functions in gene expression and photosynthesis. However, the function of many ycfs is still in vain so that attention is directed to other chloroplast functions such as metabolism of co-factors, protein translocation and protection against abiotic stress. We provide a comprehensive functional description of ycf53 and ycf59, two genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis. While ycf59 encodes an essential enzymatic component of Mg protoporphyrin monomethylester cyclase, ycf53 encodes a posttranslational regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Their roles in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis were compared by using cyanobacterial and plant mutants with modulated expression of these two genes. Our work provides indications for diverse effects of these homologous gene products in plants and cyanobacteria on tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and photosynthesis.
