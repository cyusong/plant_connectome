Growth is central to plant morphogenesis. Plant cells are encased in rigid cell walls, and they must overcome physical confinement to grow to specific sizes and shapes. Cell wall tension and turgor pressure are the main mechanical components impacting plant cell growth. Cell wall mechanics has been the focus of most plant biomechanical studies, and turgor pressure was often considered as a constant and largely passive component. Nevertheless, it is increasingly accepted that turgor pressure plays a significant role in plant growth. Numerous theoretical and experimental studies suggest that turgor pressure can be both spatially inhomogeneous and actively modulated during morphogenesis. Here, we revisit the pressure-growth relationship by reviewing recent advances in investigating the interactions between cellular/tissular pressure and growth.
