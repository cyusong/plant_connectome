In plants, cellular lipid peroxidation is enhanced under low nitrogen (LN) stress; this increases the lipid-derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS) levels. The cellular toxicity of RCS can be reduced by various RCS-scavenging enzymes. However, the roles of these enzymes in alleviating oxidative stress and improving nutrient use efficiency (NUE) under nutrient stress remain unknown. Here, we overexpressed maize endogenous NADPH-dependent 2-alkenal reductase (ZmAER) in maize; it significantly increased the tolerance of transgenic plants (OX-AER) to LN stress. Under LN condition, the biomass, nitrogen accumulation, NUE, and leaf photosynthesis of the OX-AER plants were significantly higher than those of the wild-type (WT) plants. The leaf and root malondialdehyde and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> levels in the transgenic plants were significantly lower than those in WT. The expression of antioxidant enzyme-related genes ZmCAT3, ZmPOD5 and ZmPOD13 was significantly higher in the transgenic lines than in WT. Under LN stress, the nitrate reductase activity in the OX-AER leaves was significantly increased compared with that in the WT leaves. Furthermore, under LN stress, ZmNRT1.1 and ZmNRT2.5 expression was upregulated in the OX-AER plants compared with that in WT. Overall, up-regulated ZmAER expression could enhance maize's tolerance to LN stress by alleviating oxidative stress and improve NUE.
