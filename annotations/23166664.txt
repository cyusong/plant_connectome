['23166664', 'Arabidopsis thaliana vegetative storage proteins, VSP1 and VSP2, are acid  phosphatases and belong to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. In  addition to their potential nutrient storage function, they were thought to be  involved in plant defense and flower development. To gain insights into the  architecture of the protein and obtain clues about its function, we have tested  their substrate specificity and solved the structure of VSP1. The acid  phosphatase activities of these two enzymes require divalent metal such as  magnesium ion. Conversely, the activity of these two enzymes is inhibited by  vanadate and molybdate, but is resistant to inorganic phosphate. Both VSP1 and  VSP2 did not exhibit remarkable activities to any physiological substrates  tested. In the current study, we presented the crystal structure of recombinant  VSP1 at 1.8 A resolution via the selenomethionine single-wavelength anomalous  diffraction (SAD). Specifically, an alpha-helical cap domain on the top of the alpha/beta  core domain is found to be involved in dimerization. In addition, despite of the  low sequence similarity between VSP1 and other HAD enzymes, the core domain of  VSP1 containing conserved active site and catalytic machinery displays a classic  haloacid dehalogenase fold. Furthermore, we found that VSP1 is distinguished from  bacterial class C acid phosphatase P4 by several structural features. To our  knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the crystal structure of plant  vegetative storage proteins.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0049421', 'Zhang']
