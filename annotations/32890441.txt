In Normandy, flax is a plant of important economic interest because of its fibres. Fusarium oxysporum, a telluric fungus, is responsible for the major losses in crop yield and fibre quality. Several methods are currently used to limit the use of phytochemicals on crops. One of them is the use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) occurring naturally in the rhizosphere. PGPR are known to act as local antagonists to soil-borne pathogens and to enhance plant resistance by eliciting the induced systemic resistance (ISR). In this study, we first investigated the cell wall modifications occurring in roots and stems after inoculation with the fungus in two flax varieties. First, we showed that both varieties displayed different cell wall organization and that rapid modifications occurred in roots and stems after inoculation. Then, we demonstrated the efficiency of a Bacillus subtilis strain to limit Fusarium wilt on both varieties with a better efficiency for one of them. Finally, thermo-gravimetry was used to highlight that B. subtilis induced modifications of the stem properties, supporting a reinforcement of the cell walls. Our findings suggest that the efficiency and the mode of action of the PGPR B. subtilis is likely to be flax variety dependent.
