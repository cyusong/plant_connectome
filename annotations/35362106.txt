Seed inoculation with beneficial microorganisms has gained importance as it has been proven to show biostimulant activity in plants, especially in terms of abiotic/biotic stress tolerance and plant growth promotion, representing a sustainable way to ensure yield stability under low input sustainable agriculture. Nevertheless, limited knowledge is available concerning the molecular and physiological processes underlying the root-inoculant symbiosis or plant response at the root system level. Our work aimed to integrate the interrelationship between agronomic traits, rhizosphere microbial population and metabolic processes in roots, following seed treatment with either arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) or Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR). To this aim, maize was grown under open field conditions with either optimal or reduced nitrogen availability. Both seed treatments increased nitrogen uptake efficiency under reduced nitrogen supply revealed some microbial community changes among treatments at root microbiome level and limited yield increases, while significant changes could be observed at metabolome level. Amino acid, lipid, flavone, lignan, and phenylpropanoid concentrations were mostly modulated. Integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets (Multiple Co-Inertia Analysis) highlighted a strong correlation between the metagenomics and the untargeted metabolomics datasets, suggesting a coordinate modulation of root physiological traits.
