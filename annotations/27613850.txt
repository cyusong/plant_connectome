['27613850', 'Small proteins have long been overlooked due to their poor annotation and the  experimental challenges they pose. However, in recent years, their role in  various processes has started to emerge, opening new research avenues. Here, we  present the isolation and characterization of two allelic mutants, twisted  seed1-1 (tws1-1) and tws1-2, which exhibit an array of developmental and  biochemical phenotypes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. We have  identified AT5G01075 as the subtending gene encoding a small protein of 81 amino  acids localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. TWS1 is strongly expressed in  seeds, where it regulates both embryo development and accumulation of storage  compounds. TWS1 loss-of-function seeds exhibit increased starch, sucrose, and  protein accumulation at the detriment of fatty acids. TWS1 is also expressed in  vegetative and reproductive tissues, where it is responsible for proper epidermal  cell morphology and overall plant growth. At the cellular level, TWS1 is  responsible for cuticle deposition on epidermal cells and organization of the  endomembrane system. Finally, we show that TWS1 is a single-copy gene in  Arabidopsis, and it is specifically conserved among angiosperms.', '2016 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.00915', 'ORCID:']
