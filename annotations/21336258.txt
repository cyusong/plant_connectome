['21336258', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that are essential for the  development of plants. A tight control of BR homeostasis is vital for modulating  their impact on growth responses. Although it is recognized that the rapid  adaptation of de novo synthesis has a key role in adjusting required BR levels,  our knowledge of the mechanisms governing feedback control is limited. In this  study, we identify the transcription factor CESTA as a regulator of BR  biosynthesis. ces-D was isolated in a screen of Arabidopsis mutants by BR  over-accumulation phenotypes. Loss-of-function analysis and the use of a dominant  repressor version revealed functional overlap among CESTA and its homologues and  confirmed the role of CESTA in the positive control of BR-biosynthetic gene  expression. We provide evidence that CESTA interacts with its homologue BEE1 and  can directly bind to a G-box motif in the promoter of the BR biosynthesis gene  CPD. Moreover, we show that CESTA subnuclear localization is BR regulated and  discuss a model, in which CESTA interplays with BEE1 to control BR biosynthesis  and other BR responses.', '2011 Mar 16', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2011.35', 'Sieberer']
