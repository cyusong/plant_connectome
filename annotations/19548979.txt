The Arabidopsis gene At2g47770 encodes a membrane-bound protein designated AtTSPO (Arabidopsis thaliana TSPO-related). AtTSPO is related to the bacterial outer membrane tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) and the mammalian mitochondrial 18-kDa translocator protein (18 kDa TSPO), members of the group of TspO/MBR domain-containing membrane proteins. In this study we show that AtTSPO is mainly detected in dry seeds, but can be induced in vegetative tissues by osmotic or salt stress or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, corroborating available transcriptome data. Using subcellular fractionation, immunocytochemistry and fluorescent protein tagging approaches we present evidence that AtTSPO is targeted to the secretory pathway in plants. Induced or constitutively expressed AtTSPO can be detected in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi stacks of plant cells. AtTSPO tagged with fluorescent protein in transgenic plants (Arabidopsis and tobacco) was mainly detected in the Golgi stacks of leaf epidermal cells. Constitutive expression of AtTSPO resulted in increased sensitivity to NaCl, but not to osmotic stress, and in reduced greening of cultured Arabidopsis cells under light growing conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtTSPO were more sensitive to ABA-induced growth inhibition, indicating that constitutive expression of AtTSPO may enhance ABA sensitivity. AtTSPO is rapidly downregulated during seed imbibition, and the ABA-dependent induction in plant is transient. Downregulation of AtTSPO seems to be boosted by treatment with aminolevulinic acid. Taken together, these results suggest that AtTSPO is a highly regulated protein, induced by abiotic stress to modulate, at least in part, transient intracellular ABA-dependent stress perception and/or signalling.
