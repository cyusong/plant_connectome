['20097872', "We identify and functionally characterize MRL1, a conserved nuclear-encoded  regulator of the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate  carboxylase/oxygenase. The nonphotosynthetic mrl1 mutant of Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii lacks ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, and the  resulting block in electron transfer is partially compensated by redirecting  electrons toward molecular oxygen via the Mehler reaction. This allows continued  electron flow and constitutive nonphotochemical quenching, enhancing cell  survival during illumination in spite of photosystem II and photosystem I  photoinhibition. The mrl1 mutant transcribes rbcL normally, but the mRNA is  unstable. The molecular target of MRL1 is the 5 ' untranslated region of rbcL.  MRL1 is located in the chloroplast stroma, in a high molecular mass complex.  Treatment with RNase or deletion of the rbcL gene induces a shift of the complex  toward lower molecular mass fractions. MRL1 is well conserved throughout the  green lineage, much more so than the 10 other pentatricopeptide repeat proteins  found in Chlamydomonas. Depending upon the organism, MRL1 contains 11 to 14  pentatricopeptide repeats followed by a novel MRL1-C domain. In Arabidopsis  thaliana, MRL1 also acts on rbcL and is necessary for the  production/stabilization of the processed transcript, presumably because it acts  as a barrier to 5 ' >3 ' degradation. The Arabidopsis mrl1 mutant retains normal  levels of the primary transcript and full photosynthetic capacity.", '2010 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.066266', 'Vallon']
