Plant GH3 genes play pivotal roles in biotic stress through involving in hormonal homeostasis by conjugation to amino acids of the free-form of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid (JA) or indole-3-acetic acid. We recently showed that rice group I GH3 gene family, with four members, are the functional JA-Ile synthetases and positively mediated rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Here, we further found that these four genes are also positive regulators conferring resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), the devastating bacterial pathogen of rice. The transcript of these four genes were all activated upon Xoc invasion. The overexpressing plants showed less lesion length in comparison with wild type plant accompanying with higher pathogenesis-related genes accumulation, while the triple and quadruple suppressing plants showed susceptible to Xoc with less pathogenesis-related genes accumulation. Previous and present work demonstrate that rice group I GH3 family genes act as positive regulators in the resistance to Xoo and Xoc.
