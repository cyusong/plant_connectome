<i>Helitrons</i>, a novel type of mysterious DNA transposons discovered computationally prior to bench work confirmation, are components ubiquitous in most sequenced genomes of various eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and fungi. There is a paucity of empirical evidence to elucidate the mechanism of <i>Helitrons</i> transposition in plants. Here, by constructing several artificial defective <i>Helitron</i> (<i>dHel</i>) reporter systems, we aim to identify the autonomous <i>Helitrons</i> (<i>aHel</i>) in maize genetically and to demonstrate the transposition and repair mechanisms of <i>Helitrons</i> upon the <i>dHel-GFP</i> excision in maize. When crossing with various inbred lines, several transgenic lines produced progeny of segregated, purple-blotched kernels, resulting from a leaky expression of the <i>C1</i> gene driven by the <i>dHel</i>-interrupted promoter. Transcription analysis indicated that the insertion of different <i>dHels</i> into the <i>C1</i> promoter or exon would lead to multiple distinct mRNA transcripts corresponding to transgenes in the host genome. Simple excision products and circular intermediates of <i>dHel-GFP</i> transposition have been detected from the leaf tissue of the seedlings in F<sub>1</sub> hybrids of transgenic lines with corresponding <i>c1</i> tester, although they failed to be detected in all primary transgenic lines. These results revealed the transposition and repair mechanism of <i>Helitrons</i> in maize. It is strongly suggested that this reporter system can detect the genetic activity of autonomic <i>Helitron</i> at the molecular level. Sequence features of <i>dHel</i> itself, together with the flanking regions, impact the excision activity of <i>dHel</i> and the regulation of the <i>dHel</i> on the transcription level of the host gene.
