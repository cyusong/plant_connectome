Cell division and differentiation of stem cells are controlled by non-cell-autonomous signals in higher organisms. The plant vascular meristem is a stem-cell tissue comprising procambial cells that produce xylem cells on one side and phloem cells on the other side. Recent studies have revealed that TDIF (tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor)/CLE41/CLE44 peptide signal controls the procambial cell fate in a non-cell-autonomous manner. TDIF produced in and secreted from phloem cells is perceived by TDR/PXY, a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase located in the plasma membrane of procambial cells. This signal suppresses xylem cell differentiation of procambial cells and promotes their proliferation. In addition to TDIF, some other CLE peptides play roles in vascular development. Here, we summarize recent advances in CLE signaling governing vascular development.
