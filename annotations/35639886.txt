The sustainable production of crops faces increasing challenges from global climate change and human activities, which leads to increasing instances of many abiotic stressors to plants. Among the abiotic stressors, drought, salinity and excessive levels of toxic metals cause reductions in global agricultural productivity and serious health risks for humans. Cytokinins (CKs) are key phytohormones functioning in both normal development and stress responses in plants. Here, we summarize the molecular mechanisms on the biosynthesis, metabolism, transport and signaling transduction pathways of CKs. CKs act as negative regulators of both root system architecture plasticity and root sodium exclusion in response to salt stress. The functions of CKs in mineral-toxicity tolerance and their detoxification in plants are reviewed. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to trace the origin, evolution and diversification of the critical regulatory networks linking CK signaling and abiotic stress. We found that the production of CKs and their derivatives, pathways of signal transduction and drought-response root growth regulation are evolutionarily conserved in land plants. In addition, the mechanisms of CK-mediated sodium exclusion under salt stress are suggested for further investigations. In summary, we propose that the manipulation of CK levels and their signaling pathways is important for plant abiotic stress and is, therefore, a potential strategy for meeting the increasing demand for global food production under changing climatic conditions.
