Seed oil traits in soybean that are of benefit to human nutrition and health have been selected for during crop domestication. However, these domesticated traits have significant differences across various evolutionary types. In this study, we found that the integration of evolutionary population structure (evolutionary types) with genome-wide association studies increased the power of gene detection, and it identified one locus for traits related to seed size and oil content on chromosome 13. This domestication locus, together with another one in a 200-kb region, was confirmed by the GEMMA and EMMAX software. The candidate gene, GmPDAT, had higher expressional levels in high-oil and large-seed accessions than in low-oil and small-seed accessions. Overexpression lines had increased seed size and oil content, whereas RNAi lines had decreased seed size and oil content. The molecular mechanism of GmPDAT was deduced based on results from linkage analysis for triacylglycerols and on histocytological comparisons of transgenic soybean seeds. Our results illustrate a new approach for identifying domestication genes with pleiotropic effects.
