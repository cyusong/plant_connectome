['22461611', "Transcription termination is emerging as an important component of gene  regulation necessary to partition the genome and minimize transcriptional  interference. We have discovered a role for the Arabidopsis RNA silencing enzyme  DICER-LIKE 4 (DCL4) in transcription termination of an endogenous Arabidopsis  gene, FCA. DCL4 directly associates with FCA chromatin in the 3' region and  promotes cleavage of the nascent transcript in a domain downstream of the  canonical polyA site. In a dcl4 mutant, the resulting transcriptional  read-through triggers an RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of a transgene  containing the same 3' region. We conclude that DCL4 promotes transcription  termination of the Arabidopsis FCA gene, reducing the amount of aberrant RNA  produced from the locus.", '2012 Mar 30', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1214402', 'Dean']
