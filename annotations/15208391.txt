['15208391', 'Ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated protein degradation controls various developmental  pathways in eukaryotes. Cullin-containing complexes are both versatile and  abundant groups of RING family ubiquitin E3 ligases, whose activities are subject  to control by RUB/Nedd8 (for related to ubiquitin/neural precursor cell-expressed  developmentally downregulated 8) modification of their cullin subunits. Here, we  report the identification of an Arabidopsis thaliana counterpart of human CAND1  (cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated) and demonstrate that it can  preferentially interact with unmodified CUL1. The Arabidopsis cand1-1 null mutant  displays distinct phenotypes, including late flowering, aerial rosettes, floral  organ defects, low fertility, dwarfism, loss of apical dominance, and altered  responses to multiple plant hormones. Molecular analyses show that many of these  defects are because of compromised activity of CUL1-containing ubiquitin E3  ligases, indicating that CAND1 is required for their optimal activity.  Furthermore, the cand1-1 mutant displays a partial constitutive photomorphogenic  phenotype and has defects in HY5 degradation in the absence of light, a process  mediated by a different RING family E3, COP1. Thus, our data provides genetic  support for a critical role of CAND1 in regulating various ubiquitin E3 ligases  and their targeted cellular and developmental pathways.', '2004 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.021949', 'Deng']
