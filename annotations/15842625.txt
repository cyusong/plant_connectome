Harpin from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (HrpZ) elicits a rapid cell death response in tobacco plants. Multiple signaling components, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and salicylic acid (SA), have been reported to be involved in this cell death process, but the interaction between these molecules is poorly understood. Here we show through utilizing plants manipulated in SIPK expression levels that lack of SIPK results in increased sensitivity to harpin with concomitant accumulation of higher levels of ROS. Conversely, SIPK-overexpressing plants show reduced sensitivity to harpin relative to wild-type plants, and display reduced ROS accumulation. Harpin-induced cell death was found to be conditional on the ability of the plant to accumulate SA, whereas harpin induction of MAPK activation and ROS accumulation are not. However, harpin-induced ROS accumulation is required for activation of SIPK and wound-induced protein kinase. Transcriptional profiling revealed that suppression of SIPK signaling also affects early expression of a range of pathogen- and stress-responsive genes during harpin challenge.
