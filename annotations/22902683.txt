Plant tropisms are decisively influenced by dynamic adjustments in spatiotemporal distribution of the growth regulators auxin. Polar auxin transport requires activity of PIN-type auxin carrier proteins, with their distribution at the plasma membrane significantly contributing to the directionality of auxin flow. Control of PIN protein distribution involves regulation of their endocytosis and further sorting into the lytic vacuole for degradation and recently, protein ubiquitylation has been demonstrated to control degradative sorting of plasma membrane proteins in plants. ( 1) (-) ( 6) Here we show dynamic adjustments in PIN2 ubiquitylation in gravity-stimulated roots, a response that coincides with establishment of a lateral PIN2 expression gradient. Our results imply that perception and transduction of gravity signals triggers differential ubiquitylation of PIN2, which might feed back on the coordination of auxin distribution in root meristems.
