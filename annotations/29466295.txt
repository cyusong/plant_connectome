<i>Tetranychus urticae</i> (<i>T. urticae</i>) Koch is a cosmopolitan, polyphagous mite which causes economic losses in both agricultural and ornamental plants. Some traits of <i>T. urticae</i> hamper its management, including a short life cycle, arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, its haplodiploid sex determination system, and its extraordinary ability to adapt to different hosts and environmental conditions. Currently, the use of chemical and biological control are the major control methods used against this mite. In recent years, some studies have focused on plant defence mechanisms against herbivores. Various families of plant compounds (such as flavonoids, glucosinolates, or acyl sugars) have been shown to behave as acaricides. Plants can be induced upon appropriate stimuli to increase their resistance against spider mites. This knowledge, together with the understanding of mechanisms by which <i>T. urticae</i> detoxifies and adapts to pesticides, may complement the control of this pest. Herein, we describe plant volatile compounds (VOCs) with repellent activity, and new findings about defence priming against spider mites, which interfere with the <i>T. urticae</i> performance. The use of VOCs and defence priming can be integrated into current management practices and reduce the damage caused by <i>T. urticae</i> in the field by implementing new, more sustainable crop management tools.
