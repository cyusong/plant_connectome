Potassium (K(+)) is one of the essential nutrient elements for plant growth and development. Plants absorb K(+) ions from the environment via root cell K(+) channels and/or transporters. In this study, the Shaker K(+) channel Os-AKT1 was characterized for its function in K(+) uptake in rice (Oryza sativa) roots, and its regulation by Os-CBL1 (Calcineurin B-Like protein1) and Os-CIPK23 (CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase23) was investigated. As an inward K(+) channel, Os-AKT1 could carry out K(+) uptake and rescue the low-K(+)-sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana akt1 mutant plants. Rice Os-akt1 mutant plants showed decreased K(+) uptake and displayed an obvious low-K(+)-sensitive phenotype. Disruption of Os-AKT1 significantly reduced the K(+) content, which resulted in inhibition of plant growth and development. Similar to the AKT1 regulation in Arabidopsis, Os-CBL1 and Os-CIPK23 were identified as the upstream regulators of Os-AKT1 in rice. The Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex could enhance Os-AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake. A phenotype test confirmed that Os-CIPK23 RNAi lines exhibited similar K(+)-deficient symptoms as the Os-akt1 mutant under low K(+) conditions. These findings demonstrate that Os-AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake in rice roots is modulated by the Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex.
