['18363787', 'The photoperiod pathway is a genetically conserved pathway that affects flowering  in distantly related angiosperms. Here we report a novel flowering promoter  AGAMOUS-LIKE 17 (AGL17) acting in the photoperiod pathway of Arabidopsis. AGL17  transcripts were detectable in various plant organs with the highest expression  in the root. Under long-day conditions, expression of AGL17 gradually increased  in the aerial part of seedlings during the floral transition. Overexpression of  AGL17 caused early flowering, while loss of function of AGL17 exhibited late  flowering, particularly under long days. Analysis of AGL17 expression in various  flowering-time mutants showed that its transcripts were significantly reduced in  the photoperiod pathway mutant co-1. Correspondingly, AGL17 expression was  upregulated in transgenic plants overexpressing CONSTANS (CO) and also when CO  activity was induced by light. Genetic analysis further showed that  overexpression of AGL17 could partially suppress the late flowering of co-1.  These results suggest that AGL17 acts to promote flowering and is positively  controlled by the photoperiod pathway regulator CO. In contrast, another target  of CO, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), did not affect AGL17 expression, and vice versa.  The expression of two floral meristem identity genes LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1  (AP1) decreased in agl17-1, while LFY and AP1 could be rapidly induced by AGL17  using a functional estradiol-inducible system. These findings indicate that AGL17  ultimately promotes flowering via regulation of LFY and AP1.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03499.x', 'Yu']
