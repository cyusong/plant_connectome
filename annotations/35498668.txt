['35498668', 'The pollen intine layer is necessary for male fertility in flowering plants.  However, the mechanisms behind the developmental regulation of intine formation  still remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a positive regulator,  Arabidopsis novel microgametophyte defective mutant 1 (AtNMDM1), which influences  male fertility by regulating intine formation. The AtNMDM1, encoding a pollen  nuclei-localized protein, was highly expressed in the pollens at the late anther  stages, 10-12. Both the mutations and the knock-down of AtNMDM1 resulted in  pollen defects and significantly lowered the seed-setting rates. Genetic  transmission analysis indicated that AtNMDM1 is a microgametophyte lethal gene.  Calcofluor white staining revealed that abnormal cellulose distribution was  present in the aborted pollen. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the abnormal  intine rather than the exine led to pollen abortion. We further found, using  transcriptome analysis, that cell wall modification was the most highly enriched  gene ontology (GO) term used in the category of biological processes. Notably,  two categories of genes, Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) and pectin  methylesterases (PMEs) were greatly reduced, which were associated with pollen  intine formation. In addition, we also identified another regulator, AtNMDM2,  which interacted with AtNMDM1 in the pollen nuclei. Taken together, we identified  a novel regulator, AtNMDM1 that affected cellulose distribution in the intine by  regulating intine-related gene expression; furthermore, these results provide  insights into the molecular mechanisms of pollen intine development.', '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.814870', 'Lu']
