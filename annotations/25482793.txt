High light acclimation implicates mechanisms on various molecular levels and time scales. The recently identified small transcription factor network of APETALA 2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factors is triggered upon transfer of Arabidopsis to high light and depends on metabolite export and mitogen activated protein kinase activation. An experimental design was developed consisting of a low light to high light and back to low light illumination. This allowed the determination of the time point of no return post high light transfer which activates transcription of the AP2/ERF network. Within 10 seconds of high light treatment transcript levels of ERF6, ERF104, ERF105 and RRTF were triggered to increase from low to high levels within the next 10 minutes witnessing an ultrafast retrograde pathway with a very early time point of no return. This response differed profoundly from other high light-responsive transcripts such as stromal ascorbate peroxidase (sAPX) which accumulated in a dose-dependent manner or COR47.
