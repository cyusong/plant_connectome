['26063506', 'In this study of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), we investigated the  relationship between FOREVER YOUNG FLOWER (FYF) and Ethylene Response DNA-binding  Factors (EDFs) and functionally analyzed a key FYF target, an Ethylene-Responsive  Factor (ERF), that controls flower senescence/abscission. Ectopic expression of  EDF1/2/3/4 caused promotion of flower senescence/abscission and the activation of  the senescence-associated genes. The presence of a repressor domain in EDFs and  the enhancement of the promotion of senescence/abscission in EDF1/2/3/4+SRDX  (converting EDFs to strong repressors by fusion with the ERF-associated  amphiphilic repression motif repression domain SRDX) transgenic plants suggested  that EDFs act as repressors. The significant reduction of beta-glucuronidase (GUS)  expression by 35S:FYF in EDF1/2/3/4:GUS plants indicates that EDF1/2/3/4  functions downstream of FYF in regulating flower senescence/abscission. In this  study, we also characterized an ERF gene, FOREVER YOUNG FLOWER UP-REGULATING  FACTOR1 (FUF1), which is up-regulated by FYF during flower development. Ectopic  expression of FUF1 caused similar delayed flower senescence/abscission as seen in  35S:FYF plants. This phenotype was correlated with deficient abscission zone  formation, ethylene insensitivity, and down-regulation of EDF1/2/3/4 and  abscission-associated genes in 35S:FUF1 flowers. In contrast, significant  promotion of flower senescence/abscission and up-regulation of EDF1/2/3/4 were  observed in 35S:FUF1+SRDX transgenic dominant-negative plants, in which FUF1 is  converted to a potent repressor by fusion to an SRDX-suppressing motif. Thus,  FUF1 acts as an activator in suppressing EDF1/2/3/4 function and  senescence/abscission of the flowers. Our results reveal that FYF regulates  flower senescence/abscission by negatively regulating EDF1/2/3/4, which is the  downstream gene in the ethylene response, by activating FUF1 in Arabidopsis.', '2015 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.00433', 'Yang']
