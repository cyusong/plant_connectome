['16751345', 'In plants, many gene transcripts are very unstable, which is important for the  tight control of their temporal and spatial expression patterns. To identify  cellular factors controlling the stability of unstable mRNAs in plants, we used  luciferase imaging in Arabidopsis thaliana to isolate a recessive mutant,  stabilized1-1 (sta1-1), with enhanced stability of the normally unstable  luciferase transcript. The sta1-1 mutation also causes the stabilization of some  endogenous gene transcripts and has a range of developmental and stress response  phenotypes. STA1 encodes a nuclear protein similar to the human U5 small  ribonucleoprotein-associated 102-kD protein and to the yeast pre-mRNA splicing  factors Prp1p and Prp6p. STA1 expression is upregulated by cold stress, and the  sta1-1 mutant is defective in the splicing of the cold-induced COR15A gene. Our  results show that STA1 is a pre-mRNA splicing factor required not only for  splicing but also for the turnover of unstable transcripts and that it has an  important role in plant responses to abiotic stresses.', '2006 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.042184', 'Zhu']
