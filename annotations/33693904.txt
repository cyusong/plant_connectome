In Arabidopsis thaliana, two genes encode the E2 subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (2-OGDH), a multimeric complex composed of three subunits. To functionally characterize the isoforms of E2 subunit, we isolated Arabidopsis mutant lines for each gene encoding the E2 subunit and performed a detailed molecular and physiological characterization of the plants under controlled growth conditions. The functional lack of expression of E2 subunit isoforms of 2-OGDH increased plant growth, reduced dark respiration and altered carbohydrate metabolism without changes in the photosynthetic rate. Interestingly, plants from e2-ogdh lines also exhibited reduced seed weight without alterations in total seed number. We additionally observed that downregulation of 2-OGDH activity led to minor changes in the levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates without clear correlation with the reduced expression of specific E2-OGDH isoforms. Furthermore, the e2-ogdh mutant lines exhibited a reduction by up to 25% in the leaf total amino acids without consistent changes in the amino acid profile. Taken together, our results indicate that the two isoforms of E2 subunit play a similar role in carbon-nitrogen metabolism, in plant growth and in seed weight.
