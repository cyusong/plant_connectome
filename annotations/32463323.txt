L. is a typical euhalophyte and is widely distributed throughout the world. Suaeda plants are important halophyte resources, and the physiological and biochemical characteristics of their various organsand their response to salt stress have been intensively studied. Leaf succulence, intracellular ion localization, increased osmotic regulation and enhanced antioxidant capacities are important responses for Suaeda plants to adapt to salt stress. Among these responses, scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important mechanism for plants to withstand oxidative stress and improve salt tolerance. The generation and scavenging pathways of ROS, as well as the expression of scavenging enzymes change under salt stress. This article reviews the antioxidant system constitute of <i>S. salsa</i>, and the mechanisms by which <i>S. salsa</i>antioxidant capacity is improved for salt tolerance. In addition, the differences between types of antioxidant mechanisms in <i>S. salsa</i>are reviewed, thereby revealing the adaptation mechanisms of Suaeda to different habitats. The review provides important clues for the comprehensive understanding of the salt tolerance mechanisms of halophytes.
