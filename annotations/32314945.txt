<i>Trichoderma</i> species are widely used to control fungal and nematode diseases of crops. To date, only one complete <i>Trichoderma</i> genome has been sequenced, <i>T. reesei</i> QM6a, a model fungus for industrial enzyme production, while the species or strains used for biological control of plant diseases are only available as draft genomes. Previously, we demonstrated that two <i>Trichoderma</i> strains (<i>T. afroharzianum</i> and <i>T. cyanodichotomus</i>) provide effective control of nematode and fungal plant pathogens. Based on deep sequencing using Illumina and Pacbio platforms, we have assembled high-quality genomes of the above two strains, with contig N<sub>50</sub> reaching 4.2 and 1.7 Mbp, respectively, which is greater than those of published draft genomes. The genome data will provide a resource to assist research on the biological control mechanisms of <i>Trichoderma</i> spp.
