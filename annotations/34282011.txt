['34282011', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a major role in abiotic stress  responses in plants, and subclass III SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2)  kinases mediate ABA signaling. In this study, we identified Raf36, a group C  Raf-like protein kinase in Arabidopsis, as a protein that interacts with multiple  SnRK2s. A series of reverse genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that 1)  Raf36 negatively regulates ABA responses during postgermination growth, 2) the N  terminus of Raf36 is directly phosphorylated by SnRK2s, and 3) Raf36 degradation  is enhanced in response to ABA. In addition, Raf22, another C-type Raf-like  kinase, functions partially redundantly with Raf36 to regulate ABA responses. A  comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of ABA-induced responses of wild-type and  raf22raf36-1 plants identified proteins that are phosphorylated downstream of  Raf36 and Raf22 in planta. Together, these results support a model in which  Raf36/Raf22 function mainly under optimal conditions to suppress ABA responses,  whereas in response to ABA, the SnRK2 module promotes Raf36 degradation as a  means of alleviating Raf36-dependent inhibition and allowing for heightened ABA  signaling to occur.', '2021 Jul 27', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2100073118', 'ORCID:']
