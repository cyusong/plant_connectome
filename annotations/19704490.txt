The mitochondrion has a central role during programmed cell death (PCD) in animals, acting as both a sensor of death signals, and as an initiator of the biochemical processes which lead to the controlled destruction of the cell. In contrast to our extensive knowledge of animal cell death, the part played by mitochondria in the death of plant cells has received relatively little attention. Using a combination of whole-organism and cell-based models, we recently demonstrated that changes in mitochondrial morphology are an early and crucial step in plant cell death. Here, we discuss these findings in the light of recent literature, and how they relate to our knowledge of plant cell death as a whole.
