Strains of <i>Erwinia tracheiphila,</i> causal agent of bacterial wilt of cucurbits, are divided into distinct clades. <i>Et-melo</i> clade strains wilt <i>Cucumis</i> spp. but not <i>Cucurbita</i> spp., thus exhibiting host specificity, whereas <i>Et-C1</i> clade strains wilt <i>Cucurbita</i> spp. more rapidly than <i>Cucumis melo</i>, thus exhibiting a host preference. This study investigated the contribution of the effector proteins Eop1 and DspE to <i>E. tracheiphila</i> pathogenicity and host adaptation. Loss of <i>eop1</i> did not enable <i>Et-melo</i> strains to infect squash (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i>) or an <i>Et-C1</i> strain to induce a more rapid wilt of muskmelon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>), indicating that Eop1 did not function in host specificity or preference as in the related pathogen <i>E. amylovora.</i> However, overexpression of <i>eop1</i> from <i>Et-melo</i> strain MDCuke but not from <i>Et-C1</i> strain BHKY increased the virulence of a BHKY <i>eop1</i> deletion mutant on muskmelon, demonstrating that the Eop1 variants in the two clades are distinct in their virulence functions. Loss of <i>dspE</i> from <i>Et-melo</i> strains reduced but did not eliminate virulence on hosts muskmelon and cucumber, whereas loss of <i>dspE</i> from an <i>Et-C1</i> strain eliminated pathogenicity on hosts squash, muskmelon, and cucumber. Thus, the centrality of DspE to virulence differs in the two clades. <i>Et-melo</i> mutants lacking the chaperone DspF exhibited similar virulence to mutants lacking DspE, indicating that DspF is the sole chaperone for DspE in <i>E. tracheiphila</i>, unlike in <i>E. amylovora</i>. Collectively, these results provide the first functional evaluation of effectors in <i>E. tracheiphila</i> and demonstrate clade-specific differences in the roles of Eop1 and DspE.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
