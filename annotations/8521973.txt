['8521973', 'An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA (AtGSHS) encoding a protein with high primary  sequence identity to cDNAs previously isolated from Xenopus laevis (42%),  Schizosaccharomyces pombe (40%), Rattus norvegicus (40%) and Homo sapiens (37%)  encoding glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3) has been isolated by functional  complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in this enzyme. AtGSHS is  encoded by a single gene, GSHB, as determined by Southern blot analysis and the  corresponding mRNA is abundant in both roots and leaves of Arabidopsis.', '1995 Nov 27', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/0014-5793(95)01253-1', 'May']
