['26203119', 'Enzymatic side reactions can give rise to the formation of wasteful and toxic  products that are removed by metabolite repair pathways. In this work, we  identify and characterize a mitochondrial metabolic repair mechanism in  Arabidopsis thaliana involving malate dehydrogenase (mMDH) and  l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (l-2HGDH). We analyze the kinetic properties  of both A. thaliana mMDH isoforms, and show that they produce  l-2-hydroxyglutarate (l-2HG) from 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) at low rates in side  reactions. We identify A. thaliana l-2HGDH as a mitochondrial FAD-containing  oxidase that converts l-2HG back to 2-KG. Using loss-of-function mutants, we show  that the electrons produced in the l-2HGDH reaction are transferred to the  mitochondrial electron transport chain through the electron transfer protein  (ETF). Thus, plants possess the biochemical components of an l-2HG metabolic  repair system identical to that found in mammals. While deficiencies in the  metabolism of l-2HG result in fatal disorders in mammals, accumulation of l-2HG  in plants does not adversely affect their development under a range of tested  conditions. However, orthologs of l-2HGDH are found in all examined genomes of  viridiplantae, indicating that the repair reaction we identified makes an  essential contribution to plant fitness in as yet unidentified conditions in the  wild.', '2015 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcv108', 'Maurino']
