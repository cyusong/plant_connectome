In many eukaryotes, translation initiation is regulated by proteins that bind to the mRNA cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). These proteins commonly prevent association of eIF4E with eIF4G or form repressive messenger ribonucleoproteins that exclude the translation machinery. Such gene-regulatory mechanisms in plants, and even the presence of eIF4E-interacting proteins other than eIF4G (and the plant-specific isoform eIFiso4G, which binds eIFiso4E), are unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein, conserved binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1). We found that CBE1 has an evolutionarily conserved eIF4E-binding motif in its N-terminal domain and binds eIF4E or eIFiso4E <i>in vitro</i> CBE1 thereby forms cap-binding complexes and is an eIF4E-dependent constituent of these complexes <i>in vivo</i> Of note, plant mutants lacking CBE1 exhibited dysregulation of cell cycle-related transcripts and accumulated higher levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mitosis than did WT plants. Our findings indicate that CBE1 is a plant protein that can form mRNA cap-binding complexes having the potential for regulating gene expression. Because mammalian translation factors are known regulators of cell cycle progression, we propose that CBE1 may represent such first translation factor-associated plant-specific cell cycle regulator.
