['31092096', 'Plants possess the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes  cohesin, condensin, and SMC5/6, which function in fundamental biological  processes such as sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome condensation and  segregation, and damaged DNA repair. Recently, increasing evidence in several  organisms has suggested that condensin is involved in chromatin organizations  during interphase. In Arabidopsis thaliana, condensin II is localized in the  nucleus throughout interphase and is suggested to be required for keeping  centromeres apart and the assembly of euchromatic chromosome arms. However, it  remains unclear how condensin II organizes chromatin associations. Here, we first  showed the high possibility that the function of condensin II as a complex is  required for the disassociation of centromeres. Analysis of the rDNA array  distribution revealed that condensin II is also indispensable for the association  of centromeres with rDNA arrays. Reduced axial compaction of chromosomes and  impaired genome integrity in condensin II mutants are not related to the  disruption of chromatin organization. In contrast, the axial compaction of  chromosomes by condensin II produces the force leading to the disassociation of  heterologous centromeres in Drosophila melanogaster. Taken together, our data  imply that the condensin II function in chromatin organization differs among  eukaryotes.', '2019 Dec', 'Nucleus', '10.1080/19491034.2019.1616507', 'ORCID:']
