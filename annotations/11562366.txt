['11562366', 'Ca(2+) levels in plants, fungi, and bacteria are controlled in part by  H(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers; however, the relationship between primary sequence and  biological activity of these transporters has not been reported. The Arabidopsis  H(+)/cation exchangers, CAX1 and CAX2, were identified by their ability to  suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca(2+) transport. CAX1 has a much  higher capacity for Ca(2+) transport than CAX2. An Arabidopsis thaliana homolog  of CAX1, CAX3, is 77% identical (93% similar) and, when expressed in yeast,  localized to the vacuole but did not suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar  Ca(2+) transport. Chimeric constructs and site-directed mutagenesis showed that  CAX3 could suppress yeast vacuolar Ca(2+) transport mutants if a nine-amino acid  region of CAX1 was inserted into CAX3 (CAX3-9). Biochemical analysis in yeast  showed CAX3-9 had 36% of the H(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activity as compared with CAX1;  however, CAX3-9 and CAX1 appear to differ in their transport of other ions.  Exchanging the nine-amino acid region of CAX1 into CAX2 doubled yeast vacuolar  Ca(2+) transport but did not appear to alter the transport of other ions. This  nine-amino acid region is highly variable among the plant CAX-like transporters.  These findings suggest that this region is involved in CAX-mediated Ca(2+)  specificity.', '2001 Nov 16', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M106637200', 'Hirschi']
