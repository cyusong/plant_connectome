Previously, we reported that the allelic <i>de-etiolated by zinc (dez)</i> and <i>trichome birefringence</i> (<i>tbr</i>) mutants exhibit photomorphogenic development in the dark, which is enhanced by high Zn. TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE proteins had been implicated in transferring acetyl groups to various hemicelluloses. Pectin <i>O</i>-acetylation levels were lower in dark-grown <i>dez</i> seedlings than in the wild type. We observed Zn-enhanced photomorphogenesis in the dark also in the <i>reduced wall acetylation 2</i> (<i>rwa2-3</i>) mutant, which exhibits lowered <i>O</i>-acetylation levels of cell wall macromolecules including pectins and xyloglucans, supporting a role for cell wall macromolecule <i>O</i>-acetylation in the photomorphogenic phenotypes of <i>rwa2-3</i> and <i>dez</i>. Application of very short oligogalacturonides (vsOGs) restored skotomorphogenesis in dark-grown <i>dez</i> and <i>rwa2-3</i>. Here we demonstrate that in <i>dez, O</i>-acetylation of non-pectin cell wall components, notably of xyloglucan, is enhanced. Our results highlight the complexity of cell wall homeostasis and indicate against an influence of xyloglucan <i>O</i>-acetylation on light-dependent seedling development.
