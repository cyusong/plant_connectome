Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the expression of genes at the transcriptional level. Modification of TF activity dynamically alters the transcriptome, which leads to metabolic and phenotypic changes. Thus, functional analysis of TFs using 'omics-based' methodologies is one of the most important areas of the post-genome era. In this mini-review, we present an overview of Arabidopsis TFs and introduce strategies for the functional analysis of plant TFs, which include both traditional and recently developed technologies. These strategies can be assigned to five categories: bioinformatic analysis; analysis of molecular function; expression analysis; phenotype analysis; and network analysis for the description of entire transcriptional regulatory networks.

Transcription factors: !regulate! gene expression
Bioinformatic analysis: !identifies! TFs 
Molecular function: !analyzes! TFs 
Expression analysis: !examines! transcriptome 
Phenotype analysis: !investigates! metabolic and phenotypic changes 
Network analysis: !describes! transcriptional regulatory networks
