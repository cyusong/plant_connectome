Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and its core endocytic machinery are evolutionarily conserved across all eukaryotes. In mammals, the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) sorts plasma membrane (PM) cargoes into vesicles via the recognition of motifs based on Tyr or di-Leu in their cytoplasmic tails. However, in plants, very little is known about how PM proteins are sorted for CME and whether similar motifs are required. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BR INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) undergoes endocytosis, which depends on clathrin and AP-2. Here, we demonstrate that BRI1 binds directly to the medium AP-2 subunit (AP2M). The cytoplasmic domain of BRI1 contains five putative canonical surface-exposed Tyr-based endocytic motifs. The Tyr-to-Phe substitution in Y<sub>898</sub>KAI reduced BRI1 internalization without affecting its kinase activity. Consistently, plants carrying the BRI1<sup>Y898F</sup> mutation were hypersensitive to BRs. Our study demonstrates that AP-2-dependent internalization of PM proteins via the recognition of functional Tyr motifs also operates in plants.
