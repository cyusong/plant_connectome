['16313235', 'Two sPPases (soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases, EC 3.6.1.1) have been isolated  from the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Both are monomeric proteins of  organellar localization, the chloroplastic sPPase I [Cr (Ch. reinhardtii)-sPPase  I, 30 kDa] is a major isoform and slightly larger protein than the mitochondrial  sPPase II (Cr-sPPase II, 24 kDa). They are members of sPPase family I and are  encoded by two different cDNAs, as demonstrated by peptide mass fingerprint  analysis. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that Cr-sPPase I is closely  related to other eukaryotic sPPases, whereas Cr-sPPase II resembles its  prokaryotic counterparts. Chloroplastic sPPase I may have replaced a  cyanobacterial ancestor very early during plastid evolution. Cr-sPPase II  orthologues are found in members of the green photosynthetic lineage, but not in  animals or fungi. These two sPPases from photosynthetic eukaryotes are novel  monomeric family I sPPases with different molecular phylogenies and cellular  localizations.', '2006 Apr 1', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20051657', 'Serrano']
