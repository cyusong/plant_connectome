Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potent signal molecules rapidly generated in response to stress. Detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns induces a transient apoplastic ROS through the function of the NADPH respiratory burst oxidase homologs D (RbohD). However, little is known about the regulation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-elicited ROS or its role in plant immunity. We investigated ROS production triggered by bacterial flagellin (flg22) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The oxidative burst was diminished in ethylene-insensitive mutants. Flagellin Sensitive2 (FLS2) accumulation was reduced in etr1 and ein2, indicating a requirement of ethylene signaling for FLS2 expression. Multiplication of virulent bacteria was enhanced in Arabidopsis lines displaying altered ROS production at early but not late stages of infection, suggesting an impairment of preinvasive immunity. Stomatal closure, a mechanism used to reduce bacterial entry into plant tissues, was abolished in etr1, ein2, and rbohD mutants. These results point to the importance of flg22-triggered ROS at an early stage of the plant immune response.
