The evolution of hummingbird pollination is common across angiosperms throughout the Americas, presenting an opportunity to examine convergence in both traits and environments to better understand how complex phenotypes arise. Here we examine independent shifts from bee to hummingbird pollination in the Neotropical spiral gingers (Costus) and address common explanations for the prevalence of transitions from bee to hummingbird pollination. We use floral traits of species with observed pollinators to predict pollinators of unobserved species and reconstruct ancestral pollination states on a well-resolved phylogeny. We examine whether independent transitions evolve towards the same phenotypic optimum and whether shifts to hummingbird pollination correlate with elevation or climate. Traits predicting hummingbird pollination include small flower size, brightly colored floral bracts and the absence of nectar guides. We find many shifts to hummingbird pollination and no reversals, a single shared phenotypic optimum across hummingbird flowers, and no association between pollination and elevation or climate. Evolutionary shifts to hummingbird pollination in Costus are highly convergent and directional, involve a surprising set of traits when compared with other plants with analogous transitions and refute the generality of several common explanations for the prevalence of transitions from bee to hummingbird pollination.
