Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) produced by pokeweed plants is a single-chain (type I) ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) that depurinates ribosomes at the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop of the large rRNA, resulting in inhibition of translation. Unlike the type II RIPs, which have an active and a binding moiety, PAP has only the active moiety. The mechanism by which toxins without a binding moiety gain access to cytosolic ribosomes is not known. We set up yeast as a simple and genetically tractable system to investigate how PAP accesses ribosomes and showed that the mature form of PAP is targeted to the cytosol from the endomembrane system in yeast. In the present study, we performed a systematic deletion analysis to identify the signal required for transport of PAP to the cytosol. We demonstrate here that processing of the C-terminal extension and sequences at the C-terminus of the mature protein are critical for its accumulation in the cytosol. Using a series of PAP mutants, we identified the C-terminal signal and demonstrated that it is distinct from the sequences required for ribosome depurination and cytotoxicity. The C-terminal motif showed sequence similarity to type II RIPs that retrotranslocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol. These results demonstrate that a conserved sequence at the C-terminus of a type I RIP mediates its transport to the cytosol and suggest that type I and II RIPs may use a common signal to enter the cytosol.
