Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the staple food for almost half of the world's population, prefers ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>) as the major nitrogen resource, and while NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> has profound effects on rice growth and yields, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroidal hormones playing key roles in plant growth and development. In this study, we show that NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> promotes BR biosynthesis through miR444 to regulate rice root growth. miR444 targeted five homologous MADS-box transcription repressors potentially forming homologous or heterogeneous complexes in rice. miR444 positively regulated BR biosynthesis through its MADS-box targets, which directly repress the transcription of <i>BR-deficient dwarf 1</i> (<i>OsBRD1</i>), a key BR biosynthetic gene. NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> induced the miR444-OsBRD1 signaling cascade in roots, thereby increasing the amount of BRs, whose biosynthesis and signaling were required for NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> <b>-</b>dependent root elongation inhibition. Consistently, miR444-overexpressing rice roots were hypersensitive to NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> depending on BR biosynthesis, and overexpression of miR444's target, <i>OsMADS57</i>, resulted in rice hyposensitivity to NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> in root elongation, which was associated with a reduction of BR content. In summary, our findings reveal a cross talk mechanism between NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and BR in which NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> activates miR444-OsBRD1, an undescribed BR biosynthesis-promoting signaling cascade, to increase BR content, inhibiting root elongation in rice.
