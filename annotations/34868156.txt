Kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia eriantha</i>) is a peculiar berry resource in China, and the maturation period is generally late. Fortunately, we found an early mature <i>A. eriantha</i> germplasm. In order to explore the formation mechanism of its early mature trait, we determined the main carbohydrate and endogenous hormone content of the fruit, and used off-target metabolomics and transcriptomics to identify key regulatory metabolites and genes. We found that early mature germplasm had faster starch conversion rate and higher sucrose, glucose, and fructose content when harvested, while with lower auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and zeatin (ZR) content. Through the non-targeted metabolome, 19 and 20 metabolites closely related to fruit maturity and early maturity were identified, respectively. At the same time, weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed that these metabolites were regulated by 73 and 99 genes, respectively, especially genes related to sugar metabolism were mostly. Based on above, the formation of early mature trait of <i>A. eriantha</i> was mainly due to the sucrose decomposition rate was reduced and the soluble solid content (SSC) accumulated at low levels of endogenous hormones, so as to reach the harvest standard earlier than the late mature germplasm. Finally, ten single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were developed which can be used for the identification of early mature trait of <i>A. eriantha</i>.
