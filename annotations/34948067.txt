The toxicity of aluminum (Al) in acidic soil limits global crop yield. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-like gene superfamily has functions and structures related to transportation, so it responds to aluminum stress in plants. In this study, one half-size ABC transporter gene was isolated from wild soybeans (<i>Glycine soja</i>) and designated <i>GsABCI1</i>. By real-time qPCR, <i>GsABCI1</i> was identified as not specifically expressed in tissues. Phenotype identification of the overexpressed transgenic lines showed increased tolerance to aluminum. Furthermore, <i>GsABCI1</i> transgenic plants exhibited some resistance to aluminum treatment by ion translocation or changing root components. This work on the <i>GsABCI1</i> identified the molecular function, which provided useful information for understanding the gene function of the ABC family and the development of new aluminum-tolerant soybean germplasm.
