The role of Ca(2+) in the induction of enzymes involved in fructan synthesis (FSS) mediated by sucrose was studied in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Increase of FSS enzyme activity and induction of the expression of their coding genes by sucrose were inhibited in leaf blades treated with chelating agents (EDTA, EGTA and BAPTA). Ca(2+) channel blockers (lanthanum chloride and ruthenium red) also inhibited the FSS response to sucrose, suggesting the participation of Ca(2+) from both extra- and intra- cellular stores. Sucrose induced a rapid Ca(2+) influx into the cytosol in wheat leaf and root tissues, shown with the Ca(2+ )sensitive fluorescent probe Fluo-3/AM ester. Our results support the hypothesis that calcium is a component of the sucrose signaling pathway that leads to the induction of fructan synthesis.
