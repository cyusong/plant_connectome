In flowering plants, gravity perception appears to involve the sedimentation of starch-filled plastids, called amyloplasts, within specialized cells (the statocytes) of shoots (endodermal cells) and roots (columella cells). Unfortunately, how the physical information derived from amyloplast sedimentation is converted into a biochemical signal that promotes organ gravitropic curvature remains largely unknown. Recent results suggest an involvement of the Translocon of the Outer Envelope of (Chloro)plastids (TOC) in early phases of gravity signal transduction within the statocytes. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern gravity signal transduction in flowering plants and summarizes models that attempt to explain the contribution of TOC proteins in this important behavioral plant growth response to its mechanical environment.
