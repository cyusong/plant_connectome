['27535792', 'Chloroplast development requires the coordinated expressions of nuclear and  chloroplast genomes, and both anterograde and retrograde signals exist and work  together to facilitate this coordination. We have utilized the Arabidopsis yellow  variegated (var2) mutant as a tool to dissect the genetic regulatory network of  chloroplast development. Here, we report the isolation of a new (to our  knowledge) var2 genetic suppressor locus, SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION9 (SVR9). SVR9  encodes a chloroplast-localized prokaryotic type translation initiation factor 3  (IF3). svr9-1 mutant can be fully rescued by the Escherichia coli IF3 infC,  suggesting that SVR9 functions as a bona fide IF3 in the chloroplast. Genetic and  molecular evidence indicate that SVR9 and its close homolog SVR9-LIKE1 (SVR9L1)  are functionally interchangeable and their combined activities are essential for  chloroplast development and plant survival. Interestingly, we found that SVR9 and  SVR9L1 are also involved in normal leaf development. Abnormalities in leaf  anatomy, cotyledon venation patterns, and leaf margin development were identified  in svr9-1 and mutants that are homozygous for svr9-1 and heterozygous for  svr9l1-1 (svr9-1 svr9l1-1/+). Meanwhile, as indicated by the auxin response  reporter DR5:GUS, auxin homeostasis was disturbed in svr9-1, svr9-1 svr9l1-1/+,  and plants treated with inhibitors of chloroplast translation. Genetic analysis  established that SVR9/SVR9L1-mediated leaf margin development is dependent on  CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 activities and is independent of their roles in chloroplast  development. Together, our findings provide direct evidence that chloroplast IF3s  are essential for chloroplast development and can also regulate leaf development.', '2016 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.02040', 'ORCID:']
