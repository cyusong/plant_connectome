Shoot branching is one of the important agronomic traits affecting yields and quality of tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Cytokinins (CTKs) play critical roles in regulating shoot branching. However, whether and how differently alternative splicing (AS) variant of CTKs-related genes can influence shoot branching of tea plant is still not fully elucidated. In this study, five AS variants of CTK biosynthetic gene adenylate isopentenyltransferase (CsA-IPT5) with different 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) and 5' UTR from tea plant were cloned and investigated for their regulatory effects. Transient expression assays showed that there were significant negative correlations between CsA-IPT5 protein expression, mRNA expression of CsA-IPT5 AS variants and the number of ATTTA motifs, respectively. Shoot branching processes induced by exogenous 6-BA or pruning were studied, where CsA-IPT5 was demonstrated to regulate protein synthesis of CsA-IPT5, as well as the biosynthesis of trans-zeatin (tZ)- and isopentenyladenine (iP)-CTKs, through transcriptionally changing ratios of its five AS variants in these processes. Furthermore, the 3' UTR AS variant 2 (3AS2) might act as the predominant AS transcript. Together, our results indicate that 3AS2 of the CsA-IPT5 gene is potential in regulating shoot branching of tea plant and provides a gene resource for improving the plant-type of woody plants.
