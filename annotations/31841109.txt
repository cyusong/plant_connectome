Insect herbivores are frequently reported to metabolize plant defense compounds, but the physiological and ecological consequences are not fully understood. It has rarely been studied whether such metabolism is genuinely beneficial to the insect, and whether there are any effects on higher trophic levels. Here, we manipulated the detoxification of plant defenses in the herbivorous pest diamondback moth (<i>Plutella xylostella</i>) to evaluate changes in fitness, and additionally examined the effects on a predatory lacewing (<i>Chrysoperla carnea</i>). Silencing glucosinolate sulfatase genes resulted in the systemic accumulation of toxic isothiocyanates in <i>P. xylostella</i> larvae, impairing larval development and adult reproduction. The predatory lacewing <i>C. carnea</i>, however, efficiently degraded ingested isothiocyanates via a general conjugation pathway, with no negative effects on survival, reproduction, or even prey preference. These results illustrate how plant defenses and their detoxification strongly influence herbivore fitness but might only subtly affect a third trophic level.
