Evaluation of nitrogen (N) status by leaf color is a kind of classic nutritional diagnostic method. However, the color of leaves is influenced not only by N, but also by other nutrients such as potassium (K). Two-year field trials with a factorial combination of N and K were conducted to investigate the effects of different N and K rates on soil plant analysis development (SPAD) readings and leaf N, K, magnesium (Mg), and chlorophyll concentrations. Visual inspections in leaf greenness revealed darker green leaves with increasing N rates, while paler green leaves with increasing K rates. Data showed that SPAD readings, chlorophyll, N and Mg concentrations, and the chloroplast area increased significantly with raising N rates, while declined sharply with the increase in K rates due to the antagonistic relationships between K<sup>+</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> as well as Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It was also probable that the increase in K promoted the growth of leaves and diluted their N and Mg concentrations. The paler leaf appearance resulting from the application of K may overestimate the actual demand for N in the diagnosis of rice N status. The strong antagonistic relationships between K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> should be considered in rice production and fertilization.
