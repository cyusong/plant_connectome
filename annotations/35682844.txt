As sessile organisms, plants are constantly exposed to a variety of environmental stresses and have evolved adaptive mechanisms, including transcriptional reprogramming, in order to survive or acclimate under adverse conditions. Over the past several decades, a large number of gene-specific transcription factors have been identified in the transcriptional regulation of plant adaptive responses. The Mediator complex plays a key role in transducing signals from gene-specific transcription factors to the transcription machinery to activate or repress target gene expression. Since its first purification about 15 years ago, plant Mediator complex has been extensively analyzed for its composition and biological functions. Mutants of many plant Mediator subunits are not lethal but are compromised in growth, development and response to biotic and abiotic stress, underscoring a particularly important role in plant adaptive responses. Plant Mediator subunits also interact with partners other than transcription factors and components of the transcription machinery, indicating the complexity of the regulation of gene expression by plant Mediator complex. Here, we present a comprehensive discussion of recent analyses of the structure and function of plant Mediator complex, with a particular focus on its roles in plant adaptive responses to a wide spectrum of environmental stresses and associated biological processes.
