Copper and iron proteins have a wide range of functions in living organisms. Metal assembly into metalloproteins is a complex process, where mismetalation is detrimental and energy consuming to cells. Under metal deficiency, metal distribution is expected to reach a metalation ranking, prioritizing essential versus dispensable metalloproteins, while avoiding interference with other metals and protecting metal-sensitive processes. In this review, we propose that post-transcriptional modulators of metalloprotein mRNA (ModMeR) are good candidates in metal prioritization under metal-limited conditions. ModMeR target high quota or redundant metalloproteins and, by adjusting their synthesis, ModMeR act as internal metal distribution valves. Inappropriate metalation of ModMeR targets could compete with metal delivery to essential metalloproteins and interfere with metal-sensitive processes, such as chloroplastic photosynthesis and mitochondrial respiration. Regulation of ModMeR targets could increase or decrease the metal flow through interconnected pathways in cellular metal distribution, helping to achieve adequate differential metal requirements. Here, we describe and compare ModMeR that function in response to copper and iron deficiencies. Specifically, we describe copper-miRNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana and diverse iron ModMeR from yeast, mammals, and bacteria under copper and iron deficiencies, as well as the influence of oxidative stress. Putative functions derived from their role as ModMeR are also discussed.
