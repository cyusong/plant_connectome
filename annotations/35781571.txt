Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinase crucial for coordinating growth according to nutrient availability in eukaryotes. It works as a central integrator of multiple nutrient inputs such as sugar, nitrogen, and phosphate and promotes growth and biomass accumulation in response to nutrient sufficiency. Studies, especially in the past decade, have identified the central role of TORC1 in regulating growth through interaction with hormones, photoreceptors, and stress signaling machinery in plants. In this review, we comprehensively analyse the interactome and phosphoproteome of the Arabidopsis TORC1 signaling network. Our analysis highlights the role of TORC1 as a central hub kinase communicating with the transcriptional and translational apparatus, ribosomes, chaperones, protein kinases, metabolic enzymes, and autophagy and stress response machinery to orchestrate growth in response to nutrient signals. This analysis also suggests that along with the conserved downstream components shared with other eukaryotic lineages, plant TORC1 signaling underwent several evolutionary innovations and co-opted many lineage-specific components during. Based on the protein-protein interaction and phosphoproteome data, we also discuss several uncharacterized and unexplored components of the TORC1 signaling network, highlighting potential links for future studies.
