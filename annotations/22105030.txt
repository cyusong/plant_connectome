Trichomes are specialized structures that develop from epidermal cells in the aerial parts of plants, and are an excellent model system to study all aspects of cell differentiation including cell fate determination, cell cycle regulation, cell polarity and cell expansion. The development of the trichome is a process of integration of both external signals and endogenous developmental programs. During recent years, molecular analysis of trichome development at different stages has been well studied, and through the mutant phenotypes and the function of corresponding genes, the underlying mechanism has been revealed in a first glimpse. This paper offers a mini-view on this integration process with emphasis on the effects of plant hormone signaling on trichome development in plants through GLABROUS INFLORESCENCE STEMS (GIS) family and subfamily genes.
