['17496120', 'The plant circadian clock is required for daily anticipation of the diurnal  environment. Mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) affects  free-running circadian rhythms. To investigate how TIC functions within the  circadian system, we introduced markers for the evening and morning phases of the  clock into tic and measured evident rhythms. The phases of evening clock genes in  tic were all advanced under light/dark cycles without major expression level  defects. With regard to morning-acting genes, we unexpectedly found that TIC has  a closer relationship with LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) than with CIRCADIAN  CLOCK ASSOCIATED1, as tic has a specific LHY expression level defect. Epistasis  analysis demonstrated that there were no clear rhythms in double mutants of tic  and evening-acting clock genes, although double mutants of tic and morning-acting  genes exhibited a similar free-running period as tic. We isolated TIC and found  that its mRNA expression is continuously present over the diurnal cycle, and the  encoded protein appears to be strictly localized to the nucleus. Neither its  abundance nor its cellular distribution was found to be clock regulated. We  suggest that TIC encodes a nucleus-acting clock regulator working close to the  central oscillator.', '2007 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047241', 'Davis']
