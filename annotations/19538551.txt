In recent years, oxylipins (lipoxygenase-derived oxygenated fatty acid products) have been reported in several bloom-forming marine diatoms. Despite increasing attention on the ecophysiological role of these molecules in marine environments, their biosynthesis is largely unknown in these microalgae. Biochemical methods, including tandem mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and radioactive probes were used to identify structures, enzymatic activities and growth-dependent modulation of oxylipin biosynthesis in the pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima. Three major compounds, 15S-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E,17Z)-eicosapentaenoic acid (15S-HEPE), 15-oxo-5Z,9E,11E,13E-pentadecatetraenoic acid and 13,14-threo-13R-hydroxy-14S,15S-trans-epoxyeicosa-5Z,8Z,11Z,17Z-tetraenoic acid (13,14-HEpETE), were produced by three putative biochemical pathways triggered by eicosapentaenoic acid-dependent 15S lipoxygenase. Oxylipin production increases along the growth curve, with remarkable changes that precede the demise of the culture. At least one of the compounds, namely 15-oxoacid, is formed only in the stationary phase immediately before the collapse of the culture. Synthesis and regulation of phyco-oxylipins seem to correspond to a signaling mechanism that governs adaptation of diatoms along the growth curve until bloom termination. Factors triggering the process are unknown but synthesis of 15-oxoacid, constrained within a time-window of a few days just before the collapse of the culture, implies the involvement of a physiological control not directly dependent on distress or death of diatom cells.
