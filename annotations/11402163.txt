['11402163', 'The Arabidopsis cell wall-associated receptor-like kinase (WAK) gene family  contains five highly related members whose products are suited for exchanging  signals between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. WAK members are  expressed in specific organs and regulated differentially by various biotic and  abiotic factors. To gain further insight into how WAKs function during  development, we used a glucocorticoid-inducible system to express ectopically the  WAK4 antisense gene. The induced expression of the WAK4 antisense gene resulted  in a significant decrease of WAK proteins. Ninety-six hours after the induction  of WAK4 antisense expression, WAK proteins became undetectable. Cell elongation  was impaired, and lateral root development was blocked. The level of WAK protein  could be controlled by the concentration of the applied inducer, dexamethasone,  and was correlated with the severity of the cell elongation inhibition phenotype.  These results suggest that the WAKs serve a vital role in cell elongation and are  required for plant development.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.6.1317', 'He']
