Flowering plants produce multicellular gametophytes through an elaborate regulation of gametogenesis. During female and male gametogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, sporogenous cells differentiate and undergo meiosis to produce megaspores and microspores, which in turn go through mitosis to develop into multicellular gametophytes. Here we report that the Arabidopsis spliceosomal protein, SPLICEOSOME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 130 (AtSAP130), is required for proper reproduction. AtSAP130 is encoded by two genes, AtSAP130a and AtSAP130b. Plants with reduced expression of the AtSAP130 genes, induced by RNA interference, showed a defect in fertilization. Besides functional impairment observed in the female reproductive organs, analysis focusing on pollen development revealed defects in the transition from the microspore to the bicellular stage. Our results suggest that AtSAP130a and AtSAP130b play an indispensable role in specific spatiotemporal events in reproduction.
