The mitochondrion is deemed to be one of the most important organelles, and plays an essential role in various biological processes. Nonetheless, the role of mitochondria in response to abiotic stress remains unclear. Here, we report that accumulation of the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) protein ORFH79 in the vegetative tissues resulted in the dysfunction of mitochondria with decreased enzymatic activities of respiratory chain complexes, reduced ATP content and even a morphological change of the mitochondria. However, the suppression of orfH79 by overexpressing a fertility restorer gene Rf5, which is targeted to mitochondria and induced an endonucleolytic cleavage on the atp6-orfH79 transcripts, could recover the function of mitochondria and further significantly improved the tolerance to drought and salt stress. The above evidence suggests that the mitochondrion plays a pivotal role in tolerance to drought and salt stress in rice.
