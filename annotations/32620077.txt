Aquatic Euryale ferox Salisb. is an economically important crop in China and India. Unfortunately, low yield limitations seriously hinder market growth. Unveiling the control of seed size is of remarkable importance in improvement of crops. Here, we generated a new hybrid line (HL) with larger seeds by crossing South Gordon Euryale and North Gordon Euryale (WT) which hasn't been reported before. However, the functional genes and molecular mechanisms controlling the seed size in Euryale ferox Salisb. remain unclear. In this study, we focused on the differentially expressed genes in the auxin signal transduction pathway during fruit development between HL and WT to explore candidate regulatory genes participated in regulating seed size. Both concentration and localization of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at two growth stages of fruits of WT and HL were detected by LC-MS and immunofluorescence. Although IAA content between the two lines did not differ, IAA distribution was significantly different. To elucidate the mechanism and to seek the key genes underlying this difference, RNA-seq was performed on young fruits at the two selected growth stages, and differentially expressed genes related to the auxin transduction pathway were selected for further analysis. Hybrid Euryale ferox Salisb. expressed significant heterosis, resulting in non-prickly, thin-coated, large seeds, which accounted for the significantly larger yield of HL than that of WT. Our study indicated that Small Auxin Up RNAs (SAURs) -mediated localization of IAA regulates seed size in Euryale ferox Salisb. We found that some SAURs may act as a positive mediator of the auxin transduction pathway, thereby contributing to the observed heterosis.
