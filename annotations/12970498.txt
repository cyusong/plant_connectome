['12970498', 'Highly conserved mismatch repair (MMR) systems promote genomic stability by  correcting DNA replication errors, antagonizing homeologous recombination, and  responding to various DNA lesions. Arabidopsis and other plants encode a suite of  MMR protein orthologs, including MSH2, the constant component of various  specialized eukaryotic mismatch recognition heterodimers. To study MMR roles in  plant genomic stability, we used Arabidopsis AtMSH2::TDNA mutant SALK_002708 and  AtMSH2 RNA-interference (RNAi) lines. AtMSH2::TDNA and RNAi lines show normal  growth, development, and fertility. To analyze AtMSH2 effects on germ line DNA  fidelity, we measured insertion-deletion mutation of dinucleotide-repeat  sequences (microsatellite instability) at nine loci in 16 or more progeny of two  to four different wild-type or AtMSH2-deficient plants. Scoring 992 total alleles  revealed 23 (2.3%) unique and 51 (5.1%) total repeat length shifts ([+2], [-2],  [+4], or [-4] bp). For the six longest repeat loci, the corresponding frequencies  were 22/608 and 50/608. Two of four AtMSH2-RNAi plants showed similar  microsatellite instability. In wild-type progeny, only one unique repeat length  allele was found in 576 alleles tested. This endogenous microsatellite  instability, shown for the first time in MMR-defective plants, is similar to that  seen in MMR-defective yeast and mice, indicating that plants also use MMR to  promote germ line fidelity. We used a frameshifted reporter transgene, (G)(7)GUS,  to measure insertion-deletion reversion as blue-staining  beta-glucuronidase-positive leaf spots. Reversion rates increased only 5-fold in  AtMSH2::TDNA plants, considerably less than increases in MSH2-deficient yeast or  mammalian cells for similar mononucleotide repeats. Thus, MMR-dependent error  correction may be less stringent in differentiated leaf cells than in plant  equivalents of germ line tissue.', '2003 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.023952', 'Hays']
