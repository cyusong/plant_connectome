CONSTANS (CO) and CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) transcription factors have been known to regulate a series of cellular processes including the transition from the vegetative growth to flower development in plants. However, their role in regulating fruit yield in tomato is poorly understood. In this study, the tomato ortholog of Arabidopsis CONSTANS, SlCOL1, was shown to play key roles in the control of flower development and fruit yield. Suppression of SlCOL1 expression in tomato was found to lead to promotion of flower and fruit development, resulting in increased tomato fruit yield. On the contrary, overexpression of SlCOL1 disturbed flower and fruit development, and significantly reduced tomato fruit yield. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that SlCOL1 controls inflorescence development by directly binding to the promoter region of tomato inflorescence-associated gene SINGLE-FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) and negatively regulating its expression. Additionally, we found that SlCOL1 can also negatively regulate fruit size in tomato. Tomato SlCOL1 binds to the promoter of the SFT gene, down-regulates its expression, and plays a key role in reducing the fruit size.
