Systematics reconstructs tempo and mode in biological evolution by resolving the phylogenetic fabric of biodiversity. The staggering duration and complexity of evolution, coupled with loss of information (extinction), render exhaustive reconstruction of the evolutionary history of life unattainable. Instead, we sample its products-phenotypes and genotypes-to generate phylogenetic hypotheses, which we sequentially reassess and update against new data. Current consensus in evolutionary biology emphasizes fossil integration in total-evidence analyses, requiring in-depth understanding of fossils-age, phenotypes, and systematic affinities-and a detailed morphological framework uniting fossil and extant taxa. Bryophytes present a special case: deep evolutionary history but sparse fossil record and phenotypic diversity encompassing small dimensional scales. We review how these peculiarities shape fossil inclusion in bryophyte systematics. Paucity of the bryophyte fossil record, driven primarily by phenotypic (small plant size) and ecological constraints (patchy substrate-hugging populations), and incomplete exploration, results in many morphologically isolated, taxonomically ambiguous fossil taxa. Nevertheless, instances of exquisite preservation and pioneering studies demonstrate the feasibility of including bryophyte fossils in evolutionary inference. Further progress will arise from developing extensive morphological matrices for bryophytes, continued exploration of the fossil record, re-evaluation of previously described fossils, and training specialists in identification and characterization of bryophyte fossils, and in bryophyte morphology.
