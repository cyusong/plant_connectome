['11302841', 'The suspensor is a specialized basal structure that differentiates early in plant  embryogenesis to support development of the embryo proper. Suspensor  differentiation in Arabidopsis is maintained in part by the TWIN1 (TWN1) gene,  which suppresses embryogenic development in suspensor cells: twn1 mutants produce  supernumerary embryos via suspensor transformation. To better understand  mechanisms of suspensor development and further investigate the function of TWN1,  we have characterized late-embryo and post-embryonic development in the twn1  mutant, using seedling culture, microscopy, and genetics. We report here that the  twn1 mutation disrupts cotyledon number, arrangement, and morphology and  occasionally causes partial conversion of cotyledons into leaves. These defects  are not a consequence of suspensor transformation. Thus, in addition to its basal  role in suspensor differentiation, TWN1 influences apical pattern and morphology  in the embryo proper. To determine whether other genes can similarly affect both  suspensor and cotyledon development, we looked for twinning in Arabidopsis  mutants previously identified by their abnormal cotyledon phenotypes. One such  mutant, amp1, produced a low frequency of twin embryos by suspensor  transformation. Our results suggest that mechanisms that maintain suspensor  identity also function later in development to influence organ formation at the  embryonic shoot apex. We propose that TWN1 functions in cell communication  pathways that convey local positional information in both the apical and basal  regions of the Arabidopsis embryo.', '2001 Apr', 'Am J Bot', '88/4/570', 'Forsthoefel']
