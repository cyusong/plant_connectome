The <i>Xanthomonas</i> genus, comprises more than 30 species of gram-negative bacteria, most of which are pathogens of plants with high economic value, such as rice, common bean, and maize. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), which act by regulating the host gene expression, are some of the major virulence factors of these bacteria. We present a novel tool to identify TALE genes in the genome of <i>Xanthomonas</i> strains and their respective targets. The analysis of the results obtained by TargeTALE in a proof-of-concept validation demonstrate that, at optimum setting, approximately 93% of the predicted target genes with available expression data were confirmed as upregulated during the infection, indicating that the tool might be useful for researchers in the field.

TALEs: !regulate! host gene expression
TargeTALE: !identifies! TALE genes
TargeTALE: !predicts! target genes
target genes: !upregulated! during infection
