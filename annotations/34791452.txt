Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) primary and lateral roots (LRs) are well suited for 3D and 4D microscopy, and their development provides an ideal system for studying morphogenesis and cell proliferation dynamics. With fast-advancing microscopy techniques used for live-imaging, whole tissue data are increasingly available, yet present the great challenge of analyzing complex interactions within cell populations. We developed a plugin "Live Plant Cell Tracking" (LiPlaCeT) coupled to the publicly available ImageJ image analysis program and generated a pipeline that allows, with the aid of LiPlaCeT, 4D cell tracking and lineage analysis of populations of dividing and growing cells. The LiPlaCeT plugin contains ad hoc ergonomic curating tools, making it very simple to use for manual cell tracking, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio of images is low or variable in time or 3D space and when automated methods may fail. Performing time-lapse experiments and using cell-tracking data extracted with the assistance of LiPlaCeT, we accomplished deep analyses of cell proliferation and clonal relations in the whole developing LR primordia and constructed genealogical trees. We also used cell-tracking data for endodermis cells of the root apical meristem (RAM) and performed automated analyses of cell population dynamics using ParaView software (also publicly available). Using the RAM as an example, we also showed how LiPlaCeT can be used to generate information at the whole-tissue level regarding cell length, cell position, cell growth rate, cell displacement rate, and proliferation activity. The pipeline will be useful in live-imaging studies of roots and other plant organs to understand complex interactions within proliferating and growing cell populations. The plugin includes a step-by-step user manual and a dataset example that are available at https://www.ibt.unam.mx/documentos/diversos/LiPlaCeT.zip.
