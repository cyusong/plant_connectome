Deltasatellites are small noncoding DNA satellites associated with begomoviruses. The study presented here has investigated the biology of two deltasatellites found in wild malvaceous plants in the New World (NW). Infectious clones of two NW deltasatellites (from Malvastrum coromandelianum and Sidastrum micranthum) and associated begomoviruses were constructed. Infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and their natural malvaceous hosts was assessed. The NW deltasatellites were not able to spread autonomously in planta, whereas they were maintained by the associated bipartite begomovirus. Furthermore, NW deltasatellites were transreplicated by a monopartite NW begomovirus, tomato leaf deformation virus. However, they were not maintained by begomoviruses from the Old World (tomato yellow leaf curl virus, tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus and African cassava mosaic virus) or a curtovirus (beet curly top virus). NW deltasatellites did not affect the symptoms induced by the helper viruses but in some cases reduced their accumulation. Moreover, one NW deltasatellite was shown to be transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, the vector of its helper begomoviruses. These results confirm that these molecules are true satellites. The availability of infectious clones and the observation that NW deltasatellites reduced virus accumulation paves the way for further studies of the effect on their helper begomoviruses.
