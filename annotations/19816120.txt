In order to understand more details about the role of abscisic acid (ABA) in fruit ripening and senescence, six 740 bp cDNAs (LeNCED1, LeNCED2, PpNCED1, VVNCED1, DKNCED1 and CMNCED1) which encode 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) as a key enzyme in ABA biosynthesis, were cloned from fruits of tomato, peach, grape, persimmon and melon using an RT-PCR approach. A Blast homology search revealed a similarity of amino acid 85.76% between the NCEDs. A relationship between ABA and ethylene during ripening was also investigated. At the mature green stage, exogenous ABA treatment increased ABA content in flesh, and promoting ethylene synthesis and fruit ripening, while treatment with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), inhibited them, delayed fruit ripening and softening. However, ABA inhibited the ethylene synthesis obviously while NDGA promoted them when treated the immature fruit with these chemicals. At the breaker, NDGA treatment cannot block ABA accumulation and ethylene synthesis. Based on the results obtained in this study, it was concluded that ABA plays different role in ethylene synthesis system in different stages of tomato fruit ripening.
