As a major component of plant secondary cell walls, lignin provides structural integrity and rigidity, and contributes to primary defense by providing a physical barrier to pathogen ingress. Genetic modification of lignin biosynthesis has been adopted to reduce the recalcitrance of lignified cell walls to improve biofuel production, tree pulping properties and forage digestibility. However, lignin-modification is often, but unpredictably, associated with dwarf phenotypes. Hypotheses suggested to explain this include: collapsed vessels leading to defects in water and solute transport; accumulation of molecule(s) that are inhibitory to plant growth or deficiency of metabolites that are critical for plant growth; activation of defense pathways linked to cell wall integrity sensing. However, there is still no commonly accepted underlying mechanism for the growth defects. Here, we discuss recent data on transcriptional reprogramming in plants with modified lignin content and their corresponding suppressor mutants, and evaluate growth-defense trade-offs as a factor underlying the growth phenotypes. New approaches will be necessary to estimate how gross changes in transcriptional reprogramming may quantitatively affect growth. Better understanding of the basis for yield drag following cell wall engineering is important for the biotechnological exploitation of plants as factories for fuels and chemicals.
