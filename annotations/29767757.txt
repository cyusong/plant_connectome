Calcium (Ca2+) is among the most important intracellular messengers in living organisms. Understanding of the players and dynamics of Ca2+ signalling pathways in plants may help to unravel the molecular basis of their exceptional flexibility to respond and to adapt to different stimuli. In the present review we focus on new tools that have recently revolutionized our view of organellar Ca2+ signalling as well as on the current knowledge regarding the pathways mediating Ca2+ fluxes across intracellular membranes. The contribution of organelles and cellular subcompartments to the orchestrated response via Ca2+ signalling within a cell is also discussed, underlining the fact that one of the greatest challenges in the field is the elucidation of how influx and efflux Ca2+ transporters/channels are regulated in a concerted manner to translate specific information into a Ca2+ signature.
