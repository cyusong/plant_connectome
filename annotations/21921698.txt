The majority of understanding of root gravity responses comes from the study of primary roots, even though lateral roots make a far greater contribution to root system architecture. The focus of this report is the analysis of gravitropic responses in lateral roots of wild-type background and pgm-1 mutants. Despite the significant reduction in gravitropic response of primary roots of pgm-1 mutants, the lateral roots of this mutant demonstrate wild-type rates of gravitropism, suggesting a significant difference in gravity signal transduction between primary and lateral roots.

pgm-1 mutant: !reduces! gravitropic response of primary roots
lateral roots: !demonstrate! wild-type rates of gravitropism
primary roots: !differ from! lateral roots in gravity signal transduction
