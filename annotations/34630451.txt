The Salt-Overly-Sensitive (SOS) pathway controls the net uptake of sodium by roots and the xylematic transfer to shoots in vascular plants. SOS3/CBL4 is a core component of the SOS pathway that senses calcium signaling of salinity stress to activate and recruit the protein kinase SOS2/CIPK24 to the plasma membrane to trigger sodium efflux by the Na/H exchanger SOS1/NHX7. However, despite the well-established function of SOS3 at the plasma membrane, SOS3 displays a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution whose physiological meaning is not understood. Here, we show that the N-terminal part of SOS3 encodes structural information for dual acylation with myristic and palmitic fatty acids, each of which commands a different location and function of SOS3. <i>N</i>-myristoylation at glycine-2 is essential for plasma membrane association and recruiting SOS2 to activate SOS1, whereas <i>S</i>-acylation at cysteine-3 redirects SOS3 toward the nucleus. Moreover, a poly-lysine track in positions 7-11 that is unique to SOS3 among other <i>Arabidopsis</i> CBLs appears to be essential for the correct positioning of the SOS2-SOS3 complex at the plasma membrane for the activation of SOS1. The nuclear-localized SOS3 protein had limited bearing on the salt tolerance of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. These results are evidence of a novel <i>S</i>-acylation dependent nuclear trafficking mechanism that contrasts with alternative subcellular targeting of other CBLs by <i>S</i>-acylation.
