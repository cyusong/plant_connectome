Flowering plants consist of highly differentiated organs, including roots, leaves, shoots and flowers, which have specific roles: root system for water and nutrient uptake, leaves for photosynthesis and gas exchange and reproductive organs for seed production. The communication between organs through the vascular system, by which water, nutrient and signaling molecules are transported, is essential for coordinated growth and development of the whole plant, particularly under adverse conditions. Here, we highlight recent progress in understanding how signaling pathways of plant hormones are associated with long-distance stress and developmental signals, with particular focus on environmental stress responses. In addition to the root-to-shoot peptide signal that induces abscisic acid accumulation in leaves under drought stress conditions, we summarize the diverse stress-responsive peptide signals reported to date to play a role in environmental responses.
