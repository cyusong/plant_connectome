Combined nitrogen (N) sources are known to strongly affect initiation, development and functioning of Nitrogen-Fixing-Nodules whose formation is triggered by lipochitin-oligosaccharide signals secreted in the rhizospere by the Rhizobium partner. The rapid effects of N supply on nodule initiation have been mainly described when N sources are present at the moment of Rhizobium inoculation or purified Nod Factors addition. We recently reported that high ammonium nitrate growth conditions might also strongly affect the nodulation competence of Lotus japonicus plants, prior to the Rhizobium inoculation. This is a long-term effect, which suggests a change of the general nutritional status as the signal controlling the reduced nodulation capacities. The mechanisms underlying these inhibitory pathways are apparently different and the identification of the molecular actors involved may provide new insights into the linkage between N environmental changes and root organogenesis programs.
