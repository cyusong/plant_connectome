The ratio of Red to Far Red light (R:FR) is sensed by phytochromes, including phytochrome B, and serves as a signal of potential competition. Low R:FR represses Arabidopsis thaliana branching by promoting the accumulation of abscisic acid in the young buds and by enhancing auxin signaling in the main shoot. While overall plant level branching is reduced by low R:FR, the growth of the uppermost branches tends to be promoted while the lower buds are suppressed. Buds at intermediate positions can show either growth promotion or growth suppression by low R:FR if they become exposed to low R:FR late or early, respectively. This pattern suggests that developmental stage specific programming occurs to modify the response of specific buds to branching regulators including auxin and ABA.
