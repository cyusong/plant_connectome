['18368500', 'Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an abundant and highly conserved molecular  chaperone. In Arabidopsis, the Hsp90 gene family consists of seven members. Here,  we report that the AtHsp90-6 gene gives rise to two mRNA populations, termed  AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S due to alternative initiation of transcription. The  AtHsp90-6L and AtHsp90-6S transcription start sites are located 228 nucleotides  upstream and 124 nucleotides downstream of the annotated translation start site,  respectively. Both transcripts are detected under normal or heat-shock  conditions. The inducibility of AtHsp90-6 mRNAs by heat shock implies a potential  role of both isoforms in stress management. Stable transformation experiments  with fusion constructs between the N-terminal part of each AtHsp90-6 isoform and  green fluorescent protein indicated import of both fusion proteins into  mitochondria. In planta investigation confirmed that fusion of the AtHsp90-5  N-terminus to green fluorescent protein (GFP) did result in specific  chloroplastic localization. The mechanisms of regulation for mitochondria- and  plastid-localized chaperone-encoding genes are not well understood. Future work  is needed to address the possible roles of harsh environmental conditions and  developmental processes on fine-tuning and compartmentalization of the  AtHsp90-6L, AtHsp90-6S, and AtHsp90-5 proteins in Arabidopsis.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9322-8', 'Hatzopoulos']
