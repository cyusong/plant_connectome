<i>Bacillus</i> can help plants to acquire nutrients either directly or indirectly. However, the role of <i>Bacillus</i> community on the competitive growth of invasive <i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i> is poorly understood. Native <i>Setaria viridis</i> is often found in areas that have been invaded by <i>A. artemisiifolia</i>. We sought to determine whether the quantitative and/or qualitative differences in the <i>Bacillus</i> community present on the invasive <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> and native <i>S.viridis</i> provide a competitive advantage to the invasive over native species. A field experiment was established to imitate the invasion of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i>. The 16S rRNA gene was commercially sequenced to identify the bacilli isolated from the rhizosphere soil of field-grown <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> and <i>S. viridis</i>. The <i>Bacillus</i> communities in their rhizosphere were compared, and their effects on the competitive growth of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> and <i>S. viridis</i> were tested in the pot experiments. <i>Bacillus</i> in the rhizosphere soil of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> significantly enhanced its intra-specific competitive ability. The relative abundance of <i>B. megaterium</i> in the rhizosphere soil of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> was significantly higher than that of <i>S. viridis</i>. Inoculation with <i>B. megaterium</i> that was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of both <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> and <i>S. viridis</i> significantly enhanced the relative competitiveness of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> and inhibited that of <i>S. viridis</i>. The higher abundance of <i>B. megaterium</i> in the rhizosphere of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> creates higher levels of available nutrients than that in the native <i>S. viridis</i>, which enhance the competitive growth of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i>. The result helps to discover the mechanism of <i>Bacillus</i> community in the invasion of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i>.
