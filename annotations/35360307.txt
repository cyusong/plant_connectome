Orchids highly rely on mycorrhizal fungi for seed germination, and compatible fungi could effectively promote germination up to seedlings, while incompatible fungi may stimulate germination but do not support subsequent seedling development. In this study, we compared the fungal colonization process among two compatible and two incompatible fungi during seed germination of <i>Dendrobium officinale.</i> The two compatible fungi, i.e., <i>Tulasnella</i> SSCDO-5 and Sebacinales LQ, originally from different habitats, could persistently colonize seeds and form a large number of pelotons continuously in the basal cells, and both fungi promoted seed germination up to seedling with relative effectiveness. In contrast, the two incompatible fungi, i.e., <i>Tulasnella</i> FDd1 and <i>Tulasnella</i> AgP-1, could not persistently colonize seeds. No pelotons in the FDd1 treatment and only a few pelotons in the AgP-1 treatment were observed; moreover, no seedlings were developed at 120 days after incubation in either incompatible fungal treatment. The pattern of fungal hyphae colonizing seeds was well-matched with the morphological differentiation of seed germination and seedling development. In the fungal cocultural experiments, for both orchids of <i>D. officinale</i> and <i>Dendrobium devonianum</i>, cocultures had slightly negative effects on seed germination, protocorm formation, and seedling formation compared with the monocultures with compatible fungus. These results provide us with a better understanding of orchid mycorrhizal interactions; therefore, for orchid conservation based on symbiotic seed germination, it is recommended that a single, compatible, and ecological/habitat-specific fungus can be utilized for seed germination.
