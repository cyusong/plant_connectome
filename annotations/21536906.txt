['21536906', 'Development in plants is controlled by abiotic environmental cues such as day  length, light quality, temperature, drought, and salinity. These signals are  sensed by a variety of systems and transmitted by different signal transduction  pathways. Ultimately, these pathways are integrated to control expression of  specific target genes, which encode proteins that regulate development and  differentiation. The molecular mechanisms for such integration have remained  elusive. We here show that a linear 130-amino-acids-long sequence in the Med25  subunit of the Arabidopsis thaliana Mediator is a common target for the drought  response element binding protein 2A, zinc finger homeodomain 1, and Myb-like  transcription factors which are involved in different stress response pathways.  In addition, our results show that Med25 together with drought response element  binding protein 2A also function in repression of PhyB-mediated light signaling  and thus integrate signals from different regulatory pathways.', '2011 May 17', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1002981108', 'Bjorklund']
