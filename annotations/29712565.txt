Following publication of the original article [1], a reader spotted that the article appears to have some misplaced/duplicated figures. In particular, Fig. 5a and Fig. 6a appear to be identical, and do not match what is written in the text. The authors apologized for this oversight and supplied the original pictures, which are reproduced below.
