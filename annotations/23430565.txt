['23430565', 'Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that is intimately associated with regulation  of synaptic transmission in the cholinergic nervous system and in neuromuscular  junctions of animals. However the presence of cholinesterase activity has been  described also in non-metazoan organisms such as slime molds, fungi and plants.  More recently, a gene purportedly encoding for acetylcholinesterase was cloned  from maize. We have cloned the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the Zea mays gene,  At3g26430, and studied its biochemical properties. Our results indicate that the  protein encoded by the gene exhibited lipase activity with preference to long  chain substrates but did not hydrolyze choline esters. The At3g26430 protein  belongs to the SGNH clan of serine hydrolases, and more specifically to the  GDS(L) lipase family.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-013-0021-8', 'Mor']
