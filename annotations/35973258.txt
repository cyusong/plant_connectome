Tip growth of the pollen tube is a model system for the study of cell polarity establishment in flowering plants. The tip growth of the pollen tube displays an oscillating pattern corresponding to cellular ion and pH dynamics. Therefore, cellular pH and ions play an important role in pollen growth and development. In this review, we summarized the current advances in understanding the function of cellular pH and ions in regulating pollen tube growth. We analyzed the physiological roles and underlying mechanisms of cellular pH and ions, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>, in regulating pollen tube growth. We further examined the function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in regulating cytoskeletons, small G proteins, and cell wall development in relation to pollen tube growth. We also examined the regulatory roles of cellular pH in pollen tube growth as well as pH regulation of ion flow, cell wall development, auxin signaling, and cytoskeleton function in pollen. In addition, we assessed the regulation of pollen tube growth by proton pumps and the maintenance of pH homeostasis in the trans-Golgi network by ion transporters. The interplay of ion homeostasis and pH dynamics was also assessed. We discussed the unanswered questions regarding pollen tube growth that need to be addressed in the future.
