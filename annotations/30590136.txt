The phytohormone auxin has been shown to be of pivotal importance in growth and development of land plants. The underlying molecular players involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling are quite well understood in Arabidopsis. However, functional characterizations of auxin-related genes in economically important crops, specifically maize and rice, are still limited. In this article, we comprehensively review recent functional studies on auxin-related genes in both maize and rice, compared with what is known in Arabidopsis, and highlight conservation and diversification of their functions. Our analysis is illustrated by phylogenetic analysis and publicly available gene expression data for each gene family, which will aid in the identification of auxin-related genes for future research. Current challenges and future directions for auxin research in maize and rice are discussed. Developments in gene editing techniques provide powerful tools for overcoming the issue of redundancy in these gene families and will undoubtedly advance auxin research in crops.
