['28586470', 'Small signalling peptides have emerged as important cell to cell messengers in  plant development and stress responses. However, only a few of the predicted  peptides have been functionally characterized. Here, we present functional  characterization of two members of the IDA-LIKE (IDL) peptide family in  Arabidopsis thaliana, IDL6 and IDL7. Localization studies suggest that the  peptides require a signal peptide and C-terminal processing to be correctly  transported out of the cell. Both IDL6 and IDL7 appear to be unstable transcripts  under post-transcriptional regulation. Treatment of plants with synthetic IDL6  and IDL7 peptides resulted in down-regulation of a broad range of  stress-responsive genes, including early stress-responsive transcripts, dominated  by a large group of ZINC FINGER PROTEIN (ZFP) genes, WRKY genes, and genes  encoding calcium-dependent proteins. IDL7 expression was rapidly induced by  hydrogen peroxide, and idl7 and idl6 idl7 double mutants displayed reduced cell  death upon exposure to extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Co-treatment  of the bacterial elicitor flg22 with IDL7 peptide attenuated the rapid ROS burst  induced by treatment with flg22 alone. Taken together, our results suggest that  IDL7, and possibly IDL6, act as negative modulators of stress-induced ROS  signalling in Arabidopsis.', '2017 Jun 15', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erx168', 'Bones']
