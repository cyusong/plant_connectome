Net ecosystem productivity (NEP), which plays a key role in the carbon cycle, is an important indicator of the ecosystem's carbon budget. In this paper, the spatial and temporal variations of NEP over Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China from 2001 to 2020 were studied based on remote sensing and climate re-analysis data. The modified Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model was employed to estimate net primary productivity (NPP), and the soil heterotrophic respiration model was used to calculate soil heterotrophic respiration. Then NEP was obtained by calculating the difference between NPP and heterotrophic respiration. The annual mean NEP of the study area was high in the east and low in the west, high in the north and low in the south. The 20-year mean vegetation NEP of the study area is 128.54 gC·m<sup>-2</sup>, indicating that the study area is a carbon sink on the whole. From 2001 to 2020, the annual mean vegetation NEP ranged between 93.12 and 158.05 gC·m<sup>-2</sup>, and exhibited an increasing trend in general. 71.46% of the vegetation area showed increasing trends of NEP. NEP exhibited a positive relationship with precipitation and a negative relationship with air temperature, and the correlation with air temperature was more significant. The work reveals the spatio-temporal dynamics of NEP in Xinjiang Autonomous Region and can provide a valuable reference for assessing regional carbon sequestration capacity.
