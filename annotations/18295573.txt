Similar to animal stem cells, plant stem cells require special niche microenvironments to continuously generate the tissues that constitute the plant body. Recent work using computer modeling and live imaging is helping to elucidate some of the mechanisms responsible for the specification and maintenance of stem cells in the root and shoot.
