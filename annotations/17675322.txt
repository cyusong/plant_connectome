There has been much recent research on the contribution of microRNA (miRNA) in plant organogenesis and hormone action. In plants, it has been reported that Dicer-like 1 (DCL1), HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) and SERRATE (SE) are involved in the production of miRNAs. The means by which miRNAs are processed and transported is not well understood in detail, however. In this study, we investigated the intracellular localization and intermolecular interaction of these molecules using imaging techniques, including bimolecular fluorescence complementation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques, making use of various enhanced fluorescent proteins. We found that DCL1, HYL1 and SE formed bodies which localized in the nuclei. We were also able to locate the miRNA primary transcript using an MS2-tagged method on these bodies. It appears very likely that the observed DCL1-HYL1-SE nuclear body is involved in miRNA production. Co-expression of SmD3 or SmB proteins revealed the localization of DCL1-HYL1-SE complexes in the SmD3/SmB nuclear bodies.
