['20738727', 'Sialyltransferases (SiaTs) exist widely in vertebrates and play important roles  in a variety of biological processes. In plants, several genes have also been  identified to encode the proteins that share homology with the vertebrate SiaTs.  However, very little is known about their functions in plants. Here we report the  identification and characterization of a novel Arabidopsis gene, MALE GAMETOPHYTE  DEFECTIVE 2 (MGP2) that encodes a sialyltransferase-like protein. MGP2 was  expressed in all tissues including pollen grains and pollen tubes. The MGP2  protein was targeted to Golgi apparatus. Knockout of MGP2 significantly inhibited  the pollen germination and retarded pollen tube growth in vitro and in vivo, but  did not affect female gametophytic functions. These results suggest that the  sialyltransferase-like protein MGP2 is important for normal pollen germination  and pollen tube growth, giving a novel insight into the biological roles of the  sialyltransferase-like proteins in plants.', '2010 Sep', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00963.x', 'Ye']
