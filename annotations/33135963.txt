Microbial pathogens deliver effectors into plant cells to suppress plant immune responses and modulate host metabolism in order to support infection processes. We sought to determine if the <i>Acidovorax avenae</i> rice-virulent K1 strain can suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) induced by flagellin isolated from the rice-avirulent N1141 strain. The flagellin-triggered PTI, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, callose deposition, and expression of several immune-related genes were strongly suppressed in K1 preinoculated cultured rice cells in a type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent manner. By screening 4,562 transposon-tagged mutants based on their suppression ability, we found that 156 transposon-tagged K1 mutants lost the ability to suppress PTI induction. Mutant sequence analysis, comprehensive expression analysis using RNA sequencing, and the prediction of secretion through T3SS showed that a protein named <i>A. avenae</i> K1 suppression factor 1 (AKSF1) suppresses flagellin-triggered PTI in rice. Translocation of AKSF1 protein into rice cells is dependent on the T3SS during infection, an <i>AKSF1</i>-disruption mutant lost the ability to suppress PTI responses, and expression of <i>AKSF1</i> in the <i>AKSF1</i>-disruption mutant complemented the suppression activity. When <i>AKSF1</i>-disruption mutants were inoculated into the host rice plant, reduction of the disease symptoms and suppression of bacterial growth were observed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AKSF1 is a novel effector that can suppress the PTI in a host rice plant.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. 2021.
