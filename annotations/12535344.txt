['12535344', "Trichomes of Arabidopsis are single-celled epidermal hair that are a useful model  for studying plant cell fate determination. Trichome initiation requires the  activity of the GLABROUS1 (GL1) gene whose expression in epidermal and trichome  cells is dependent on the presence of a 3'-cis-regulatory element. Using a  one-hybrid screen, we have isolated a cDNA, which encodes for a protein, GL1  enhancer binding protein (GeBP), that binds this regulatory element in yeast and  in vitro. GeBP and its three homologues in Arabidopsis share two regions: a  central region with no known motifs and a C-terminal region with a putative  leucine-zipper motif. We show that both regions are necessary for  trans-activation in yeast. A translational fusion with the Yellow Fluorescent  Protein (YFP) indicates that GeBP is a nuclear protein whose localization is  restricted to, on average, 3-5 subnuclear foci that might correspond to nucleoli.  Transcriptional fusion with the GUS reporter indicates that GeBP is mainly  expressed in vegetative meristematic tissues and in very young leaf primordia. We  looked at GeBP expression in plants mutated in or misexpressing KNAT1, a KNOX  gene, expressed in the shoot apical meristem and downregulated in leaf founder  cells, and found that GeBP transcript level is regulated by KNAT1 suggesting that  KNAT1 is a transcriptional activator of GeBP. This regulation suggests that GeBP  is acting as a repressor of leaf cell fate.", '2003 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01622.x', 'Vachon']
