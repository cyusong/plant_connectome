['16339853', 'Gibberellic acid (GA) promotes germination, stem/hypocotyl elongation, and leaf  expansion during seedling development. Using activation-tagging mutagenesis, we  identified a mutation, sob2-D (for suppressor of phytochromeB-4 [phyB-4]#2  dominant), which suppresses the long-hypocotyl phenotype of a phyB missense  allele, phyB-4. This mutant phenotype is caused by the overexpression of an  APETALA2 transcription factor, SOB2, also called DRN-like. SOB2/DRN-like  transcript is not detectable in wild-type seedling or adult tissues via RT-PCR  analysis, suggesting that SOB2/DRN-like may not be involved in seedling  development under normal conditions. Adult sob2-D phyB-4 plants have curled  leaves and club-like siliques, resembling plants that overexpress a closely  related gene, LEAFY PETIOLE (LEP). Hypocotyls of a LEP-null allele, lep-1, are  shorter in the light and dark, suggesting LEP involvement in seedling  development. This aberrant hypocotyl phenotype is due at least in part to a delay  in germination. In addition, lep-1 is less responsive to GA and more sensitive to  the GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol, indicating that LEP is a positive  regulator of GA-induced germination. RT-PCR shows that LEP transcript accumulates  in wild-type seeds during imbibition and germination, and the transcript levels  of REPRESSOR OF ga1-3-LIKE2 (RGL2), a negative regulator of GA signaling during  germination, is unaffected in lep-1. These results suggest LEP is a positive  regulator of GA-induced germination acting independently of RGL2. An alternative  model places LEP downstream of RGL2 in the GA-signaling cascade.', '2006 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.036707', 'Neff']
