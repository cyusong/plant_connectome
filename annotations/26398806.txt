['26398806', 'During their life cycle, plants have to cope with fluctuating environmental  conditions. The perception of the stressful environmental conditions induces a  specific stress hormone signature specifying a proper response with an efficient  fitness. By reverse genetics, we isolated and characterized a novel mutation in  Arabidopsis, associated with environmental stress responses, that affects the  At5g11250/BURNOUT1 (BNT1) gene which encode a Toll/Interleukin1  receptor-nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR) protein. The  knock-out bnt1 mutants displayed, in the absence of stress conditions, a  multitude of growth and development defects, suchas severe dwarfism, early  senescence and flower sterility, similar to those observed in vitro in wild type  plants upon different biotic and/or abiotic stresses. The disruption of BNT1  causes also a drastic increase of the jasmonic, salicylic and abscisic acids as  well as ethylene levels. Which was consistent with the expression pattern  observed in bnt1 showing an over representation of genes involved in the hormonal  response to stress? Therefore, a defect in BNT1 forced the plant to engage in an  exhausting general stress response, which produced frail, weakened and poorly  adapted plants expressing "burnout" syndromes. Furthermore, by in vitro  phenocopying experiments, physiological, chemical and molecular analyses, we  propose that BNT1 could represent a molecular link between stress perception and  specific hormonal signature.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.07.017', 'Sangwan']
