To gain insight into genetic factors controlling seed metabolic composition and its relationship to major seed properties, an Arabidopsis recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, derived from accessions Col-0 and C24, was studied using an MS-based metabolic profiling approach. Relative intensities of 311 polar primary metabolites were used to identify associated genomic loci and to elucidate their interactions by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. A total of 786 metabolic QTLs (mQTLs) were unequally distributed across the genome, forming several hotspots. For the branched-chain amino acid leucine, mQTLs and candidate genes were elucidated in detail. Correlation studies displayed links between metabolite levels, seed protein content, and seed weight. Principal component analysis revealed a clustering of samples, with PC1 mapping to a region on the short arm of chromosome IV. The overlap of this region with mQTL hotspots indicates the presence of a potential master regulatory locus of seed metabolism. As a result of database queries, a series of candidate regulatory genes, including bZIP10, were identified within this region. Depending on the search conditions, metabolic pathway-derived candidate genes for 40-61% of tested mQTLs could be determined, providing an extensive basis for further identification and characterization of hitherto unknown genes causal for natural variation of Arabidopsis seed metabolism.
