Microtubules (MTs), as transport tracks, play important roles in hyphal-tip growth in filamentous fungi, but MT-associated proteins involved in polarized growth remain unknown. Here, we found that one novel zinc finger protein, FgChy1, is required for MT morphology and polarized growth in <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. The <i>Fgchy1</i> mutant presented curved and directionless growth of hyphae. Importantly, the conidia and germ tubes of the <i>Fgchy1</i> mutant exhibited badly damaged and less-organized beta-tubulin cytoskeletons. Compared with the wild type, the <i>Fgchy1</i> mutant lost the ability to maintain polarity and was also more sensitive to the anti-MT drugs carbendazim and nocodazole, likely due to the impaired MT cytoskeleton. Indeed, the hyphae of the wild type treated with nocodazole exhibited a morphology consistent with that of the <i>Fgchy1</i> mutant. Interestingly, the disruption of FgChy1 resulted in the off-center localization of actin patches and the polarity-related polarisome protein FgSpa2 from the hyphal-tip axis. A similar defect in FgSpa2 localization was also observed in the nocodazole-treated wild-type strain. In addition, FgChy1 is also required for conidiogenesis, septation, sexual reproduction, pathogenicity, and deoxynivalenol production. Overall, this study provides the first demonstrations of the functions of the novel zinc finger protein FgChy1 in polarized growth, development, and virulence in filamentous fungi.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
