['17020925', 'Proteins containing the evolutionarily conserved SET domain are involved in  regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and chromatin structure through their  histone lysine methyltransferase (HMTase) activity. The Drosophila SU(VAR)3-9  protein and related proteins of other organisms have been associated with gene  repression and heterochromatinization. In Arabidopsis there are 10 SUVH and 5  SUVR genes encoding proteins similar to SU(VAR)3-9, and 4 SUVH proteins have been  shown to control heterochromatic silencing by its HMTase activity and by  directing DNA methylation. The SUVR proteins differ from the SUVH proteins in  their domain structure, and we show that the closely related SUVR1, SUVR2 and  SUVR4 proteins contain a novel domain at their N-terminus, and a SUVR specific  region preceding the SET domain. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusions of these  SUVR proteins preferably localize to the nucleolus, suggesting involvement in  regulation of rRNA expression, in contrast to other SET-domain proteins studied  so far. A novel HMTase specificity was demonstrated for SUVR4, in that  monomethylated histone H3K9 is its preferred substrate in vitro.', '2006', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkl687', 'Aalen']
