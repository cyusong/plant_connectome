Gibberellin (GA) is an integral phytohormone that plays prominent roles in controlling seed germination, stem elongation, leaf development and floral induction. It has been shown that GA regulates these diverse biological processes mainly through overcoming the suppressive effects of the DELLA proteins, a family of nuclear repressors of GA response. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which have been identified as master regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes, are also involved in a wide range of plant developmental events through the repression of their target genes. The pathways of GA biosynthesis and signaling, as well as the pathways of miRNA biogenesis and regulation, have been profoundly delineated in the past several decades. Growing evidence has shown that miRNAs and GAs are coordinated in regulating plant development, as several components in GA pathways are targeted by miRNAs, and GAs also regulate the expression of miRNAs or their target genes vice versa. Here, we review the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular connections between miRNAs and GA, with an emphasis on the two miRNAs, miR156 and miR159.
