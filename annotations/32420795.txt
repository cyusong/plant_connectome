Olive leaf scab, also known as peacock spot disease, caused by <i>Venturia oleaginea</i> (syn. <i>Spilocaea oleaginea</i> and <i>Fusicladium oleagineum</i>) is the most widespread and economically important fungal disease attacking olive in production countries. Here, we report the first highly contiguous whole-genome sequence (46.08 Mb) of one isolate, YUN35, of <i>V. oleaginea.</i> The described genome sequence and annotation resource will be useful to study the fungal biology, pathogen-host interaction, characterization of genes of interest, and population genetic diversity.
