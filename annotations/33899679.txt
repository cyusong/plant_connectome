Plants have evolved elaborate physiological and molecular responses to diverse environmental challenges, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Accumulating evidence suggests that biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways are intricately intertwined, and factors involved in molecular crosstalk between these pathways have been identified. The R2R3-type MYB96 transcription factor is a key player that mediates plant response to drought and osmotic stresses as well as to microbial pathogens, acting as a molecular signaling integrator. Here, we report that MYB96 is required for the transcriptional regulation of <i>SUGAR TRANSPORT PROTEIN 13</i> (<i>STP13</i>) that lies at the intersection of abscisic acid (ABA) and defense signaling pathways. MYB96 directly binds to the <i>STP13</i> promoter and activates gene expression upon exogenous application of ABA and bacterial flagellin peptide flg22. Our findings indicate that MYB96 integrates biotic and abiotic stress signals and possibly induces sugar uptake to confer tolerance to a wide range of adverse environmental challenges.
