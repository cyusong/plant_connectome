Legumes interact with a wide range of microbes in their root systems, ranging from beneficial symbionts to pathogens. Symbiotic rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal glomeromycetes trigger a so-called common symbiotic signalling pathway (CSSP), including the induction of nuclear calcium spiking in the root epidermis. By combining gene expression analysis, mutant phenotypic screening and analysis of nuclear calcium elevations, we demonstrate that recognition of an endophytic Fusarium solani strain K (FsK) in model legumes is initiated via perception of chitooligosaccharidic molecules and is, at least partially, CSSP-dependent. FsK induced the expression of Lysin-motif receptors for chitin-based molecules, CSSP members and CSSP-dependent genes in Lotus japonicus. In LysM and CSSP mutant/RNAi lines, root penetration and fungal intraradical progression was either stimulated or limited, whereas FsK exudates triggered CSSP-dependent nuclear calcium spiking, in epidermal cells of Medicago truncatula root organ cultures. Our results corroborate CSSP being involved in the perception of signals from other microbes beyond the restricted group of symbiotic interactions sensu stricto.
