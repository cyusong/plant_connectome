Understanding of the roles that HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 1 (HOS1) plays in the plant's ability to sense and respond to environmental signals has grown dramatically. Mechanisms through which HOS1 affects plant development have been uncovered, and the broader consequences of hos1 on the plant's ability to perceive and respond to its environment have been investigated. As such, it has been possible to place HOS1 as a key integrator of temperature information in response to both acute signals and cues that indicate time of year into developmental processes that are essential for plant survival. This review summarizes knowledge of HOS1's form and function, and contextualizes this information so that it is relevant for better understanding the processes of cold signalling, flowering time, and nuclear pore complex function more broadly.
