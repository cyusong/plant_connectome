['16039640', 'Initiation of transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II requires a number of  transcription factors among which TFIID is the major core promoter recognition  factor. TFIID is composed of highly conserved factors which include the  TATA-binding protein (TBP) and about 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Recently,  the complete Arabidopsis TAF family has been identified. To obtain functional  information about Arabidopsis TAFs, we analyzed a T-DNA insertion mutant for  AtTAF6. Segregation analysis showed that plants homozygous for the mutant allele  were never found, indicating that inhibition of the AtTAF6 function is lethal.  Genetic experiments also revealed that the male gametophyte was affected by the  attaf6 mutation since significant reduced transmission of the mutant allele  through the male gametophyte was observed. Detailed histological and  morphological analysis showed that the T-DNA insertion in AtTAF6 specifically  affects pollen tube growth, indicating that the transcriptional regulation of  only a specific subset of genes is controlled by this basal transcription factor.', '2005 Sep 1', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.06.006', 'Kater']
