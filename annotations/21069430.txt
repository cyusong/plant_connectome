['21069430', 'APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factors (TFs) play very important roles in plant  growth and development and in defense response. Here, we report functional  characterization of four AP2 TF family genes [(RAP2.6 (At1g43160), RAP2.6L  (At5g13330), DREB 26 (At1g21910) and DREB19 (At2g38340)] that were identified  among NaCl inducible transcripts in abscisic acid responsive 17 (ABR17)  transgenic Arabidopsis in our previous microarray analyses. DREB19 and DREB26  function as transactivators and localize in the nucleus. All four genes were  abundant in early vegetative and flowering stages, although the magnitude of the  expression varied. We observed tissue specific expression patterns for RAP2.6,  RAP2.6L, DREB19 and DREB26 in flowers and other organs. RAP2.6 and RAP2.6L were  responsive to stress hormones like jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid  and ethylene in addition to salt and drought. DREB19 and DREB26 were less  responsive to stress hormones, but the former was highly responsive to salt, heat  and drought. Overexpression of RAP2.6 in Arabidopsis resulted in a dwarf  phenotype with extensive secondary branching and small siliques, and DREB26  overexpression resulted in deformed plants. However, overexpression of RAP2.6L  and DREB19 enhanced performance under salt and drought stresses without affecting  phenotype. In summary, we have demonstrated that RAP2.6, RAP2.6L, DREB26 and  DREB19 are transactivators, they exhibit tissue specific expression, and they  participate in plant developmental processes as well as biotic and/or abiotic  stress signaling. It is possible that the results from this study on these  transcription factors, in particular RAP2.6L and DREB19, can be utilized in  developing salt and drought tolerant plants in the future.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-010-9711-7', 'Kav']
