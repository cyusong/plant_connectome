Phenolic sucrose esters (PSEs) are a diverse group of specialized metabolites that are present in several angiosperm lineages. Phylogenetic reconstruction and structural variation suggest that these metabolites may have evolved independently in monocots and dicots. Constitutive variation in PSE abundance across plant organs and developmental stages is correlated with transcriptional regulation of the upstream phenylpropanoid pathway, whereas pathogen induction is regulated by stress-related phytohormones such as ethylene. Shared structural features of PSEs indicate that their biosynthesis may involve one or more hydroxycinnamoyl transferases and BAHD acetyltransferases, which could be identified by correlative analyses of multi-omics datasets. Elucidation of the core biosynthetic pathway of PSEs will be essential for more detailed studies of the biological function of these compounds and their potential medicinal and agricultural applications.
