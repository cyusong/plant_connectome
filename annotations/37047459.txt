Brassinosteroids (BRs) are important hormones that play crucial roles in plant growth, reproduction, and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. CYP85A1 is a castasterone (CS) synthase that catalyzes C-6 oxidation of 6-deoxocastasterone (6-deoxoCS) to CS, after which CS is converted into brassinolide (BL) in a reaction catalyzed by CYP85A2. Here, we report the functional characteristics of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) <i>OsCYP85A1</i>. Constitutive expression of <i>OsCYP85A1</i> driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter increased endogenous BR levels and significantly promoted growth and biomass production in three groups of transgenic <i>Populus tomentosa</i> lines. The plant height and stem diameter of the transgenic poplar plants were increased by 17.6% and 33.6%, respectively, in comparison with control plants. Simultaneously, we showed that expression of <i>OsCYP85A1</i> enhanced xylem formation in transgenic poplar without affecting cell wall thickness or the composition of cellulose. Our findings suggest that <i>OsCYP85A1</i> represents a potential target candidate gene for engineering fast-growing trees with improved wood production.
