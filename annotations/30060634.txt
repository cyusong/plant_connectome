The Formosa lily (<i>Lilium formosanum</i>) is one of the most common horticultural species in Taiwan. To explore gene regulation involved in this species, we used transcriptome analysis to generate PH-FB (mixed floral buds) and PH-LF (mature leaves) datasets. Combination of the PH-FB and PH-LF constructed a de novo assembly of the ALL dataset, including 18,041 contigs and 23,807 unigenes by Nr, GO, COG, and KEGG databases. The differential gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed 9937 genes were upregulated while 10,383 genes were downregulated in the developing floral buds compared to mature leaves. Seven putative genes (<i>LFMADS1 to 7</i>) encoding floral organ identity proteins were selected for further analysis. <i>LFMADS1-6</i> genes were specifically expressed in the floral organ, while <i>LFMADS7</i> in the floral buds and mature leaves. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LFMADS1-3 is classified into B-class, LFMADS4 into C-class, LFMADS5 into D-class, and LFMADS6-7 into E-class, respectively. LFMADS-GFP fusion proteins appeared to localize in the nucleus, supporting their roles as transcription factors (TFs). Overexpression of the <i>LFMADS2</i>, <i>LFMADS4</i>, and <i>LFMADS6</i> genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> resulted in early flowering and floral defect, however, only early flowering in transgenic tobacco was observed. Highly expressed floral integrator genes, including <i>AtFT</i>, <i>AtLFY</i>, and <i>AtFUL</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>NtFUL</i> and <i>NtSOC1</i> in transgenic tobacco, resulted in early flowering phenotype through qRT-PCR analysis. Yeast two-hybrid analysis suggested that LFMADSs may form higher order complexes with the B-, C-, D, and/or E-class proteins to determine the floral organ identity. Furthermore, E-class LFMADS proteins may function as a glue to mediate and strengthen the protein-protein interactions. Therefore, our de novo datasets would provide information for investigating other differentially expressed candidate transcripts. In addition, functional conservation of LFMADSs appears to be vital in floral transition and floral organ identity.
