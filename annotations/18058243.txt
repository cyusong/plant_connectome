Tamarix hispida, a woody halophyte, thrives in saline and saline-alkali soil. To better understand the gene expression profiles that manifest in response to saline-alkali stress, three cDNA libraries were constructed from leaf tissue of T. hispida plants that were well watered and exposed to NaHCO3 for 24 and 52 h. A total of 9,447 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained from the three libraries. These ESTs represent 3,945 unigenes, including 986 contigs and 2,959 singlets. The numbers of unigenes obtained from the three libraries were 1,752, 1,558 and 1,675, respectively. The EST analysis was performed to compare gene expression in the three cDNA libraries; the transcripts responsive to NaHCO3 were identified. The differentially expressed transcripts were identified. The up-regulation genes were involved in a variety function areas, such as stress-related proteins, hormone signaling transduction, antioxidative response, transcriptional regulators, protein synthesis and destination, ion homeostasis, photosynthesis and metabolism. The results indicated that the response to NaHCO3 in T. hispida is a complex one, involving multiple physiological and metabolic pathways. Nine gene expression patterns were compared in response to NaHCO3 and NaCl using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gene expression trends were similar after a 24-h exposure to either NaCl or NaHCO3, however, great variability was found after a 52-h exposure, indicating that short-term responses to either salt may not be obviously different.
