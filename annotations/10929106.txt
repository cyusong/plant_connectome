['10929106', 'Yeast Snf4 is a prototype of activating gamma-subunits of conserved  Snf1/AMPK-related protein kinases (SnRKs) controlling glucose and stress  signaling in eukaryotes. The catalytic subunits of Arabidopsis SnRKs, AKIN10 and  AKIN11, interact with Snf4 and suppress the snf1 and snf4 mutations in yeast. By  expression of an Arabidopsis cDNA library in yeast, heterologous multicopy snf4  suppressors were isolated. In addition to AKIN10 and AKIN11, the deficiency of  yeast snf4 mutant to grown on non-fermentable carbon source was suppressed by  Arabidopsis Myb30, CAAT-binding factor Hap3b, casein kinase I, zinc-finger  factors AZF2 and ZAT10, as well as orthologs of hexose/UDP-hexose transporters,  calmodulin, SMC1-cohesin and Snf4. Here we describe the characterization of  AtSNF4, a functional Arabidopsis Snf4 ortholog, that interacts with yeast Snf1  and specifically binds to the C-terminal regulatory domain of Arabidopsis SnRKs  AKIN10 and AKIN11.', '2000 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00809.x', 'Koncz']
