Oilseed rape is one of the most important dicotyledonous field crops in the world, where it plays a key role in productive cereal crop rotations. However, its production requires high nitrogen fertilization and its nitrogen footprint exceeds that of most other globally important crops. Hence, increased nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in this crop is of high priority for sustainable agriculture. We report a comprehensive study of macrophysiological characteristics associated with breeding progress, conducted under contrasting nitrogen fertilization levels in a large panel of elite oilseed rape varieties representing breeding progress over the past 20 years. The results indicate that increased plant biomass at flowering, along with increases in primary yield components, have increased NUE in modern varieties. Nitrogen uptake efficiency has improved through breeding, particularly at high nitrogen. Despite low heritability, the number of seeds per silique is associated positively with increased yield in modern varieties. Seed weight remains unaffected by breeding progress; however, recent selection for high seed oil content and for high seed yields appears to have promoted a negative correlation (r= -0.39 at high and r= -0.49 at low nitrogen) between seed weight and seed oil concentration. Overall, our results reveal valuable breeding targets to improve NUE in oilseed rape.
