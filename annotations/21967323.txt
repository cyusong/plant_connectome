Disease resistance (R) proteins, as central regulators of plant immunity, are tightly regulated for effective defense responses and to prevent constitutive defense activation under non-pathogenic conditions. Here we report the identification of an F-box protein CPR1/CPR30 as a negative regulator of an R protein SNC1 likely through SCF (Skp1-cullin-F-box) mediated protein degradation. The cpr1-2 (cpr30-1) loss-of-function mutant has constitutive defense responses, and it interacts synergistically with a gain-of function mutant snc1-1 and a bon1-1 mutant where SNC1 is upregulated. The loss of SNC1 function suppresses the mutant phenotypes of cpr1-2 and cpr1-2 bon1-1, while overexpression of CPR1 rescues mutant phenotypes of both bon1-1 and snc1-1. Furthermore, the amount of SNC1 protein is upregulated in the cpr1-2 mutant and down-regulated when CPR1 is overexpressed. The regulation of SNC1 by CPR1 is dependent on the 26S proteosome as a protease inhibitor MG132 stabilizes SNC1 and reverses the effect of CPR1 on SNC1. Interestingly, CPR1 is induced after infection of both virulent and avirulent pathogens similarly to the other negative defense regulator BON1. Thus, this study reveals a new mechanism in R protein regulation likely through protein degradation and suggests negative regulation as a critical component in fine control of plant immunity.
