['16415218', 'Different classes of plant hormones and different wavelengths of light act  through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate higher plant  development. A specific prephenate dehydratase protein (PD1) was discovered to  have a strong interaction with the sole canonical G-protein Galpha-subunit (GPA1)  in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). PD1 is a protein located in the cytosol,  present in etiolated seedlings, with a specific role in blue light-mediated  synthesis of phenylpyruvate and subsequently of phenylalanine (Phe). Insertion  mutagenesis confirms that GPA1 and the sole canonical G-protein-coupled receptor  (GCR1) in Arabidopsis also have a role in this blue light-mediated event. In  vitro analyses indicate that the increase in PD1 activity is the direct and  specific consequence of its interaction with activated GPA1. Because of their  shared role in the light-mediated synthesis of phenylpyruvate and Phe, because  they are iteratively interactive, and because activated GPA1 is directly  responsible for the activation of PD1; GCR1, GPA1, and PD1 form all of or part of  a signal transduction mechanism responsible for the light-mediated synthesis of  phenylpyruvate, Phe, and those metabolites that derive from that Phe. Data are  also presented to confirm that abscisic acid can act through the same pathway. An  additional outcome of the work is the confirmation that phenylpyruvate acts as  the intermediate in the synthesis of Phe in etiolated plants, as it commonly does  in bacteria and fungi.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.071282', 'Kaufman']
