Protons (H+) in acidic soils arrest plant growth. However, the mechanisms by which plants optimize their biological processes to diminish the unfavorable effects of H+ stress remain largely unclear. Here, we showed that in the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, the C2H2-type transcription factor STOP1 in the nucleus was enriched by low pH in a nitrate-independent manner, with the spatial expression pattern of NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1.1 (NRT1.1) established by low pH required the action of STOP1. Additionally, the nrt1.1 and stop1 mutants, as well as the nrt1.1 stop1 double mutant, had a similar hypersensitive phenotype to low pH, indicating that STOP1 and NRT1.1 function in the same pathway for H+ tolerance. Molecular assays revealed that STOP1 directly bound to the promoter of NRT1.1 to activate its transcription in response to low pH, thus upregulating its nitrate uptake. This action improved the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of plants and created a favorable rhizospheric pH for root growth by enhancing H+ depletion in the rhizosphere. Consequently, the constitutive expression of NRT1.1 in stop1 mutants abolished the hypersensitive phenotype to low pH. These results demonstrate that STOP1-NRT1.1 is a key module for plants to optimize NUE and ensure better plant growth in acidic media.
