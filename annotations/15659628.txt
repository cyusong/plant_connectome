We have identified and characterized a 17- to 18-kD Ser50-phosphorylated form of maize (Zea mays) CENTROMERIC HISTONE H3 (phCENH3-Ser50). Immunostaining in both mitosis and meiosis indicates that CENH3-Ser50 phosphorylation begins in prophase/diplotene, increases to a maximum at prometaphase-metaphase, and drops during anaphase. Dephosphorylation is precipitous (approximately sixfold) at the metaphase-anaphase transition, suggesting a role in the spindle checkpoint. Although phCENH3-Ser50 lies within a region that lacks homology to any other known histone, its closest counterpart is the phospho-Ser28 residue of histone H3 (phH3-Ser28). CENH3-Ser50 and H3-Ser28 are phosphorylated with nearly identical kinetics, but the former is restricted to centromeres and the latter to pericentromeres. Opposing centromeres separate in prometaphase, whereas the phH3-Ser28-marked pericentromeres remain attached and coalesce into a well-defined tether that binds the centromeres together. We propose that a centromere-initiated wave of histone phosphorylation is an early step in defining the two major structural domains required for chromosome segregation: centromere (alignment, motility) and pericentromere (cohesion).

CENH3-Ser50: !dephosphorylates! at metaphase-anaphase transition
CENH3-Ser50: !localizes to! centromeres
H3-Ser28: !phosphorylates! with similar kinetics
H3-Ser28: !localizes to! pericentromeres
Pericentromeres: !coalesce into! tether binding centromeres
