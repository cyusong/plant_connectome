Emergence at an appropriate time and place is critical for maximizing plant fitness and hence sophisticated mechanisms such as seed dormancy have evolved. Although maternal influence on different aspects of dormancy behavior has been identified, its impact under field conditions and its relation to plant fitness has not been fully determined. This study examined maternal effects in Polygonum aviculare on release of seed primary dormancy, responses to alternating temperatures, induction into secondary dormancy, and field emergence patterns as influenced by changes in the sowing date and photoperiod experienced by the mother plant. Maternal effects were quantified using population threshold models that allowed us to simulate and interpret the experimental results. We found that regulation of dormancy in P. aviculare seeds by the maternal environment is instrumental for maximizing plant fitness in the field. This regulation operates by changing the dormancy level of seeds dispersed at different times (as a consequence of differences in the sowing dates of mother plants) in order to synchronize most emergence to the seasonal period that ultimately guarantees the highest reproductive output of the new generation. Our results also showed that maternal photoperiod, which represents a clear seasonal cue, is involved in this regulation.
