GhMYC2 regulates the gossypol biosynthesis pathway in cotton through activation of the expression of gossypol synthesis gene CYP71BE79, CDNC, CYP706B1, DH1, and CYP82D113. Cotton is one of the main cash crops globally. Cottonseed contains fiber, fat, protein, and starch, and has important economic value. However, gossypol in cottonseed seriously affects the development and utilization of cottonseed. Nonetheless, gossypol has great application potential in agriculture, medicine, and industry. Therefore, it is very important to study gossypol biosynthesis and its upstream regulatory pathways. It has been reported that the content of gossypol in hairy roots of cotton is regulated through jasmonic acid signaling; however, the specific molecular mechanism has not been revealed yet. We found that the expression of basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor GhMYC2 was significantly upregulated after exogenous administration of methyl jasmonate to cotton seedlings, and the content of gossypol changed significantly with the variation of GhMYC2 expression. Further studies revealed that GhMYC2 could specifically bind to the G-Box in the promoter region of CDNC, CYP706B1, DH1, CYP82D113, CYP71BE79 to activate its expression and regulate gossypol synthesis, and its activation of CYP71BE79 promoter was inhibited by GhJAZ2. Not only that GhMYC2 could also interact with GoPGF. In this work, the molecular mechanisms of gossypol biosynthesis regulated by GhMYC2 were analyzed. The results provide a theoretical basis for cultivating new varieties of low-gossypol or high-gossypol cotton and creating excellent germplasm resources.
