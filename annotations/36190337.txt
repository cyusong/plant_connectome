RAC/Rho of plant (ROP) GTPases are major molecular switches that control diverse signaling cascades for plant growth, development, and defense. Here, we discovered a signaling node that connects RAC/ROPs to cytokinins. Rice (Oryza sativa) plants develop a fibrous root system mainly composed of crown roots. Cytokinin signaling via a phosphorelay system is critical for crown root development. We show that OsRopGEF10, which activates RAC/ROPs, acts upstream of the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling phosphotransfer proteins AHPs of the cytokinin signaling pathway to promote crown root development. Mutations of OsRopGEF10 induced hypersensitivity to cytokinin, whereas overexpressing this gene reduced the cytokinin response. Loss of OsRopGEF10 function reduced the expression of the response regulator gene OsRR6, a repressor of cytokinin signaling, and impaired crown root development. Mutations in OsAHP1/2 led to increased crown root production and rescued the crown root defect of Osropgef10. Furthermore, auxin activates the ROP GTPase OsRAC3, which attenuates cytokinin signaling for crown root initiation. Molecular interactions between OsRopGEF10, OsRAC3, and OsAHP1/2 implicate a mechanism whereby OsRopGEF10-activated OsRAC3 recruits OsAHP1/2 to the cortical cytoplasm, sequestering them from their phosphorelay function in the nucleus. Together, our findings uncover the OsRopGEF10-OsRAC3-OsAHP1/2 signaling module, establish a link between RAC/ROPs and cytokinin, and reveal molecular crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin during crown root development.
