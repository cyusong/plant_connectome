Mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ) is the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> from intercellular air spaces (IAS) to the first site of carboxylation in the mesophyll cells. In C<sub>3</sub> species, g<sub>m</sub> is influenced by diverse leaf structural and anatomical traits; however, little is known about traits affecting g<sub>m</sub> in C<sub>4</sub> species. To address this knowledge gap, we used online oxygen isotope discrimination measurements to estimate g<sub>m</sub> and microscopy techniques to measure leaf structural and anatomical traits potentially related to g<sub>m</sub> in 18 C<sub>4</sub> grasses. In this study, g<sub>m</sub> scaled positively with photosynthesis and intrinsic water-use efficiency (TE<sub>i</sub> ), but not with stomatal conductance. Also, g<sub>m</sub> was not determined by a single trait but was positively correlated with adaxial stomatal densities (SD<sub>ada</sub> ), stomatal ratio (SR), mesophyll surface area exposed to IAS (S<sub>mes</sub> ) and leaf thickness. However, g<sub>m</sub> was not related to abaxial stomatal densities (SD<sub>aba</sub> ) and mesophyll cell wall thickness (T<sub>CW</sub> ). Our study suggests that greater SD<sub>ada</sub> and SR increased g<sub>m</sub> by increasing S<sub>mes</sub> and creating additional parallel pathways for CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion inside mesophyll cells. Thus, SD<sub>ada</sub> , SR and S<sub>mes</sub> are important determinants of C<sub>4</sub> -g<sub>m</sub> and could be the target traits selected or modified for achieving greater g<sub>m</sub> and TE<sub>i</sub> in C<sub>4</sub> species.
