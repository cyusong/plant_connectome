Arabidopsis thaliana small GTP-binding proteins, AtRAB8s, associate with the endomembrane system and modulate tubulovesicular trafficking between compartments of the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways. There are five members in Arabidopsis, namely AtRAB8A-8E. Yeast two-hybrid assays, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays showed that RAB8A, 8B and 8D interacted with several membrane-associated reticulon-like (AtRTNLB) proteins in yeast, plant cells and in vitro. Furthermore, RAB8A, 8B and 8D proteins showed interactions with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence protein, VirB2, a component of a type IV secretion system (T4SS). A. tumefaciens uses a T4SS to transfer T-DNA and Virulence proteins to plants, which causes crown gall disease in plants. The Arabidopsis rab8A, rab8B and rab8D single mutants showed decreased levels of Agrobacterium-mediated root and seedling transformation, while the RAB8A, 8B and 8D overexpression transgenic Arabidopsis plants were hypersusceptible to A. tumefaciens and Pseudomonas syringae infections. RAB8A-8E transcripts accumulated differently in roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, inflorescence and flowers of wild-type plants. In summary, RAB8A, 8B and 8D interacted with several RTNLB proteins and participated in A. tumefaciens and P. syringae infection processes.
