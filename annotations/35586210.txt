Appropriate genotype selection and management can impact wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) yield in dryland environments, but their impact on yield components and their role in yield modulation are not well understood. Our objectives were to evaluate the yield response of commercial winter wheat genotypes to different management practices reflecting a stepwise increase in management intensity (including a reduction in crop density under high input), and to quantify how the different yield components modulate wheat yield. A factorial experiment evaluated six management (M) intensities ["farmer practice" (FP), "enhanced fertility" (EF), "ecological intensification" (EI), "increased foliar protection" (IFP), "water-limited yield" (Yw), and "increased plant productivity" (IPP)] and four winter wheat genotypes (G) in four Kansas environments (E). Average grain yield was 4.9 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> and ranged from 2.0 to 7.4 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, with significant two-way interactions (E × M and E × G). The EF usually maximized yields in dry environments, while EI, which consisted of EF plus one fungicide application, maximized yields in environments with greater water availability. Across all sources of variation, kernels m<sup>-2</sup> and aboveground biomass were the strongest modulators of yield as compared to kernel weight and harvest index, while spikes m<sup>-2</sup> and kernels spike<sup>-1</sup> modulated yields at a similar magnitude. Foliar fungicides improved yield through increased green canopy cover duration and greater radiation intercepted during grain filling. When crop density was reduced from 2.7 to 1.1 million plants per hectare in an otherwise high-input system, plants produced more productive tillers (with genotype-specific response); however, reduced green canopy cover at anthesis and reduced cumulative solar radiation intercepted during grain filling limited wheat yield-although large differences in canopy cover or intercepted radiation were needed to cause modest changes in yield. Treatments more intensive than EI were not warranted as EF or EI maximized yields at all environments, and practices that promote biomass and kernels m<sup>-2</sup> are to be targeted for future increases in wheat yield.
