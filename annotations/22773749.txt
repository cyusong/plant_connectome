['22773749', 'Auxin transport, which is mediated by specialized influx and efflux carriers,  plays a major role in many aspects of plant growth and development. AUXIN1 (AUX1)  has been demonstrated to encode a high-affinity auxin influx carrier. In  Arabidopsis thaliana, AUX1 belongs to a small multigene family comprising four  highly conserved genes (i.e., AUX1 and LIKE AUX1 [LAX] genes LAX1, LAX2, and  LAX3). We report that all four members of this AUX/LAX family display auxin  uptake functions. Despite the conservation of their biochemical function, AUX1,  LAX1, and LAX3 have been described to regulate distinct auxin-dependent  developmental processes. Here, we report that LAX2 regulates vascular patterning  in cotyledons. We also describe how regulatory and coding sequences of AUX/LAX  genes have undergone subfunctionalization based on their distinct patterns of  spatial expression and the inability of LAX sequences to rescue aux1 mutant  phenotypes, respectively. Despite their high sequence similarity at the protein  level, transgenic studies reveal that LAX proteins are not correctly targeted in  the AUX1 expression domain. Domain swapping studies suggest that the N-terminal  half of AUX1 is essential for correct LAX localization. We conclude that  Arabidopsis AUX/LAX genes encode a family of auxin influx transporters that  perform distinct developmental functions and have evolved distinct regulatory  mechanisms.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.097766', 'Swarup']
