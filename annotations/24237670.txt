2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was the first synthetic herbicide to be commercially developed and has commonly been used as a broadleaf herbicide for over 60 years. It is a selective herbicide that kills dicots without affecting monocots and mimics natural auxin at the molecular level. Physiological responses of dicots sensitive to auxinic herbicides include abnormal growth, senescence, and plant death. The identification of auxin receptors, auxin transport carriers, transcription factors response to auxin, and cross-talk among phytohormones have shed light on the molecular action mode of 2,4-D as a herbicide. Here, the molecular action mode of 2,4-D is highlighted according to the latest findings, emphasizing the physiological process, perception, and signal transduction under herbicide treatment.

2,4-D: !mimics! auxin 
auxin receptor: !binds to! 2,4-D 
auxin transport carrier: !mediates! auxin response 
transcription factor: !responds to! auxin 
phytohormone: !cross-talks with! auxin 
auxin: !induces! abnormal growth
