In plants RNA silencing is a host defense mechanism against viral infection, in which double-strand RNA is processed into 21-24-nt short interfering RNA (siRNA). Silencing spreads from cell to cell and systemically through a sequence-specific signal to limit the propagation of the virus. To counteract this defense mechanism, viruses encode suppressors of silencing. The P1 protein encoded by the rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) displays suppression activity with variable efficiency, according to the isolates that they originated from. Here, we show that P1 proteins from two RYMV isolates displaying contrasting suppression strength reduced local silencing induced by single-strand and double-strand RNA in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. This suppression was associated with a slight and a severe reduction in 21- and 24-nt siRNA accumulation, respectively. Unexpectedly, cell-to-cell movement and systemic propagation of silencing were enhanced in P1-expressing Nicotiana plants. When transgenically expressed in rice, P1 proteins induced specific deregulation of DCL4-dependent endogenous siRNA pathways, whereas the other endogenous pathways were not affected. As DCL4-dependent pathways play a key role in rice development, the expression of P1 viral proteins was associated with the same severe developmental defects in spikelets as in dcl4 mutants. Overall, our results demonstrate that a single viral protein displays multiple effects on both endogenous and exogenous silencing, not only in a suppressive but also in an enhancive manner. This suggests that P1 proteins play a key role in maintaining a subtle equilibrium between defense and counter-defense mechanisms, to insure efficient virus multiplication and the preservation of host integrity.
