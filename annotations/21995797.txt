Central to the mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is the arbuscule, the site where symbiotic phosphate is delivered. Initial investigations in legumes have led to the exciting observation that symbiotic phosphate uptake not only enhances plant growth but also regulates arbuscule dynamics and is, furthermore, required for maintenance of the symbiosis. This review evaluates the possible role of the phosphate ion, not only as a nutrient but also as a signal that is necessary for reprogramming the host cortex cell for symbiosis.
