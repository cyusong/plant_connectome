Adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are important for the regulation of transcription, DNA replication, and genome stability in eukaryotes. Although genetic studies have illustrated various biological functions of core and accessory subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes in plants, the identification and characterization of chromatin-remodeling complexes in plants is lagging behind that in yeast and animals. Recent studies determined whether and how the Arabidopsis SWI/SNF, ISWI, INO80, SWR1, and CHD chromatin remodelers function in multi-subunit complexes in Arabidopsis. Both conserved and plant-specific subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes have been identified and characterized. These findings provide a basis for further studies of the molecular mechanisms by which the chromatin-remodeling complexes function in plants.
