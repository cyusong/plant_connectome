The assimilation of inorganic nitrogen is an essential process for all plant-like organisms. In the presence of ammonium and nitrate as nitrogen sources, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii preferentially assimilates ammonium and represses the nitrate assimilation pathway through an unknown mechanism that in part involves the guanylate cyclase CYG56. It is demonstrated that cells not only respond quantitatively to the NH(4)(+) signal but are also able to sense a balance between both nitrogen sources. This quantitative response was altered in a collection of mutants that were partially insensitive to NH(4)(+). In one of these mutants, reduced function of a gene named CDP1 encoding a cysteine domain-containing protein was genetically linked to NH(4)(+) insensitivity. Alteration of CYG56 or CDP1 transcription was detected in several mutants, and combined down-regulation of both genes seemed to enhance the incapacity to sense NH(4)(+) properly. These results suggest that transcriptional regulation of CYG56 and CDP1 are central and independent steps of the NH(4)(+) signalling pathway.

CYG56: !transcriptionally regulated by! CDP1
CDP1: !transcriptionally regulated by! CYG56
CYG56: !enhanced by! down-regulation of CDP1
CDP1: !enhanced by! down-regulation of CYG56
