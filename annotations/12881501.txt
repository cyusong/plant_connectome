['12881501', 'Intercellular signaling mediated by receptor-like kinases (RLKs) is important for  diverse processes in plant development, although downstream intracellular  signaling pathways remain poorly understood. Proteins interacting directly with  RLK were screened for by yeast two-hybrid assay with the kinase domain as bait. A  MADS-box protein, AGL24 was identified as a candidate substrate of MRLK  (Meristematic Receptor-Like Kinase), which was named for its spatial expression  in shoot and root apical meristems in Arabidopsis: The AGL24 protein specifically  interacted with, and was phosphorylated by, the MRLK kinase domain in in vitro  assays. The simultaneous expression of AGL24 and MRLK in shoot apices during  floral transition suggested that the interaction occurs in plants. Using plants  constitutively expressing a fusion protein of AGL24 and green fluorescent  protein, the subcellular localization of AGL24 protein was observed exclusively  in the nucleus in apical tissues where MRLK was expressed, while AGL24 was  localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in tissues where no MRLK  expression was detectable. These results suggest that MRLK signaling promotes  translocation of AGL24 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We propose that the RLK  signaling pathway involves phosphorylation of a MADS-box transcription factor.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcg092', 'Kohchi']
