CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genome engineering by facilitating a wide range of targeted DNA perturbations. These systems have resulted in new powerful screens to test gene functions at the genomic scale. While there is tremendous potential for CRISPR screens to map and interrogate gene regulatory networks at unprecedented speed and scale, their implementation in plants remains in its infancy. Here we discuss the general concepts, tools and workflows for establishing CRISPR screens in plants and analyze the handful of recent reports using this strategy to generate mutant knockout collections or diversify DNA sequences. In addition, we provide insight on how to design CRISPR knockout screens in plants given the current challenges and limitations and examine multiple design options. Finally, we discuss the unique multiplexing capabilities of CRISPR screens to investigate redundant gene function in highly duplicated plant genomes. Combinatorial mutant screens have the potential to routinely generate higher-order mutant collections and facilitate the characterization of gene networks. By integrating this approach with the large resource of genomic profiles that were generated in the last two decades, the implementation of CRISPR screens offers new opportunities to analyze plant genomes at deeper resolution and will greatly advance plant functional and synthetic biology.
