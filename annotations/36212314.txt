Concerns regarding inevitable soil translocation and bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) in plants have been escalating in concomitance with the posed phytotoxicity and threat to human health. Exhibiting a Cd tolerance, <i>Bacillus</i> sp. M6 strain has been reported as a soil amendment owing to its capability of reducing metal bioavailability in soils. The present study investigated the rhizospheric bacterial community of the Cd hyperaccumulator <i>Sedum alfredii</i> using 16S <i>rRNA</i> gene sequencing. Additionally, the Cd removal efficiency of strain <i>Bacillus</i> sp. M6 was enhanced by supplementing with biochar (C), glutamic acid (G), and rhamnolipid (R) to promote the phytoremediation effect of hyperaccumulator <i>S. alfredii</i>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the amendments such as C, G, and R together with the plant-microbe system <i>S. alfredii-Bacillus</i> sp. M6 has been used for Cd bioremediation. The results showed that soil CaCl<sub>2</sub> and DTPA (Diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) extractable Cd increased by 52.77 and 95.08%, respectively, in all M6 treatments compared to unamended control (CK). <i>Sedum alfredii</i> with <i>Bacillus</i> sp. M6 supplemented with biochar and rhamnolipid displayed a higher phytoremediation effect, and the removal capability of soil Cd (II) reached up to 16.47%. Moreover, remediation of Cd polluted soil by <i>Bacillus</i> sp. M6 also had an impact on the soil microbiome, including ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and cadmium transporting ATPase (<i>cadA)</i> genes. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed the <i>Bacillus</i> sp. M6 strain increased the abundance of AOB and <i>cadA</i> in both low Cd (LC) and high Cd (HC) soils compared to AOA gene abundance. Besides, the abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i> was found to be highest in both soils representing high tolerance capacity against Cd. While <i>Firmicutes</i> ranked third, indicating that the additionof strain could not make it the most dominant species. The results suggested the presence of the hyperaccumulator <i>S. alfredii</i> and Cd tolerant strain <i>Bacillus</i> sp. M6 supplemented with biochar, and rhamnolipid, play a unique and essential role in the remediation process and reducing the bioavailability of Cd.
