Lipid remodeling, defined herein as post-synthetic structural modifications of membrane lipids, play crucial roles in regulating the physicochemical properties of cellular membranes and hence their many functions. Processes affected by lipid remodeling include lipid metabolism, membrane repair, cellular homeostasis, fatty acid trafficking, cellular signaling and stress tolerance. Glycerolipids are the major structural components of cellular membranes and their composition can be adjusted by modifying their head groups, their acyl chain lengths and the number and position of double bonds. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of membrane lipid remodeling with emphasis on the lipases and acyltransferases involved in the modification of phosphatidylcholine and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, the major membrane lipids of extraplastidic and photosynthetic membranes, respectively. We also discuss the role of triacylglycerol metabolism in membrane acyl chain remodeling. Finally, we discuss emerging data concerning the functional roles of glycerolipid remodeling in plant stress responses. Illustrating the molecular basis of lipid remodeling may lead to novel strategies for crop improvement and other biotechnological applications such as bioenergy production.
