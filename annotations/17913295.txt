Flowering time is regulated by genetic programs and environment signals in plants. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flower induction. Genotype W378 is a rice (Oryza sativa) late-flowering mutant selected from our collections of T-DNA insertion line. The T-DNA flanking gene in mutant W378 codes OsLFL1 (O. sativa LEC2 and FUSCA3 Like 1), a putative B3 DNA-binding domain-containing transcription factor. In wild-type rice OsLFL1 is expressed exclusively in spikes and young embryos, while in mutant W378 it is ectopically expressed. Introduction of OsLFL1-RNAi into mutant W378 successfully down-regulated OsLFL1 expression and restored flowering to almost normal time, indicating that overexpression of OsLFL1 confers late flowering for mutant W378. The flowering-promoting gene Ehd1 and its downstream genes are all down-regulated in W378. Thus, overexpression of OsLFL1 might delay the flowering of W378 by repressing the expression of Ehd1.
