Due to anthropogenic emissions and changes in land use, trees are now exposed to atmospheric levels of [[Formula: see text]] that are unprecedented for 650,000 y [Lüthi et al. (2008) <i>Nature</i> 453:379-382] (thousands of tree generations). Trees are expected to acclimate by modulating leaf-gas exchanges and alter water use efficiency which may result in forest productivity changes. Here, we present evidence of one of the strongest, nonlinear, and unequivocal postindustrial increases in intrinsic water use efficiency ([Formula: see text]) ever documented (+59%). A dual-isotope tree-ring analysis ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) covering 715 y of growth of North America's oldest boreal trees (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i> L.) revealed an unprecedented increase in [Formula: see text] that was directly linked to elevated assimilation rates of [Formula: see text] (A). However, limited nutrient availability, changes in carbon allocation strategies, and changes in stomatal density may have offset stem growth benefits awarded by the increased [Formula: see text] Our results demonstrate that even in scenarios where a positive [Formula: see text] fertilization effect is observed, other mechanisms may prevent trees from assimilating and storing supplementary anthropogenic emissions as above-ground biomass. In such cases, the sink capacity of forests in response to changing atmospheric conditions might be overestimated.
