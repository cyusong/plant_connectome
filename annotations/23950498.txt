['23950498', 'Lignin is a major component of plant secondary cell walls. Here we describe  caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE) as an enzyme central to the lignin biosynthetic  pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana cse mutants deposit less lignin than do wild-type  plants, and the remaining lignin is enriched in p-hydroxyphenyl units. Phenolic  metabolite profiling identified accumulation of the lignin pathway intermediate  caffeoyl shikimate in cse mutants as compared to caffeoyl shikimate levels in the  wild type, suggesting caffeoyl shikimate as a substrate for CSE. Accordingly,  recombinant CSE hydrolyzed caffeoyl shikimate into caffeate. Associated with the  changes in lignin, the conversion of cellulose to glucose in cse mutants  increased up to fourfold as compared to that in the wild type upon  saccharification without pretreatment. Collectively, these data necessitate the  revision of currently accepted models of the lignin biosynthetic pathway.', '2013 Sep 6', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1241602', 'Boerjan']
