['19435754', 'Regulation of the number of cells is critical for development of multicellular  organisms. During plant epidermal development, a protodermal cell first makes a  fate decision of whether or not to be the meristemoid mother cell (MMC), which  undergoes asymmetric cell division forming a meristemoid and its sister cell. The  MMC-derived lineage produces all stomatal guard cells and a large proportion of  non-guard cells. We demonstrate that a small secretory peptide, EPIDERMAL  PATTERING FACTOR 2 (EPF2), is produced by the MMC and its early descendants, and  negatively regulates the density of guard and non-guard epidermal cells. Our  results suggest that EPF2 inhibits cells from adopting the MMC fate in a  non-cell-autonomous manner, thus limiting the number of MMCs. This feedback loop  is critical for regulation of epidermal cell density. The amino acid sequence of  EPF2 resembles that of EPF1, which is known to control stomatal positioning.  Over-expression of EPF1 also inhibits stomatal development, but EPF1 can act only  on a later developmental process than EPF2. Overexpression and promoter swapping  experiments suggested that the protein functions of EPF1 and EPF2, rather than  the expression patterns of the genes, are responsible for the specific functions.  Although targets of EPF1 and EPF2 are different, both EPF1 and EPF2 require  common putative receptor components TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM), ERECTA (ER), ERECTA  LIKE 1 (ERL1) and ERL2 in order to function.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcp068', 'Kakimoto']
