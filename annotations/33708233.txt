Agronomic traits such as heading date (HD), plant height (PH), thousand grain weight (TGW), and spike length (SL) are important factors affecting wheat yield. In this study, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using the Wheat55K SNP Array to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits in 207 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). A total of 37 QTLs were identified, including 9 QTLs for HD, 7 QTLs for PH, 12 QTLs for TGW, and 9 QTLs for SL, which explained 3.0-48.8% of the phenotypic variation. Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed based on sequencing data and used for validation of the stably detected QTLs on chromosomes 3A, 4B and 6A using 400 RILs. A QTL cluster on chromosome 4B for PH and TGW was delimited to a 0.8 Mb physical interval explaining 12.2-22.8% of the phenotypic variation. Gene annotations and analyses of SNP effects suggested that a gene encoding protein Photosynthesis Affected Mutant 68, which is essential for photosystem II assembly, is a candidate gene affecting PH and TGW. In addition, the QTL for HD on chromosome 3A was narrowed down to a 2.5 Mb interval, and a gene encoding an R3H domain-containing protein was speculated to be the causal gene influencing HD. The linked KASP markers developed in this study will be useful for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding, and the candidate genes provide new insight into genetic study for those traits in wheat.
