Recovery of photosynthesis in rehydrating desiccated leaves of the poikilochlorophyllous desiccation-tolerant plant Xerophyta scabrida was investigated. Detached leaves were remoistened under 12 h light/dark cycles for 96 h. Water, chlorophyll (Chl), and protein contents, Chl fluorescence, photosynthesis-CO(2) concentration response, and the amount and activity of Rubisco were measured at intervals during the rehydration period. Leaf relative water contents reached 87% in 12 h and full turgor in 96 h. Chl synthesis was slower before than after 24 h, and Chla:Chlb ratios changed from 0.13 to 2.6 in 48 h. The maximum quantum efficiency recovered faster during rehydration than the photosystem II operating efficiency and the efficiency factor, which is known to depend mainly on the use of the electron transport chain products. From 24 h to 96 h of rehydration, net carbon fixation was Rubisco limited, rather than electron transport limited. Total Rubisco activity increased during rehydration more than the Rubisco protein content. Desiccated leaves contained, in a close to functional state, more than half the amount of the Rubisco protein present in rehydrated leaves. The results suggest that in X. scabrida leaves Rubisco adopts a special, protective conformation and recovers its activity during rehydration through modifications in redox status.
