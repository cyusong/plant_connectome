Rhizosphere CO<sub>2</sub> is vital for crop growth, development, and productivity. However, the mechanisms of plants' responses to root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> are unclear. Oriental melons are sensitive to root-zone gas, often encountering high root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> during cultivation. We investigated root growth and nitrogen metabolism in oriental melons under T1 (0.5%) and T2 (1.0%) root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations using physiology and comparative transcriptome analysis. T1 and T2 increased root vigor and the nitrogen content in the short term. With increased treatment time and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, root inhibition increased, characterized by decreased root absorption, incomplete root cell structure, accelerated starch accumulation and hydrolysis, and cell aging. We identified 1280 and 1042 differentially expressed genes from T1 and T2, respectively, compared with 0.037% CO<sub>2</sub>-grown plants. Among them, 683 co-expressed genes are involved in stress resistance and nitrogen metabolism (enhanced phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, hormone signal transduction, glutathione metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism). Nitrogen metabolism gene expression, enzyme activity, and nitrogen content analyses showed that short-term elevated root-zone CO<sub>2</sub> mainly regulated plant nitrogen metabolism post-transcriptionally, and directly inhibited it transcriptionally in the long term. These findings provided a basis for further investigation of nitrogen regulation by candidate genes in oriental melons under elevated root-zone CO<sub>2</sub>.
