The application of nanotechnology in agriculture can remarkably improve the cultivation and growth of crop plants. Many studies showed that nanoparticles (NPs) made plants grow more vigorously. Light can make NPs aggregated, leading to the reduction of the NPs toxicity. In addition, treatment with NPs had a "hormesis effect" on plants. In this study, light-induced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by using the alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) extracts, and then the optimal synthetic condition was determined. Light-induced AgNPs were aggregated, spherical and pink, and they were coated with esters, phenols, acids, terpenes, amino acids and sugars, which were the compositions of alfalfa extracts. The concentration of free Ag<sup>+</sup> was less than 2 % of the AgNPs concentration. Through nanopriming, Ag<sup>+</sup> got into the seedlings and caused the impact of AgNPs on alfalfa. Compared with the control group, low concentration of light-induced AgNPs had a positive effect on the photosynthesis. It was also harmless to the leaf cells, and there was no elongation effect on shoots. Although high concentration of AgNPs was especially beneficial to root elongation, it had a slight toxic effect on seedlings due to the accumulation of silver. With the increase of AgNPs concentration, the content of silver in the seedlings increased and the silver enriched in plants was at the mg/kg level. Just as available research reported the toxicity of NPs can be reduced by using suitable synthesis and application methods, the present light induction, active material encapsulation and nanopriming minimized the toxicity of AgNPs to plants, enhancing the antioxidant enzyme system.
