Brassinosteroids (BRs) are known as one of the major classes of phytohormones essential for various processes during normal plant growth, development, and adaptations to biotic and abiotic stresses. Significant progress has been achieved on revealing mechanisms regulating BR biosynthesis, catabolism, and signaling in many crops and in model plant <i>Arabidopsis</i>. It is known that BRs control plant growth and development in a dosage-dependent manner. Maintenance of BR homeostasis is therefore critical for optimal functions of BRs. In this review, updated discoveries on mechanisms controlling BR homeostasis in higher plants in response to internal and external cues are discussed.

BR: !controls! Plant growth and development 
BR: !maintains! Homeostasis 
Internal/External cues: !regulate! BR homeostasis
