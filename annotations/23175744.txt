['23175744', 'Supramolecular organization of enzymes is proposed to orchestrate metabolic  complexity and help channel intermediates in different pathways. Phenylpropanoid  metabolism has to direct up to 30% of the carbon fixed by plants to the  biosynthesis of lignin precursors. Effective coupling of the enzymes in the  pathway thus seems to be required. Subcellular localization, mobility,  protein-protein, and protein-membrane interactions of four consecutive enzymes  around the main branch point leading to lignin precursors was investigated in  leaf tissues of Nicotiana benthamiana and cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. CYP73A5  and CYP98A3, the two Arabidopsis cytochrome P450s (P450s) catalyzing para- and  meta-hydroxylations of the phenolic ring of monolignols were found to colocalize  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to form homo- and heteromers. They moved  along with the fast remodeling plant ER, but their lateral diffusion on the ER  surface was restricted, likely due to association with other ER proteins. The  connecting soluble enzyme hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), was found partially  associated with the ER. Both HCT and the 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase relocalized  closer to the membrane upon P450 expression. Fluorescence lifetime imaging  microscopy supports P450 colocalization and interaction with the soluble  proteins, enhanced by the expression of the partner proteins. Protein  relocalization was further enhanced in tissues undergoing wound repair. CYP98A3  was the most effective in driving protein association.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.102566', 'Werck-Reichhart']
