The hairy root (HR) culture system is an excellent alternative strategy to the whole plant system for producing valuable compounds. However, selection of suitable <i>Agrobacterium</i> strain for the successful induction of HR is an essential step for enhanced production of beneficial secondary metabolites. In this study, we examined the transformation efficiency of various <i>A. rhizogenes</i> strains (ATCC 13333, ATCC 15834, A4, R1000, R1200, and R1601) for transgenic HRs induction in <i>Ocimum basilicum</i>. Among the tested strains, the R1601 was found to be one of the most promising strain for mass production of HR in terms of transformation efficiency (94%) and the number and length of HR (8.4 ± 0.52 and 1.68 ± 0.14 cm). The HR induced by the same strain exhibited highest levels of rosmarinic acid level (62.05 ± 4.94 µg/g DW) and total phenolic content (62.3 ± 4.95 µg/g DW). A total of 55 metabolites were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS). The PCA and PLS-DA plot of the identified metabolites showed that HR induced by A4 and ATCC 15834 displayed variation in primary and secondary metabolite contents. Analysis of the metabolic pathway identified a total of 56 pathways, among which 35 were found to be impacted. A heat map and hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that HR induced by different <i>Agrobacterium</i> strains exhibited differential metabolites profiles. In conclusion, <i>Agrobacterium</i> strains R1601 is one of the best and most promising strains for inducing mass HR production and enhanced levels of secondary metabolites in <i>O. basilicum</i>.
