['19965720', "Noncoding RNA is emerging as an important regulator of gene expression in many  organisms. We are characterizing RNA-mediated chromatin silencing of the  Arabidopsis major floral repressor gene, FLC. Through suppressor mutagenesis, we  identify a requirement for CstF64 and CstF77, two conserved RNA 3'-end-processing  factors, in FLC silencing. However, FLC sense transcript 3' processing is not  affected in the mutants. Instead, CstF64 and CstF77 are required for 3'  processing of FLC antisense transcripts. A specific RNA-binding protein directs  their activity to a proximal antisense polyadenylation site. This targeted  processing triggers localized histone demethylase activity and results in reduced  FLC sense transcription. Targeted 3' processing of antisense transcripts may be a  common mechanism triggering transcriptional silencing of the corresponding sense  gene.", '2010 Jan 1', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1180278', 'Dean']
