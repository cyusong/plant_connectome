Paeonia suffruticosa (PS) and Paeonia lactiflora (PL) belong to the only genus in the family Paeoniaceae. Comparative analysis of the spatial metabolomes of PS and PL has rarely been performed. In this work, combined with multiple matrixes and dual-polarity detection, high mass resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS imaging (MALDI MSI) and MALDI tandem MSI were performed on the root sections of the two Paeonia species. The spatial distributions of many metabolites including monoterpene and paeonol glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, saccharides and lipids were systematically characterized. The ambiguous tissue distribution of the two isomers paeoniflorin and albiflorin were distinguished by tandem MSI using lithium salt doped 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate matrix. In addition, the major intermediates involved in the biosynthetic pathway of gallotannins were successfully localized and visualized in the root sections. High-mass resolution MALDI full-scan MSI provides comprehensive and accurate spatial distribution of metabolites. The analytical power of the technique was further tested in the tandem MSI of two isomers. The ion images of individual metabolites provide chemical and microscopic characteristics beyond morphological identification, and the detailed spatiochemical information could not only improve our understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of hydrolyzable tannins, but also ensure the safety and effectiveness of their medicinal use.
