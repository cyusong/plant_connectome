We have previously reported the presence of an apyrase in Mimosa pudica. However, only limited information is available for this enzyme. Thus, in this study, the apyrase was purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of around 67 kD and was able to hydrolyze both nucleotide triphosphate and nucleotide diphosphate as substrates. The ratio of ATP to ADP hydrolysis velocity of the purified protein was 0.01 in the presence of calcium ion, showing extremely high substrate specificity toward ADP. Thus, we designated this novel apyrase as MP67. A cDNA clone of MP67 was obtained using primers designed from the amino acid sequence of trypsin-digested fragments of the protein. In addition, rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction was performed to clone a conventional apyrase (MpAPY2). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that MP67 is similar to ecto-apyrases; however, it was distinct from conventional apyrase based on phylogenetic classification. MP67 and MpAPY2 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified. The recombinant MP67 showed high substrate specificity toward ADP rather than ATP. A polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant MP67 was used to examine the tissue distribution and localization of native MP67 in the plant. The results showed that MP67 was ubiquitously distributed in various tissues, most abundantly in leaves, and was localized to plasma membranes. Thus, MP67 is a novel ecto-apyrase with extremely high substrate specificity for ADP.
