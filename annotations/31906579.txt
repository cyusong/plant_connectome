<b>:</b> <i>Dendrobium</i> are tropical orchid plants that host diverse endophytic fungi. The role of these fungi is not currently well understood in <i>Dendrobium</i> plants. We morphologically and molecularly identified these fungal endophytes, and created an efficient system for evaluating the pathogenicity and symptoms of endophytic fungi on <i>Dendrobium nobile</i> and <i>Dendrobium officinale</i> though in vitro co-culturing. ReThe colony morphological traits of <i>Dendrobium</i> myco-endophytes (DMEs) were recorded for their identification. Molecular identification revealed the presence of Colletotrichum tropicicola, Fusarium keratoplasticum, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Trichoderma longibrachiatum. The pathogenicity results revealed that T. longibrachiatum produced the least pathogenic effects against D. nobile protocorms. In seedlings, T. longibrachiatum showed the least pathogenic effects against D. officinale seedlings after seven days. C. tropicicola produced highly pathogenic effects against both Dendrobium seedlings. The results of histological examination of infected tissues revealed that F. keratoplasticum and T. longibrachiatum fulfill Koch's postulates for the existence of endophytes inside the living tissues. The DMEs are cross-transmitted inside the host plant cells, playing an important role in plant host development, resistance, and alkaloids stimulation.
