The development of nitrogen fixing root nodules is complex and involves an interplay of signaling processes. During maturation of plant host cells and their endocytosed rhizobia in symbiosomes, host cells and symbiosomes expand. This expansion is accompanied by a large quantity of membrane biogenesis. We recently characterized an AGC kinase gene, MtIRE, that could play a role in this expansion. MtIRE's expression coincides with host cell and symbiosome expansion in the proximal side of the invasion zone in developing Medicago truncatula nodules. MtIRE's closest homolog is the Arabidopsis AGC kinase family IRE gene, which regulates root hair elongation. AGC kinases are regulated by phospholipid signaling in animals and fungi as well as in the several instances where they have been studied in plants. Here we suggest that a phospholipid signaling pathway may also activate MtIRE activity and propose possible upstream activators of MtIRE protein's presumed AGC kinase activity.
