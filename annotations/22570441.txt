['22570441', 'Endomembrane proteins (EMPs), belonging to the evolutionarily conserved  transmembrane nine superfamily in yeast and mammalian cells, are characterized by  the presence of a large lumenal N terminus, nine transmembrane domains, and a  short cytoplasmic tail. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 12 EMP members  (EMP1 to EMP12), but little is known about their protein subcellular localization  and function. Here, we studied the subcellular localization and targeting  mechanism of EMP12 in Arabidopsis and demonstrated that (1) both endogenous EMP12  (detected by EMP12 antibodies) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-EMP12 fusion  localized to the Golgi apparatus in transgenic Arabidopsis plants; (2) GFP fusion  at the C terminus of EMP12 caused mislocalization of EMP12-GFP to reach  post-Golgi compartments and vacuoles for degradation in Arabidopsis cells; (3)  the EMP12 cytoplasmic tail contained dual sorting signals (i.e., an endoplasmic  reticulum export motif and a Golgi retention signal that interacted with COPII  and COPI subunits, respectively); and (4) the Golgi retention motif of EMP12  retained several post-Golgi membrane proteins within the Golgi apparatus in  gain-of-function analysis. These sorting signals are highly conserved in all  plant EMP isoforms and, thus, likely represent a general mechanism for EMP  targeting in plant cells.', '2012 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.096057', 'Jiang']
