Vacuoles and actin filaments are important cytoarchitectures involved in guard cell function. The changes in the morphology and number of vacuoles and the regulation of ion channel activity in tonoplast of guard cells are essential for stomatal movement. A number of studies have investigated the regulation of ion channels in animal and plant cells; however, little is known about the regulating mechanism for vacuolar dynamics in stomatal movement. Actin filaments of guard cells are remodelling with the changes in the stomatal aperture; however, the dynamic functions of actin filaments in stomatal movement remain elusive. In this paper, we summarize the recent developments in the understanding of the dynamics of actin filaments and vacuoles of guard cells during stomatal movement. All relevant studies suggest that actin filaments might be involved in stomatal movement by regulating vacuolar dynamics and the ion channels in tonoplast. The future study could be focused on the linker protein mediating the interaction between actin filaments and tonoplast, which will provide insights into the interactive function of actin and vacuole in stomatal movement regulation.
