The original domesticated carrots (<i>Daucus carota</i>) are thought to have been purple, accumulating large quantities of anthocyanins in their roots. A quantitative trait locus associated with anthocyanin pigmentation in purple carrot roots has been identified on chromosome 3 and includes two candidate genes, <i>DcMYB6</i> and <i>DcMYB7</i> Here, we characterized the functions of <i>DcMYB6</i> and <i>DcMYB7</i> in carrots. Overexpression of <i>DcMYB7</i>, but not <i>DcMYB6</i>, in the orange carrot 'Kurodagosun' led to anthocyanin accumulation in roots. Knockout of <i>DcMYB7</i> in the solid purple (purple periderm, phloem, and xylem) carrot 'Deep Purple' using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 system resulted in carrots with yellow roots. <i>DcMYB7</i> could activate the expression of its DcbHLH3 partner, a homolog of the anthocyanin-related apple (<i>Malus × domestica</i>) bHLH3, and structural genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. We determined that the promoter sequence of <i>DcMYB7</i> in nonpurple carrots was interrupted either by <i>DcMYB8</i>, a nonfunctional tandem duplication of <i>DcMYB7</i>, or by two transposons, leading to the transcriptional inactivation of <i>DcMYB7</i> in nonpurple carrot roots. As a result, nonpurple carrots fail to accumulate anthocyanins in their roots. Our study supports the hypothesis that another genetic factor suppresses <i>DcMYB7</i> expression in the phloem and xylem of purple peridermal carrot root tissues. <i>DcMYB7</i> also regulated the glycosylation and acylation of anthocyanins by directly activating <i>DcUCGXT1</i> and <i>DcSAT1</i> We reveal the genetic factors conditioning anthocyanin pigmentation in purple versus nonpurple carrot roots. Our results also provide insights into the mechanisms underlying anthocyanin glycosylation and acylation.
