The objective of this research was to investigate the differences between glaucous and non-glaucous near-isogenic lines (NILs) of winter rye (Secale cereale L.) in terms of epicuticular wax layer properties (weight, composition, and crystal morphology), selected physiological and biochemical responses, yield components, above-ground biomass, and plant height under soil drought stress. An important aspect of this analysis was to examine the correlation between the above characteristics. Two different NIL pairs were tested, each consisting of a typical glaucous line and a non-glaucous line with a recessive mutation. The drought experiment was conducted twice (2015-2016). Our study showed that wax accumulation during drought was not correlated with higher leaf hydration and glaucousness. Environmental factors had a large impact on the response of the lines to drought in individual years, both in terms of physiological and biochemical reactions, and the composition of epicuticular leaf wax. The analysed pairs displayed significantly different responses to drought. Demonstration of the correlation between the components of rye leaf wax and the physiological and biochemical parameters of rye NILs is a significant achievement of this work. Interestingly, the study showed a correlation between the wax components and the content of photosynthetic pigments and tocopherols, whose biosynthesis, similarly to the biosynthesis of wax precursors, is mainly located in chloroplasts. This suggests a relationship between wax biosynthesis and plant response to various environmental conditions and drought stress.
