Aluminum (Al) toxicity is one of the major constraints to agricultural production in acid soils. Molecular mechanisms of coping with Al toxicity have now been investigated in a range of plant species. Two main mechanisms of Al tolerance in plants are Al exclusion from the roots and the ability to tolerate Al in the roots. This review focuses on the recent discovery of novel genes and mechanisms that confer Al tolerance in plants and summarizes our understanding of the physiological, genetic, and molecular basis for plant Al tolerance. We hope this review will provide a theoretical basis for the genetic improvement of Al tolerance in plants.
