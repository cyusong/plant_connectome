Reproductive growth and vegetative growth are a pair of main contradictions in the process of plant growth. Flowering, as part of reproductive growth, is a key switch in the life cycle of higher plants, which affects the yield and economic benefits of plants to a certain extent. The Euphorbiaceae species, including castor bean (<i>Ricinus communis</i>), physic nut (<i>Jatropha curcas</i>), tung tree (<i>Vernicia fordii</i>), cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i>), and rubber tree (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>), have important economic values because they are raw materials for the production of biodiesel, rubber, etc. The flowering mechanisms are still excluded in the Euphorbiaceae species. The flowering-related genes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (Arabidopsis) were used as a reference to determine the orthologs of these genes in Euphorbiaceae genomes. The result showed that 146, 144, 114, 114, and 149 of 207 A<i>. thaliana</i> genes were respectively matched to <i>R. communis</i>, <i>V. fordii</i>, <i>J. curcas</i>, <i>H. brasiliensis</i>, and <i>M. esculenta</i>. These identified genes were clustered into seven pathways including gibberellins, floral meristem identity (FMI), vernalization, photoperiod, floral pathway integrators (FPIs), and autonomous pathways. Then, some key numbers of flowering-related genes are widely conserved in the Euphorbiaceae genomes including but not limited to FPI genes <i>LFY</i>, <i>SOC1</i>, <i>FT</i>, and FMI genes <i>AG</i>, <i>CAL</i>, and <i>FUL</i>. However, some genes, including <i>FRI</i>, <i>FLC</i>, and <i>GO</i>, were missing in several or all five Euphorbiaceae species. In this study, we proposed the putative mechanisms of flowering-related genes to control flowering and provided new candidate flowering genes for using marker-assisted breeding to improve variety quality.
