Fine roots of woody plants comprise multiple root orders, which can be functionally partitioned into two pools: absorptive fine roots (AFRs, orders 1, 2) and transport fine roots (TFRs, orders 3-5). However, the function-based fine-root dynamics and especially their responses to increased nitrogen (N) availability remain unclear. We explored dynamic responses of both AFRs and TFRs of Pinus elliottii to N addition in subtropical China based on a 4-yr minirhizotron experiment and a two-stage - early (0.5 yr) vs late (4 yr) - decomposition experiment. N addition increased the production, mortality, and turnover of AFRs but not TFRs. High rates of N persistently inhibited AFR decomposition but affected TFR decomposition differentially at the early (no effect) and late (negative effect) stages. The increased production of AFRs was driven by N-induced decrease in foliar and soil phosphorus (P) concentrations. The decreased decomposition of AFRs might be due to the increased acid-unhydrolyzable residues in decomposing roots. AFRs are the resource-acquiring module, the increased carbon allocation to AFRs may represent a P-acquiring strategy when N no longer limits growth of P. elliottii. Our results suggest that AFRs and TFRs respond differently to N deposition, both in terms of production, mortality, and turnover and in terms of decomposition.
