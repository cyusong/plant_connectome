['11006337', 'Recent studies suggest that cross-talk between salicylic acid (SA)-, jasmonic  acid (JA)-, and ethylene-dependent signaling pathways regulates plant responses  to both abiotic and biotic stress factors. Earlier studies demonstrated that  ozone (O(3)) exposure activates a hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death  pathway in the Arabidopsis ecotype Cvi-0. We now have confirmed the role of SA  and JA signaling in influencing O(3)-induced cell death. Expression of salicylate  hydroxylase (NahG) in Cvi-0 reduced O(3)-induced cell death. Methyl jasmonate  (Me-JA) pretreatment of Cvi-0 decreased O(3)-induced H(2)O(2) content and SA  concentrations and completely abolished O(3)-induced cell death. Cvi-0  synthesized as much JA as did Col-0 in response to O(3) exposure but exhibited  much less sensitivity to exogenous Me-JA. Analyses of the responses to O(3) of  the JA-signaling mutants jar1 and fad3/7/8 also demonstrated an antagonistic  relationship between JA- and SA-signaling pathways in controlling the magnitude  of O(3)-induced HR-like cell death.', '2000 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.9.1633', 'Davis']
