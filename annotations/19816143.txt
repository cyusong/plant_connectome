Using two ecotypes of <i>Stellaria longipes</i> with contrasting responses to shade, we found that plants can differ in their responses to similar light cues, reflecting adaptations to their natural habitat. It was also observed that the plants could distinguish between distinct shade signals. Furthermore, the activity of wall modifying proteins, expansins and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase(s) (XTHs) was regulated during these responses. However, only expansin activity and gene expression profiles correlated with observed growth trends. The differential expression of expansins was light signal specific and ecotype specific and could account for both the trends in growth and their magnitude. We have thus established a potential molecular basis for the observed plasticity in responses to shade.
