The Gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacterium <i>Xanthomonas euvesicatoria</i> is the causal agent of bacterial spot disease in pepper and tomato plants. Pathogenicity of <i>X. euvesicatoria</i> depends on a type III secretion (<i>T3S</i>) system which translocates effector proteins into plant cells and is associated with an extracellular pilus and a translocon in the plant plasma membrane. Effector protein translocation is activated by the cytoplasmic <i>T3S</i> chaperone HpaB which presumably targets effectors to the <i>T3S</i> system. We previously reported that HpaB is controlled by the translocated regulator HpaA which binds to and inactivates HpaB during the assembly of the <i>T3S</i> system. In the present study, we show that translocation of HpaA depends on the <i>T3S</i> substrate specificity switch protein HpaC and likely occurs after pilus and translocon assembly. Translocation of HpaA requires the presence of a translocation motif (TrM) in the N-terminal region. The TrM consists of an arginine-and proline-rich amino acid sequence and is also essential for the <i>in vivo</i> function of HpaA. Mutation of the TrM allowed the translocation of HpaA in <i>hpaB</i> mutant strains but not in the wild-type strain, suggesting that the recognition of the TrM depends on HpaB. Strikingly, the contribution of HpaB to the TrM-dependent translocation of HpaA was independent of the presence of the C-terminal HpaB-binding site in HpaA. We propose that HpaB generates a recognition site for the TrM at the <i>T3S</i> system and thus restricts the access to the secretion channel to effector proteins. Possible docking sites for HpaA at the <i>T3S</i> system were identified by <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> interaction studies and include the ATPase HrcN and components of the predicted cytoplasmic sorting platform of the <i>T3S</i> system. Notably, the TrM interfered with the efficient interaction of HpaA with several <i>T3S</i> system components, suggesting that it prevents premature binding of HpaA. Taken together, our data highlight a yet unknown contribution of the TrM and HpaB to substrate recognition and suggest that the TrM increases the binding specificity between HpaA and <i>T3S</i> system components.
