Although previous studies on N2-fixing legumes have demonstrated the contribution of acid phosphatases to their phosphorus (P) use efficiency under P-deficient growth conditions, localization of these enzymes in bean nodules has not been demonstrated. In this study, phosphoenol pyruvate phosphatase (PEPase) gene transcripts were localized within the nodule tissues of two recombinant inbred lines, RIL115 (P-deficiency tolerant) and RIL147 (P-deficiency sensitive), of Phaseolus vulgaris. Nodules were induced by Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 under hydroaeroponic conditions with a sufficient versus a deficient P supply. The results indicated that PEPase transcripts were particularly abundant in the nodule infected zone and cortex of both RILs. Analysis of fluorescence intensity indicated that nodule PEPase was induced under conditions of P deficiency to a significantly higher extent in RIL147 than in RIL115, and more in the inner cortex (91%) than in the outer cortex (71%) or the infected zone (79%). In addition, a significant increase (39%) in PEPase enzyme activity in the P-deficient RIL147 correlated with an increase (58%) in the efficiency of use in rhizobial symbiosis. It was concluded that nodule PEPase is upregulated under conditions of P deficiency in the P-deficiency-sensitive RIL147, and that this gene may contribute to adaptation of rhizobial symbiosis to low-P environments.
