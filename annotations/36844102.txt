The CorA / MGT / MRS2 family proteins are an important group of magnesium transporter proteins that maintain magnesium ion homeostasis in plant cells. However, little is known about the MGT functions in wheat. The known MGT sequences were used as queries to BlastP against wheat genome IWGSC RefSeq v2.1 assembly (E-value <10-5). Chromosome localization information for each <i>TaMGT</i> gene was obtained from the GFF3 file of the wheat genome data (IWGSCv2.1).The sequence of 1500 bp upstream of the <i>TaMGT</i> genes was extracted from the wheat genome data. The cis-elements were analyzed using PlantCARE online tool. A total of 24 <i>MGT</i> genes were identified on 18 chromosomes of wheat. After functional domain analysis, only <i>TaMGT1A</i>, <i>TaMGT1B</i>, and <i>TaMGT1D</i> had GMN mutations to AMN, while all the other genes had conserved GMN tripeptide motifs. Expression profiling showed that the <i>TaMGT</i> genes were differentially expressed under different stresses and at different growth and development stages. The expression levels of <i>TaMGT4B</i> and <i>TaMGT4A</i> were significantly up-regulated in cold damage. In addition, qRT-PCR results also confirmed that these <i>TaMGT</i> genes are involved in the wheat abiotic stress responses. In conclusion, The results of our research provide a theoretical basis for further research on the function of <i>TaMGT</i> gene family in wheat.
