Improved cytosine and adenine base editors and an efficient dual editor were applied in targeted evolution of ACETYL COA CARBOXYLASE in rice, resulting in the generation of dozens of herbicide-resistant mutations, at least three of which, W2125L, W2125Q and C2186H, have not been reported previously.
