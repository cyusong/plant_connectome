Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvere (Mediterranean corn borer, MCB) is the main pest of maize in the Mediterranean area. QTL for MCB stalk tunneling and grain yield under high MCB infestation had been located at bin 8.03-8.05 (4-21 cM and 10-30 cM respectively) in a previous analysis of the EP42 x EP39 RILs mapping population. The objective of the present work was to study with higher resolution those QTL, and validating and estimating with higher precision their locations and effects. To achieve this objective, we developed a set of 38 heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs) which were near-homozygous in the genome, except in the region under study. The HIFs were evaluated in multiple environments under artificial infestation with MCB and genotyped with SNPs. The QTL for grain yield under high infestation was confirmed with higher precision and improved reliability at 112.6-116.9 Mb. On the contrary, the location of the QTL for stalk tunneling was not validated probably due to the fixation of some genomic regions during the development of the HIFs. Our study confirmed that the co-localization of the QTL for stalk tunneling and grain yield in the previous study was due to linked genes, not to pleiotropic effects. So, the QTL for grain yield can be used for improving grain yield without undesirable effect on stalk tunneling. The HIF analysis is useful for validating QTL and for conducting deeper studies in traits related to corn borer resistance.
