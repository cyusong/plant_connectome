GhBASS5 is a member of the bile acid sodium symporter (BASS) gene family from cotton and a plastid-localized Na<sup>+</sup> transporter that negatively regulates salt tolerance of plants. Soil salinization is a major constraint on global cotton production, and Na<sup>+</sup> is the most dominant toxic ion in salinity stress. Hence, insights into the identities and properties of transporters that catalyze Na<sup>+</sup> movement between different tissues and within the cell compartments are vital to understand the salt-tolerant mechanisms of plants. Here, we identified the GhBASS5 gene, a member of the bile acid sodium symporter (BASS) gene family from cotton, served as a plastidic Na<sup>+</sup> transporter. GhBASS5 encodes a membrane protein localized in the plastid envelope. It was highly expressed in cotton roots and predominantly existed in the vascular cylinder. Heterogenous expression of GhBASS5 in Arabidopsis chloroplasts promoted Na<sup>+</sup> uptake into chloroplasts, which contributed to an increased cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. And GhBASS5-overexpressed transgenic plants showed an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> translocation from roots to shoots and an elevated Na<sup>+</sup> content in both roots and shoots, but a dramatic decrease in the Na<sup>+</sup> efflux from root tissues and the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, especially under salt stress conditions. Furthermore, overexpressing GhBASS5 greatly damaged plastid functions and enhanced salt sensitivity in transgenic Arabidopsis when compared with wild-type plants under salt stress. Additionally, the salt-responsive transporter genes that regulate K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis were dramatically expressed in GhBASS5-overexpressed lines, especially under salt stress conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that GhBASS5 is a plastid-localized Na<sup>+</sup> transporter, and high expression of GhBASS5 impairs salt tolerance of plants via increasing Na<sup>+</sup> transportation and accumulation at both cell and tissue levels.
