['30252137', 'Plant-specific EFFECTORS OF TRANSCRIPTION (ET) are characterised by a variable  number of highly conserved ET repeats, which are involved in zinc and DNA  binding. In addition, ETs share a GIY-YIG domain, involved in DNA nicking  activity. It was hypothesised that ETs might act as epigenetic regulators. Here,  methylome, transcriptome and phenotypic analyses were performed to investigate  the role of ET factors and their involvement in DNA methylation in Arabidopsis  thaliana. Comparative DNA methylation and transcriptome analyses in flowers and  seedlings of et mutants revealed ET-specific differentially expressed genes and  mostly independently characteristic, ET-specific differentially methylated  regions. Loss of ET function results in pleiotropic developmental defects. The  accumulation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers after ultraviolet stress in et  mutants suggests an ET function in DNA repair.', '2019 Jan', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.15439', 'ORCID:']
