The phosphate uptake potential was significantly stimulated with low concentration of salicylic acid (SA). In one of the wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum Var. Sonalika), 50 microM SA stimulated phosphate (PO(4)(3-)) uptake. At higher concentrations of SA (500 and 1000 microM), the rate of uptake was reduced. These findings underscore the light and dose-dependent biphasic action of SA: a low 50 microM stimulated, and high concentrations 500 and 1000 microM inhibited, PO(4)(3-) uptake.

SA: !stimulates! PO(4)(3-) uptake
SA: !inhibits! PO(4)(3-) uptake
