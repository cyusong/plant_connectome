Fine roots of trees exhibit varying degree of plasticity to adapt to environmental stress. Although the morphological and physiological plasticity of roots has been well studied, less known are the accompanying changes in the chemical composite (chemical plasticity) of fine roots, which regulates both root function and soil carbon sequestration. We investigated the changes in quantity, composition and localization of phenolic compounds in fine root orders of Quercus alba and Quercus rubra subjected to drought stress. In both species the total quantity of lignins varied only by root orders, where the distal (first and second) root orders had lower lignin compared to higher orders. Despite a lower lignin content, the distal root orders had higher content of guaiacyl lignin and bound phenolics that would provide a greater meshing of lignocellulosic matrix, and thus a higher tissue integrity. Unlike lignins, drought altered the quantity and composition of tannins. In Q. alba, the ellagitannins decreased in the distal root orders exposed to drought, while the fiber-bound condensed tannnins increased. The lower content of ellagitannins with antimicrobial properties under drought reveals an adaptive response by fine roots to promote symbiotic association, as evidenced by the higher colonization of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Our study revealed that, when exposed to drought, the composition of heteropolymers are strategically varied across fine root orders, so as to provide a greater root function without compromising the tissue protection.
