*The photobionts of lichens have previously been shown to reversibly inactivate their photosystem II (PSII) upon desiccation, presumably as a photoprotective mechanism. The mechanism and the consequences of this process have been investigated in the green algal lichen Lobaria pulmonaria. *Lichen thalli were collected from a shaded and a sun-exposed site. The activation of PSII was followed by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. *Inactivation of PSII, as indicated by the total loss of variable fluorescence, was accompanied by a strong decrease of basal fluorescence (F(0)). Sun-grown thalli, as well as thalli exposed to low irradiance during drying, showed a larger reduction of F(0) than shade-grown thalli or thalli desiccated in the dark. Desiccation increased phototolerance, which was positively correlated to enhanced quenching of F(0). Quenching of F(0) could be reversed by heating, and could be inhibited by glutaraldehyde but not by the uncoupler nigericin. *Activation of energy dissipation, apparent as F(0) quenching, is proposed to be based on an alteration in the conformation of a pigment protein complex. This permits thermal energy dissipation and gives considerable flexibility to photoprotection. Zeaxanthin formation apparently did not contribute to the enhancement of photoprotection by desiccation in the light. Light-induced absorbance changes indicated the involvement of chlorophyll and carotenoid cation radicals.
