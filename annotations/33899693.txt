Almost all life activities of plants are accompanied by electrophysiological information. Plant's electrical parameters are considered to be the fastest response to environment. In this study, the theoretically intrinsic relationships between the clamping force and leaf resistance (R) and inductive reactance (XL) were revealed as 3-parameter exponential decay based on bioenergetics for the first time. The intrinsic resistance (IR), capacitive reactance (IXc), inductive reactance (IXL), impedance (IZ), and capacitance (IC) in plant leaves were successfully monitored. The nutrient flux per unit area (UNF), nutrient transfer rate (NTR) and nutrient transport capacity (NTC) in plants based on IR, IXc, IXL, IZ and IC were defined to reflect nutrient transport characteristics. The results indicate that IXc and IXL could be used to manifest the relative composition characteristics of cell membrane proteins, and are inversely proportional to the amount of surface and binding proteins that induce membrane Xc and XL in plant leaves, respectively. UNF, NTR or NTC exhibited good correlations with crude protein or crude ash, and accurately revealed the nutrient transport strategies of tested plants and their diversity. This study highlights that plant's electrophysiological information could effectively manifest the composition and nutrient transport characteristics of membrane proteins in plant cells.
