Wheat seedlings (Triticum durum Desf.) were incubated in a solution containing 100 microM CuSO(4) for increasing time ranging from 1 min to 6h. Copper rapidly accumulated into the roots, and its amount increased significantly until 360 min. During the experiment, copper did not cause any lipid peroxidation and K(+) leakage. Up to 60 min of copper treatment the superoxide (O2(*-)) production in root apoplast decreased concomitantly with increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In contrast, after 60 min of incubation, SOD decreased and this facilitated an increase in O2(*-) production. In the presence of the SOD inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid, O2(*-) production was more than two times higher and showed a biphasic increase. Very high SOD activity in the apoplast, due to the presence of three different isozymes, one Mn-SOD and two CuZn-SODs, dismutated the radical giving rise, at least in part, to an increase in hydrogen peroxide. The highest value of H(2)O(2) was detected at 15 min, when peroxidase (POD) activity reached the lowest value. Root apoplast showed the presence of at least five different isoforms of PODs, whose pattern did not change during the entire treatment.
