['23071452', 'In eukaryotic cells, environmental and developmental signals alter chromatin  structure and modulate gene expression. Heterochromatin constitutes the  transcriptionally inactive state of the genome and in plants and mammals is  generally characterized by DNA methylation and histone modifications such as  histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DNA methylation  and H3K9 methylation are usually colocated and set up a mutually self-reinforcing  and stable state. Here, in contrast, we found that SUVR5, a plant Su(var)3-9  homolog with a SET histone methyltransferase domain, mediates H3K9me2 deposition  and regulates gene expression in a DNA methylation-independent manner. SUVR5  binds DNA through its zinc fingers and represses the expression of a subset of  stimulus response genes. This represents a novel mechanism for plants to regulate  their chromatin and transcriptional state, which may allow for the adaptability  and modulation necessary to rapidly respond to extracellular cues.', '2012', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1002995', 'Jacobsen']
