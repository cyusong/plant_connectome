Phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases add three methyl groups successively to their substrate to produce phosphocholine, an important precursor for phospholipid biosynthesis in diverse organisms. New work from Lee and Jez reveals critical domain movements that explain how multiple methylation reactions are uniquely coordinated by plant methyltransferases and provides insights into the evolution of this class of enzymes. As opposed to closely related family members, the intermediates in this pathway are likely shuttled between two tethered domains to ensure complete methylation.
