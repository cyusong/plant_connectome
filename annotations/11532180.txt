['11532180', 'Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), an intermediate in biosynthesis and  degradation of proline (Pro), is assumed to play a role in cell death in plants  and animals. Toxicity of external Pro and P5C supply to Arabidopsis suggested  that P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH; EC 1.2.1.12) plays a crucial role in this process  by degrading the toxic Pro catabolism intermediate P5C. Also in a Deltaput2 yeast  mutant, lacking P5CDH, Pro led to growth inhibition and formation of reactive  oxygen species (ROS). Complementation of the Deltaput2 mutant allowed  identification of the Arabidopsis P5CDH gene. AtP5CDH is a single-copy gene and  the encoded protein was localized to the mitochondria. High homology of AtP5CDH  to LuFIS1, an mRNA up-regulated during susceptible pathogen attack in flax,  suggested a role for P5CDH in inhibition of hypersensitive reactions. An  Arabidopsis mutant (cpr5) displaying a constitutive pathogen response was found  to be hypersensitive to external Pro. In agreement with a role in prevention of  cell death, AtP5CDH was expressed at a basal level in all tissues analysed. The  highest expression was found in flowers that are known to contain the highest Pro  levels under normal conditions. External supply of Pro induced AtP5CDH  expression, but much more slowly than Pro dehydrogenase (AtProDH) expression.  Uncoupled induction of the AtProDH and AtP5CDH genes further supports the  hypothesis that P5C levels have to be tightly controlled. These results indicate  that, in addition to the well-studied functions of Pro, for example in  osmoregulation, the Pro metabolism intermediate P5C also serves as a regulator of  cellular stress responses.', '2001 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01101.x', 'Frommer']
