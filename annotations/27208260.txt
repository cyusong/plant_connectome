Previously the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) zinc finger protein OXIDATIVE STRESS2 (AtOXS2) and four OXS2-like (AtO2L) family members were described to play a role in stress tolerance and stress escape. For stress escape, SOC1 was a target of AtOXS2. However, for stress tolerance, the downstream targets were not identified. We cloned two OXS2 homolog genes from sweet corn, ZmOXS2b and ZmO2L1 Both genes are transiently inducible by Cd treatment. When expressed in Arabidopsis, each enhances tolerance against cadmium. Further analysis showed that ZmOXS2b and ZmO2L1 proteins enhance Cd tolerance in Arabidopsis by activating at least one target gene, that encoding a putative S-adenosyl-l-Met-dependent methyltransferase superfamily protein (AT5G37990), which we named CIMT1 This activation involves the in vivo interaction with a segment of the CIMT1 promoter that contains a BOXS2 motif previously identified as the binding element for AtOXS2. More importantly, CIMT1 is induced by Cd treatment, and overexpression of this gene alone was sufficient to enhance Cd tolerance in Arabidopsis. The connection of ZmOXS2b and ZmO2L1 to Arabidopsis CIMT1 suggests a similar network may exist in maize (Zea mays) and may provide a clue to possibly using a CIMT1 maize homolog to engineer stress tolerance in a major crop.
