Late blight of potato, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is a devastating disease that can cause the rapid death of plants. To investigate the molecular basis of this compatible interaction, potato cDNA microarrays were utilized to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the host during a compatible interaction with P. infestans. Of the 7,680 cDNA clones represented on the array, 643 (12.9%) were differentially expressed in infected plants as compared with mock-inoculated control plants. These genes were classified into eight groups using a nonhierarchical clustering method with two clusters (358 genes) generally down-regulated, three clusters (241 genes) generally up-regulated, and three clusters (44 genes) with a significant change in expression at only one timepoint. Three genes derived from two down-regulated clusters were evaluated further, using reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. For these analyses, both incompatible and compatible interactions were included to determine if suppression of these genes was specific to compatibility. One gene, plastidic carbonic anhydrase (CA), was found to have a very different expression pattern in compatible vs. incompatible interactions. Virus-induced gene silencing was used to suppress expression of this gene in Nicotiana benthamiana. In CA-silenced plants, the pathogen grew more quickly, indicating that suppression of CA increases susceptibility to P. infestans.
