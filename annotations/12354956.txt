['12354956', 'Visual examination of roots from 12,000 mutagenized Arabidopsis seedlings has led  to the identification of more than 40 mutants impaired in root hair  morphogenesis. Mutants from four phenotypic classes have been characterized in  detail, and genetic tests show that these result from single nuclear recessive  mutations in four different genes designated RHD1, RHD2, RHD3, and RHD4. The  phenotypic analysis of the mutants and homozygous double mutants has led to a  proposed model for root hair development and the stages at which the genes are  normally required. The RHD1 gene product appears to be necessary for proper  initiation of root hairs, whereas the RHD2, RHD3, and RHD4 gene products are  required for normal hair elongation. These results demonstrate that root hair  development in Arabidopsis is amenable to genetic dissection and should prove to  be a useful model system to study the molecular mechanisms governing cell  differentiation in plants.', '1990 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.2.3.235', 'Somerville']
