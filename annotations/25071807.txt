['25071807', 'The Sucrose non-Fermenting Related Kinase 1 (SnRK1) proteins have been linked to  regulation of energy and stress signaling in eukaryotes. In plants, there is a  small SnRK1 gene family. While the SnRK1.1 gene has been well studied, the role  other SnRK1 isoforms play in energy or stress signaling is less well understood.  We used promoter:GUS analysis and found SnRK1.1 is broadly expressed, while  SnRK1.2 is spatially restricted. SnRK1.2 is expressed most abundantly in  hydathodes, at the base of leaf primordia, and in vascular tissues within both  shoots and roots. We examined the impact that sugars have on SnRK1 gene  expression and found that trehalose induces SnRK1.2 expression. Given that the  SnRK1.1 and SnRK1.2 proteins are very similar at the amino acid level, we sought  to address whether SnRK1.2 is capable of re-programming growth and development as  has been seen previously with SnRK1.1 overexpression. While gain-of-function  transgenic plants overexpressing two different isoforms of SnRK1.1 flower late as  seen previously in other SnRK1.1 overexpressors, SnRK1.2 overexpressors flower  early. In addition, SnRK1.2 overexpressors have increased leaf size and rosette  diameter during early development, which is the opposite of SnRK1.1  overexpressors. We also investigated whether SnRK1.2 was localized to similar  subcellular compartments as SnRK1.1, and found that both accumulate in the  nucleus and cytoplasm in transient expression assays. In addition, we found  SnRK1.1 accumulates in small puncta that appear after a mechanical wounding  stress. Together, these data suggest key differences in regulation of the SnRK1.1  and SnRK1.2 genes in plants, and highlights differences overexpression of each  gene has on the development of Arabidopsis.', '2014', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2014.00324', 'Gillaspy']
