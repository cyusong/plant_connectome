Recent results suggest that metabolism-mediated stomatal closure mechanisms are important to regulate differentially the stomatal speediness between ferns and angiosperms. However, evidence directly linking mesophyll metabolism and the slower stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ) in ferns is missing. Here, we investigated the effect of exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA), sucrose and mannitol on stomatal kinetics and carried out a metabolic fingerprinting analysis of ferns and angiosperms leaves harvested throughout a diel course. Fern stomata did not respond to ABA in the time period analysed. No differences in the relative decrease in g<sub>s</sub> was observed between ferns and the angiosperm following provision of sucrose or mannitol. However, ferns have slower g<sub>s</sub> responses to these compounds than angiosperms. Metabolomics analysis highlights that ferns have a higher accumulation of secondary rather than primary metabolites throughout the diel course, with the opposite being observed in angiosperms. Our results indicate that metabolism-mediated stomatal closure mechanisms underpin the differential stomatal speediness regulation among ferns and angiosperms, in which the slower stomatal closure in ferns is associated with the lack of ABA-responsiveness, to a reduced capacity to respond to mesophyll-derived sucrose and to a higher carbon allocation toward secondary metabolism, which likely modulates both photosynthesis-g<sub>s</sub> and growth-stress tolerance trade-offs.
