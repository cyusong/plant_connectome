Programmed cell death (PCD) is a highly conserved cellular suicide process important in developmental processes and elimination of damaged cells upon environmental stresses. Among the important regulators of PCD, much interest has been centered on BCL2-associated x protein (BAX) as the pro-PCD factor. On the other hand, BAX inhibitor-1 (BI-1) has been implicated as an anti-PCD factor that balances out the activity of BAX in the developmental processes and responses to environment. A cDNA clone coding a BI-1 gene was isolated from a cDNA library of heat-stressed hot pepper (Capsicum annuum) and named as CaBI-1. This gene contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 248 amino acids encoding a BI-1 protein. Genomic DNA-blot analysis for CaBI-1 suggested one or two loci in the C. annuum genome. Transcription of CaBI-1 was induced in response to high or low temperatures, drought, high salinity, flooding and heavy metal stresses, and ABA. We introduced the ORF of CaBI-1 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (P(35S)) into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Wisconsin 38) genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The P(35S):CaBI-1 transgenic plants displayed markedly improved tolerance to high temperature, water deficit, and high salinity in comparison to the control plants. The results indicate that CaBI-1 is a BI-1 gene of which expression induced under various abiotic stresses and endows tolerance to several types of environmental stresses.
