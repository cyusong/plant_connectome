The genetics underlying Cyto-Nuclear Incompatibility (CNI) was studied in <i>Pelargonium</i> interspecific hybrids. We created hybrids of 12 closely related crop wild relatives (CWR) with the ornamental <i>P.</i> × <i>hortorum</i>. Ten of the resulting 12 (F<sub>1</sub>) interspecific hybrids segregate for chlorosis suggesting biparental plastid inheritance. The segregation ratios of the interspecific F<sub>2</sub> populations show nuclear interactions of one, two, or three nuclear genes regulating plastid function dependent on the parents. We further validated that biparental inheritance of plastids is common in section <i>Ciconium</i>, using diagnostic PCR primers. Our results pave the way for using the diverse species from section <i>Ciconium</i>, each with its own set of characteristics, as novel sources of desired breeding traits for <i>P.</i> × <i>hortorum</i> cultivars.
