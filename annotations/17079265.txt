['17079265', 'In flowering plants, sperm cells develop in the pollen cytoplasm and are  transported through floral tissues to an ovule by a pollen tube, a highly  polarized cellular extension. After targeting an ovule, the pollen tube bursts,  releasing two sperm that fertilize an egg and a central cell. Here, we identified  the gene encoding Arabidopsis HAP2, demonstrating that it is allelic to GCS1.  HAP2 is expressed only in the haploid sperm and is required for efficient pollen  tube guidance to ovules. We identified an insertion (hap2-1) that disrupts the  C-terminal portion of the protein and tags mutant pollen grains with the  beta-glucuronidase reporter. By monitoring reporter expression, we showed that  hap2-1 does not diminish pollen tube length in vitro or in the pistil, but it  reduces ovule targeting by twofold. In addition, we show that the hap2 sperm that  are delivered to ovules fail to initiate fertilization. HAP2 is predicted to  encode a protein with an N-terminal secretion signal, a single transmembrane  domain and a C-terminal histidine-rich domain. These results point to a dual role  for HAP2, functioning in both pollen tube guidance and in fertilization.  Moreover, our findings suggest that sperm, long considered to be passive cargo,  are involved in directing the pollen tube to its target.', '2006 Dec', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02683', 'Preuss']
