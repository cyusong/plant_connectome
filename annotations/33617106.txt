Secretions from glandular trichomes potentially protect plants against a variety of aggressors. In the tomato clade of the Solanum genus, glandular trichomes of wild species produce a rich source of chemical diversity at the leaf surface. Previously, 7-epi-zingiberene produced in several accessions of Solanum habrochaites was found to confer resistance to whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) and other insect pests. Here, we report the identification and characterisation of 9-hydroxy-zingiberene (9HZ) and 9-hydroxy-10,11-epoxyzingiberene (9H10epoZ), two derivatives of 7-epi-zingiberene produced in glandular trichomes of S. habrochaites LA2167. Using a combination of transcriptomics and genetics, we identified a gene coding for a cytochrome P450 oxygenase, ShCYP71D184, that is highly expressed in trichomes and co-segregates with the presence of the zingiberene derivatives. Transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that ShCYP71D184 carries out two successive oxidations to generate 9HZ and 9H10epoZ. Bioactivity assays showed that 9-hydroxy-10,11-epoxyzingiberene in particular exhibits substantial toxicity against B. tabaci and various microorganisms including Phytophthora infestans and Botrytis cinerea. Our work shows that trichome secretions from wild tomato species can provide protection against a wide variety of organisms. In addition, the availability of the genes encoding the enzymes for the pathway of 7-epi-zingiberene derivatives makes it possible to introduce this trait in cultivated tomato by precision breeding.
