['22786889', 'The LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) DOMAIN (LBD) gene family encodes  plant-specific transcriptional regulators functioning in organ development. In a  screen of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sequence-indexed transferred DNA  insertion mutants, we found disruption of the LOB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN20  (LBD20) gene led to increased resistance to the root-infecting vascular wilt  pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. In wild-type plants, LBD20 transcripts were barely  detectable in leaves but abundant in roots, where they were further induced after  F. oxysporum inoculation or methyl jasmonate treatment. Induction of LBD20  expression in roots was abolished in coronatine insensitive1 (coi1) and myc2  (allelic to jasmonate insensitive1) mutants, suggesting LBD20 may function in  jasmonate (JA) signaling. Consistent with this, expression of the JA-regulated  THIONIN2.1 (Thi2.1) and VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN2 (VSP2) genes were  up-regulated in shoots of lbd20 following treatment of roots with F. oxysporum or  methyl jasmonate. However, PLANT DEFENSIN1.2 expression was unaltered, indicating  a repressor role for LBD20 in a branch of the JA-signaling pathway. Plants  overexpressing LBD20 (LBD20-OX) had reduced Thi2.1 and VSP2 expression. There was  a significant correlation between increased LBD20 expression in the LBD20-OX  lines with both Thi2.1 and VSP2 repression, and reduced survival following F.  oxysporum infection. Chlorosis resulting from application of F. oxysporum culture  filtrate was also reduced in lbd20 leaves relative to the wild type. Taken  together, LBD20 is a F. oxysporum susceptibility gene that appears to regulate  components of JA signaling downstream of COI1 and MYC2 that are required for full  elicitation of F. oxysporum- and JA-dependent responses. To our knowledge, this  is the first demonstration of a role for a LBD gene family member in either  biotic stress or JA signaling.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.199067', 'Manners']
