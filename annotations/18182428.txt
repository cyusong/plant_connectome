The accumulation of compatible solutes is often regarded as a basic strategy for the protection and survival of plants under abiotic stress conditions, including both salinity and oxidative stress. In this work, a possible causal link between the ability of contrasting barley genotypes to accumulate/synthesize compatible solutes and their salinity stress tolerance was investigated. The impact of H(2)O(2) (one of the components of salt stress) on K(+) flux (a measure of stress 'severity') and the mitigating effects of glycine betaine and proline on NaCl-induced K(+) efflux were found to be significantly higher in salt-sensitive barley genotypes. At the same time, a 2-fold higher accumulation of leaf and root proline and leaf glycine betaine was found in salt-sensitive cultivars. The total amino acid content was also less affected by salinity in salt-tolerant cultivars. In these, potassium was found to be the main contributor to cytoplasmic osmolality, while in salt-sensitive genotypes, glycine betaine and proline contributed substantially to cell osmolality, compensating for reduced cytosolic K(+). Significant negative correlations (r= -0.89 and -0.94) were observed between Na(+)-induced K(+) efflux (an indicator of salt tolerance) and leaf glycine betaine and proline. These results indicate that hyperaccumulation of known major compatible solutes in barley does not appear to play a major role in salt-tolerance, but rather, may be a symptom of salt-susceptibility.
