Anthocyanins have long been suggested as having great potential in offering photoprotection to plants facing high light irradiance. Nonetheless, their effective ability in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from supernumerary photons has been questioned by some authors, based upon the inexact belief that anthocyanins almost exclusively absorb green photons, which are poorly absorbed by chlorophylls. Here we focus on the blue light absorbing features of anthocyanins, a neglected issue in anthocyanin research. Anthocyanins effectively absorb blue photons: the absorbance of blue relative to green photons increases from tri- to mono-hydroxy B-ring substituted structures, reaching up to 50% of green photons absorption. We offer a comprehensive picture of the molecular events activated by low blue-light availability, extending our previous analysis in purple and green basil, which we suggest to be responsible for the "shade syndrome" displayed by cyanic leaves. While purple leaves display overexpression of genes promoting chlorophyll biosynthesis and light harvesting, in green leaves it is the genes involved in the stability/repair of photosystems that are largely overexpressed. As a corollary, this adds further support to the view of an effective photoprotective role of anthocyanins. We discuss the profound morpho-anatomical adjustments imposed by the epidermal anthocyanin shield, which reflect adjustments in light harvesting capacity under imposed shade and make complex the analysis of the photosynthetic performance of cyanic versus acyanic leaves.
