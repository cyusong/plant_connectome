In S-RNase-mediated self-incompatibility, S-RNase secreted from the style destroys the actin cytoskeleton of the self-pollen tubes, eventually halting their growth, but the mechanism of this process remains unclear. In vitro biochemical assays revealed that S-RNase does not bind or sever filamentous actin (F-actin). In apple (Malus domestica), we identified an actin-binding protein containing myosin, villin and GRAM (MdMVG), that physically interacts with S-RNase and directly binds and severs F-actin. Immunofluorescence assays and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicated that S-RNase inhibits the F-actin-severing activity of MdMVG in vitro. In vivo, the addition of S-RNase to self-pollen tubes increased the fluorescence intensity of actin microfilaments and reduced the severing frequency of microfilaments and the rate of pollen tube growth in self-pollination induction in the presence of MdMVG overexpression. By generating 25 single-, double- and triple-point mutations in the amino acid motif E-E-K-E-K of MdMVG via mutagenesis and testing the resulting mutants with immunofluorescence, we identified a triple-point mutant, MdMVG<sup>(E167A/E171A/K185A)</sup> , that no longer has F-actin-severing activity or interacts with any of the four S-haplotype S-RNases, indicating that all three amino acids (E167, E171 and K185) are essential for the severing activity of MdMVG and its interaction with S-RNases. We conclude that apple S-RNase interacts with MdMVG to reduce self-pollen tube growth by inhibiting its F-actin-severing activity.
