Root-knot nematodes (RKN) are highly specialized, obligatory plant parasites. These animals reprogram root cells to form large, multinucleate, and metabolically active feeding cells (giant cells) that provide a continuous nutrient supply during 3-6 weeks of the nematode's life. The establishment and maintenance of physiologically fully functional giant cells are necessary for the survival of these nematodes. As such, giant cells may be useful targets for applying strategies to reduce damage caused by these nematodes, aiming the reduction of their reproduction. We have recently reported the involvement of cell cycle inhibitors of Arabidopsis, named Kip-Related Proteins (KRPs), on nematode feeding site ontogeny. Our results have demonstrated that this family of cell cycle inhibitors can be envisaged to efficiently disrupt giant cell development, based on previous reports which showed that alterations in KRP concentration levels can induce cell cycle transitions. Herein, we demonstrated that by overexpressing KRP genes, giant cells development is severely compromised as well as nematode reproduction. Thus, control of root-knot nematodes by modulating cell cycle-directed pathways through the enhancement of KRP protein levels may serve as an attractive strategy to limit damage caused by these plant parasites.
