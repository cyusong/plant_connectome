['22675210', 'In a reverse genetics screen based on a group of genes enriched for  development-related Polycomb group targets in the apex (DPAs), we isolated DPA4  as a novel regulator of leaf margin shape. T-DNA insertion lines in the DPA4  locus display enhanced leaf margin serrations and enlarged petals, whereas  overexpression of DPA4 results in smooth margins. DPA4 encodes a putative RAV  (Related to ABI3/VP1) transcriptional repressor and is expressed in the lateral  organ boundary region and in the sinus of leaf serrations. DPA4 expression  domains overlap with those of the known leaf shape regulator CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON  2 (CUC2) and we provide evidence that DPA4 negatively regulates CUC2 expression  independently of MIR164A, an established regulator of CUC2. Taken together, the  data suggest DPA4 as a newly identified player in the signalling network that  controls leaf serrations in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2012 Jul', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.078618', 'Turck']
