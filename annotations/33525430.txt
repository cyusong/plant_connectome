Plants adjust their growth and development through a sophisticated regulatory system integrating endogenous and exogenous cues. Many of them rely on intricate crosstalk between nutrients and hormones, an effective way of coupling nutritional and developmental information and ensuring plant survival. Sugars in their different forms such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and trehalose-6-P and the hormone family of cytokinins (CKs) are major regulators of the shoot and root functioning throughout the plant life cycle. While their individual roles have been extensively investigated, their combined effects have unexpectedly received little attention, resulting in many gaps in current knowledge. The present review provides an overview of the relationship between sugars and CKs signaling in the main developmental transition during the plant lifecycle, including seed development, germination, seedling establishment, root and shoot branching, leaf senescence, and flowering. These new insights highlight the diversity and the complexity of the crosstalk between sugars and CKs and raise several questions that will open onto further investigations of these regulation networks orchestrating plant growth and development.
