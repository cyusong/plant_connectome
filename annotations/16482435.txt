Plants protect themselves against pathogens using a range of response mechanisms. There are two categories of nonhost resistance: Type I, which does not result in visible cell death; and Type II, which entails localized programmed cell death (or hypersensitive response) in response to nonhost pathogens. The genes responsible for these two systems have not yet been intensively investigated at the molecular level. Using tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum), we compared expression of 12 defense-related genes between a Type I (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines 8ra) nonhost interaction, and two Type II (Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121) nonhost interactions, as well as those expressed during R gene-mediated resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus. In general, expression of most defense-related genes during R gene-mediated resistance was activated 48 h after challenge by TMV; the same genes were upregulated as early as 9 h after infiltration by nonhost pathogens. Surprisingly, X. axonopodis pv. glycines (Type I) elicited the same set of defense-related genes as did two pathovars of P. syringae, despite the absence of visible cell death. In two examples of Type II nonhost interactions, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 produced an expression profile more closely resembling that of X. axonopodis pv. glycines 8ra, than that of P. syringae pv. syringae 61. These results suggest that Type I nonhost resistance may act as a mechanism providing a more specific and active defense response against a broad range of potential pathogens.
