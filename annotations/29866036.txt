BcGs1, a cell wall-degrading enzyme (CWDE), was originally derived from Botrytis cinerea. Our previous study revealed that BcGs1 could trigger defense responses and protect plants against various pathogens. We researched the defense response mechanism underlying this BcGs1 elicitation in tomato. We revealed that the two domains were required for BcGs1's full necrosis activity. According to analysis and quantitative real-time PCR of the up-regulated proteins and genes filtered by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteome approach, oxidative metabolism and phenylpropanoid metabolism were speculated to be involved in BcGs1-triggered defense response in tomato. Furthermore, experimental evidence showed that BcGs1 triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and increased the level of phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POD) enzyme activity, as well as lignin accumulation. Moreover, histochemical analysis revealed that infiltration of BcGs1 in tomato leaves exhibited cell wall thickening compared with untreated plants. The results suggested that BcGs1 activated the basal defense response included lignin metabolism contributed to BcGs1-induced resistance to Botrytis. cinerea infection in tomato.
