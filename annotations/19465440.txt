In previous studies, we attempted to reduce phytic acid in rice seeds by silencing the 1d-myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase gene, RINO1, using an antisense sequence under the control of the rice glutelin GluB-1 promoter. The stable transgenic line showed a weak low phytic acid phenotype. In this study, we show that the position of the caryopsis in the panicle might affect the level of gene silencing through a difference in temporal and spatial expression patterns between RINO1 and GluB-1 promoters, resulting in a large variation in Pi levels and a small increase in Pi in the transgenic seeds.

RINO1: !synthesizes! phytic acid 
GluB-1 promoter: !controls! RINO1 
position of caryopsis: !affects! expression patterns of RINO1 and GluB-1 promoters 
temporal and spatial expression patterns: !influence! level of gene silencing
