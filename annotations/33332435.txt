['33332435', 'Abiotic stresses especially salinity, drought and high temperature result in  considerable reduction of crop productivity. In this study, we identified  AT4G18280 annotated as a glycine-rich cell wall protein-like (hereafter refer to  as GRPL1) protein as a potential multistress-responsive gene. Analysis of public  transcriptome data and GUS assay of pGRPL1::GUS showed a strong induction of  GRPL1 under drought, salinity and heat stresses. Transgenic plants overexpressing  GRPL1-3HA showed significantly higher germination, root elongation and survival  rate under salt stress. Moreover, the 35S::GRPL1-3HA transgenic lines also showed  higher survival rates under drought and heat stresses. GRPL1 showed similar  expression patterns with Abscisic acid (ABA)-pathway genes under different growth  and stress conditions, suggesting a possibility that GRPL1 might act in the ABA  pathway that is further supported by the inability of ABA-deficient mutant  (aba2-1) to induce GRPL1 under drought stress. Taken together, our data presents  GRPL1 as a potential multi-stress responsive gene working downstream of ABA.', '2020', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0244030', 'Asim']
