Despite its central role as the ark of genetic information and gene expression the plant nucleus is surprisingly understudied. We isolated nuclei from the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> dark grown cell culture left untreated and treated with flg22 and nlp20, two elicitors of pattern triggered immunity (PTI) in plants, respectively. An liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based discovery proteomics approach was used to measure the nuclear proteome fractions. An enrichment score based on the relative abundance of cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and Golgi markers in the nuclear protein fraction allowed us to curate the nuclear proteome producing high quality catalogs of around 3,000 nuclear proteins under untreated and both PTI conditions. The measurements also covered low abundant proteins including more than 100 transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators. We disclose a list of several hundred potentially dual targeted proteins including proteins not yet found before for further study. Protein import into the nucleus in plant immunity is known. Here we sought to gain a broader impression of this phenomenon employing our proteomics data and found 157 and 73 proteins to possibly be imported into the nucleus upon stimulus with flg22 and nlp20, respectively. Furthermore, the abundance of 93 proteins changed significantly in the nucleus following elicitation of immunity. These results suggest promiscuous ribosome assembly and a role of prohibitins and cytochrome C in the nucleus in PTI.
