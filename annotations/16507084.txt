['16507084', 'The multifunctional protein (MFP) of peroxisomal beta-oxidation catalyses four  separate reactions, two of which (2-trans enoyl-CoA hydratase and  L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) are core activities required for the  catabolism of all fatty acids. We have isolated and characterized five  Arabidopsis thaliana mutants in the MFP2 gene that is expressed predominantly in  germinating seeds. Seedlings of mfp2 require an exogenous supply of sucrose for  seedling establishment to occur. Analysis of mfp2-1 seedlings revealed that seed  storage lipid was catabolized more slowly, long-chain acyl-CoA substrates  accumulated and there was an increase in peroxisome size. Despite a reduction in  the rate of beta-oxidation, mfp2 seedlings are not resistant to the herbicide  2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid, which is catabolized to the auxin  2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by beta-oxidation. Acyl-CoA feeding experiments  show that the MFP2 2-trans enoyl-CoA hydratase only exhibits activity against  long chain (C18:0) substrates, whereas the MFP2 L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase  is active on C6:0, C12:0 and C18:0 substrates. A mutation in the abnormal  inflorescence meristem gene AIM1, the only homologue of MFP2, results in an  abnormal inflorescence meristem phenotype in mature plants (Richmond and  Bleecker, Plant Cell 11, 1999, 1911) demonstrating that the role of these genes  is very different. The mfp2-1 aim1double mutant aborted during the early stages  of embryo development showing that these two proteins share a common function  that is essential for this key stage in the life cycle.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02650.x', 'Graham']
