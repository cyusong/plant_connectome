['20521084', 'To gain insight into the functions of the nuclear-encoded factors involved in  chloroplast development, we characterized the high chlorophyll fluorescence and  pale green mutant 108-1 (designated as hfp108-1) of Arabidopsis thaliana.  Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant contains a tandem repeat of part of  the sequence (including 116 nucleotides from 631 to 746 bp downstream of the ATG)  of At3g63190, which encodes a chloroplast ribosome recycling factor homologue and  was named AtcpRRF. The chloroplasts of hfp108-1 plants contain few internal  thylakoid membranes and are severely defective in the accumulation of  chloroplast-encoded proteins. In vivo labeling experiments showed a drastic  decrease in the synthesis of the chloroplast-encoded proteins, which may be  attributed primarily to reduced translation of the corresponding mRNA molecules.  The level of the HFP108 transcript was greatly reduced in hfp108-1, so hfp108-1  showed a weak phenotype, and null alleles of HFP108 (hfp108-2) were embryonic  lethal. Observations with cleared seeds in the same silique showed that  homozygous hfp108-2 seeds were blocked at the heart stage and did not develop  further. Thus, these results suggest that AtcpRRF is essential for embryogenesis  and chloroplast biogenesis.', '2010 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-010-9653-0', 'Zhang']
