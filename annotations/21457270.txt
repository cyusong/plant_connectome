The structure and compaction of chromatin exerts a major regulatory influence on eukaryotic transcription. Changes in both histone composition and post-translational modifications of individual histone proteins can lead to remodelling of higher order chromatin structure. Chromatin remodelling regulates transcriptional activity through modifying gene accessibility, via DNA/histone interactions and the recruitment of non-histone proteins to DNA. Plant growth and development is regulated by the integration of multiple environmental signals. Of these, light is one of the most important. Chromatin remodelling processes have been identified in plants following a variety of different light treatments. These include the initiation of seedling de-etiolation, changes in photon irradiance and ultraviolet-B radiation exposure. In this review, we will summarize the roles of chromatin remodelling in plant photomorphogenesis and discuss these in the wider context of plant environmental adaptation.

Chromatin: !regulates! Transcriptional activity
Histone composition: !modifies! Higher order chromatin structure
Light: !regulates! Plant growth and development
DNA/histone interactions: !modify! Gene accessibility
Non-histone proteins: !recruit to! DNA
Chromatin remodelling: !initiates! Seedling de-etiolation
