Hybridization is a potential tool for incorporating stress tolerance in plants, particularly to pests and diseases, in support of restoration and conservation efforts. Butternut (<i>Juglans cinerea</i>) is a species for which hybridization has only recently begun being explored. This North American hardwood tree is threatened due to <i>Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum</i> (<i>Ocj</i>), the causal fungus of butternut canker disease (BCD), first observed in 1967. Observational evidence in some wild <i>J. cinerea</i> populations indicates that naturalized hybrids of <i>J. cinerea</i> with Japanese walnut (<i>Juglans ailantifolia</i>) may be more tolerant to BCD than non-admixed <i>J. cinerea</i>, but this has not been formally tested in a controlled trial. We aimed to examine potential BCD tolerance within and between <i>J. cinerea</i> and <i>J. cinerea</i> × <i>J. ailantifolia</i> hybrids and to determine if there is a difference in canker growth between BCD fungal isolates. Five-year-old <i>J. cinerea</i> and hybrid trees were inoculated with two <i>Ocj</i> fungal isolates collected from natural infections found in two different sites in Indiana, United States, and a blank control (agar only). Measurements of both artificially induced and naturally occurring cankers were taken at 8-, 12-, 20-, 24-, and 32-month post-inoculation. Differences in canker presence/absence and size were observed by fungal isolate, which could help explain some of the differences in BCD severity seen between <i>J. cinerea</i> populations. Smaller and fewer cankers and greater genetic gains were seen in hybrid families, demonstrating that hybrids warrant further evaluation as a possible breeding tool for developing BCD-resistant <i>J. cinerea</i> trees.
