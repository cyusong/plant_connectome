The reciprocal exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes during meiotic recombination is essential to secure balanced chromosome segregation and to promote genetic diversity. The chromosomal position and frequency of reciprocal genetic exchange shapes the efficiency of breeding programmes and influences crop improvement under a changing climate. In large genome cereals, such as wheat and barley, crossovers are consistently restricted to subtelomeric chromosomal regions, thus preventing favourable allele combinations being formed within a considerable proportion of the genome, including interstitial and pericentromeric chromatin. Understanding the key elements driving crossover designation is therefore essential to broaden the regions available for crossovers. Here, we followed early meiotic chromatin dynamism in cereals through the visualisation of a homologous barley chromosome arm pair stably transferred into the wheat genetic background. By capturing the dynamics of a single chromosome arm at the same time as detecting the undergoing events of meiotic recombination and synapsis, we showed that subtelomeric chromatin of homologues synchronously transitions to an open chromatin structure during recombination initiation. By contrast, pericentromeric and interstitial regions preserved their closed chromatin organisation and become unpackaged only later, concomitant with initiation of recombinatorial repair and the initial assembly of the synaptonemal complex. Our results raise the possibility that the closed pericentromeric chromatin structure in cereals may influence the fate decision during recombination initiation, as well as the spatial development of synapsis, and may also explain the suppression of crossover events in the proximity of the centromeres.
