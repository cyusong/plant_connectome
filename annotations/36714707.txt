Sunflower breeding for resistance to the parasitic plant sunflower broomrape (Orobanche cumana Wallr.) requires the identification of novel resistance genes. In this research, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify QTLs associated with broomrape resistance. The marker-trait associations were examined across a germplasm set composed of 104 sunflower accessions. They were genotyped with a 600k AXIOM® genome-wide array and evaluated for resistance to three populations of the parasite with varying levels of virulence (races EFR, FGV, and GTK) in two environments. The analysis of the genetic structure of the germplasm set revealed the presence of two main groups. The application of optimized treatments based on the general linear model (GLM) and the mixed linear model (MLM) allowed the detection of 14 SNP markers significantly associated with broomrape resistance. The highest number of marker-trait associations were identified on chromosome 3, clustered in two different genomic regions of this chromosome. Other associations were identified on chromosomes 5, 10, 13, and 16. Candidate genes for the main genomic regions associated with broomrape resistance were studied and discussed. Particularly, two significant SNPs on chromosome 3 associated with races EFR and FGV were found at two tightly linked SWEET sugar transporter genes. The results of this study have confirmed the role of some QTL on resistance to sunflower broomrape and have revealed new ones that may play an important role in the development of durable resistance to this parasitic weed in sunflower.
