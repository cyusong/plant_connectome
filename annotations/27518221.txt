The NAC proteins are the largest transcription factors in plants. The functions of NACs are various and we focus on their roles in response to abiotic stress here. In our study, a typical NAC gene (SlNAM1) is isolated from tomato and its product is located in the nucleus. It also has a transcriptional activity region situated in C-terminal. The expression levels of SlNAM1 in tomato were induced by 4°C, PEG, NaCl, abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments. The function of SlNAM1 in response to chilling stress has been investigated. SlNAM1 overexpression in tobacco exhibited higher germination rates, minor wilting, and higher photosynthetic rates (Pn) under chilling stress. Meanwhile, overexpression of SlNAM1 improved the osmolytes contents and reduced the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> contents under low temperature, which contribute to alleviating the oxidative damage of cell membrane after chilling stress. Moreover, the transcripts of NtDREB1, NtP5CS, and NtERD10s were higher in transgenic tobacco, and those increased expressions may confer higher chilling tolerance of transgenic plants. These results indicated that overexpression of SlNAM1 could improve chilling stress tolerance of transgenic tobacco.
