Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are an important mechanism of species coexistence in forest communities. However, evidence remains limited for how light availability regulates PSFs in species with different shade tolerance via changes in plant-microbial interactions. Here we tested in a glasshouse experiment how PSFs changed as a function of light availability and tree shade tolerance. Soil bacterial and fungal communities were profiled using the 16S rRNA and ITS2 gene sequencing, respectively. Under low light, individual PSFs were positively related to shade tolerance, while the least shade-tolerant species produced the most positive PSFs under high light. Pairwise PSFs between species with contrasting shade tolerance were strongly positive under high light but negative under low light, thereby promoting the dominance of less shade-tolerant species in forest gaps and species coexistence under closed canopy, respectively. Under high light, PSFs were related to soil microbial composition and diversity, with the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi being the primary driver of PSFs. Under low light, none of soil microbial properties were significantly related to PSFs. These findings indicate PSFs and plant shade tolerance interact to promote species coexistence and improve our understanding of how soil microbes contribute to variation in PSFs.
