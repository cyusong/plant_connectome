If pollinators or compatible mates are scarce, plants in small populations may be pollen-limited and consequently produce fewer offspring. However, determining the relative importance of the genetic vs ecological mechanisms limiting successful pollination is challenging. We explored the relationships among population size, population connectivity, pollinator visitation, allozyme diversity, mate availability (measured as percent compatible crosses among plants within a population), and pollen limitation in 12 populations (N = 39-885,274) of the self-incompatible plant Hymenoxys herbacea in Ontario, Canada. Unexpectedly, small populations had more insect flower visitors per capitulum than large populations. Consistent with the effects of genetic drift, both allozyme polymorphism and mate availability decreased with decreasing population size. Pollen limitation was low and significant in only one population and could not be predicted based on knowledge of population size, connectivity, compatible mate availability, or pollinator visitation. Population size had detectable effects on both pollinator activity and mate availability. However, because the effect of population size was complementary on these two potentially limiting mechanisms, this threatened plant was rarely pollen-limited.
