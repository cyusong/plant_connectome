Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has been previously shown to extend the vase life of various cut flowers; however, its positive effect on extending vase life of carnations has not been well documented. Moreover, the role of SNP in the mechanisms underlying determination of vase life of cut carnations has also not been well addressed. SNP increased vase life of Tico Viola carnations along with their relative fresh weight (RFW). Among the treatments, the flowers treated with 10 mg L<sup>-1</sup> SNP had the longest vase life and maximum relative fresh weight (RFW). This was achieved through significant suppression of ethylene production via downregulation of ethylene biosynthesis and petal senescence-related genes, and through an increase in the scavenging mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by antioxidant activity during flower vase life. In addition, the positive efficacy of SNP could also be confirmed using 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and different cultivars, resulting in similar trends for both experiments. Taken together, these results suggest that SNP plays a crucial role in multiple modes of action that are associated with the longevity of cut carnation flowers.
