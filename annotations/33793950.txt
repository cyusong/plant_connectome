Meiotic recombination (MR) drives novel combinations of alleles and contributes to genomic diversity in eukaryotes. In this study, we showed that heat stress (36°C-38°C) over the fertile threshold fully abolished crossover formation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Cytological and genetic studies in wild-type plants and syn1 and rad51 mutants suggested that heat stress reduces generation of SPO11-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs). In support, the abundance of recombinase DMC1, which is required for MR-specific DSB repair, was significantly reduced under heat stress. In addition, high temperatures induced disassembly and/or instability of the ASY4- but not the SYN1-mediated chromosome axis. At the same time, the ASY1-associated lateral element of the synaptonemal complex (SC) was partially affected, while the ZYP1-dependent central element of SC was disrupted, indicating that heat stress impairs SC formation. Moreover, expression of genes involved in DSB formation; e.g. SPO11-1, PRD1, 2, and 3 was not impacted; however, recombinase RAD51 and chromosome axis factors ASY3 and ASY4 were significantly downregulated under heat stress. Taken together, these findings revealed that heat stress inhibits MR via compromised DSB formation and homolog synapsis, which are possible downstream effects of the impacted chromosome axis. Our study thus provides evidence shedding light on how increasing environmental temperature influences MR in Arabidopsis.
