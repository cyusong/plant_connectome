['12244265', 'We have previously described a homeotic leafy cotyledon (lec) mutant of  Arabidopsis that exhibits striking defects in embryonic maturation and produces  viviparous embryos with cotyledons that are partially transformed into leaves. In  this study, we present further details on the developmental anatomy of mutant  embryos, characterize their response to abscisic acid (ABA) in culture, describe  other mutants with related phenotypes, and summarize studies with double mutants.  Our results indicate that immature embryos precociously enter a germination  pathway after the torpedo stage of development and then acquire characteristics  normally restricted to vegetative parts of the plant. In contrast to other  viviparous mutants of maize (vp1) and Arabidopsis (abi3) that produce  ABA-insensitive embryos, immature lec embryos are sensitive to ABA in culture.  ABA is therefore necessary but not sufficient for embryonic maturation in  Arabidopsis. Three other mutants that produce trichomes on cotyledons following  precocious germination in culture are described. One mutant is allelic to lec1,  another is a fusca mutant (fus3), and the third defines a new locus (lec2).  Mutant embryos differ in morphology, desiccation tolerance, pattern of  anthocyanin accumulation, presence of storage materials, size and frequency of  trichomes on cotyledons, and timing of precocious germination in culture. The  leafy cotyledon phenotype has therefore allowed the identification of an  important network of regulatory genes with overlapping functions during embryonic  maturation in Arabidopsis.', '1994 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.6.8.1049', 'Yeung']
