Remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and structure from motion (SfM) is useful for the sustainable and cost-effective management of agricultural fields. Ground control points (GCPs) are typically used for the high-precision monitoring of plant height (PH). Additionally, a secondary UAV flight is necessary when off-season images are processed to obtain the ground altitude (GA). In this study, four variables, namely, camera angles, real-time kinematic (RTK), GCPs, and methods for GA, were compared with the predictive performance of maize PH. Linear regression models for PH prediction were validated using training data from different targets on different flights ("different-targets-and-different-flight" cross-validation). PH prediction using UAV-SfM at a camera angle of -60° with RTK, GCPs, and GA obtained from an off-season flight scored a high coefficient of determination and a low mean absolute error (MAE) for validation data (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> <i><sub><i>val</i></sub> </i> = 0.766, MAE = 0.039 m in the vegetative stage; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> <i><sub><i>val</i></sub> </i> = 0.803, MAE = 0.063 m in the reproductive stage). The low-cost case (LC) method, conducted at a camera angle of -60° without RTK, GCPs, or an extra off-season flight, achieved comparable predictive performance (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> <i><sub><i>val</i></sub> </i> = 0.794, MAE = 0.036 m in the vegetative stage; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> <i><sub><i>val</i></sub> </i> = 0.749, MAE = 0.072 m in the reproductive stage), suggesting that this method can achieve low-cost and high-precision PH monitoring.
