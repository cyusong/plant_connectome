In an approach to study lateral root development in monocots, genome-wide searches for homologs of the Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-like (GAST-like) gene family in rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays) were carried out. Six novel GAST-like genes in rice and 10 members of the gene family in maize, which were designated ZmGSL (for Z. mays Gibberellic Acid Stimulated-Like), were identified. The ZmGSL family encodes small proteins of 75 to 128 amino acids, which are characterized by a conserved 59 to 64 amino acid C-terminal domain. Within this domain, 17 amino acids, including 12 cysteines, are perfectly conserved. The transcript of the ZmGSL1 gene is differentially spliced into the alternative variants ZmGSL1a and ZmGSL1b, the latter of which is translated into a premature protein that lacks the C-terminal domain. The presence of an additional N-terminal cleavable signal sequence in eight of the 10 ZmGSL proteins suggests that they are secreted into the extracellular matrix. In-depth root-specific gene expression analyses carried out in the wild type and the lateral root mutants lrt1 and rum1 suggest a role for ZmGSL genes in early lateral root development, which is likely regulated by gibberellic acid. Expression patterns of ZmGSL1a and ZmGSL1b propose antagonistic functions of these splice variants during early lateral root formation.
