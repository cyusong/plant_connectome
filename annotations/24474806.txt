The body architectures of most multicellular organisms consistently display both symmetry and asymmetry. Here, we discuss some of the available knowledge and open questions on how symmetry and asymmetry appear in several conspicuous plant cells and tissues. We focus, where possible, on the role of genes that participate in the maintenance or the breaking of symmetry and that are directly or indirectly related to the cell cycle, under an organ-centric point of view and with an emphasis on the leaf.
