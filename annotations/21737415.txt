Abiotic stresses such as drought, high salinity, and cold are common adverse environmental conditions that significantly influence plant growth and productivity worldwide. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in physiological and developmental responses as well as in co-ordinating various stress signal transduction pathways in plants. DREBs (dehydration responsive element binding) are important plant transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the expression of many stress-inducible genes mostly in an ABA-independent manner and play a critical role in improving the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by interacting with a DRE/CRT cis-element present in the promoter region of various abiotic stress-responsive genes. This review summarizes recent studies highlighting the role of the DRE-binding family of TFs in the adaptive responses to different abiotic stresses and their structural and functional characters with emphasis on the expression and regulation of DREBs. The practical and application value of DREBs in crop improvement, such as stress tolerance engineering as well as marker-assisted selection (MAS), has also been discussed.
