Plant tolerance of serpentine soils is potentially an excellent model for studying the genetics of adaptive variation in natural populations. A large-scale viability screen of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants on a defined nutrient solution with a low Ca(2+) : Mg(2+) ratio (1 : 24 mol : mol), typical of serpentine soils, yielded survivors with null alleles of the tonoplast calcium-proton antiporter CAX1. cax1 mutants have most of the phenotypes associated with tolerance to serpentine soils, including survival in solutions with a low Ca(2+) : Mg(2+) ratio; requirement for a high concentration of Mg(2+) for maximum growth; reduced leaf tissue concentration of Mg(2+); and poor growth performance on 'normal' levels of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). A physiological model is proposed to explain how loss-of-function cax1 mutations could produce all these phenotypes characteristic of plants adapted to serpentine soils, why 'normal' plants are unable to survive on serpentine soil, and why serpentine-adapted plants are unable to compete on 'normal' soils.

CAX1: !affects! Plant tolerance 
CAX1: !represses! Growth performance 
Mg2+: !enhances! Survival 
Mg2+: !requires! High concentration for maximum growth
