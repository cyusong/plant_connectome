In the symbiotic associations between rhizobia and legumes, the NodD regulators orchestrate the transcription of the specific nodulation genes. This set of genes is involved in the synthesis of nodulation factors, which are responsible for initiating the nodulation process. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 is the most successful symbiont of Phaseolus vulgaris and can nodulate a variety of legumes. Among the five NodD regulators present in this rhizobium, only NodD1 and NodD2 seem to have a role in the symbiotic process. However, the individual role of each NodD in the absence of the other proteins has remained elusive. In this work, we show that the CIAT 899 NodD2 does not require activation by inducers to promote the synthesis of nodulation factors. A CIAT 899 strain overexpressing nodD2, but lacking all additional nodD genes, can nodulate three different legumes as efficiently as the wild type. Interestingly, CIAT 899 NodD2-mediated gain of nodulation can be extended to another rhizobial species, since its overproduction in Sinorhizobium fredii HH103 not only increases the number of nitrogen-fixing nodules in two host legumes but also results in nodule development in incompatible legumes. These findings potentially open exciting opportunities to develop rhizobial inoculants and increase legume crop production.
