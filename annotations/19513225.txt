The growth and circumnutation of the stem of three-week old Helianthus annuus in the 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod were monitored using an angular position-sensing transducer and a time lapse photography system. It was found that the rate of growth and circumnutation reached a high level in the dark stage; in the light stage, however, only the growth rate reached the same high level, whereas the circumnutations were weak. These results showed that in the light stage the stem circumnutation was downregulated more strongly than the growth. Short-term stem responses to darkening and illumination were a further display of the relation between growth and circumnutations. Switching off the light caused an increase in the growth and circumnutation rate. In some cases it was accompanied by changes in the rotation direction. On the other hand, switching the light on caused an immediate transient (several-minute long) decrease in the growth rate resulting in stem contraction, and this was accompanied by an almost complete pause of circumnutation. Additionally, under light, there occurred a subsequent decrease in the magnitude, disturbance of circumnutation trajectory and, in some cases, changes in the direction of rotation. The observed stem contraction and disturbance of circumnutation imply the occurrence of turgor changes in sunflower stem, which may be caused by a non-wounding, darkening or illumination stimulus. Our experiments indicate that the disturbances of the growth rate are accompanied by changes in circumnutation parameters but we have also seen that there is no simple quantitative relation between growth rate and circumnutation rate.
