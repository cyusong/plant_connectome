['20133010', 'Cryptochromes are blue-light photoreceptors that control many aspects of plant  development. In this study, cryptochrome mutants of Arabidopsis were examined to  assess the role of cryptchrome-1 (CRY1) in lateral roots growth. When grown in  blue light for 12d, mutant seedlings (cry1) showed increased growth of lateral  roots, while CRY1-overexpressing transgenic seedlings (CRY1ox) exhibited a marked  decrease. Lateral roots growth of CRY1ox could be stimulated by auxin, but  expression of PIN1 (efflux carrier of polar auxin transport) was strongly  reduced. Contrary, the cry1 mutation showed the opposite effect, indicating that  blue light and the auxin-signaling pathway interact in lateral roots growth of  Arabidopsis. The free IAA content in CRY1ox roots was half of that in wild type  and cry1 mutant roots. Moreover, the content of flavonoids (quercetin,  kaempferol, isorhamnetin), which act as endogenous negative regulators of auxin  transport, increased in CRY1ox seedlings. Taken together, these results suggest  that Arabidopsis CRY1 restrains lateral roots growth by inhibiting auxin  transport.', '2010 May 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2009.12.003', 'Liu']
