The phytohormone auxin regulates various developmental programs in plants, including cell growth, cell division and cell differentiation. The auxin efflux carriers are essential for the auxin transport. To show an involvement of auxin transporters in the coordination of fruit development in bitter gourd, a juicy fruit, we isolated novel cDNAs (referred as McPIN) encoding putative auxin efflux carriers, including <i>McPIN1</i>, <i>McPIN2</i> (allele of <i>McPIN1</i>) and <i>McPIN3</i>, from developing fruits of bitter gourd. Both <i>McPIN1</i> and <i>McPIN3</i> genes possess six exons and five introns. Hydropathy analysis revealed that both polypeptides have two hydrophobic regions with five transmembrane segments and a predominantly hydrophilic core. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that McPIN1 shared the highest homology to the group of <i>Arabidopsis</i>, cucumber and tomato PIN1, while McPIN3 belonged to another group, including <i>Arabidopsis</i> and tomato PIN3 as well as PIN4. This suggests different roles for McPIN1 and McPIN3 in auxin transport involved in the fruit development of bitter gourd. Maximum mRNA levels for both genes were detected in staminate and pistillate flowers. <i>McPIN1</i> is expressed in a particular period of early fruit development but <i>McPIN3</i> continues to be expressed until the last stage of fruit ripening. Moreover, these two genes are auxin-inducible and qualified as early auxin-response genes. Their expression patterns suggest that these two auxin transporter genes play a pivotal role in fruit setting and development.
