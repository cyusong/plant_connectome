Cyanobacteria are structurally the simplest oxygenic phototrophs, which makes it difficult to understand the regulation of photosynthesis because the photosynthetic and respiratory processes share the same thylakoid membranes and cytosolic space. This review aimed to summarise the molecular mechanisms and in vivo activities of electron transport in cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes based on the latest progress in photosynthesis research in cyanobacteria. Photosynthetic linear electron transport for CO2 assimilation has the dominant electron flux in the thylakoid membranes. The capacity of O2 photoreduction in cyanobacteria is comparable to the photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, which is mediated by flavodiiron proteins. Additionally, cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes harbour the significant electron flux of respiratory electron transport through a homologue of respiratory complex I, which is also recognized as the part of cyclic electron transport chain if it is coupled with photosystem I in the light. Further, O2-independent alternative electron transports through hydrogenase and nitrate reductase function with reduced ferredoxin as the electron donor. Whereas all these electron transports are recently being understood one by one, the complexity as the whole regulatory system remains to be uncovered in near future.

Flavodiiron proteins: !mediate! O2 photoreduction
Respiratory complex I: !mediates! Respiratory electron transport
Hydrogenase: !mediates! O2-independent alternative electron transport
Nitrate reductase: !mediates! O2-independent alternative electron transport
