DREB1/CBFs are key transcription factors involved in plant cold stress adaptation. The expression of <i>DREB1/CBF</i>s triggers a cold-responsive transcriptional cascade, after which many stress tolerance genes are expressed. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms of cold stress-inducible <i>DREB1/CBF</i> expression is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of plant cold stress responses and tolerance. We analyzed the roles of a transcription factor, INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1 (ICE1), that is well known as an important transcriptional activator in the cold-inducible expression of <i>DREB1A/CBF3</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>ice1-1</i> is a widely accepted mutant allele known to abolish cold-inducible <i>DREB1A</i> expression, and this evidence has strongly supported ICE1-<i>DREB1A</i> regulation for many years. However, in <i>ice1-1</i> outcross descendants, we unexpectedly discovered that <i>ice1-1 DREB1A</i> repression was genetically independent of the <i>ice1-1</i> allele ICE1(R236H). Moreover, neither <i>ICE1</i> overexpression nor double loss-of-function mutation of <i>ICE1</i> and its homolog <i>SCRM2</i> altered <i>DREB1A</i> expression. Instead, a transgene locus harboring a reporter gene in the <i>ice1-1</i> genome was responsible for altering <i>DREB1A</i> expression. The <i>DREB1A</i> promoter was hypermethylated due to the transgene. We showed that <i>DREB1A</i> repression in <i>ice1-1</i> results from transgene-induced silencing and not genetic regulation by ICE1. The ICE1(R236H) mutation has also been reported as <i>scrm-D</i>, which confers constitutive stomatal differentiation. The <i>scrm-D</i> phenotype and the expression of a stomatal differentiation marker gene were confirmed to be linked to the ICE1(R236H) mutation. We propose that the current ICE1-<i>DREB1</i> regulatory model should be revalidated without the previous assumptions.
