The C(18) ketone (5E,7E)-6-methyl-8-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-enyl)octa-5,7-dien-2-one (D'orenone) has been postulated to be an early cleavage product of beta-carotene en route to trisporic acids; these act as morphogenetic factors during the sexual reproduction of zygomycetes. Here we report that D'orenone blocks the highly polarized tip growth of root hairs, causing tip growth to stop completely within a few minutes. Importantly, external auxin reverses the effects of D'orenone on root hairs. Further analysis revealed that D'orenone lowers the auxin concentration in trichoblasts via PIN2-mediated auxin efflux to below the critical levels essential for root hair growth. D'orenone specifically increases PIN2 protein abundance without affecting PIN2 transcripts, and the PIN2 expression domain enlarges and shifts basipetally, resulting in more active auxin transport. The observation that D'orenone does not interfere with the root hair growth in roots of null mutant lines provides additional evidence that PIN2 is its specific target.
