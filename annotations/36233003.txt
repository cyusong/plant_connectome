Anthocyanins act as polyphenolic pigment that is ubiquitously found in plants. Anthocyanins play a role not only in health-promoting as an antioxidant, but also in protection against all kinds of abiotic and biotic stresses. Most recent studies have found that MYB transcription factors (MYB TFs) could positively or negatively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis. Understanding the roles of MYB TFs is essential in elucidating how MYB TFs regulate the accumulation of anthocyanin. In the review, we summarized the signaling pathways medicated by MYB TFs during anthocyanin biosynthesis including jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway, cytokinins (CKs) signaling pathway, temperature-induced, light signal, 26S proteasome pathway, NAC TFs, and bHLH TFs. Moreover, structural and regulator genes induced by MYB TFs, target genes bound and activated or suppressed by MYB TFs, and crosstalk between MYB TFs and other proteins, were found to be vitally important in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. In this study, we focus on the recent knowledge concerning the regulator signaling and mechanism of MYB TFs on anthocyanin biosynthesis, covering the signaling pathway, genes expression, and target genes and protein expression.
