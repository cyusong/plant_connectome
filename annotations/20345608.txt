['20345608', 'Seed dormancy is essential for most plants to control the timing of germination.  In Arabidopsis thaliana, PED3 is a single-copy gene encoding an ATP-binding  cassette transporter that is required for peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation.  PED3 is involved in the import of several biologically important molecules into  the peroxisome, including very-long-chain fatty acids associated with the  breakdown of seed-reserve lipids, and precursors of auxin and jasmonic acid. The  germination of ped3 mutants is significantly impaired, suggesting that PED3  regulates dormancy and germination. A transcriptome analysis revealed that many  genes containing the core motif of the ABA responsive element (ABRE) in their  promoter regions, and the ABA insensitive 5 (ABI5) transcription factor that  binds to ABRE, are abnormally up-regulated in imbibed ped3 seeds. Expression of  polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) is also up-regulated specifically  in ped3 after imbibition. By contrast, the ped3 abi5 double mutant does not show  any of these expression patterns. The results indicate that the abi5 mutation  normalizes PGIP expression and rescues the impaired germination phenotype of the  ped3 mutant. PGIPs are known to act as inhibitors of polygalacturonases that  degrade pectin. The amount of PGIP1 transcript regulates the timing of radicle  protrusion. The impaired germination of ped3 could also be rescued by removal of  pectin from the seed coat using exogenous polygalacturonase or acidic conditions.  Overall, our results suggest that PED3, a peroxisomal ABC transporter, promotes  seed germination by suppressing PGIPs under the control of ABI5.', '2010 Jun 1', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04205.x', 'Hayashi']
