['31345954', 'The timely release of mature pollen following anther dehiscence is essential for  reproduction in flowering plants. AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR17 (ARF17) plays a crucial  role in pollen wall pattern formation, tapetum development, and auxin signal  transduction in anthers. Here, we showed that ARF17 is also involved in anther  dehiscence. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) arf17 mutant exhibits  defective endothecium lignification, which leads to defects in anther dehiscence.  The expression of MYB108, which encodes a transcription factor important for  anther dehiscence, was dramatically down-regulated in the flower buds of arf17  Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays  showed ARF17 directly binds to the MYB108 promoter. In an ARF17-GFP transgenic  line, in which ARF17-GFP fully complements the arf17 phenotype, ARF17-GFP was  observed in the endothecia at anther stage 11. The GUS signal driven by the  MYB108 promoter was also detected in endothecia at late anther stages in  transgenic plants expressing promoterMYB108::GUS Thus, the expression pattern of  both ARF17 and MYB108 is consistent with the function of these genes in anther  dehiscence. Furthermore, the expression of MYB108 driven by the ARF17 promoter  successfully restored the defects in anther dehiscence of arf17 These results  demonstrated that ARF17 regulates the expression of MYB108 for anther dehiscence.  Together with its function in microcytes and tapeta, ARF17 likely coordinates the  development of different sporophytic cell layers in anthers. The ARF17-MYB108  pathway involved in regulating anther dehiscence is also discussed.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00576', 'ORCID:']
