Ribosome biogenesis is a constitutive fundamental process for cellular function. Its rate of production depends on the rate of maturation of precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). The rRNA maturation paths are marked by four dominant rate-limiting intermediates with cell-type variation of the processivity rate. We have identified that high temperature stress in plants, while halting the existing pre-rRNA maturation schemes, also transiently triggers an atypical pathway for 35S pre-rRNA processing. This pathway leads to production of an aberrant precursor rRNA, reminiscent of yeast 24S, encompassing 18S and 5.8S rRNA that do not normally co-occur together at sub-unit levels; this response is elicited specifically by high and not low temperatures. We show this response to be conserved in two other model crop plant species (Rice and Tomato). This pathway persists even after returning to normal growth conditions for 1 hour and is reset between 1-6 hours after stress treatment, likely, due to resumption of normal 35S pre-rRNA synthesis and processing. The heat-induced ITS2 cleavage-derived precursors and stalled P-A2-like precursors were heterogeneous in nature with a fraction containing polymeric (A) tails. Furthermore, high temperature treatment and subsequent fractionation resulted in polysome and precursor rRNA depletion.
