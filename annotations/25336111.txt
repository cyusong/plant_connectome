Soil salinity is a common environmental stress factor that limits agricultural production worldwide. Plants have evolved different strategies to achieve salt tolerance. miR393 has been identified as closely related to biotic and abiotic stresses, and targets F-box genes that encode auxin receptors. The miR393-TIR1/AFB2/AFB3 regulatory module was discovered to have multiple functions that manipulate the auxin response. This study focused on miR393 and one of its targets, TIR1, and found that they played potential roles in response to salt stress. Our results showed that overexpression of a miR393-resistant TIR1 gene (mTIR1) in Arabidopsis clearly enhanced salt stress tolerance, which led to a higher germination rate, less water loss, reduced inhibition of root elongation, delayed senescence, decreased death rate and stabilized Chl content. These plants accumulated more proline and anthocyanin, and displayed enhanced osmotic stress tolerance. The expression of some salt stress-related genes was altered, and sodium content can be reduced in these plants under salt stress. We proposed that highly increased auxin signaling by overexpression of mTIR1 may trigger auxin-mediated downstream pathways to enhance plant salt stress resistance by osmoregulation and increased Na(+) exclusion.
