['19889877', 'The functional protein phosphatase type 2C from beechnut (Fagus sylvatica;  FsPP2C1) was a negative regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in seeds. In  this report, to get deeper insight on FsPP2C1 function, we aim to identify  PP2C-interacting partners. Two closely related members (PYL8/RCAR3 and  PYL7/RCAR2) of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BetV I family were shown to  bind FsPP2C1 in a yeast two-hybrid screening and in an ABA-independent manner. By  transient expression of FsPP2C1 and PYL8/RCAR3 in epidermal onion (Allium cepa)  cells and agroinfiltration in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) as green  fluorescent protein fusion proteins, we obtained evidence supporting the  subcellular localization of both proteins mainly in the nucleus and in both the  cytosol and the nucleus, respectively. The in planta interaction of both proteins  in tobacco cells by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays resulted in a  specific nuclear colocalization of this interaction. Constitutive overexpression  of PYL8/RCAR3 confers ABA hypersensitivity in Arabidopsis seeds and,  consequently, an enhanced degree of seed dormancy. Additionally, transgenic  35S:PYL8/RCAR3 plants are unable to germinate under low concentrations of  mannitol, NaCl, or paclobutrazol, which are not inhibiting conditions to the wild  type. In vegetative tissues, Arabidopsis PYL8/RCAR3 transgenic plants show  ABA-resistant drought response and a strong inhibition of early root growth.  These phenotypes are strengthened at the molecular level with the enhanced  induction of several ABA response genes. Both seed and vegetative phenotypes of  Arabidopsis 35S:PYL8/RCAR3 plants are opposite those of 35S:FsPP2C1 plants.  Finally, double transgenic plants confirm the role of PYL8/RCAR3 by antagonizing  FsPP2C1 function and demonstrating that PYL8/RCAR3 positively regulates ABA  signaling during germination and abiotic stress responses.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.146381', 'Lorenzo']
