Wheat leaf rust (also known as brown rust), caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Puccinia triticina</i> Erikss. (Pt), is one by far the most troublesome wheat disease worldwide. The exploitation of resistance genes has long been considered as the most effective and sustainable method to control leaf rust in wheat production. Previously the leaf rust resistance gene <i>Lr65</i> has been mapped to the distal end of chromosome arm 2AS linked to molecular marker <i>Xbarc212</i>. In this study, <i>Lr65</i> was delimited to a 0.8 cM interval between flanking markers <i>Alt-64</i> and <i>AltID-11</i>, by employing two larger segregating populations obtained from crosses of the resistant parent Altgold Rotkorn (ARK) with the susceptible parents Xuezao and Chinese Spring (CS), respectively. 24 individuals from 622 F<sub>2</sub> plants of crosses between ARK and CS were obtained that showed the recombination between <i>Lr65</i> gene and the flanking markers <i>Alt-64</i> and <i>AltID-11</i>. With the aid of the CS reference genome sequence (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0), one SSR marker was developed between the interval matched to the <i>Lr65</i>-flanking marker and a high-resolution genetic linkage map was constructed. The <i>Lr65</i> was finally located to a region corresponding to 60.11 Kb of the CS reference genome. The high-resolution genetic linkage map founded a solid foundation for the map-based cloning of <i>Lr65</i> and the co-segregating marker will facilitate the marker-assisted selection (MAS) of the target gene.
