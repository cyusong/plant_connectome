Jasmonate is a well-known defence hormone for plants, but it is also necessary for growth and development. Indeed, the identification of the COI1 receptor was based on the jasmonate-triggered response of root growth inhibition. In this special issue, a collection of review papers and two research papers discuss the current state of progress in this field, covering areas from seed germination and flowering to the Jasminum sambac genome.
