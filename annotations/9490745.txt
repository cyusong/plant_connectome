['9490745', 'Cell elongation is a developmental process that is regulated by light and  phytohormones and is of critical importance for plant growth. Mutants defective  in their response to light and various hormones are often dwarfs. The dwarfed  phenotype results because of a failure in normal cell elongation. Little is  known, however, about the basis of dwarfism as a common element in these diverse  signaling pathways and the nature of the cellular functions responsible for cell  elongation. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis mutant, dwarf4 (dwf4), whose  phenotype can be rescued with exogenously supplied brassinolide. dwf4 mutants  display features of light-regulatory mutants, but the dwarfed phenotype is  entirely and specifically brassinosteroid dependent; no other hormone can rescue  dwf4 to a wild-type phenotype. Therefore, an intact brassinosteroid system is an  absolute requirement for cell elongation.', '1998 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.2.219', 'Feldmann']
