Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a family of plant steroid hormones that play diverse roles in many aspects of plant growth and development. For example, BRs promote seed germination by counteracting the inhibitory effect of ABA and regulate plant reproductive development, thus affecting seed yield. We have recently reported that MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT) regulates seed germination through a negative feedback loop modulating ABA signaling in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that MFT function is also relevant to the BR signaling pathway. In mft loss-of-function mutants, the application of BR could not fully antagonize the inhibitory effect of exogenous ABA on seed germination, suggesting that BR promotes seed germination against ABA partly through MFT. In addition, mft enhances the low-fertility phenotype of det2 in which BR biosynthesis is blocked. This phenotype, together with the observation that MFT is expressed in gametophytes and developing seeds, suggests that MFT and BR play redundant roles in regulating fertility. Therefore, these results suggest that MFT affects seed germination and fertility relevant to the BR signaling pathway.
