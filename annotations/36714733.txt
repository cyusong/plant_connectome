Photosynthetic adaptive strategies vary with the growth irradiance. The potential photosynthetic adaptive strategies of shade-tolerant species <i>Panax notoginseng</i> (Burkill) F. H. Chen to long-term high light and low light remains unclear. Photosynthetic performance, photosynthesis-related pigments, leaves anatomical characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activities were comparatively determined in <i>P. notoginseng</i> grown under different light regimes. The thickness of the upper epidermis, palisade tissue, and lower epidermis were declined with increasing growth irradiance. Low-light-grown leaves were declined in transpiration rate (Tr) and stomatal conductance (Cond), but intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (<i>C</i> <sub>i</sub>) and net photosynthesis rate (<i>P</i> <sub>n</sub>) had opposite trends. The maximum photo-oxidation <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>P</mtext> <mn>700</mn> <mo>+</mo></msubsup> </math> (<i>P</i> <sub>m</sub>) was greatly reduced in 29.8% full sunlight (FL) plants; The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (<i>F</i> <sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i> <sub>m</sub>) in 0.2% FL plants was significantly lowest. Electron transport, thermal dissipation, and the effective quantum yield of PSI [Y(I)] and PSII [Y(II)] were declined in low-light-grown plants compared with high-light-grown <i>P. notoginseng</i>. The minimum value of non-regulated energy dissipation of PSII [Y(NO)] was recorded in 0.2% FL <i>P. notoginseng</i>. OJIP kinetic curve showed that relative variable fluorescence at J-phase (<i>V</i> <sub>J</sub>) and the ratio of variable fluorescent <i>F</i> <sub>K</sub> occupying the <i>F</i> <sub>J</sub>-<i>F</i> <sub>O</sub> amplitude (<i>W</i> <sub>k</sub>) were significantly increased in 0.2% FL plants. However, the increase in <i>W</i> <sub>k</sub> was lower than the increase in <i>V</i> <sub>J</sub>. In conclusion, PSI photoinhibition is the underlying sensitivity of the typically shade-tolerant species <i>P. notoginseng</i> to high light, and the photodamage to PSII acceptor side might cause the typically shade-tolerant plants to be unsuitable for long-term low light stress.
