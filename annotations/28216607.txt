Phytopathogenic oomycetes, such as <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, potentially secrete many RxLR effector proteins into plant cells to modulate plant immune responses and promote colonization. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these RxLR effectors suppress plant immune responses are largely unknown. Here we describe an RxLR effector PITG_22798 (Gene accession: XM_002998349) that was upregulated during early infection of potato by <i>P. infestans</i>. By employment of agroinfiltration, we observed that <i>PITG_22798</i> triggers cell death in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Confocal microscopic examination showed that PITG_22798-GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) located in the host nucleus when expressed transiently in <i>N. benthamiana</i> leaves. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain of PITG_22798 is important for nuclear localization and cell death-inducing activity. Sequence alignment and transient expression showed that <i>PITG_22798</i> from diverse <i>P. infestans</i> isolates are conserved, and transient expression of <i>PITG_22798</i> enhances <i>P. infestans</i> colonization of <i>N. benthamiana</i> leaves, which suggests that <i>PITG_22798</i> contributes to <i>P. infestans</i> infection. <i>PITG_22798</i>-triggered cell death is dependent on SGT1-mediated signaling and is suppressed by the <i>P. infestans</i> avirulence effector 3b (AVR3b). The present research provides a clue for further investigation of how <i>P. infestans</i> effector PITG_22798 associates with and modulates host immunity.
