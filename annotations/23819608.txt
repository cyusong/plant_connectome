Adult plant rust resistance genes Lr67 and Lr34 confer race non-specific resistance to multiple fungal pathogens of wheat. Induced, susceptible mutants were characterised for both genes. Three categories of Lr34 mutants were identified that were either partial susceptible, fully susceptible or hyper-susceptible to stripe rust and leaf rust. The likely impact of the mutational change on the predicted Lr34 protein correlated with differences in response to rust infection. Four independent Lr67 mutants were recovered that were susceptible to stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust pathogens, including one possible hyper-susceptible Lr67 mutant. Detailed study of Lr34 mutants revealed that subtle changes in resistance response to multiple pathogens were correlated with mutational changes in the predicted protein. Recovery of independent Lr67 mutants indicates that as for Lr34, a single gene at the Lr67 locus is likely to confer resistance to multiple pathogens. The infection phenotypes of Lr67 mutants closely resembled that of Lr34 mutants.
