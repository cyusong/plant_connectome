Plants require zinc (Zn) as an essential cofactor for diverse molecular, cellular and physiological functions. Zn is crucial for crop yield, but is one of the most limiting micronutrients in soils. Grasses like rice, wheat, maize and barley are crucial sources of food and nutrients for humans. Zn deficiency in these species therefore not only reduces annual yield but also directly results in Zn malnutrition of more than two billion people in the world. There has been good progress in understanding Zn homeostasis and Zn deficiency mechanisms in plants. However, our current knowledge of monocots, including grasses, remains insufficient. In this review, we provide a summary of our knowledge of molecular Zn homeostasis mechanisms in monocots, with a focus on important cereal crops. We additionally highlight divergences in Zn homeostasis of monocots and the dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as important gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed in future research on Zn homeostasis in cereal monocots.
