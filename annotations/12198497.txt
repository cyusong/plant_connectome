['12198497', 'MOR1 is a member of the MAP215 family of microtubule-associated proteins and is  required to establish interphase arrays of cortical microtubules in plant cells.  Here we show that MOR1 binds microtubules in vivo, localizing to both cortical  microtubules and to areas of overlapping microtubules in the phragmoplast.  Genetic complementation of the cytokinesis-defective gemini pollen 1-1 (gem1-1)  mutation with MOR1 shows that MOR1 (which is synonymous with the protein GEM1) is  essential in cytokinesis. Phenotypic analysis of gem1-1 and gem1-2, which  contains a T-DNA insertion, confirm that MOR1/GEM1 is essential for regular  patterns of cytokinesis. Both the gem1-1 and gem1-2 mutations cause the  truncation of the MOR1/GEM1 protein. In addition, the carboxy-terminal domain of  the protein, which is absent in both mutants, binds microtubules in vitro. Our  data show that MOR1/GEM1 has an essential role in the cytokinetic phragmoplast.', '2002 Sep', 'Nat Cell Biol', '10.1038/ncb844', 'Hussey']
