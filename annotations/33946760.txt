<i>Fagopyrum tataricum</i> 'Hokkai T10' is a buckwheat cultivar capable of producing large amounts of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids (anthocyanins), phenolic acids, and catechin, which have antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we revealed that the maize transcription factor Lc increased the accumulation of phenolic compounds, including sinapic acid, 4-hydroxybenzonate, <i>t</i>-cinnamic acid, and rutin, in Hokkai T10 hairy roots cultured under long-photoperiod (16 h light and 8 h dark) conditions. The transcription factor upregulated phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes, yielding total phenolic contents reaching 27.0 ± 3.30 mg g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight, 163% greater than the total flavonoid content produced by a <i>GUS</i>-overexpressing line (control). In contrast, when cultured under continuous darkness, the phenolic accumulation was not significantly different between the <i>ZmLC</i>-overexpressing hairy roots and the control. These findings suggest that the transcription factor (ZmLC) activity may be light-responsive in the <i>ZmLC</i>-overexpressing hairy roots of <i>F. tataricum</i>, triggering activation of the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Further studies are required on the optimization of light intensity in <i>ZmLC</i>-overexpressing hairy roots of <i>F. tataricum</i> to enhance the production of phenolic compounds.
