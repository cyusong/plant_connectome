Cotton Verticillium wilt (CVW) is a severe soilborne disease caused by the pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, and it has a great impact on cotton production. Previous studies found that the biocontrol agent <i>Chaetomium globosum</i> CEF-082 and its metabolic filtrate could reduce the incidence of CVW; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The metabolic crude extract of CEF-082 increased the sensitivity of <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i> to stress, degraded the cell wall of <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>, and increased the emergence and plant height of cotton. Through separation and purification of the metabolic crude extract of CEF-082, chaetoviridin A was identified and found to be highly active against <i>V. dahliae</i>. The compound caused cell necrosis and mycelial deformation, increased the production of reactive oxygen species and nitrous oxide, and inhibited the germination of microsclerotia of <i>V. dahliae</i>, enhancing the cotton plant defense response. In addition, CEF-082 also colonized cotton plants.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). This is an open access article distributed under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.
