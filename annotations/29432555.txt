Leguminous plant roots can form a symbiosis with soil-dwelling nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, leading to the formation of a new root organ, the nodule. Successful nodulation requires co-ordination of spatially separated events in the root, including infection in the root epidermis and nodule organogenesis deep in the root cortex. We show that the hormone gibberellin plays distinct roles in these epidermal and cortical programmes. We employed a unique set of genetic material in pea that includes severely gibberellin-deficient lines and della-deficient lines that enabled us to characterize all stages of infection and nodule development. We confirmed that gibberellin suppresses infection thread formation and show that it also promotes nodule organogenesis into nitrogen-fixing organs. In both cases, this is achieved through the action of DELLA proteins. This study therefore provides a mechanism to explain how both low and high gibberellin signalling can result in reduced nodule number and reveals a clear role for gibberellin in the maturation of nodules into nitrogen-fixing organs. We also demonstrate that gibberellin acts independently of ethylene in promoting nodule development.
