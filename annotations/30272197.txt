The transition of skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis is induced by the perception of light, and is characterized by the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and opening of cotyledons. Although it is known that the plant hormone cytokinin inhibits hypocotyl elongation in dark-grown Arabidopsis plants when applied in high concentrations, it is unclear to what extent this response is the result of cytokinin alone or cytokinin-induced ethylene production. Here, we show that cytokinin-induced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation is largely independent of ethylene and suggest a close connection between the cytokinin two-component system and the light-signaling networks. We show that this cytokinin signal is mainly mediated through the cytokinin receptor ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 and the ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR1 in combination with ARR12. Interestingly, mutation of CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPOGENIC1 (COP1), DE-ETIOLATED1, and CYTOKININ INSENSITIVE4/COP10 renders plants insensitive to cytokinin, and these factors are indispensable for the transcriptional response during cytokinin-induced de-etiolation, indicating that a functional light-signaling pathway is essential for this cytokinin response. In addition, the effect of cytokinin on hypocotyl elongation is strongly dependent on the light conditions, with higher light intensities causing a switch in the response to cytokinin from an inhibitor to a promoter of hypocotyl elongation.
