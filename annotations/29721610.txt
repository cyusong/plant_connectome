Mitogen-activated protein kinases seem to mark genes which are set up to be activated in daughter cells and thus they may play a direct role in cellular patterning during embryogenesis. Embryonic patterning starts very early and after the first division of zygote different genes are expressed in apical and basal cells. However, there is an ongoing debate about the way these different transcription patterns are established during embryogenesis. The presented data indicate that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) concentrate in the vicinity of chromosomes and form visible foci there. Cells in the apical and basal regions differ in number of foci observed during the metaphase which suggests that cellular patterning may be determined by activation of diverse MAPK-dependent genes. Different number of foci in each group of separating chromatids and the specified direction of these mitoses in apical-basal axis indicate that the unilateral auxin accumulation in a single cell may regulate the number of foci in each group of chromatids. Thus, we put forward a hypothesis that MAPKs localized in the vicinity of chromosomes during mitosis mark those genes which are set up to be activated in daughter cells after division. It implies that the chromosomal localization of MAPKs may be one of the mechanisms involved in establishment of cellular patterns in some plant species.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): !localize to! chromosomes 
MAPKs: !mark genes! set up to be activated in daughter cells 
MAPKs: !regulate! number of foci in each group of chromatids 
Unilateral auxin accumulation: !regulates! number of foci in each group of chromatids
