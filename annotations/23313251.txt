Metabolic engineering approaches to increase plant oil levels can generally be divided into categories which increase fatty acid biosynthesis ('Push'), are involved in TAG assembly ('Pull') or increase TAG storage/decrease breakdown ('Accumulation'). In this study, we describe the surprising synergy when Push (WRI1) and Pull (DGAT1) approaches are combined. Co-expression of these genes in the Nicotiana benthamiana transient leaf expression system resulted in TAG levels exceeding those expected from an additive effect and biochemical tracer studies confirmed increased flux of carbon through fatty acid and TAG synthesis pathways. Leaf fatty acid profile also synergistically shifts from polyunsaturated to monounsaturated fatty acids.
