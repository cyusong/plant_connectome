It is well known that abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence and premature leaf senescence negatively affect the yield of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this relationship, especially the upstream transcriptional network that modulates ABA level during leaf senescence, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a rice NAC transcription factor, OsNAC2, that participates in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of <i>OsNAC2</i> dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrated that OsNAC2 directly activates expression of chlorophyll degradation genes, <i>OsSGR</i> and <i>OsNYC3</i> Moreover, ectopic expression of <i>OsNAC2</i> leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly up-regulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (<i>OsNCED3</i> and <i>OsZEP1</i>) as well as down-regulating the ABA catabolic gene (<i>OsABA8ox1</i>). Interestingly, <i>OsNAC2</i> is upregulated by a lower level of ABA but downregulated by a higher level of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of <i>OsNAC2</i> by ABA. Additionally, reduced <i>OsNAC2</i> expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines. The novel ABA-NAC-SAGs regulatory module might provide a new insight into the molecular action of ABA to enhance leaf senescence and elucidates the transcriptional network of ABA production during leaf senescence in rice.
