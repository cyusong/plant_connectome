Concurrent suboptimal supply of several nutrients requires the coordination of nutrient-specific transcriptional, phenotypic, and metabolic changes in plants in order to optimize growth and development in most agricultural and natural ecosystems. Phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) and iron (Fe) deficiency induce overlapping but mostly opposing transcriptional and root growth responses in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. On the metabolite level, P<sub>i</sub> deficiency negatively modulates Fe deficiency-induced coumarin accumulation, which is controlled by Fe as well as P<sub>i</sub> deficiency response regulators. Here, we report the impact of Fe availability on seedling growth under P<sub>i</sub> limiting conditions and on P<sub>i</sub> deficiency-induced accumulation of amino acids and organic acids, which play important roles in P<sub>i</sub> use efficiency. Fe deficiency in P<sub>i</sub> replete conditions hardly changed growth and metabolite profiles in roots and shoots of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but partially rescued growth under conditions of P<sub>i</sub> starvation and severely modulated P<sub>i</sub> deficiency-induced metabolic adjustments. Analysis of T-DNA insertion lines revealed the concerted coordination of metabolic profiles by regulators of Fe (FIT, bHLH104, BRUTUS, PYE) as well as of P<sub>i</sub> (SPX1, PHR1, PHL1, bHLH32) starvation responses. The results show the interdependency of P<sub>i</sub> and Fe availability and the interplay between P<sub>i</sub> and Fe starvation signaling on the generation of plant metabolite profiles.
