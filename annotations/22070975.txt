The glutathione-ascorbate (GSH-ASC) cycle in plants plays an important role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species. Little is known about how the enzymes and antioxidants in the maize GSH-ASC cycle respond to stress. We clarified the genome positions, exon-intron structures and predicted subcellular locations of the ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR) families in maize. ABA treatment increased the transcript levels of most of the APX genes except ZmAPX3 and ZmAPX6, upregulated the transcription of ZmMDAR1 and downregulated the transcriptions of ZmMDAR3 and ZmMDAR4. However, it had little effect on the expressions of the ZmDHAR and ZmGR gene families. ABA treatment increased the activities of only 2 enzymes, ZmAPX and ZmDHAR. The PEG treatment led to similar expression patterns as that of ABA. ZmAPX1.1 and ZmAPX2 exhibited the same expression patterns under PEG treatment conditions. Enzyme activities were not affected by the PEG treatment with the exception of a significant decrease in MDAR activity that was observed after 6h. Compared to the ABA and PEG treatments, the NaCl treatment only slightly affected the transcription of the four gene families but significantly increased the activity of ZmGR. The ABA and PEG treatments elevate the ASC levels and decrease the GSSG level. Our results show that the gene families of the maize GSH-ASC redox cycle respond differently to abiotic stresses and suggest that APX and MDAR may play more important roles in stress tolerance in plants.
