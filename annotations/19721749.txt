Leguminous plants form root nodules, in which symbiotic rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen and supply the fixation products to their host plants as a nitrogen source. On the process of establishing the symbiosis, rhizobia induce genes involved in the defense system of their host plants. However, the host defense responses will be cancelled by unknown mechanism. We focused on nitric oxide (NO) as a key molecule of plant defense system and class 1 plant hemoglobin (Hb) as a scavenger of NO. The inoculation of a symbiotic rhizobium, <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i> MAFF303099, induced transiently NO production and expression of a class 1 Hb gene <i>LjHb1</i> in the roots of a model legume <i>Lotus japonicus</i>. In this addendum, we show that the lipopolysaccharide of <i>M. loti</i> induces NO production and expression of <i>LjHb1</i> in <i>L. japonicus</i>, and we propose the role of NO and Hb at the early stage of symbiosis.

Rhizobia: !induce! defense genes
NO: !induced by! Rhizobia
Hb: !scavenges! NO
LjHb1: !localizes to! roots
LPS: !induces! NO production
NO: !enhances! expression of LjHb1
