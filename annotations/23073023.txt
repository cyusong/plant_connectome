Plant growth and development is determined by intracellular and intercellular auxin gradients that are controlled at first hand by auxin efflux catalysts of the ABCB/PGP and PIN families. ABCB transport activity was shown to be counter-actively regulated by protein phosphorylation by the AGC protein kinase, PINOID (PID), that is coordinated by interaction with the immunophilin-like FKBP42, TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1). In contrast, PID was shown to determine PIN polarity, however, the direct impact of PID on PIN activity has yet not been tested. Co-expression in yeast indicates that PID had no effect on PIN1,2 alone but specifically inhibits interactive ABCB1-PIN1/PIN2 auxin efflux in an action that is dependent on its kinase activity. PIN1-PID co-transfection in N. benthamiana revealed that PID blocks PIN1-mediated auxin efflux without changing PIN1 location. In summary, these data provide evidence that PID phosphorylation does not only determine PIN polarity but also has a direct impact on transport activity of the activity of the binary PIN-ABCB1 complex.
