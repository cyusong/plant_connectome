Although physiological and biochemical data since long suggested that Na(+)/H(+) and K(+)/H(+) antiporters are involved in intracellular ion and pH regulation in plants, it has taken a long time to identify genes encoding antiporters that could fulfil these roles. Genome sequencing projects have now shown that plants contain a very large number of putative Cation/Proton antiporters, the function of which is only beginning to be studied. The intracellular NHX transporters constitute the first Cation/Proton exchanger family studied in plants. The founding member, AtNHX1, was identified as an important salt tolerance determinant and suggested to catalyze Na(+) accumulation in vacuoles. It is, however, becoming increasingly clear, that this gene and other members of the family also play crucial roles in pH regulation and K(+) homeostasis, regulating processes from vesicle trafficking and cell expansion to plant development.
