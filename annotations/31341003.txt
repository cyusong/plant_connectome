Microalgae are known to respond to salinity stress via mechanisms that include accumulation of compatible solutes and synthesis of antioxidants. Here, we describe a salinity-tolerance mechanism mediated by lipid droplets (LDs). In the alga <i>Parachlorella kessleri</i> grown under salt-stress conditions, we observed significant increases in cell size and LD content. LDs that were closely grouped along the plasma membrane shrank as the plasma membrane expanded, and some LDs were engulfed by vacuoles. Transcriptome analysis showed that genes encoding lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) and phospholipase A2 were significantly up-regulated following salt stress. Diacylglycerol kinase and LPLAT were identified in the proteome of salt-induced LDs, alongside vesicle trafficking and plastidial proteins and histone H2B. Analysis of fatty acid composition revealed an enrichment of C18:1 and C18:2 at the expense of C18:3 in response to salt stress. Pulse-chase experiments further suggested that variations of fatty acid composition were associated with LDs. Acetate stimulation research further confirmed a positive role of LDs in cell growth under salt stress. These results suggest that LDs play important roles in salt-stress tolerance, through harboring proteins, participating in cytoplasmic component recycling, and providing materials and enzymes for membrane modification and expansion.
