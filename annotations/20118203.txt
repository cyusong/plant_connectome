['20118203', 'Embryogenesis is a critical stage during the plant life cycle in which a  unicellular zygote develops into a multicellular organism. Co-ordinated gene  expression is thus necessary for proper embryo development. Polycomb and  Trithorax group genes are members of evolutionarily conserved machinery that  maintains the correct expression patterns of key developmental regulators by  repressing and activating gene transcription. TRAUCO (TRO), a gene homologous to  the Trithorax group of genes that can functionally complement a BRE2P yeast  mutant, has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. It is demonstrated that TRO  is a nuclear gene product expressed during embryogenesis, and loss of TRO  function leads to impaired early embryo development. Embryos that arrested at the  globular stage in the tro-1 mutant allele were fully rescued by a TRO expression  clone, a demonstration that the tro-1 mutation is a true loss-of-function in TRO.  Our data have established that TRO is the first trithorax-group gene homologue in  plants that is required for early embryogenesis.', '2010 Feb', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erp396', 'Arce-Johnson']
