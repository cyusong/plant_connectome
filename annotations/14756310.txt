['14756310', 'A mutant exhibiting conditional male sterility, in which fertility was restored  under conditions of high humidity, was identified in T-DNA tagged lines of  Arabidopsis thaliana. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that the  pollen surface was almost smooth and the reticulate pattern not prominent. Thus,  the mutant was named faceless pollen-1 (flp1). Transmission electron microscopy  (TEM) revealed that the smooth appearance was due to tryphine filling in the  exine cavities and covering the pollen surface. The lipid droplets in the  tryphine of mutant pollen were smaller and more numerous than those of the wild  type. SEM analysis also demonstrated that pollen exine was easily damaged by  acetolysis, suggesting that a component of exine, sporopollenin, was defective in  the mutant. In addition, the stems and siliques had reduced amounts of wax  crystals. A predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA that corresponded to the  tagged gene, fip1, showed sequence similarity to proteins involved in wax  biosynthesis. The FLP1 protein is likely to play a role in the synthesis of the  components of tryphine, sporopollenin of exine and the wax of stems and siliques.', '2003 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/B:PLAN.0000009269.97773.70', 'Toriyama']
