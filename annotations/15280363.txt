['15280363', 'Cytokinins (CKs), a group of phytohormones, are adenine derivatives that carry  either an isoprene-derived or an aromatic side chain at the N(6) terminus.  trans-Zeatin (tZ), an isoprenoid CK, is assumed to play a central physiological  role because of its general occurrence and high activity in bioassays. Although  hydroxylation of isopentenyladenine-type CKs is a key step of tZ biosynthesis,  the catalyzing enzyme has not been characterized yet. Here we demonstrate that  CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) that catalyze  the biosynthesis of tZ. We identified the genes from Arabidopsis using an  adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (AtIPT4)/P450 co-expression system in  yeast. Co-expression of AtIPT4 and CYP735A enabled yeast to excrete tZ and the  nucleosides to the culture medium. In vitro, both CYP735As preferentially  utilized isopentenyladenine nucleotides rather than the nucleoside and free base  forms and produced tZ nucleotides but not the cis-isomer. The expression of  CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 was differentially regulated in terms of organ specificity  and response to CK. Root-specific induction of CYP735A2 expression by CK suggests  that the trans-hydroxylation is involved in the regulation of CK metabolism and  signaling in roots.', '2004 Oct 1', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M406337200', 'Sakakibara']
