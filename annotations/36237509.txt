Cotton is a major fiber crop grown worldwide. Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for cotton production and supports efficient crop production. It is a crucial nutrient that is required more than any other. Nitrogen management is a daunting task for plants; thus, various strategies, individually and collectively, have been adopted to improve its efficacy. The negative environmental impacts of excessive N application on cotton production have become harmful to consumers and growers. The 4R's of nutrient stewardship (right product, right rate, right time, and right place) is a newly developed agronomic practice that provides a solid foundation for achieving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in cotton production. Cropping systems are equally crucial for increasing production, profitability, environmental growth protection, and sustainability. This concept incorporates the right fertilizer source at the right rate, time, and place. In addition to agronomic practices, molecular approaches are equally important for improving cotton NUE. This could be achieved by increasing the efficacy of metabolic pathways at the cellular, organ, and structural levels and NUE-regulating enzymes and genes. This is a potential method to improve the role of N transporters in plants, resulting in better utilization and remobilization of N in cotton plants. Therefore, we suggest effective methods for accelerating NUE in cotton. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of agronomic and molecular approaches for improving NUE in cotton production, which benefits both the environment and growers.
