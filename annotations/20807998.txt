['20807998', "In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), farnesylcysteine is oxidized to farnesal  and cysteine by a membrane-associated thioether oxidase called farnesylcysteine  lyase. Farnesol and farnesyl phosphate kinases have also been reported in plant  membranes. Together, these observations suggest the existence of enzymes that  catalyze the interconversion of farnesal and farnesol. In this report,  Arabidopsis membranes are shown to possess farnesol dehydrogenase activity. In  addition, a gene on chromosome 4 of the Arabidopsis genome (At4g33360), called  FLDH, is shown to encode an NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase that oxidizes farnesol  more efficiently than other prenyl alcohol substrates. FLDH expression is  repressed by abscisic acid (ABA) but is increased in mutants with T-DNA  insertions in the FLDH 5' flanking region. These T-DNA insertion mutants, called  fldh-1 and fldh-2, are associated with an ABA-insensitive phenotype, suggesting  that FLDH is a negative regulator of ABA signaling.", '2010 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.157784', 'Crowell']
