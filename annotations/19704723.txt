The soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) is an obligate parasite of soybean (Glycine max). It is the most destructive pathogen of G. max, accounting for approximately 0.46-0.82 billion dollars in crop losses, annually, in the U.S. Part of the infection process involves H. glycines establishing feeding sites (syncytia) that it derives its nourishment from throughout its lifecycle. Microscopic methods (i.e., laser capture microdissection [LCM]) that faithfully dissect out those feeding sites are important improvements to the study of this significant plant pathogen. Our isolation of developing feeding sites during an incompatible or a compatible reaction is providing new ways by which this important plant-pathogen interaction can be studied. We have used these methods to create cDNA libraries, clone genes and perform microarray analyses. Importantly, it is providing insight not only into how the root is responding at the organ level to H. glycines, but also how the syncytium is responding during its maturation into a functional feeding site.
