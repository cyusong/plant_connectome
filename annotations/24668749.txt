The apical hook is an essential structure that enables epigeal plants to protrude through the soil. Arabidopsis thaliana HOOKLESS1 (HLS1) is reported to be a key regulator of hook development and a direct target gene of the ethylene (ET)-activated transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and its close homolog EIN3-Like1. Previous research has shown that the phytohormones jasmonate (JA) and ET antagonistically regulate apical hook development, although the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we report that JA represses hook formation by reducing HLS1 expression. Our results further reveal that the JA-activated transcription factor MYC2 represses EIN3 function to reduce HLS1 expression through at least the following two layers of regulation: (1) MYC2 binds to the promoter of an F-box gene, EIN3 BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN1, to induce its expression and thus promote EIN3 degradation; and (2) MYC2 physically interacts with EIN3 and inhibits its DNA binding activity. Collectively, our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the antagonism between JA and ET during apical hook development and provide insight into the coaction of multiple phytohormones in the regulation of plant growth and development.
