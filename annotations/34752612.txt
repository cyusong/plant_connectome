['34752612', 'Plant chloroplast RNA splicing and ribosome maturation (CRM)-domain-containing  proteins are capable of binding RNA to facilitate the splicing of group I or II  introns in chloroplasts, but their functions in mitochondria are less clear. In  the present study, Arabidopsis thaliana CFM6, a protein with a single CRM domain,  was expressed in most plant tissues, particularly in flower tissues, and  restricted to mitochondria. Mutation of CFM6 causes severe growth defects,  including stunted growth, curled leaves, delayed embryogenesis and pollen  development. CFM6 functions specifically in the splicing of group II intron 4 of  nad5, which encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, as evidenced by the  loss of nad5 intron 4 splicing and high accumulation of its pretranscripts in  cfm6 mutants. The phenotypic and splicing defects of cfm6 were rescued in  transgenic plants overexpressing 35S::CFM6-YFP. Splicing failure in cfm6 also led  to the loss of complex I activity and to its improper assembly. Moreover,  dysfunction of complex I induced the expression of proteins or genes involved in  alternative respiratory pathways in cfm6. Collectively, CFM6, a previously  uncharacterized CRM domain-containing protein, is specifically involved in the  cis-splicing of nad5 intron 4 and plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial complex I  biogenesis and normal plant growth.', '2022 Feb 15', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcab161', 'ORCID:']
