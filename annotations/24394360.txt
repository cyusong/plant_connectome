Cyclophilins are molecular chaperone act as peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase responsible for protein folding and assembly in many normal cellular processes, stabilize proteins and membranes under stress conditions. Recently, we report on the role cyclophilin A-like gene from Piriformospora indica (PiCypA) in salinity stress tolerance in T1 transgenic and up to seedling stage of T2 transgenic of tobacco plants. Here, PiCypA T2 generation matured tobacco plants were evaluated under salt (200 mM NaCl) up to flowering and seed set stages. We found that PiCypA T2 tobacco lines showed comparatively better survival and exhibited higher root growth and fresh weight as compared with wild type and vector control. This study provides further direct evidence that PiCypA transgene maintained the sustainability in providing salinity stress tolerance in T2 generation of transgenic tobacco plants.

PiCypA T2 generation: !exhibited higher! root growth and fresh weight 
PiCypA transgene: !maintained sustainability! in providing salinity stress tolerance
