In order to identify potential biochemical markers that can be used as indicators for phase change, the dynamics of polyphenolic compounds across apple seedlings (Malus domestica, Jonathan x Golden Delicious) were analyzed in this study by high performance liquid chromatography. Precocious flowering was induced by foliar sprays of plant growth regulators. Qualitative changes in the concentration of polyphenols were observed at node nos. 50, 80 and 120. Spontaneous and induced flowering was found at node nos. 122 and 77. It was reasonable to conclude that node no. 77 represented the point of transition between the juvenile phase and the adult vegetative phase, which was marked by the presence of phloridzin in the buds. The disappearance of myricitrin in the bark and the absence of caffeic acid in the aboveground tissues were qualitative markers of the reproductive phase, which was reached at node no. 122.
