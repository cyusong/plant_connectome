Heat shock proteins (HSPs) perform a fundamental role in protecting plants against abiotic stresses. Individual family members have been analyzed in previous studies, but there has not yet been a comprehensive analysis of the HSP70 gene family in Pyropia yezoensis. We investigated 15 putative HSP70 genes in Py. yezoensis. These genes were classified into two sub-families, denoted as DnaK and Hsp110. In each sub-family, there was relative conservation of the gene structure and motif. Synteny-based analysis indicated that seven and three PyyHSP70 genes were orthologous to HSP70 genes in Pyropia haitanensis and Porphyra umbilicalis, respectively. Most PyyHSP70s showed up-regulated expression under different degrees of dehydration stress. PyyHSP70-1 and PyyHSP70-3 were expressed in higher degrees compared with other PyyHSP70s in dehydration treatments, and then expression degrees somewhat decreased in rehydration treatment. Subcellular localization showed PyyHSP70-1-GFP and PyyHSP70-3-GFP were in the cytoplasm and nucleus/cytoplasm, respectively. Similar expression patterns of paired orthologs in Py. yezoensis and Py. haitanensis suggest important roles for HSP70s in intertidal environmental adaptation during evolution. These findings provide insight into the evolution and modification of the PyyHSP70 gene family and will help to determine the functions of the HSP70 genes in Py. yezoensis growth and development.
