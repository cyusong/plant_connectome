The goal of suppressing photorespiration in crops to maximize assimilation and yield is stimulating considerable interest among researchers looking to bioengineer carbon-concentrating mechanisms into C<sub>3</sub> plants. However, detailed quantification of the biochemical activities in the bundle sheath is lacking. This work presents a general stoichiometric model for C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>+C<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>4</sub> assimilation (SMA) in which energetics, metabolite traffic, and the different decarboxylating enzymes (NAD-dependent malic enzyme, NADP-dependent malic enzyme, or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) are explicitly included. The SMA can be used to refine experimental data analysis or formulate hypothetical scenarios, and is coded in a freely available Microsoft Excel workbook. The theoretical underpinnings and general model behaviour are analysed with a range of simulations, including (i) an analysis of C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>+C<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>4</sub> in operational conditions; (ii) manipulating photorespiration in a C<sub>3</sub> plant; (iii) progressively upregulating a C<sub>2</sub> shuttle in C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis; (iv) progressively upregulating a C<sub>4</sub> cycle in C<sub>2</sub> photosynthesis; and (v) manipulating processes that are hypothesized to respond to transient environmental inputs. Results quantify the functional trade-offs, such as the electron transport needed to meet ATP/NADPH demand, as well as metabolite traffic, inherent to different subtypes. The SMA refines our understanding of the stoichiometry of photosynthesis, which is of paramount importance for basic and applied research.
