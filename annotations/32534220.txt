Adventitious roots form from non-root tissues as part of normal development or in response to stress or wounding. The root primordia form in the source tissue, and during emergence the adventitious roots penetrate the inner cell layers and the epidermis; however, the mechanisms underlying this emergence remain largely unexplored. Here, we report that a regulatory module composed of the AP2/ERF transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4), the MAP kinases MPK3 and MPK6, and the phosphatase PP2C12 plays an important role in the emergence of junction adventitious roots (J-ARs) from the root-hypocotyl junctions in Arabidopsis thaliana. ABI4 negatively regulates J-AR emergence, preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and death of epidermal cells, which would otherwise facilitate J-AR emergence. Phosphorylation by MPK3/MPK6 activates ABI4 and dephosphorylation by PP2C12 inactivates ABI4. MPK3/MPK6 also directly phosphorylate and inactivate PP2C12 during J-AR emergence. We propose that this "double-check" mechanism increases the robustness of MAP kinase signaling and finely regulates the local programmed cell death required for J-AR emergence.

ABI4: !negatively regulates! J-AR emergence
MPK3/MPK6: !phosphorylates! ABI4
MPK3/MPK6: !inactivates! PP2C12
PP2C12: !dephosphorylates! ABI4
