Machine vision-based navigation in the maize field is significant for intelligent agriculture. Therefore, precision detection of the tasseled crop rows for navigation of agricultural machinery with an accurate and fast method remains an open question. In this article, we propose a new crop rows detection method at the tasseling stage of maize fields for agrarian machinery navigation. The whole work is achieved mainly through image augment and feature point extraction by micro-region of interest (micro-ROI). In the proposed method, we first augment the distinction between the tassels and background by the logarithmic transformation in RGB color space, and then the image is transformed to hue-saturation-value (HSV) space to extract the tassels. Second, the ROI is approximately selected and updated using the bounding box until the multiple-region of interest (multi-ROI) is determined. We further propose a feature points extraction method based on micro-ROI and the feature points are used to calculate the crop rows detection lines. Finally, the bisector of the acute angle formed by the two detection lines is used as the field navigation line. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed has good robustness and can accurately detect crop rows. Compared with other existing methods, our method's accuracy and real-time performance have improved by about 5 and 62.3%, respectively, which can meet the accuracy and real-time requirements of agricultural vehicles' navigation in maize fields.
