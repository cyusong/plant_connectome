Flowering time is crucial for successful reproduction in plants, the onset and progression of which are strictly controlled. However, flowering time is a complex and environmentally responsive history trait and the underlying mechanisms still need to be fully characterized. Post-translational regulation of the activities of transcription factors (TFs) is a dynamic and essential mechanism for plant growth and development. CRL3<sup>BPM</sup> E3 ligase is a CULLIN3-based E3 ligase involved in orchestrating protein stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Our study shows that the mutation of MYB106 induced early flowering phenotype while over-expression of MYB106 delayed Arabidopsis flowering. Transcriptome analysis of myb106 mutants reveals 257 differentially expressed genes between wild type and myb106-1 mutants, including Flowering Locus T (FT) which is related to flowering time. Moreover, in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assays and dual luciferase assays demonstrate that MYB106 directly binds to the promoter of FT to suppress its expression. Furthermore, we confirm that MYB106 interacts with BPM proteins which are further identified by CRL3<sup>BPM</sup> E3 ligases as the substrate. Taken together, we have identified MYB106 as a negative regulator in the control of flowering time and a new substrate for CRL3<sup>BPM</sup> E3 ligases in Arabidopsis.
