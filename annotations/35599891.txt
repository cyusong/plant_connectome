FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLS3 (FHY3) and its homolog FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1), which play pivotal roles in plant growth and development, are essential for the photo-induced phyA nuclear accumulation and subsequent photoreaction. The FAR1/FHY3 family has been systematically characterized in some plants, but not in <i>Eucalyptus grandis</i>. In this study, genome-wide identification of <i>FAR1/FHY3</i> genes in <i>E. grandis</i> was performed using bioinformatic methods. The gene structures, chromosomal locations, the encoded protein characteristics, 3D models, phylogenetic relationships, and promoter <i>cis</i>-elements were analyzed with this gene family. A total of 33 <i>FAR1/FHY3</i> genes were identified in <i>E. grandis</i>, which were divided into three groups based on their phylogenetic relationships. A total of 21 pairs of duplicated repeats were identified by homology analysis. Gene expression analysis showed that most <i>FAR1/FHY3</i> genes were differentially expressed in a spatial-specific manner. Gene expression analysis also showed that <i>FAR1/FHY3</i> genes responded to salt and temperature stresses. These results and observation will enhance our understanding of the evolution and function of the <i>FAR1/FHY3</i> genes in <i>E. grandis</i> and facilitate further studies on the molecular mechanism of the <i>FAR1/FHY3</i> gene family in growth and development regulations, especially in response to salt and temperature.
