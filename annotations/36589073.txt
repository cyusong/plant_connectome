Peptidyl-prolyl <i>cis-trans</i> isomerases (PPIases) are ubiquitous proteins which are essential for <i>cis-trans</i> isomerisation of peptide bonds preceding the proline residue. PPIases are categorized into four sub-families <i>viz</i>., cyclophilins, FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), parvulins and protein phosphatase 2A phosphatase activators (PTPAs). Apart from catalysing the <i>cis-trans</i> isomerization, these proteins have also been implicated in diverse cellular functions. Though PPIases have been identified in several important crop plants, information on these proteins, except cyclophilins, is scanty in wheat. In order to understand the role of these genes in wheat, we carried out genome-wide identification using computational approaches. The present study resulted in identification of 71 FKBP (<i>TaFKBP</i>) 12 parvulin (<i>TaPar</i>) and 3 PTPA (<i>TaPTPA</i>) genes in hexaploid wheat genome, which are distributed on different chromosomes with uneven gene densities. The TaFKBP and TaPar proteins, besides PPIase domain, also contain additional domains, indicating functional diversification. <i>In silico</i> prediction also revealed that TaFKBPs are localized to ER, nucleus, chloroplast and cytoplasm, while the TaPars are confined to cytoplasm and nucleus. The TaPTPAs, on the contrary, appear to be present only in the cytoplasm. Evolutionary studies predicted that most of the <i>TaFKBP, TaPar</i> and <i>TaPTPA</i> genes in hexaploid wheat have been derived from their progenitor species, with some events of loss or gain. Syntenic analysis revealed the presence of many collinear blocks of <i>TaFKBP</i> genes in wheat and its sub-genome donors. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that expression of <i>TaFKBP</i> and <i>TaPar</i> genes is regulated differentially by heat stress, suggesting their likely involvement in thermotolerance. The findings of this study will provide basis for further functional characterization of these genes and their likely applications in crop improvement.
