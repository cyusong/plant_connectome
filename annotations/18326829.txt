['18326829', 'Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule in plants. This analysis of  Arabidopsis thaliana HOT5 (sensitive to hot temperatures), which is required for  thermotolerance, uncovers a role of NO in thermotolerance and plant development.  HOT5 encodes S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which metabolizes the NO  adduct S-nitrosoglutathione. Two hot5 missense alleles and two T-DNA insertion,  protein null alleles were characterized. The missense alleles cannot acclimate to  heat as dark-grown seedlings but grow normally and can heat-acclimate in the  light. The null alleles cannot heat-acclimate as light-grown plants and have  other phenotypes, including failure to grow on nutrient plates, increased  reproductive shoots, and reduced fertility. The fertility defect of hot5 is due  to both reduced stamen elongation and male and female fertilization defects. The  hot5 null alleles show increased nitrate and nitroso species levels, and the heat  sensitivity of both missense and null alleles is associated with increased NO  species. Heat sensitivity is enhanced in wild-type and mutant plants by NO  donors, and the heat sensitivity of hot5 mutants can be rescued by an NO  scavenger. An NO-overproducing mutant is also defective in thermotolerance.  Together, our results expand the importance of GSNOR-regulated NO homeostasis to  abiotic stress and plant development.', '2008 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.052647', 'Vierling']
