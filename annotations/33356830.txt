Oat (<i>Avena sativa</i> L.) is an important crop in northwestern China. Drought stress is the most significant factor affecting oat yield. In the present study, we explored the changes that occur in oats under drought stress conditions at a global genomic level. RNA sequencing was performed using 15-day-old oat seedlings. The differentially expressed transcripts were identified, and their related functions and pathways were investigated. In total, 1,065 unigenes were differentially expressed in oats under drought stress conditions. Of these, 386 unigenes were upregulated and 679 were downregulated. The perturbed transcripts were closely related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, and biosynthesis of antibiotics. DN50483_c0_g1_i3, which was annotated as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, was a significant node in the protein-protein interaction network. Biosynthesis of antibiotics and secondary metabolites may be involved in the drought stress response mechanisms of oats. The perturbed transcripts may provide targets for improving plant stress responses.
