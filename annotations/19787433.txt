Salt cress (Thellungiella halophila), a salt-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis, has turned to be an important model plant for studying abiotic stress tolerance. One binary bacterial artificial chromosome (BIBAC) library was constructed which represents the first plant-transformation-competent large-insert DNA library generated for Thellungiella halophila. The BIBAC library was constructed in BamHI site of binary vector pBIBAC2 by ligation of partial digested nuclear DNA of Thellungiella halophila. This library consists of 23,040 clones with an average insert size of 75 kb, and covers 4x Thellungiella halophila haploid genomes. BIBAC clones which contain inserts over 50 kb were selected and transformed into Arabidopsis for salt tolerant plant screening. One transgenic line was found to be more salt tolerant than wild type plants from the screen of 200 lines. It was demonstrated that the library contains candidates of stress tolerance genes and the approach is suitable for the transformation of stress susceptible plants for genetic improvement.
