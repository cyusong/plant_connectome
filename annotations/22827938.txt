The gaseous plant hormone ethylene is perceived by a family of five ethylene receptor members in the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis. Genetic and biochemical studies suggest that the ethylene response is suppressed by ethylene receptor complexes, but the biochemical nature of the receptor signal is unknown. Without appropriate biochemical measures to trace the ethylene receptor signal and quantify the signal strength, the biological significance of the modulation of ethylene responses by multiple ethylene receptors has yet to be fully addressed. Nevertheless, the ethylene receptor signal strength can be reflected by degrees in alteration of various ethylene response phenotypes and in expression levels of ethylene-inducible genes. This mini-review highlights studies that have advanced our understanding of cooperative ethylene receptor signaling.
