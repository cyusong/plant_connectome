['28684426', 'Histones are essential components of the nucleosome, the major chromatin subunit  that structures linear DNA molecules and regulates access of other proteins to  DNA. Specific histone chaperone complexes control the correct deposition of  canonical histones and their variants to modulate nucleosome structure and  stability. In this study, we characterize the Arabidopsis thaliana Alpha  Thalassemia-mental Retardation X-linked (ATRX) ortholog and show that ATRX is  involved in histone H3 deposition. Arabidopsis ATRX mutant alleles are viable,  but show developmental defects and reduced fertility. Their combination with  mutants of the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA (Histone Regulator A) results in  impaired plant survival, suggesting that HIRA and ATRX function in complementary  histone deposition pathways. Indeed, ATRX loss of function alters cellular  histone H3.3 pools and in consequence modulates the H3.1/H3.3 balance in the  cell. H3.3 levels are affected especially at genes characterized by elevated H3.3  occupancy, including the 45S ribosomal DNA (45S rDNA) loci, where loss of ATRX  results in altered expression of specific 45S rDNA sequence variants. At the  genome-wide scale, our data indicate that ATRX modifies gene expression  concomitantly to H3.3 deposition at a set of genes characterized both by elevated  H3.3 occupancy and high expression. Together, our results show that ATRX is  involved in H3.3 deposition and emphasize the role of histone chaperones in  adjusting genome expression.', '2017 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00877', 'ORCID:']
