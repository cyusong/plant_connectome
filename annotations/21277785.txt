['21277785', 'Stress response and adaptation are important physiological mechanisms in plants.  As plants are not able to avoid stressful environments by moving away, as  animals, they have developed diverse mechanisms to respond to stressful  situations. One of the genes involved in these mechanisms is NRP (Asparagine-rich  protein or N-rich protein). In this study, NRP expression, protein localization  and nrp knockout plants were investigated for further understanding of NRP  function. NaCl-induced salt stress, oxidative stress (ozone exposure) and  mechanical perturbation (touch treatment) were used to induce abiotic stress. NRP  expression was up-regulated in the early phase of stress response to all three  elicitors. Stressed nrp knockout seedlings revealed a more pronounced growth  inhibition compared to wildtype (salt and osmotic stress). Seedlings showed  NRP-GFP expression in the apical meristem, leaf veins, central cylinder, root  hair zone and root tip. Analyses of NRP-GFP localization in root cells and  protoplasts revealed cytosolic distribution under non-stress conditions and  translocation of NRP-GFP to mitochondria due to stress response. Summarizing, our  findings point to a contribution of NRP in signal transduction of the initial  phase of general stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.01.005', 'Tenhaken']
