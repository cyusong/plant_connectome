The global increase in nanotechnology applications has been unprecedented and has now moved into the area of agriculture and food production. Applications with promising potential in sustainable agriculture include nanobiosensors, nanofertilizers, nanopesticides, nano-mediated remediation strategies for contaminated soils and nanoscale strategies to increase crop production and protection. Given this, the impact of nanomaterials/nanoparticles (NPs) on plant species needs to be thoroughly evaluated as this represents a critical interface between the biosphere and the environment. Importantly, phytohormones represent a critical class of biomolecules to plant health and productivity; however, the impact of NPs on these molecules is poorly understood. In addition, phytohormones, and associated pathways, are widely explored in agriculture to influence several biological processes for the improvement of plant growth and productivity under natural as well as stressed conditions. However, the impact of exogenous applications of phytohormones on NP-treated plants has not been explored. The importance of hormone signaling and cross-talk with other metabolic systems makes these biomolecules ideal candidates for a thorough assessment of NP impacts on plant species. This article presents a critical evaluation of the existing yet limited literature available on NP-phytohormone interactions in plants. In addition, the developing strategy of nano-enabled precision delivery of phytohormones via nanocarriers will be explored. Finally, directions for future research and critical knowledge gaps will be identified for this important aspect of nano-enabled agriculture.
