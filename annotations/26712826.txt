Meiosis is essential for gametogenesis in sexual reproduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We identified a MutS-homolog (MSH) family gene OsMSH4 in a trisomic plant. Cytological analysis showed that developments of both pollen and embryo sacs in an Osmsh4 mutant were blocked due to defective chromosome pairing. Compared with the wild type, the Osmsh4 mutant displayed a significant ~21.9% reduction in chiasma frequency, which followed a Poisson distribution, suggesting that class I crossover formation in the mutant was impaired. Temporal and spatial expression pattern analyses showed that OsMSH4 was preferentially expressed in meiocytes during their meiosis, indicating a critical role in gametogenesis. Subcellular localization showed that OsMSH4-green fluorescent protein was predominantly located in the nucleus. OsMSH4 could interact with another MSH member (OsMSH5) through the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. Direct physical interaction between OsMSH5, OsRPA1a, OsRPA2b, OsRPA1c, and OsRPA2c was identified by yeast two-hybrid assays and further validated by pull-down assays. Our results supported the conclusion that the OsMSH4/5 heterodimer plays a key role in regulation of crossover formation during rice meiosis by interaction with the RPA complex.
