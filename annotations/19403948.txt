['19403948', 'The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is  the most abundant membrane protein in green plants, and its degradation is a  crucial process for the acclimation to high light conditions and for the recovery  of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) during senescence. However, the molecular  mechanism of LHCII degradation is largely unknown. Here, we report that  chlorophyll b reductase, which catalyzes the first step of chlorophyll b  degradation, plays a central role in LHCII degradation. When the genes for  chlorophyll b reductases NOL and NYC1 were disrupted in Arabidopsis thaliana,  chlorophyll b and LHCII were not degraded during senescence, whereas other  pigment complexes completely disappeared. When purified trimeric LHCII was  incubated with recombinant chlorophyll b reductase (NOL), expressed in  Escherichia coli, the chlorophyll b in LHCII was converted to 7-hydroxymethyl  chlorophyll a. Accompanying this conversion, chlorophylls were released from  LHCII apoproteins until all the chlorophyll molecules in LHCII dissociated from  the complexes. Chlorophyll-depleted LHCII apoproteins did not dissociate into  monomeric forms but remained in the trimeric form. Based on these results, we  propose the novel hypothesis that chlorophyll b reductase catalyzes the initial  step of LHCII degradation, and that trimeric LHCII is a substrate of LHCII  degradation.', '2009 Jun 26', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M109.008912', 'Tanaka']
