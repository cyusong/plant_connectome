Advances in systematic computational biology and rapid elucidation of synergistic interplay between cis and trans factors governing transcriptional control have facilitated functional annotation of gene networks. The generation of data through deconstructive, reconstructive and database assisted promoter studies, and its integration to principles of synthetic engineering has started an era of designer promoters. Exploration of natural promoter architecture and the concept of cis engineering have not only enabled fine tuning of single or multiple transgene expression in response to perturbations in the chemical, physiological and environmental stimuli but also provided researchers with a unique answer to various problems in crop improvement in the form of bidirectional promoters.
