Radish is a crucial vegetable crop of the <i>Brassicaceae</i> family with many varieties and large cultivated area in China. Radish is a cool season crop, and there are only a few heat tolerant radish varieties in practical production with little information concerning the related genes in response to heat stress. In this work, some physiological parameter changes of young leaves under short-term heat stress were detected. Furthermore, we acquired 1802 differentially expressed mRNAs (including encoding some heat shock proteins, heat shock factor and heat shock-related transcription factors), 169 differentially expressed lncRNAs and three differentially expressed circRNAs (novel_circ_0000265, novel_circ_0000325 and novel_circ_0000315) through strand-specific RNA sequencing technology. We also found 10 differentially expressed miRNAs (ath-miR159b-3p, athmiR159c, ath-miR398a-3p, athmiR398b-3p, ath-miR165a-5p, ath-miR169g-3p, novel_86, novel_107, novel_21 and ath-miR171b-3p) by small RNA sequencing technology. Through function prediction and enrichment analysis, our results suggested that the significantly possible pathways/complexes related to heat stress in radish leaves were circadian rhythm-plant, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, arginine and proline metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, peroxisome and plant hormone signal transduction. Besides, we identified one lncRNA-miRNA-mRNAs combination responsive to heat stress. These results will be helpful for further illustration of molecular regulation networks of how radish responds to heat stress.
