Protein phosphorylation by kinase is an important mechanism for adapting to drought stress conditions. Here, we isolated the <i>CaDIMK1</i> (<i>Capsicum annuum drought-induced MAP kinase 1</i>) from dehydrated pepper leaf tissue and functionally characterized it. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the CaDIMK1 protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. <i>CaDIMK1</i>-silenced pepper plants exhibited drought-susceptible phenotypes that were characterized by increased transpiration rates, low leaf temperatures, and decreased stomatal closure. In contrast, <i>CaDIMK1</i>-overexpressing (OX) transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) from germination to adult growth stages. Furthermore, the <i>CaDIMK1</i>-OX plants were tolerant to drought stress. The transcript levels of several stress-related genes were high in <i>CaDIMK1</i>-OX plants than in wild-type plants. Taken together, our data demonstrate that <i>CaDIMK1</i> acts as a positive modulator of drought tolerance and ABA signal transduction in pepper plants.
