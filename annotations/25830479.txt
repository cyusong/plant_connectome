MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in development and stress responses in plants. Lead (Pb) is a non-essential element that is highly toxic to living organisms. Platanus acerifolia is grown as a street tree in cities throughout temperate regions for its importance in improving the urban ecological environment. MiRNAs that respond to abiotic stresses have been identified in plants; however, until now, the influence of Pb stress on P. acerifolia miRNAs has not been reported. To identify miRNAs and predict their target genes under Pb stress, two small RNA and two degradome libraries were constructed from Pb-treated and Pb-free leaves of P. acerifolia seedlings. After sequencing, 55 known miRNAs and 129 novel miRNAs were obtained, and 104 target genes for the miRNAs were identified by degradome sequencing. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed to predict the functions of the targets. The expressions of eight differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). This is the first report about P. acerifolia miRNAs and their target genes under Pb stress. This study has provided data for further research into molecular mechanisms involved in resistance of P. acerifolia to Pb stress.
