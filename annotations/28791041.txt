['28791041', 'Previous studies have shown that several ACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN DESATURASE  (AtAAD) members in Arabidopsis thaliana are responsible for oleic acid (C18:1)  biosynthesis. Limited research has been conducted on another member, AtAAD5, and  its paralog BnAAD5 in the closely related and commercially important plant,  Brassica napus. Here, we found that AtAAD5 was predominantly and exclusively  expressed in developing embryos at the whole seed developmental stages. The aad5  mutation caused a significant decrease in the amounts of oil and C18:1, and a  considerable increase in the content of stearic acid (C18:0) in mature seeds,  suggesting that AtAAD5 functioned as an important facilitator of seed oil  biosynthesis. We also cloned the full-length coding sequence of BnAAD5-1 from the  A3 subgenome of the B. napus inbred line L111. We showed that ectopic expression  of BnAAD5-1 in the A. thaliana aad5-2 mutant fully complemented the phenotypes of  the mutant, such as lower oil content and altered contents of C18:0 and C18:1.  These results help us to better understand the functions of AAD members in A.  thaliana and B. napus and provide a promising target for genetic manipulation of  B. napus.', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.01319', 'Chen']
