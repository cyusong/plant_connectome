Nitrogen (N) is both an important macronutrient and a signal for plant growth and development. However, the early regulatory mechanism of plants in response to N starvation is not well understood, especially in cucumber, an economically important crop that normally consumes excessive N during production. In this study, the early time-course transcriptome response of cucumber leaves under N deficiency was monitored using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). More than 23,000 transcripts were examined in cucumber leaves, of which 364 genes were differentially expressed in response to N deficiency. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction analysis, 64 signaling-related N-deficiency-responsive genes were identified. Furthermore, the potential regulatory mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation, Chl decline and cell wall remodeling were assessed at the transcription level. Increased ascorbic acid synthesis was identified in cucumber seedlings and fruit under N-deficient conditions, and a new corresponding regulatory hypothesis has been proposed. A data cross-comparison between model plants and cucumber was made, and some common and specific N-deficient response mechanisms were found in the present study. Our study provides novel insights into the responses of cucumber to nitrogen starvation at the global transcriptome level, which are expected to be highly useful for dissecting the N response pathways in this major vegetable and for improving N fertilization practices.
