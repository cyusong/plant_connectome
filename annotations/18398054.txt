['18398054', 'Three amino acid loop extension (TALE) homeodomain transcriptional regulators  play a central role in plant and animal developmental programs. Plant  KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) and animal Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site  (MEIS) proteins share a TALE homeodomain and a MEINOX (MEIS-KNOX) domain,  suggesting that an ancestral MEINOX-TALE protein predates the divergence of  plants from fungi and animals. In this study, we identify and characterize the  Arabidopsis thaliana KNATM gene, which encodes a MEINOX domain but not a  homeodomain. Phylogenetic analysis of the KNOX family places KNATM in a new class  and shows conservation in dicotyledons. We demonstrate that KNATM selectively  interacts with Arabidopsis BELL TALE proteins through the MEINOX domain. The  homeodomain is known to be necessary for KNOX-KNOX interaction. On the contrary,  KNATM specifically dimerizes with the KNOX protein BREVIPEDICELLUS through an  acidic coiled-coil domain. KNATM is expressed in proximal-lateral domains of  organ primordia and at the boundary of mature organs; in accordance, genetic  analyses identify a function for KNATM in leaf proximal-distal patterning. In  vivo domain analyses highlighted KNATM functional regions and revealed a role as  transcriptional regulator. Taken together, our data reveal a  homeodomain-independent mechanism of KNOX dimerization and transcriptional  regulation.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.058495', 'Hake']
