The closely related microRNA (miRNA) and RNAi pathways have emerged as important regulators of virus-host cell interactions. Although both pathways are relatively well conserved all the way from plants to invertebrates to mammals, there are important differences between these systems. A more complete understanding of these differences will be required to fully appreciate the relationship between these diverse host organisms and the various viruses that infect them. Insights derived from this research will facilitate a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and the host innate immune response to viral infection.
