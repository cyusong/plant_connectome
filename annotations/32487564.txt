The switch from dark- to light-mediated development is critical for the survival and growth of seedlings, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are incomplete. Here, we show that the steroids phytohormone brassinosteroids play crucial roles during this developmental transition by regulating chlorophyll biosynthesis to promote greening of etiolated seedlings upon light exposure. Etiolated seedlings of the brassinosteroids-deficient <i>det2-1</i> (<i>de-etiolated2</i>) mutant accumulated excess protochlorophyllide, resulting in photo-oxidative damage upon exposure to light. Conversely, the gain-of-function mutant <i>bzr1-1D</i> (<i>brassinazole-resistant 1-1D</i>) suppressed the protochlorophyllide accumulation of <i>det2-1</i>, thereby promoting greening of etiolated seedlings. Genetic analysis indicated that phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) were required for BZR1-mediated seedling greening. Furthermore, we reveal that GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 7 (<i>GRF7</i>) and <i>GRF8</i> are induced by BZR1 and PIF4 to repress chlorophyll biosynthesis and promote seedling greening. Suppression of GRFs function by overexpressing <i>microRNA396a</i> caused an accumulation of protochlorophyllide in the dark and severe photobleaching upon light exposure. Additionally, BZR1, PIF4, and GRF7 interact with each other and precisely regulate the expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes. Our findings reveal an essential role for BRs in promoting seedling development and survival during the initial emergence of seedlings from subterranean darkness into sunlight.
