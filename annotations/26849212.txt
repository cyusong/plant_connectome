['26849212', 'NHL (NDR1/HIN1-like) genes play crucial roles in pathogen induced plant responses  to biotic stress. Here, we report the possible function of NHL6 in plant response  to abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stress. NHL6 was highly expressed in  non-germinated seeds, and its expression was strongly induced by ABA and multiple  abiotic stress signals. Loss-of-function of NHL6 decreased sensitivity to ABA in  the early developmental stages including seed germination and post-germination  seedling growth of the nhl6 mutants. However, overexpression of NHL6 increased  sensitivity to ABA, salt and osmotic stress of the transgenic plants. Further  studies indicated that the increased sensitivity in the 35S::NHL6 overexpressing  plants could be a result of both ABA hypersensitivity and increased endogenous  ABA accumulation under the stress conditions. It was also seen that the  ABA-responsive element binding factors AREB1, AREB2 and ABF3 could regulate NHL6  expression at transcriptional level. Our results indicate that NHL6 plays an  important role in the abiotic stresses-induced ABA signaling and biosynthesis,  particularly during seed germination and early seedling development in  Arabidopsis.', '2016', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0148572', 'Zhang']
