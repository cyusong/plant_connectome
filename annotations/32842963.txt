Bud dormancy is a strategic mechanism plants developed as an adaptation to unfavorable environments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is one of the most ancient fruit vine species and vines are planted all over the world due to their great economic benefits. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying bud dormancy between adjacent months, the transcriptomes of 'Rosario Bianco' grape buds of 6 months and three nodes were analyzed using RNA-sequencing technology and pair-wise comparison. From November to April of the following year, pairwise comparisons were conducted between adjacent months. A total of 11,647 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from five comparisons. According to the results of cluster analysis of the DEG profiles and the climatic status of the sampling period, the 6 months were divided into three key processes (November to January, January to March, and March to April). Pair-wise comparisons of DEG profiles of adjacent months and three main dormancy processes showed that the whole grapevine bud dormancy period was mainly regulated by the antioxidant system, secondary metabolism, cell cycle and division, cell wall metabolism, and carbohydrates metabolism. Additionally, several DEGs, such as VvGA2OX6 and VvSS3, showed temporally and spatially differential expression patterns, which normalized to a similar trend during or before April. Considering these results, the molecular mechanisms underlying bud dormancy in the grapevine can be hypothesized, which lays the foundation for further research.
