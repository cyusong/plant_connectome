Corky disorders in apples represent a significant problem for long-term storage where controlled atmosphere (CA) is mainly used. Ultra-low oxygen (ULO) is an alternative to CA, which consists of low partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> to maintain a low metabolism in the apple fruit, achieving an effective decrease in the ethylene production and physiological disorders. The aim of this research was to study the effectiveness of a short hypoxia period on the development of cork physiological disorders during the storage of apple. 'Fuji' apples were prestored under ULO (0.5 kPa O<sub>2</sub>) for two periods of time (15 and 30 days) and at two temperatures (0 or 5<sup>°</sup>C). Corky physiological disorders increased at 5<sup>°</sup>C prestorage temperature; however, ULO treatments for 15 or 30 days at 0 or 5<sup>°</sup>C achieved a significant reduction in corky disorders near to 1%, compared with control treatments. In addition, a considerable reduction in ethylene production for up to 30 days was observed in ULO-treated fruit at 0 and 5<sup>°</sup>C. ULO for 30 days at 0 and 5<sup>°</sup>C increased the internal production of ethanol and acetaldehyde, causing a lower sensory quality due to the presence of fermentative flavors in fruit stored at 5<sup>°</sup>C. ULO of 15 days of conditioning decreased the relative expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes <i>MdACS1</i> and <i>MdACO1</i>, resulting in lower ethylene production.

ULO: !reduces! Corky disorders
ULO: !lowers! Ethylene production
MdACS1/MdACO1: !represses! Ethylene production
