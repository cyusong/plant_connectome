['12690200', 'Glucose modulates many vital processes in photosynthetic plants. Analyses of  Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2 (gin2) mutants define the physiological  functions of a specific hexokinase (HXK1) in the plant glucose-signaling network.  HXK1 coordinates intrinsic signals with extrinsic light intensity. HXK1 mutants  lacking catalytic activity still support various signaling functions in gene  expression, cell proliferation, root and inflorescence growth, and leaf expansion  and senescence, thus demonstrating the uncoupling of glucose signaling from  glucose metabolism. The gin2 mutants are also insensitive to auxin and  hypersensitive to cytokinin. Plants use HXK as a glucose sensor to interrelate  nutrient, light, and hormone signaling networks for controlling growth and  development in response to the changing environment.', '2003 Apr 11', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1080585', 'Sheen']
