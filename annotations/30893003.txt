<i>Colletotrichum orbiculare</i> species complex fungi are hemibiotrophic plant pathogens that cause anthracnose of field crops and weeds. Members of this group have genomes that are remarkably expanded relative to other <i>Colletotrichum</i> fungi and compartmentalized into AT-rich, gene-poor and GC-rich, gene-rich regions. Here, we present an updated version of the <i>C. orbiculare</i> genome, as well as draft genomes of three other members from the <i>C. orbiculare</i> species complex: the alfalfa pathogen <i>C. trifolii</i>, the prickly mallow pathogen <i>C. sidae</i>, and the burweed pathogen <i>C. spinosum</i>. The data reported here will be important for comparative genomics analyses to identify factors that play a role in the evolution and maintenance of the expanded, compartmentalized genomes of these fungi, which may contribute to their pathogenicity.
