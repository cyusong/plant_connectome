['20562234', 'Auxin is an essential phytohormone that regulates many aspects of plant  development. To identify new genes that function in auxin signaling, we performed  a genetic screen for Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with an alteration in the  expression of the auxin-responsive reporter DR5rev:GFP (for green fluorescent  protein). One of the mutants recovered in this screen, called weak auxin  response1 (wxr1), has a defect in auxin response and exhibits a variety of  auxin-related growth defects in the root. Polar auxin transport is reduced in  wxr1 seedlings, resulting in auxin accumulation in the hypocotyl and cotyledons  and a reduction in auxin levels in the root apex. In addition, the levels of the  PIN auxin transport proteins are reduced in the wxr1 root. We also show that WXR1  is ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE2 (RUS2), a member of the broadly conserved DUF647 domain  protein family found in diverse eukaryotic organisms. Our data indicate that  RUS2/WXR1 is required for auxin transport and to maintain the normal levels of  PIN proteins in the root.', '2010 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074195', 'Estelle']
