['18583534', 'To identify factors that influence cytoskeletal organization we screened for  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants that show hypersensitivity to the  microtubule destabilizing drug oryzalin. We cloned the genes corresponding to two  of the 131 mutant lines obtained. The genes encoded mutant alleles of PROCUSTE1  and KORRIGAN, which both encode proteins that have previously been implicated in  cellulose synthesis. Analysis of microtubules in the mutants revealed that both  mutants have altered orientation of root cortical microtubules. Similarly,  isoxaben, an inhibitor of cellulose synthesis, also altered the orientation of  cortical microtubules while exogenous cellulose degradation did not. Thus, our  results substantiate that proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis influence  cytoskeletal organization and indicate that this influence on cortical  microtubule stability and orientation is correlated with cellulose synthesis  rather than the integrity of the cell wall.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.120196', 'Somerville']
