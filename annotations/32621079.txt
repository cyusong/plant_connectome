NtALS1 is specifically expressed in glandular trichomes, and can improve the content of acylsugars in tobacco. The glandular trichomes of many species in the Solanaceae family play an important role in plant defense. These epidermal outgrowths exhibit specialized secondary metabolism, including the production of structurally diverse acylsugars that function in defense against insects and have substantial developmental potential for commercial uses. However, our current understanding of genes involved in acyl chain biosynthesis of acylsugars remains poor in tobacco. In this study, we identified three acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes in tobacco through homology-based gene prediction using Arabidopsis ALS. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and tissue distribution analyses suggested that NtALS1 was highly expressed in the tips of glandular trichomes. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the NtALS1 localized to the chloroplast. Moreover, in the wild-type K326 variety background, we generated two ntals1 loss-of-function mutants using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Acylsugars contents in the two ntals1 mutants were significantly lower than those in the wild type. Through phylogenetic tree analysis, we also identified NtALS1 orthologs that may be involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in other Solanaceae species. Taken together, these findings indicate a functional role for NtALS1 in acylsugar biosynthesis in tobacco.
