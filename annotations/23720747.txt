To mitigate the effects of environmental stress the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor ABI5 is required to delay growth of germinated seedlings. In the absence of stress, KEEP ON GOING (KEG) E3 is required to maintain low levels of ABI5. However, the mechanism underlying KEG-dependent turnover of ABI5 is not known. In addition, localization studies place KEG at the trans-Golgi network, whereas ABI5 is nuclear. Here we show that KEG interacts directly with ABI5 via its conserved C3 region. Interactions between KEG and ABI5 were observed in the cytoplasm and trans-Golgi network only when the RING domain of KEG was inactivated or when ABI5 was stabilized via mutations. Deletion of the C-terminal region of ABI5 or substituting lysine 344 for alanine (K344A) prohibited protein turnover. Furthermore, ABI5 is observed in the cytoplasm of Arabidopsis thaliana root cells when the K344A mutation is combined with the deletion of a nuclear localization signal. Other lysine mutations (K353A, K364A, and K376A) in conjunction with the nuclear localization signal deletion did not result in cytoplasmic accumulation of ABI5. Loss of lysine 344 did not affect the ability of ABI5 to promote ABA responses, which demonstrates that the mutant transcription factor is still functional. Based on the results, a model is suggested where KEG targets ABI5 for degradation in the cytoplasm, thus reducing nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor in the absence of ABA.
