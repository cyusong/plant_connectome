['23790083', "Resistance to wilt fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. matthioli (FOM) is a polygenic  trait in Arabidopsis thaliana. RFO3 is one of six quantitative trait loci  accounting for the complete resistance of accession Columbia-0 (Col-0) and  susceptibility of accession Taynuilt-0 (Ty-0). We find that Col-0 and Ty-0  alleles of RFO3 are representative of two common variants in wild Arabidopsis  accessions, that resistance and susceptibility to FOM are ancestral features of  the two variants and that resistance from RFO3 is unrivalled by other genes in a  genome-wide survey of diversity in accessions. A single receptor-like kinase  (RLK) gene in Col-0 is responsible for the resistance of RFO3, although the  susceptible Ty-0 allele codes for two RLK homologs. Expression of RFO3 is highest  in vascular tissue, which F. oxysporum infects, and root-expressed RFO3 restricts  FOM infection of the vascular system. RFO3 confers specific resistance to FOM and  provides no resistance to two other crucifer-infecting F. oxysporum pathogens.  RFO3's identity, expression and specificity suggest that RFO3 represents  diversity in pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) genes. The characteristics of  RFO3 and the previously published RFO1 suggest that diversity in RLK PRRs is a  major determinant of quantitative resistance in wild plant populations.", '2013 Oct', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.12368', 'Diener']
