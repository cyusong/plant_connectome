['16183635', 'Riboflavin kinases catalyze synthesis of FMN from riboflavin and ATP. These  enzymes have to date been cloned from bacteria, yeast, and mammals, but not from  plants. Bioinformatic approaches suggested that diverse plant species, including  many angiosperms, two gymnosperms, a moss (Physcomitrella patens), and a  unicellular green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), encode proteins that are  homologous to riboflavin kinases of yeast and mammals, but contain an N-terminal  domain that belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of enzymes. The  Arabidopsis homolog of these proteins was cloned by RT-PCR, and was shown to have  riboflavin kinase and FMN hydrolase activities by characterizing the recombinant  enzyme produced in Escherichia coli. Both activities of the purified recombinant  Arabidopsis enzyme (AtFMN/FHy) increased when the enzyme assays contained 0.02%  Tween 20. The FMN hydrolase activity of AtFMN/FHy greatly decreased when EDTA  replaced Mg(2+) in the assays, as expected for a member of the Mg(2+)-dependent  haloacid dehalogenase family. The functional overexpression of the individual  domains in E. coli establishes that the riboflavin kinase and FMN hydrolase  activities reside, respectively, in the C-terminal (AtFMN) and N-terminal (AtFHy)  domains of AtFMN/FHy. Biochemical characterization of AtFMN/FHy, AtFMN, and AtFHy  shows that the riboflavin kinase and FMN hydrolase domains of AtFMN/FHy can be  physically separated, with little change in their kinetic properties.', '2005 Nov 18', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M500350200', 'Roje']
