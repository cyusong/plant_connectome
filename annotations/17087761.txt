In the Arabidopsis root, asymmetric stem-cell divisions produce daughters that form the different root cell types. Here we report the establishment of a confocal tracking system that allows the analysis of numbers and orientations of cell divisions in root stem cells. The system provides direct evidence that stem cells have lower division rates than cells in the proximal meristem. It also allows tracking of cell division timing, which we have used to analyse the synchronization of root cap divisions. Finally, it gives new insights into lateral root cap formation: epidermal stem-cell daughters can rotate the orientation of the division plane like the stem cell.
