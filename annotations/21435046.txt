['21435046', 'The BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BPC) proteins are a plant-specific transcription factor  family that is present throughout land plants. The Arabidopsis BPC proteins have  been categorized into three classes based on sequence similarity, and we  demonstrate that there is functional overlap between classes. Single gene  mutations produce no visible phenotypic effects, and severe morphological  phenotypes occur only in higher order mutants between members of classes I and  II, with the most severe phenotype observed in bpc1-1 bpc2 bpc4 bpc6 plants.  These quadruple mutants are dwarfed and display small curled leaves, aberrant  ovules, altered epidermal cells and reduced numbers of lateral roots. Affected  processes include coordinated growth of cell layers, cell shape determination and  timing of senescence. Disruption of BPC3 function rescues some aspects of the  bpc1-1 bpc2 bpc4 bpc6 phenotype, indicating that BPC3 function may be  antagonistic to other members of the family. Ethylene response is diminished in  bpc1-1 bpc2 bpc4 bpc6 plants, although not all aspects of the phenotype can be  explained by reduced ethylene sensitivity. Our data indicate that the BPC  transcription factor family is integral for a wide range of processes that  support normal growth and development.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04562.x', 'Gasser']
