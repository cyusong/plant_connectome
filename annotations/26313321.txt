Abscisic acid (ABA) is a major phytohormone mediating important stress-related processes. We recently unveiled an ABA-activated MAPK signaling module constituted of MAP3K17/18-MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14. Unlike classical rapid MAPK activation, we showed that the activation of the new MAPK module is delayed and relies on the MAP3K protein synthesis. In this addendum, we discuss the role of this original and unexpected activation mechanism of MAPK cascades which suggests that MAPKs can regulate both early and long-term plant stress responses.

ABA: !activates! MAP3K17/18
MAP3K17/18: !synthesizes! MAPK module 
MAPK module: !mediates! stress-related processes 
MAP3K17/18: !regulates! early and long-term plant stress responses
