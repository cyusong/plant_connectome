MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs playing essential roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. Sequencing of small RNAs is a starting point for understanding their number, diversity, expression and possible roles in plants. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide survey of wheat miRNAs from 11 tissues, characterizing a total of 323 novel miRNAs belonging to 276 families in wheat. A miRNA conservation analysis identified 191 wheat-specific miRNAs, 2 monocot-specific miRNAs, and 30 wheat-specific variants from 9 highly conserved miRNA families. To understand possible roles of wheat miRNAs, we determined 524 potential targets for 124 miRNA families through degradome sequencing, and cleavage of a subset of them was validated via 5' RACE. Based on the genome-wide identification and characterization of miRNAs and their associated target genes, we further identified 64 miRNAs preferentially expressing in developing or germinating grains, which could play important roles in grain development. We discovered 323 wheat novel miRNAs and 524 target genes for 124 miRNA families in a genome-wide level, and our data will serve as a foundation for future research into the functional roles of miRNAs in wheat.
