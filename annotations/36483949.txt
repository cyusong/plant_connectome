Zinc finger-homeodomain (ZF-HDs) class IV transcriptional factors (TFs) is a plant-specific transcription factor and play a key role in stress responses, plant growth, development, and hormonal signaling. In this study, two new leaf rolling TFs genes, namely <i>TaZHD1</i> and <i>TaZHD10</i>, were identified in wheat using comparative genomic analysis of the target region that carried a major QTL for leaf rolling identified through multi-environment phenotyping and high throughput genotyping of a RIL population. Structural and functional annotation of the candidate <i>ZHD</i> genes with its closest rice orthologs reflects the species-specific evolution and, undoubtedly, validates the notions of remote-distance homology concept. Meanwhile, the morphological analysis resulted in contrasting difference for leaf rolling in extreme RILs between parental lines HD2012 and NI5439 at booting and heading stages. Transcriptome-wide expression profiling revealed that <i>TaZHD10</i> transcripts showed significantly higher expression levels than <i>TaZHD1</i> in all leaf tissues upon drought stress. The relative expression of these genes was further validated by qRT-PCR analysis, which also showed consistent results across the studied genotypes at the booting and anthesis stage. The contrasting modulation of these genes under drought conditions and the available evidenced for its epigenetic behavior that might involve the regulation of metabolic and gene regulatory networks. Prediction of miRNAs resulted in five Tae-miRs that could be associated with RNAi mediated control of <i>TaZHD1</i> and <i>TaZHD10</i> putatively involved in the metabolic pathway controlling rolled leaf phenotype. Gene interaction network analysis indicated that <i>TaZHD1</i> and <i>TaZHD10</i> showed pleiotropic effects and might also involve other functions in wheat in addition to leaf rolling. Overall, the results increase our understanding of <i>TaZHD</i> genes and provide valuable information as robust candidate genes for future functional genomics research aiming for the breeding of wheat varieties tolerant to leaf rolling.
