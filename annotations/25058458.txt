['25058458', 'Calcium is a ubiquitous intracellular secondary messenger in plants. Calcineurin  B-like proteins (CBLs), which contain four Ca(2+)-binding EF hand motifs, are  Ca(2+) sensors and regulate a group of Ser/Thr protein kinases called  CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Although the CBL-CIPK network has been  demonstrated to play crucial roles in plant development and responses to various  environmental stresses in Arabidopsis, little is known about their function in  glucose signaling. In the present study, we identified CIPK14 gene from  Arabidopsis that play a role in glucose signaling. The subcellular localization  of CIPK14 was determined using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as the reporter.  Furthermore, the expression levels of CIPK14 in response to salt, drought, cold,  heat, ABA, methyl viologen (MV) and glucose treatments were examined by  quantitative RT-PCR and it was found to respond to multiple stimuli, suggesting  that CIPK14 may be a point of convergence for several different signaling  pathways. Moreover, knock-out mutation of CIPK14 rendered it more sensitive to  glucose treatment. Yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that CIPK14 interacted  with three CBLs and also with two key kinases, sucrose non-fermenting 1-related  kinase (SnRK) 1.1 and SnRK1.2 implicated in glucose signaling. This is the first  report to demonstrate that CIPK also plays a role in glucose signaling.', '2014 Aug 8', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.064', 'Jiang']
