['7664733', 'Because plant cells do not move and are surrounded by a rigid cell wall, cell  division rates and patterns are believed to be directly responsible for  generating new structures throughout development. To study the relationship  between cell division and morphogenesis, transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis  plants were constructed expressing dominant mutations in a key regulator of the  Arabidopsis cell cycle, the Cdc2a kinase. Plants constitutively overproducing the  wild-type Cdc2a or the mutant form predicted to accelerate the cell cycle did not  exhibit a significantly altered development. In contrast, a mutation expected to  arrest the cell cycle abolished cell division when expressed in Arabidopsis,  whereas some tobacco plants constitutively producing this mutant protein were  recovered. These plants had a reduced histone H1 kinase activity and contained  considerably fewer cells. These cells were, however, much larger and underwent  normal differentiation. Morphogenesis, histogenesis and developmental timing were  unaffected. The results indicate that, in plants, the developmental controls  defining shape can act independently from cell division rates.', '1995 Aug 15', 'EMBO J', '10.1002/j.1460-2075.1995.tb00064.x', 'Ferreira']
