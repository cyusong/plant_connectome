Bulbus Fritillariae (BF) is a kind of herbal medicine widely used in many countries including China, Japan, Korea, and so on. Among the known BF medicinal materials, Bulbus Fritillariae cirrhosae (BF cirrhosae) was reported to have the best curative effect. Due to the limited resources of BF cirrhosae, a lot of adulterants have emerged in the market, impairing the market order, resource development, and above all, clinical efficacy. Here, a novel nucleic acid amplification technique, Recombinase Assisted Loop-mediated isothermal DNA Amplification (RALA), was used to establish a real-time fluorescence isothermal molecular authentication method for five commonly used BF drugs. Moreover, this RALA-based assay can also be developed as a colorimetric detection method for on-site detection. Both real-time fluorescence and visual methods could detect as low as 0.1% genuine targets in the mixed samples. In summary, we report an isothermal detection system for five kinds of BF circulating in the market, providing a new choice for the molecular identification of BF drugs and showing promise in the laboratory testing as well as field identification of other herbal medicines.
