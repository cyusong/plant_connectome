Phenotypic correlations and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for important growth traits and a surrogate of intrinsic water-use efficiency (leaf delta(13)C) were analysed in a willow pedigree of 92 full-sibling clones grown under two water regimes. The major objective was to examine the genetic basis of the phenotypic correlations. Cuttings of Salix were glasshouse-grown during one growing season. The relative growth rate (RGR) and underlying traits were assessed. QTL analysis was conducted based on an available linkage map for Salix. Leaf area productivity and leaf nitrogen productivity were more important in determining RGR than leaf area ratio and specific leaf area. However, phenotypic correlations among growth traits partly varied between the two environments. QTL were detected for most growth traits, among them many common QTL for different traits. The QTL pattern reflected the phenotypic correlation pattern. None of the QTL for the complex traits was consistent across the different environments. The results demonstrate a genetic basis for phenotypic correlations among growth traits in Salix, and provide evidence for the existence of 'master switches' regulating some of the traits.
