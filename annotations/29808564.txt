Global demand to increase food production and simultaneously reduce synthetic nitrogen fertilizer inputs in agriculture are underpinning the need to intensify the use of legume crops. The symbiotic relationship that legume plants establish with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria is central to their advantage. This plant-microbe interaction results in newly developed root organs, called nodules, where the rhizobia convert atmospheric nitrogen gas into forms of nitrogen the plant can use. However, the process of developing and maintaining nodules is resource intensive; hence, the plant tightly controls the number of nodules forming. A variety of molecular mechanisms are used to regulate nodule numbers under both favourable and stressful growing conditions, enabling the plant to conserve resources and optimize development in response to a range of circumstances. Using genetic and genomic approaches, many components acting in the regulation of nodulation have now been identified. Discovering and functionally characterizing these components can provide genetic targets and polymorphic markers that aid in the selection of superior legume cultivars and rhizobia strains that benefit agricultural sustainability and food security. This review addresses recent findings in nodulation control, presents detailed models of the molecular mechanisms driving these processes, and identifies gaps in these processes that are not yet fully explained.
