replying to A. M. J. Coenders-Gerrits et al. 506, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12925 (2014)In their Comment, Coenders-Gerrits et al. suggest that our conclusion that transpiration dominates the terrestrial water cycle is biased by unrepresentative input data and optimistic uncertainty ranges related to runoff, interception and the isotopic compositions of transpired and evaporated moisture. We clearly presented the uncertainties applied in our Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis, we reported percentile ranges of results rather than standard deviations to best communicate the nonlinear nature of the isotopic evaporation model, and we highlighted that the uncertainty in our calculation remains large, particularly in humid catchments (for example, figure 2 in our paper).
