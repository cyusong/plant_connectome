['15746155', 'TONSOKU(TSK)/MGOUN3/BRUSHY1 of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a nuclear  leucine-glycine-aspargine (LGN) domain protein implicated to be involved in  genome maintenance, and mutants with defects in TSK show a fasciated stem with  disorganized meristem structures. We identified a homolog of TSK from tobacco  BY-2 cells (NtTSK), which showed high sequence conservation both in the LGN  domain and in leucine-rich repeats with AtTSK. The NtTSK gene was expressed  during S phase of the cell cycle in tobacco BY-2 cells highly synchronized for  cell division. The tsk mutants of Arabidopsis contained an increased proportion  of cells with 4C nuclei and cells expressing cyclin B1 compared with the wild  type. These results suggest that TSK is required during the cell cycle and  defects of TSK cause the arrest of cell cycle progression at G2/M phase.', '2005 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pci082', 'Nakamura']
