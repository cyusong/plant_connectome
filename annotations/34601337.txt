Lectins are ubiquitous proteins that reversibly bind to specific carbohydrates and, thus, serve as readers of the sugar code. In photosynthetic organisms, lectin family proteins play important roles in capturing and releasing photosynthates via an endogenous lectin cycle. Often, lectin proteins consist of one or more lectin domains in combination with other types of domains. This structural diversity of lectins is the basis for their current classification, which is consistent with their diverse functions in cell signaling associated with growth and development, as well as in the plant's response to biotic, symbiotic, and abiotic stimuli. Furthermore, the lectin family shows evolutionary expansion that has distinct clade-specific signatures. Although the function(s) of many plant lectin family genes are unknown, studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have provided insights into their diverse roles. Here, we have used a biocuration approach rooted in the critical review of scientific literature and information available in the public genomic databases to summarize the expression, localization, and known functions of lectins in Arabidopsis. A better understanding of the structure and function of lectins is expected to aid in improving agricultural productivity through the manipulation of candidate genes for breeding climate-resilient crops, or by regulating metabolic pathways by applications of plant growth regulators.
