This is a first comprehensive study to analyze the 12 PHT1 family phosphate transporter genes in 20 foxtail millet genotypes for the improvement of millets and other crops for phosphate use efficiency. Phosphorus (P), absorbed from soil solutions as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is a limiting nutrient for plant growth and yield. Twenty genotypes of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) with contrasting degree of growth and Pi uptake responses under low Pi (LP) and high Pi (HP) supply were chosen based on a previous study. To gain molecular insights, expression dynamics of 12 PHosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) family (SiPHT1;1 to 1;12) genes were analyzed in these 20 genotypes and compared with their Pi and total P (TP) contents. SiPHT1;1, 1;2, 1;3 and 1;8 genes were expressed in shoot tissues of three (ISe 1209, ISe 1305 and Co-6) of the LP best performing genotypes (LPBG); however, they were expressed in only one of the LP worst performing genotype (LPWG) (ISe 748). More importantly, this is correlating with higher shoot Pi and TP contents of the LPBG compared to LPWG. Apart from this condition, expression of SiPHT1 genes and their Pi and TP contents do not correlate directly for many genotypes in other conditions; genotypes with low Pi and TP contents induced more SiPHT1 genes and vice versa. Promoter analysis revealed that genotype ISe 1888 with a high level of SiPHT1;8 expression possesses two additional root box motifs compared to other genotypes. The PHT1 family genes seem to play a key role for LP stress tolerance in foxtail millet and further studies will help to improve the P-use efficiency in foxtail millet and other cereals.
