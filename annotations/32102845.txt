The initiation of intracellular host cell colonization by symbiotic rhizobia in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> requires repolarization of root hairs, including the rearrangement of cytoskeletal filaments. The molecular players governing microtubule (MT) reorganization during rhizobial infections remain to be discovered. Here, we identified <i>M. truncatula</i> DEVELOPMENTALLY REGULATED PLASMA MEMBRANE POLYPEPTIDE (DREPP), a member of the MT binding DREPP/PCaP protein family, and investigated its functions during rhizobial infections. We show that rhizobial colonization of <i>drepp</i> mutant roots as well as transgenic roots overexpressing DREPP is impaired. DREPP relocalizes into symbiosis-specific membrane nanodomains in a stimulus-dependent manner. This subcellular segregation coincides with DREPP-dependent MT fragmentation and a partial loss of the ability to reorganize the MT cytoskeleton in response to rhizobia, which might rely on an interaction between DREPP and the MT-organizing protein SPIRAL2. Taken together, our results reveal that establishment of symbiotic associations in <i>M. truncatula</i> requires DREPP in order to regulate MT reorganization during initial root hair responses to rhizobia.
