Salicylic acid (SA) is involved in several plant processes including responses to abiotic stresses. Although SA is thought to interact with other regulatory molecules in a complex way, currently, little information is available regarding its molecular mechanisms of action in response to abiotic stresses. In a previous work, we observed that drought-resistant oat plants significantly increased their SA levels as compared with a susceptible cultivar. Furthermore, exogenous SA treatment alleviated drought symptoms. Here, we investigated the interaction between SA and polyamine biosynthesis during drought responses in oat and revealed that SA regulated polyamine biosynthesis through changes in polyamine gene expression. Overall, SA treatment decreased the levels of putrescine under drought conditions while increased those of spermine. This correlates with the downregulation of the ADC gene and upregulation of the AdoMetDC gene. Based on the presented results, we propose that SA modulates drought responses in oat by regulating polyamine content and biosynthesis.
