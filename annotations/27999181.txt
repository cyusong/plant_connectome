['27999181', 'Plants have the ability to respond to seasonal environmental variations by  monitoring day length to initiate flowering. The transition from vegetative to  the reproductive stage is the critical developmental switch in flowering plants  to ensure optimal fitness and/or yield. It has been previously reported that  B-BOX32 (BBX32) has the potential to increase grain yield when ectopically  expressed in soybean. In the present study, we performed a detailed molecular  characterization of the Arabidopsis B-box domain gene BBX32 We showed that the  circadian clock in Arabidopsis regulates BBX32 and expressed in the early  morning. To understand the molecular mechanism of BBX32 regulation, we performed  a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen and identified CONSTANS-LIKE 3 (COL3)/BBX4  as one of its interacting protein partners. Using different genetic and  biochemical assays, we have validated this interaction and shown that COL3  targets FT in the presence of BBX32 to regulate the flowering pathway. Based on  these findings, we hypothesized that this BBX32-COL3 module could be an  additional regulatory mechanism affecting the reproductive development in  Arabidopsis that could be translated to crops for increased agricultural  productivity.', '2017 Jan 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1616459114', 'ORCID:']
