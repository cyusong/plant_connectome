This review highlights the most relevant and recent updated information available on the defense responses of selected hosts against Xanthomonas spp. Xanthomonas is one of the most important genera of Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria, severely affecting the productivity of economically important crops worldwide, colonizing either the vascular system or the mesophyll tissue of the host. Due to its rapid propagation, Xanthomonas poses an enormous challenge to farmers, because it is usually controlled using huge quantities of copper-based chemicals, adversely impacting the environment. Thus, developing new ways of preventing colonization by these bacteria has become essential. Advances in genomic and transcriptomic technologies have significantly elucidated at molecular level interactions between various crops and Xanthomonas species. Understanding how these hosts respond to the infection is crucial if we are to exploit potential approaches for improving crop breeding and cutting productivity losses. This review focuses on our current knowledge of the defense response mechanisms in agricultural crops after Xanthomonas infection. We describe the molecular basis of host-bacterium interactions over a broad spectrum with the aim of improving our fundamental understanding of which genes are involved and how they work in this interaction, providing information that can help to speed up plant breeding programs, namely using gene editing approaches.
