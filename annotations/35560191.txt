Plants that are starved of phosphate trigger membrane lipid remodeling, which hydrolyses phospholipids and presumably allows their phosphate to be utilized, whilst replacing them with galactolipids to maintain the integrity of the membrane system. In addition to the two concurrent pathways of phospholipid hydrolysis by phospholipases C and D that have already been established, an emerging third pathway has been proposed that includes a reaction step catalysed by glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GDPDs). However, its functional involvement in phosphate-starved plants remains elusive. Here, we show that Arabidopsis GDPD6 is a functional isoform responsible for glycerophosphocholine hydrolysis in vivo. Overexpression of GDPD6 promoted root growth whilst gdpd6 mutants showed impaired root growth under phosphate starvation, and this defect was rescued by supplementing with the reaction product glycerol 3-phosphate but not with choline. Since GDPD6 is induced by phosphate starvation, we suggest that GDPD6 might be involved in root growth via the production of glycerol 3-phosphate in phosphate-starved plants.
