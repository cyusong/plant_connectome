It has long been known that more pollen grains often arrive on stigmas than there are ovules to fertilize, resulting in pollen competition. Moreover, this competition among pollen grains (gametophytes) depends, in part, on their extensive haploid gene expression. Here I review how this leads to a variety of phenomena in dioecious plants of interest to evolutionary biologists. For example, pollen competition can lead to extreme female-biased sex ratios. In addition, gene expression by individual pollen grains can slow mutation accumulation and degeneration of the Y chromosome. Lastly, I review work on how the haploid selection resulting from pollen competition has been proposed to influence which alleles are linked to the Y chromosome, and some recent empirical evidence in support of this theory.

Pollen competition: !depends on! haploid gene expression 
Haploid gene expression: !leads to! extreme female-biased sex ratios 
Haploid gene expression: !slows! mutation accumulation and Y chromosome degeneration 
Haploid selection: !influences! alleles linked to Y chromosome
