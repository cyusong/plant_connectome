['15722465', 'Aurora-like kinases play key roles in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in  yeast, plant, and animal systems. Here, we characterize three Arabidopsis  thaliana protein kinases, designated AtAurora1, AtAurora2, and AtAurora3, which  share high amino acid identities with the Ser/Thr kinase domain of yeast Ipl1 and  animal Auroras. Structure and expression of AtAurora1 and AtAurora2 suggest that  these genes arose by a recent gene duplication, whereas the diversification of  plant alpha and beta Aurora kinases predates the origin of land plants. The  transcripts and proteins of all three kinases are most abundant in tissues  containing dividing cells. Intracellular localization of green fluorescent  protein-tagged AtAuroras revealed an AtAurora-type specific association mainly  with dynamic mitotic structures, such as microtubule spindles and centromeres,  and with the emerging cell plate of dividing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2  cells. Immunolabeling using AtAurora antibodies yielded specific signals at the  centromeres that are coincident with histone H3 that is phosphorylated at Ser  position10 during mitosis. An in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that AtAurora1  preferentially phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser 10 but not at Ser 28 or Thr 3,  11, and 32. The phylogenetic analysis of available Aurora sequences from  different eukaryotic origins suggests that, although a plant Aurora gene has been  duplicated early in the evolution of plants, the paralogs nevertheless maintained  a role in cell cycle-related signal transduction pathways.', '2005 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.029710', 'Houben']
