['17435084', 'To gain insight into the biogenesis of photosystem II (PSII) and to identify  auxiliary factors required for this process, we characterized the mutant hcf173  of Arabidopsis thaliana. The mutant shows a high chlorophyll fluorescence  phenotype (hcf) and is severely affected in the accumulation of PSII subunits. In  vivo labeling experiments revealed a drastically decreased synthesis of the  reaction center protein D1. Polysome association experiments suggest that this is  primarily caused by reduced translation initiation of the corresponding psbA  mRNA. Comparison of mRNA steady state levels indicated that the psbA mRNA is  significantly reduced in hcf173. Furthermore, the determination of the psbA mRNA  half-life revealed an impaired RNA stability. The HCF173 gene was identified by  map-based cloning, and its identity was confirmed by complementation of the hcf  phenotype. HCF173 encodes a protein with weak similarities to the superfamily of  the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. The protein HCF173 is localized in the  chloroplast, where it is mainly associated with the membrane system and is part  of a higher molecular weight complex. Affinity chromatography of an HCF173 fusion  protein uncovered the psbA mRNA as a component of this complex.', '2007 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.042895', 'Westhoff']
