['25410251', 'The Arabidopsis U-box E3 Ub ligase AtPUB30 participates in the salt stress  tolerance as a negative factor in an ABA-independent manner during germination.  Based on the in silico expression data, the U-box protein 30 (AtPUB30) from  Arabidopsis thaliana was identified as a gene that responds to salt stress. The  deduced AtPUB30 protein consists of 448 amino acids with a single U-box motif and  five ARM-repeat domains. An in vitro self-ubiquitination assay demonstrated that  bacterially expressed AtPUB30 exhibited E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity and  that the U-box domain was essential for the activity. Real-time qRT-PCR and  promoter-GUS analyses showed that AtPUB30 was induced by high salinity, but not  by drought, cold, or abscisic acid (ABA), in roots but not in shoots. These  results suggest that AtPUB30 is an Arabidopsis U-box E3 Ub ligase, the expression  of which is selectively enhanced by salt stress in roots. T-DNA-inserted  loss-of-function atpub30 mutant plants (atpub30-1 and atpub30-2) were more  tolerant to salt stress in the germination stage, as identified by radicle  emergence, cotyledon opening, and more vigorous early root growth relative to  wild-type plants. Thus, it is likely that AtPUB30 plays a negative role in high  salinity tolerance in the germination process. Wild type and mutant plants  displayed very similar germination rates when treated with ABA, suggesting that  the action of AtPUB30 in the germination stage is ABA independent. The  post-germination growth of NaCl-stressed wild type and mutant plants were  indistinguishable. Overall, our data suggest that the Arabidopsis U-box E3 Ub  ligase AtPUB30 participates in the salt stress tolerance as a negative factor in  the germination stage in root tissues.', '2015 Feb', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-014-1706-4', 'Kim']
