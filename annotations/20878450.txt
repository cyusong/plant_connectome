Three genes that encode MAP65-1 family proteins have been identified in the Nicotiana tabacum genome. In this study, NtMAP65-1c fusion protein was shown to bind and bundle microtubules (MTs). Further in vitro investigations demonstrated that NtMAP65-1c not only alters MT assembly and nucleation, but also exhibits high MT stabilizing activity against cold or katanin-induced destabilization. Analysis of NtMAP65-1c-GFP expressing BY-2 cells clearly demonstrated that NtMAP65-1c was able to bind to MTs during specific stages of the cell cycle. Furthermore, in vivo, NtMAP65-1c-GFP-bound cortical MTs displayed an increase in resistance against the MT-disrupting drug, propyzamide, as well as against cold temperatures. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NtMAP65-1c stabilizes MTs and is involved in the regulation of MT organization and cellular dynamics.
