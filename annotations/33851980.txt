Uniparental genome elimination (UGE) refers to the preferential exclusion of one set of the parental chromosome complement during embryogenesis following successful fertilization, giving rise to uniparental haploid progeny. This artificially induced phenomenon was documented as one of the consequences of distant (wide) hybridization in plants. Ten decades since its discovery, attempts to unravel the molecular mechanism behind this process remained elusive due to a lack of genetic tools and genomic resources in the species exhibiting UGE. Hence, its successful adoption in agronomic crops for in planta (in vivo) haploid production remains implausible. Recently, Arabidopsis thaliana has emerged as a model system to unravel the molecular basis of UGE. It is now possible to simulate the genetic consequences of distant crosses in an A. thaliana intraspecific cross by a simple modification of centromeres, via the manipulation of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant gene, CENH3. Thus, the experimental advantages conferred by A. thaliana have been used to elucidate and exploit the benefits of UGE in crop breeding. In this review, we discuss developments and prospects of CENH3 gene-mediated UGE and other in planta haploid induction strategies to illustrate its potential in expediting plant breeding and genetics in A. thaliana and other model plants.
