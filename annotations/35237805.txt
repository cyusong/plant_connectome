Molecular engineering of plant immunity to confer resistance against plant viruses holds great promise for mitigating crop losses and improving plant productivity and yields, thereby enhancing food security. Several approaches have been employed to boost immunity in plants by interfering with the transmission or lifecycles of viruses. In this review, we discuss the successful application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) (CRISPR/Cas) systems to engineer plant immunity, increase plant resistance to viruses, and develop viral diagnostic tools. Furthermore, we examine the use of plant viruses as delivery systems to engineer virus resistance in plants and provide insight into the limitations of current CRISPR/Cas approaches and the potential of newly discovered CRISPR/Cas systems to engineer better immunity and develop better diagnostics tools for plant viruses. Finally, we outline potential solutions to key challenges in the field to enable the practical use of these systems for crop protection and viral diagnostics.
