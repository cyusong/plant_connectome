Hair loss is a disorder in which the hair falls out from skin areas such as the scalp and the body. Several studies suggest the use of herbal medicine to treat related disorders, including alopecia. Dermal microcirculation is essential for hair maintenance, and an insufficient blood supply can lead to hair follicles (HF) diseases. This work aims to provide an insight into the ethnohistorical records of some nutritional compounds containing flavonoids for their potential beneficial features in repairing or recovering from hair follicle disruption. We started from a query for "alopecia" OR "hair loss" AND "<i>Panax</i> <i>ginseng</i> C.A. Mey." (or other six botanicals) terms included in Pubmed and Web of Sciences articles. The activities of seven common botanicals introduced with diet (<i>Panax</i> <i>ginseng</i> C.A. Mey.<i>, Malus pumila</i> Mill cultivar Annurca<i>,</i> Coffea arabica, <i>Allium sativum</i> L<i>.,</i> Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze<i>, Rosmarinum officinalis</i> L., <i>Capsicum annum</i> L.) are discussed, which are believed to reduce the rate of hair loss or stimulate new hair growth. In this review, we pay our attention on the molecular mechanisms underlying the bioactivity of the aforementioned nutritional compounds <i>in vivo</i>, ex vivo and in vitro studies. There is a need for systematic evaluation of the most commonly used plants to confirm their anti-hair loss power, identify possible mechanisms of action, and recommend their best adoption.
