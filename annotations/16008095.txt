Since residues and extracts of rice plants were known to inhibit the germination and growth of several plant species, the possible involvement of a growth inhibitor, momilactone B, in rice allelopathy was discussed. Momilactone B was found in shoots and roots of rice plants over their entire life cycle. The level of momilactone B in shoots and roots increased with rice plant growing until flowering initiation, and then decreased. The highest level of momilactone B in the shoots and roots at the day of flowering initiation was 245 and 64.1 nmol g(-1) fresh weight, respectively. Thus, 1 kg of rice shoots and roots, respectively, may be able to release 245 and 64.1 micromol of momilactone B into the soil or neighboring environment by decomposition of their residues, which may be sufficient to cause growth inhibition of their neighboring or successional plants. The growth inhibitory activity of momilactone B and the occurrence of momilactone B in rice plants suggest that momilactone B may contribute the growth inhibitory effect of rice residues and extracts, indicating that momilactone B may have an important role in the rice allelopathy.
