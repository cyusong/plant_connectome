Mediator is a gigantic multiprotein complex required for transcription of almost all the protein coding genes. In this report, we have analyzed the transcript abundance of 31 Med genes in different tissues of Arabidopsis. Our analysis revealed the tissue specific differential expression profile of many Med subunit genes suggesting they might be contributing in the formation, maturation or function of that specific tissue. Moreover, we also found increase or decrease in the expression level of several Med subunits during the same duration of specific processes (for example flowering) indicating probable enrichment of a particular arrangement of selected subunits during that process. Thus, this study suggests that not only specific Med subunits have functional relevance in specific processes, but specific arrangements of Med subunits might also play significant role in some processes in Arabidopsis or other plants.
