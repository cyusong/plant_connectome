['8768377', 'The high-chlorophyll fluorescence photosynthesis mutant hcf109 of Arabidopsis was  characterized in detail to gain insights into the regulatory mechanism of RNA  processing in higher plants. By using electron transport, chlorophyll  fluorescence, and immunoblot studies, we assigned the mutational lesion to  photosystems I and II and the plastid NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex. The  functional pleiotropy was reflected in RNA deficiencies. Although all  nuclear-encoded photosynthetic RNAs analyzed revealed no difference in size or  steady state level between mutant and wild type, the RNA patterns of the  plastome-encoded psbB-psbT-psbH-petB-petD, psbD-psbC-ycf9, ndhC-ndhK-ndhJ, and  ndhH-ndhA-ndhI-ndhG-ndhE-psaC-ndh D transcription units were severely disturbed.  These operons encode subunits of photosystems I (psa) and II (psb), the  cytochrome bGf complex (pet), the plastid NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (ndh), and the  unidentified open reading frame ycf9. With the exception of the ndhC operon, the  RNA deficiencies observed were specific and restricted to particular segments of  the psbB, psbD/C, and ndhH operons, that is, the psbB-psbT, ycf9, and psaC  regions. Run-on transcription studies with isolated chloroplasts showed that the  failure of these transcripts to accumulate was due to RNA stability and not  transcription. Other polycistronic transcription units analyzed were not affected  by the mutation. This result indicates that the trans-regulatory factor encoded  by the hcf109 gene is not a general RNA stability factor but that it specifically  controls the stability of only these distinct transcripts. Because the hcf109  locus was mapped at a distance < 0.1 centimorgans from the phytochrome C gene,  its molecular characterization by positional cloning is possible.', '1996 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.8.7.1193', 'Westhoff']
