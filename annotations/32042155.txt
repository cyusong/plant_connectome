Many plants benefit from synchronous year-to-year variation in seed production, called masting. Masting benefits plants because it increases the efficiency of pollination and satiates predators, which reduces seed loss. Here, using a 39-year-long dataset, we show that climate warming over recent decades has increased seed production of European beech but decreased the year-to-year variability of seed production and the reproductive synchrony among individuals. Consequently, the benefit that the plants gained from masting has declined. While climate warming was associated with increased reproductive effort, we demonstrate that less effective pollination and greater losses of seeds to predators offset any benefits to the plants. This shows that an apparently simple benefit of climate warming unravels because of complex ecological interactions. Our results indicate that in masting systems, the main beneficiaries of climate-driven increases in seed production are seed predators, not plants.

Climate Warming: !increases! Seed Production 
Climate Warming: !decreases! Year-to-Year Variability 
Climate Warming: !decreases! Reproductive Synchrony 
Climate Warming: !reduces! Benefit of Masting 
Pollination: !less effective! with Climate Warming 
Predators: !greater losses! of Seeds with Climate Warming 
Predators: !main beneficiaries! of Climate-Driven Increases in Seed Production
