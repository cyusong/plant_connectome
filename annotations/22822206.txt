Transcriptional regulation plays a central role in plant hormone signaling. At the core of transcriptional regulation is the Mediator, an evolutionarily conserved, multisubunit complex that serves as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase machinery to regulate transcription. Here, we report the action mechanisms of the MEDIATOR25 (MED25) subunit of the Arabidopsis thaliana Mediator in regulating jasmonate- and abscisic acid (ABA)-triggered gene transcription. We show that during jasmonate signaling, MED25 physically associates with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2 in promoter regions of MYC2 target genes and exerts a positive effect on MYC2-regulated gene transcription. We also show that MED25 physically associates with the basic Leu zipper transcription factor ABA-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) in promoter regions of ABI5 target genes and shows a negative effect on ABI5-regulated gene transcription. Our results reveal that underlying the distinct effects of MED25 on jasmonate and ABA signaling, the interaction mechanisms of MED25 with MYC2 and ABI5 are different. These results highlight that the MED25 subunit of the Arabidopsis Mediator regulates a wide range of signaling pathways through selectively interacting with specific transcription factors.
