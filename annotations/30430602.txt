Cultivated soybean (Glycine max) was derived from the wild soybean (Glycine soja), which has genetic resources that can be critically important for improving plant stress resistance. However, little information is available pertaining to the molecular and physiochemical comparison between the cultivated and wild soybeans in response to the pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl. In this study, we first used comparative phenotypic and paraffin section analyses to indicate that wild soybean is indeed more resistant to F. oxysporum than cultivated soybean. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing approach was then used to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying the differential physiological and biochemical responses of the cultivated soybean, and its relative, to F. oxysporum. A greater number of genes related to cell wall synthesis and hormone metabolism were significantly altered in wild soybean than in cultivated soybean under F. oxysporum infection. Accordingly, a higher accumulation of lignins was observed in wild soybean than cultivated soybean under F. oxysporum infection. Collectively, these results indicated that secondary metabolites and plant hormones may play a vital role in differentiating the response between cultivated and wild soybeans against the pathogen. These important findings may provide future direction to breeding programs to improve resistance to F. oxysporum in the elite soybean cultivars by taking advantage of the genetic resources within wild soybean germplasm.
