Melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i> L.) seed germination significantly affects its economic value. Cultivation of melon varieties with high germination ability and seedling vigor is beneficial in large-scale melon propagation. In this study, two melon genotypes differing in their germination ability, P5 with low and P10 with high germination ability, were used to identify the optimal seed germination conditions by evaluating different water immersion times and germination temperatures. The germination rate of the P5 and P10 parental genotypes and their segregating population, consisting of 358 F<sub>2:3</sub> families, were evaluated for 2 years to identify their genetic basis. QTL analysis was performed on a high-density genetic map constructed using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). The germination rate of F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> populations treated with water immersion for 8 h at 28°C and measured at 48 h showed a normal distribution Genetic mapping carried out using the high-density genetic map revealed eight QTLs in chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 that control melon seed germination, of which 2020/2021-<i>qsg5.1</i> was consistently significant in both years of experimentation. <i>qsg5.1</i> explained 15.13% of the phenotypic variance with a LOD of 4.1. To fine map the candidate region of <i>qsg5.1</i>, eight cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) markers were used to construct a genetic map with another 421 F<sub>2</sub> individual fruits. The major QTL <i>qsg5.1</i> was located between SNP53 and SNP54 within a 55.96 Kb interval containing four genes. qRT-PCR gene expression analysis of the candidate genes showed that <i>MELO3C031219.2</i> (<i>Phosphorus transporter PHO-5</i>) exhibited a significant difference in gene expression between the parental lines at 24, 32, and 48 h after germination, potentially being the underlying gene controlling melon seed germination. These results provide a theoretical basis for the molecular mechanisms controlling melon seed germination and can practically contribute to further improving germination to increase the propagation efficiency of commercial melon cultivars.
