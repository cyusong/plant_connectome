A novel glycine-rich protein gene, PsGRP1, has been identified in Pisum sativum L. Accumulation of PsGRP1 transcripts was observed in reproductive organs and vegetative tissues. They were localized in endocarp sclerenchyma during fruit development in cells that will lignify. PsGRP1 expression was also detected in senescent pistils and developing seeds and induced by ABA treatment in presenescent pistils. A raise in the expression was also observed in roots after treatment with ABA or mannitol but not under cold stress. A mannitol treatment induced a rise in ABA levels and fluridone treatment counteracted the mannitol induction of PsGRP1 expression. The results suggest a possible role for PsGRP1 in differentiation of the endocarp sclerenchyma and during seed development, pistil senescence and osmotic stress under ABA control.
