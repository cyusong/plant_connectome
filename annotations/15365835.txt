The inner layer of the cell wall in tissues that are under tensile stress in situ, e.g. epidermis and collenchyma of etiolated sunflower hypocotyls, shows a pattern of transverse folds when the tissues are detached and plasmolysed. This can be observed by Nomarski imaging of inner surfaces of the outer cell walls and electron microscopy of longitudinal sections after peeling the epidermis and bathing it in plasmolysing solutions. The folds are apparently caused by buckling of the inner layer due to the longitudinal compressive force exerted on this layer by the outer wall layer, when it shrinks after the removal of the longitudinal tensile stresses. In these stresses, two components can be distinguished: the tissue stress, disappearing on peeling, and that caused directly by turgor pressure, disappearing in hyperosmotic solution. Investigation of the buckling indicates that the outer layer of the cell wall transmits in situ most of the longitudinal tensile stress in the wall. The common concept that the inner layer of the wall is the region bearing most stress and therefore regulating growth can still be valid with respect to the transverse stress component.
