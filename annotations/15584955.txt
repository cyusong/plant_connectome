['15584955', 'Glucosinolates are a class of secondary metabolites with important roles in plant  defense and human nutrition. Here, we characterize a putative  UDP-glucose:thiohydroximate S-glucosyltransferase, UGT74B1, to determine its role  in the Arabidopsis glucosinolate pathway. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that  recombinant UGT74B1 specifically glucosylates the thiohydroximate functional  group. Low Km values for phenylacetothiohydroximic acid (approximately 6 microm)  and UDP-glucose (approximately 50 microm) strongly suggest that thiohydroximates  are in vivo substrates of UGT74B1. Insertional loss-of-function ugt74b1 mutants  exhibit significantly decreased, but not abolished, glucosinolate accumulation.  In addition, ugt74b1 mutants display phenotypes reminiscent of auxin  overproduction, such as epinastic cotyledons, elongated hypocotyls in light-grown  plants, excess adventitious rooting and incomplete leaf vascularization. Indeed,  during early plant development, mutant ugt74b1 seedlings accumulate nearly  threefold more indole-3-acetic acid than the wild type. Other phenotypes,  however, such as chlorosis along the leaf veins, are likely caused by  thiohydroximate toxicity. Analysis of UGT74B1 promoter activity during plant  development reveals expression patterns consistent with glucosinolate metabolism  and induction by auxin treatment. The results are discussed in the context of  known mutations in glucosinolate pathway genes and their effects on auxin  homeostasis. Taken together, our work provides complementary in vitro and in vivo  evidence for a primary role of UGT74B1 in glucosinolate biosynthesis.', '2004 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02261.x', 'Abel']
