['19625633', 'Plant adaptive responses to drought are coordinated by adjusting growth and  developmental processes as well as molecular and cellular activities. The root  system is the primary site that perceives drought stress signals, and its  development is profoundly affected by soil water content. Various growth  hormones, particularly abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin, play a critical role in  root growth under drought through complex signaling networks. Here, we report  that a R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB96, regulates drought stress  response by integrating ABA and auxin signals. The MYB96-mediated ABA signals are  integrated into an auxin signaling pathway that involves a subset of GH3 genes  encoding auxin-conjugating enzymes. A MYB96-overexpressing Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant exhibited enhanced drought resistance with reduced  lateral roots. In the mutant, while lateral root primordia were normally  developed, meristem activation and lateral root elongation were suppressed. In  contrast, a T-DNA insertional knockout mutant was more susceptible to drought.  Auxin also induces MYB96 primarily in the roots, which in turn induces the GH3  genes and modulates endogenous auxin levels during lateral root development. We  propose that MYB96 is a molecular link that mediates ABA-auxin cross talk in  drought stress response and lateral root growth, providing an adaptive strategy  under drought stress conditions.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.144220', 'Park']
