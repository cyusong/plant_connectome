The evolution of photosynthesis and its associated metabolic pathways has been crucial to the successful establishment of plants, but has also challenged plant cells in the form of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, multiple forms of ROS are generated in virtually every plant cell compartment through diverse pathways. As a result, a sophisticated network of ROS detoxification and signaling that is simultaneously tailored to individual organelles and safeguards the entire cell is necessary. Here we take an organelle-centric view on the principal sources and sinks of ROS across the plant cell and provide insights into the ROS-induced organelle to nucleus retrograde signaling pathways needed for operational readjustments during environmental stresses.
