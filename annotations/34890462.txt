['34890462', 'The mechanical properties of guard cell (GC) walls are important for stomatal  development and stomatal response to external stimuli. However, the molecular  mechanisms of pectin synthesis and pectin composition controlling stomatal  development and dynamics remain poorly explored. Here, we characterized the role  of two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) galacturonosyltransferases, GAUT10 and  GAUT11, in plant growth, stomatal development, and stomatal dynamics. GAUT10 and  GAUT11 double mutations reduced pectin synthesis and promoted homogalacturonan  (HG) demethylesterification and demethylesterified HG degradation, resulting in  larger stomatal complexes and smaller pore areas, increased stomatal dynamics,  and enhanced drought tolerance of plants. In contrast, increased GAUT10 or GAUT11  expression impaired stomatal dynamics and drought sensitivity. Genetic  interaction analyses together with immunolabeling analyses suggest that the  methylesterified HG level is important in stomatal dynamics, and pectin abundance  with the demethylesterified HG level controls stomatal dimension and stomatal  size. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of GC wall  properties in stomatal dynamics, and highlight the role of GAUT10 and GAUT11 in  stomatal dimension and dynamics through modulation of pectin biosynthesis and  distribution in GC walls.', '2021 Dec 4', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiab432', 'ORCID:']
