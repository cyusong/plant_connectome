['7678766', "The gene and the RNA from Arabidopsis thaliana for the plastid-located  glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT; EC 2.3.1.15) and their encoded  product have been studied. The gene (designated ATS1) was isolated by screening a  lambda DASH genomic library for cross-hybridization with a radiolabeled probe  prepared from cDNA for GPAT from squash. cDNA clones representing the mRNA were  isolated by screening a lambda ZAPII cDNA library for hybridization with a  radiolabeled probe prepared from a DNA fragment of ATS1. The nucleotide sequences  of the gene and the cDNA were determined, and the 5' end of the RNA was mapped by  primer extension. Sequences similar to the TATA box, polyadenylation sequences  and intron-splicing sequences were found at the expected locations. The pre-mRNA  was 3288 nucleotides long and contained 5' and 3'-untranslated sequences of 57  and 442 nucleotides, respectively. The coding sequence of 1377 nucleotides was  interrupted by 11 introns of 1412 nucleotides in total and the 3'-untranslated  sequence contained another intron of 94 nucleotides. The open-reading frame  encoded a polypeptide of 459 amino acid residues, the amino acid sequence of  which was highly homologous to those of precursors to plastid-located GPATs from  squash and pea. The enzymatic activity of a gene product that was over-produced  in Escherichia coli confirmed the identity of the gene.", '1993 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00019943', 'Murata']
