Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are responsible for establishing and maintaining DNA methylation through the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in plants. Although siRNA biogenesis is well known, it is relatively unclear about how the process is regulated. By a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified a mutant defective in NOT1 and demonstrated that NOT1 is required for transcriptional silencing at RdDM target genomic loci. We demonstrated that NOT1 is required for Pol IV-dependent siRNA accumulation and DNA methylation at a subset of RdDM target genomic loci. Furthermore, we revealed that NOT1 is a constituent of a multi-subunit CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex by immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry and demonstrated that the CCR4-NOT components can function as a whole to mediate chromatin silencing. Therefore, our work establishes that the CCR4-NOT complex regulates the biogenesis of Pol IV-dependent siRNAs, and hence facilitates DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis.
