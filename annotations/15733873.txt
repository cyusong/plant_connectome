['15733873', 'Arginine decarboxylase (ADC) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first  step of polyamine (PA) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We generated a  double mutant deficient in Arabidopsis two ADC genes (ADC1-/- ADC2-/-) and  examined their roles in seed development. None of the F2 seedlings from crosses  of adc1-1 and adc2-2 had the ADC1-/- ADC2-/- genotype. In addition, some abnormal  seeds were observed among the ADC1+/- ADC2-/- and ADC1-/- ADC2+/- siliques.  Viable offspring with the ADC1-/- ADC2-/- genotype could not be obtained from the  ADC1+/- ADC2-/- and ADC1-/- ADC2+/- plants. These results indicate that AtADC  genes are required for production of polyamines that are essential for normal  seed development in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Feb 28', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.01.048', 'Shinozaki']
