Regulation of a gene encoding coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase leads to substantial alterations in lignin structure in rice cell walls, identifying a promising genetic engineering target for improving grass biomass utilization. The aromatic composition of lignin greatly affects utilization characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass and, therefore, has been one of the primary targets of cell wall engineering studies. Limited information is, however, available regarding lignin modifications in monocotyledonous grasses, despite the fact that grass lignocelluloses have a great potential for feedstocks of biofuel production and various biorefinery applications. Here, we report that manipulation of a gene encoding coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H, or ferulate 5-hydroxylase, F5H) leads to substantial alterations in syringyl (S)/guaiacyl (G) lignin aromatic composition in rice (Oryza sativa), a major model grass and commercially important crop. Among three CAld5H genes identified in rice, OsCAld5H1 (CYP84A5) appeared to be predominantly expressed in lignin-producing rice vegetative tissues. Down-regulation of OsCAld5H1 produced altered lignins largely enriched in G units, whereas up-regulation of OsCAld5H1 resulted in lignins enriched in S units, as revealed by a series of wet-chemical and NMR structural analyses. Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls. Given that S/G lignin composition affects various biomass properties, we contemplate that manipulation of CAld5H gene expression represents a promising strategy to upgrade grass biomass for biorefinery applications.
