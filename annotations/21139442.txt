In order to investigate the effects of root hypoxia (1-2 % oxygen) on the nitrogen (N) metabolism of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Micro-Tom), a range of N compounds and N-assimilating enzymes were performed on roots and leaves of plants submitted to root hypoxia at the second leaf stage for three weeks. Obtained results showed that root hypoxia led to a significant decrease in dry weight (DW) production and nitrate content in roots and leaves. Conversely, shoot to root DW ratio and nitrite content were significantly increased. Contrary to that in leaves, glutamine synthetase activity was significantly enhanced in roots. The activities of nitrate and nitrite reductase were enhanced in roots as well as leaves. The higher increase in the NH(4)(+) content and in the protease activities in roots and leaves of hypoxically treated plants coincide with a greater decrease in soluble protein contents. Taken together, these results suggest that root hypoxia leaded to higher protein degradation. The hypoxia-induced increase in the aminating glutamate dehydrogenase activity may be considered as an alternative N assimilation pathway involved in detoxifying the NH(4)(+), accumulated under hypoxic conditions. With respect to hypoxic stress, the distinct sensitivity of the enzymes involved in N assimilation is discussed.
