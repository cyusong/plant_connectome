['32164240', 'The At-Hook Motif Nuclear Localized Protein (AHL) gene family encodes  embryophyte-specific nuclear proteins with DNA binding activity. They modulate  gene expression and affect various developmental processes in plants. We identify  AHL18 (At3G60870) as a developmental modulator of root system architecture and  growth. AHL18 is involved in regulation of the length of the proliferation domain  and number of dividing cells in the root apical meristem and thereby, cell  production. Both primary root growth and lateral root development respond  according to AHL18 transcription level. The ahl18 knock-out plants show reduced  root systems due to a shorter primary root and a lower number of lateral roots.  This change results from a higher number of arrested and non-developing lateral  root primordia (LRP) rather than from a decreased LRP initiation. The  over-expression of AHL18 results in a more extensive root system, longer primary  roots, and increased density of lateral root initiation events. AHL18 is thus  involved in the formation of lateral roots at both LRP initiation and their later  development. We conclude that AHL18 participates in modulation of root system  architecture through regulation of root apical meristem activity, lateral root  initiation and emergence; these correspond well with expression pattern of AHL18.', '2020 Mar 10', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms21051886', 'ORCID:']
