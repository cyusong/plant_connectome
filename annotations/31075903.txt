Boron (B) is a micronutrient for plant development, and its deficiency alters many physiological processes. However, the current knowledge on how plants are able to sense the B-starvation signal is still very limited. Recently, it has been reported that B deprivation induces an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> roots. The aim of this work was to research in <i>Arabidopsis</i> whether [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is restored to initial levels when B is resupplied and elucidate whether apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the major source for B-deficiency-induced rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>. The use of chemical compounds affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis showed that the rise in root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> induced by B deficiency was predominantly owed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast through plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in an IP<sub>3</sub>-independent manner. Furthermore, B resupply restored the root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>. Interestingly, expression levels of genes encoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters (<i>ACA10</i>, plasma membrane P<sub>IIB</sub>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase; and <i>CAX3</i>, vacuolar cation/proton exchanger) were upregulated by ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and abscisic acid (ABA). The results pointed out that ACA10, and especially CAX3, would play a major role in the restoration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis after 24 h of B deficiency.
