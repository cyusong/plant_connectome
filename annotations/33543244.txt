Shoot branching is a pivotal process during plant growth and development, and is antagonistically orchestrated by auxin and sugars. In contrast to extensive investigations on hormonal regulatory networks, our current knowledge on the role of sugar signalling pathways in bud outgrowth is scarce. Based on a comprehensive stepwise strategy, we investigated the role of glycolysis/the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) in the control of bud outgrowth. We demonstrated that these pathways are necessary for bud outgrowth promotion upon plant decapitation and in response to sugar availability. They are also targets of the antagonistic crosstalk between auxin and sugar availability. The two pathways act synergistically to down-regulate the expression of BRC1, a conserved inhibitor of shoot branching. Using Rosa calluses stably transformed with GFP-fused promoter sequences of RhBRC1 (pRhBRC1), glycolysis/TCA cycle and the OPPP were found to repress the transcriptional activity of pRhBRC1 cooperatively. Glycolysis/TCA cycle- and OPPP-dependent regulations involve the -1973/-1611 bp and -1206/-709 bp regions of pRhBRC1, respectively. Our findings indicate that glycolysis/TCA cycle and the OPPP are integrative parts of shoot branching control and can link endogenous factors to the developmental programme of bud outgrowth, likely through two distinct mechanisms.
