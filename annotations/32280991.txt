The maturation of male and female gametophytes together with its impact on plant sexual reproduction has not received much attention, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the process are largely unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis DEAD-box RNA helicase 29 (RH29) is critical for the functional maturation of both male and female gametophytes. Homozygous rh29 mutants could not be obtained, and heterozygous mutant plants were semi-sterile. Progression of the cell cycle in rh29 female gametophytes was delayed. Delayed pollination experiments showed that rh29 female gametophytes underwent cell-fate specification but were unable to develop into functional gametophytes. Functional specification but not morphogenesis was also disrupted in rh29 male gametophytes, causing defective pollen tube growth in the pistil. RH29 was highly and specifically expressed in gametophytic cells. RH29 shares high amino acid sequence identity with yeast Dbp10p, which partially rescues the aborted-ovules phenotype of rh29/RH29 plants. RH29 is essential for the synthesis of REGULATORY PARTICLE TRIPLE A ATPase 5a (RPT5a), a subunit of the regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. Our results suggest that gametophyte functional maturation is a necessary process for successful fertilization and that RH29 is essential for the functional maturation of both male and female gametophytes.
