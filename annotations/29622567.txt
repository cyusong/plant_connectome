['29622567', 'Nitrogen (N) is often a limiting nutrient whose availability determines plant  growth and productivity. Because its availability is often low and/or not uniform  over time and space in nature, plants respond to variations in N availability by  altering uptake and recycling mechanisms, but the molecular mechanisms underlying  how these responses are regulated are poorly understood. Here, we show that a  group of GARP G2-like transcription factors, Arabidopsis thaliana  NITRATE-INDUCIBLE, GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR1/HYPERSENSITIVE TO LOW  Pi-ELICITED PRIMARY ROOT SHORTENING1 proteins (NIGT1/HRS1s), are factors that  bind to the promoter of the N starvation marker NRT2.4 and repress an array of N  starvation-responsive genes under conditions of high N availability. Transient  assays and expression analysis demonstrated that NIGT1/HRS1s are transcriptional  repressors whose expression is regulated by N availability. We identified target  genes of the NIGT1/HRS1s by genome-wide transcriptome analyses and found that  they are significantly enriched in N starvation response-related genes, including  N acquisition, recycling, remobilization, and signaling genes. Loss of  NIGT1/HRS1s resulted in deregulation of N acquisition and accumulation. We  propose that NIGT1/HRS1s are major regulators of N starvation responses that play  an important role in optimizing N acquisition and utilization under fluctuating N  conditions.', '2018 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00810', 'ORCID:']
