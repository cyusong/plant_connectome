Stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is very important for plant development and is regulated by the WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS<i>-</i>CLV) feedback loop in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>WUS</i> promotes stem cell identity, whereas <i>CLV</i> negatively regulates stem cell proliferation by repressing <i>WUS</i> expression. We previously showed that, in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the <i>WUS</i> ortholog <i>TILLERS ABSENT1</i> (<i>TAB1</i>, also known as <i>OsWUS</i>) has no function in SAM maintenance, whereas it plays a crucial role in axillary meristem development. Recently, we showed that a double mutant of <i>FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2</i> (<i>FON2</i>) and <i>ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1</i> (<i>ASP1</i>) led to a marked enlargement of the inflorescence meristem, and that the <i>TAB1</i> function is not associated with massive stem cells in this meristem. In this paper, we confirmed that <i>TAB1</i> is also unrelated to the enlargement of the SAM in the vegetative phase of the <i>fon2</i> and <i>fon2 asp1</i> mutants. In addition, misexpression of <i>TAB1</i> under the promoter of <i>FON1</i> led to a slight reduction of the SAM size in wild type, suggesting that <i>TAB1</i> is not a positive regulator of stem cells. Taking together, <i>TAB1</i> seems not to be involved in meristem maintenance, irrespective of the meristem type.
