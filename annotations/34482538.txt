Plant stress signalling involves bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be mimicked by the application of acute pulses of ozone. Such ozone-pulses inhibit photosynthesis and trigger stomatal closure in a few minutes, but the signalling that underlies these responses remains largely unknown. We measured changes in Arabidopsis thaliana gas exchange after treatment with acute pulses of ozone and set up a system for simultaneous measurement of membrane potential and cytosolic calcium with the fluorescent reporter R-GECO1. We show that within 1 min, prior to stomatal closure, O<sub>3</sub> triggered a drop in whole-plant CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. Within this early phase, O<sub>3</sub> pulses (200-1000 ppb) elicited simultaneous membrane depolarization and cytosolic calcium increase, whereas these pulses had no long-term effect on either stomatal conductance or photosynthesis. In contrast, pulses of 5000 ppb O<sub>3</sub> induced cell death, systemic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and an irreversible drop in stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity. We conclude that mesophyll cells respond to ozone in a few seconds by distinct pattern of plasma membrane depolarizations accompanied by an increase in the cytosolic calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ) level. These responses became systemic only at very high ozone concentrations. Thus, plants have rapid mechanism to sense and discriminate the strength of ozone signals.
