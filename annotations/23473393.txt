The plant vascular system consists of two conductive tissues, phloem and xylem. The vascular meristem, namely the (pro-)cambium, is a stem-cell tissue that gives rise to both xylem and phloem. Recent studies have revealed that CLAVATA3/Embryo Surrounding Region-related (CLE) peptides function in establishing the vascular system through interaction with phytohormones. In particular, TDIF/CLE41/CLE44, phloem-derived CLE peptides, promote the proliferation of vascular cambium cells and prevent them from differentiating into xylem by regulating WOX4 expression through the TDR/PXY receptor. In this review article, we outline recent advances on how CLE peptides function in vascular development in concert with phytohormones through mediating cell-cell communication. The perspective of CLE peptide signaling in vascular development is also discussed.
