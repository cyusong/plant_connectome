Single-molecule imaging is emerging as a revolutionary approach to studying fundamental questions in plants. However, compared with its use in animals, the application of single-molecule imaging in plants is still underexplored. Here, we review the applications, advantages, and challenges of single-molecule fluorescence imaging in plant systems from the perspective of methodology. Firstly, we provide a general overview of single-molecule imaging methods and their principles. Next, we summarize the unprecedented quantitative details that can be obtained using single-molecule techniques compared to bulk assays. Finally, we discuss the main problems encountered at this stage and provide possible solutions.
