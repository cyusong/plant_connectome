Sensing of microbial pathogens by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) elicits a defense program known as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Recently, we have shown that the Arabidopsis thaliana L-TYPE LECTIN RECEPTOR KINASE-VI.2 (LecRK-VI.2) positively regulates bacterial PTI. In this report, we suggest by in silico analysis that the kinase domain of LecRK-VI.2 is functional. LecRK-VI.2 also demonstrated auto-phosphorylation activity in vitro in the presence of divalent metal cations indicating that LecRK-VI.2 has the ability to auto-phosphorylate. We further investigate the role of LecRK-VI.2 in Arabidopsis resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Disruption of LecRK-VI.2 did not affect Arabidopsis resistance to B. cinerea. Accordingly, wild-type upregulation levels of PTI-responsive WRKY53, FRK1, NHL10, CYP81F2 and CBP60 g after treatment with the fungal PAMP chitin were observed in lecrk-VI.2-1. These data provide evidences that the kinase domain of LecRK-VI.2 is active and show that LecRK-VI.2 is not critical for resistance to the fungal pathogen B. cinerea.
