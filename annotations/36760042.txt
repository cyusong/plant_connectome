Over 70% land plants live in mutualistic symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and maintenance of symbiosis requires transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The former has been widely studied, whereas the latter mediated by symbiotic microRNAs (miRNAs) remains obscure, especially in woody plants. Here, we performed high-throughput sequencing of the perennial woody citrus plant Poncirus trifoliata and identified 3750 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 42 miRNAs (DEmiRs) upon AM fungal colonization. By analyzing cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of the DEGs, we predicted 329 key AM transcription factors (TFs). A miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was then constructed by integrating these data. Several candidate miRNA families of P. trifoliata were identified whose members target known symbiotic genes, such as miR167h-AMT2;3 and miR156e-EXO70I, or key TFs, such as miR164d-NAC and miR477a-GRAS, thus are involved in AM symbiotic processes of fungal colonization, arbuscule development, nutrient exchange and phytohormone signaling. Finally, analysis of selected miRNA family revealed that a miR159b conserved in mycorrhizal plant species and a Poncirus-specific miR477a regulate AM symbiosis. The role of miR477a was likely to target GRAS family gene RAD1 in citrus plants. Our results not only revealed that miRNA-mRNA network analysis, especially miRNA-TF analysis, is effective in identifying miRNA family regulating AM symbiosis, but also shed light on miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of AM symbiosis in woody citrus plants.
