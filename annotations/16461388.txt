In response to exogenous rhythms of light and temperature, most organisms exhibit endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e. cycles of behavior and gene expression with a periodicity of approximately 24 h). One of the defining characteristics of the circadian clock is its ability to synchronize (entrain) to an environmental rhythm. Entrainment is arguably the most salient feature of the clock in evolutionary terms. Previous quantitative trait studies of circadian characteristics in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) considered leaf movement under constant (free-running) conditions. This study, however, addressed the important circadian parameter of phase, which reflects the entrained relationship between the clock and the external cycle. Here it is shown that, when exposed to the same photoperiod, Arabidopsis accessions differ dramatically in phase. Variation in the timing of circadian LUCIFERASE expression was used to map loci affecting the entrained phase of the clock in a recombinant population derived from two geographically distant accessions, Landsberg erecta and Cape Verde Islands. Four quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found with major effects on circadian phase. A QTL on chromosome 5 contained SIGNALING IN RED LIGHT REDUCED 1 and PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR 3, both genes known to affect the circadian clock. Previously unknown polymorphisms were found in both genes, making them candidates for the effect on phase. Fine mapping of two other QTL highlighted genomic regions not previously identified in any circadian screens, indicating their effects are likely due to genes not hitherto considered part of the circadian system.
