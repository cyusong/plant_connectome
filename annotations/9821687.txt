['9821687', 'Plant response to phosphorus starvation includes the increased production and  secretion of acid phosphatase. We have isolated a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana  (L.) Heynh., phosphatase-underproducer 1 (pup1), that has reduced histochemical  staining for acid phosphatase activity in roots of plants grown under  phosphorus-starvation conditions. Although pup1 is defective in the production of  one inducible acid phosphatase isoform, the most abundant inducible isoform is  present. The pup1 mutants are able to respond to phosphorus-deficient conditions  by an increase in overall levels of acid phosphatase activity, accumulation of  anthocyanins, an increase of the root-to-shoot ratio, and changes in the  partitioning of phosphorus between roots and shoots. The gross morphology of the  mutants appears normal, except that a small difference in the root to shoot ratio  was observed in plants grown under nonstressed conditions. The pup1 gene is  incompletely dominant and it is located between 40.2 (+/- 6.2) and 44.9 (+/- 9.9)  cM on chromosome 2. This mutant will be useful for determining the role of this  acid phosphatase isoform in plant response to phosphorus starvation.', '1998 Nov', 'Planta', '10.1007/s004250050431', 'Deikman']
