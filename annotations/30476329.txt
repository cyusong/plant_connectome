Signals and signaling pathways underlying the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia have been studied extensively over the past decades. In a previous phosphoproteomic study on the Medicago truncatula-Sinorhizobium meliloti symbiosis, we identified plant proteins that are differentially phosphorylated upon the perception of rhizobial signals, called Nod factors. In this study, we provide experimental evidence that one of these proteins, Early Phosphorylated Protein 1 (EPP1), is required for the initiation of this symbiosis. Upon inoculation with rhizobia, MtEPP1 expression was induced in curled root hairs. Down-regulation of MtEPP1 in M. truncatula roots almost abolished calcium spiking, reduced the expression of essential symbiosis-related genes (MtNIN, MtNF-YB1, MtERN1 and MtENOD40) and strongly decreased nodule development. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that orthologs of MtEPP1 are present in legumes and specifically in plant species able to host arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, suggesting a possible role in this association too. Short chitin oligomers induced the phosphorylation of MtEPP1 like Nod factors. However, the down-regulation of MtEPP1 affected the colonization of M. truncatula roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi only moderately. Altogether, these findings indicate that MtEPP1 is essential for the establishment of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis but might plays a limited role in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.
