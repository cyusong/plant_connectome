Physiological changes that increase plant performance during exposure to high temperatures may play an inverse role during exposure to low temperatures. The objective of this study was to test variations in photosystem II response to heat and cold stress in the leaves of a bromeliad with crassulacean acid metabolism submitted to high or low temperatures. Leaves were maintained under constant temperatures of 10 and 35°C and used to examine possible relationships among physiological responses to high and low temperatures and organic acid accumulation. We also tested if distinct parts of bromeliad leaves show differences in photosynthetic thermotolerance. The samples from leaves maintained at 35°C showed greater heat tolerance values, while those from leaves maintained at 10°C showed lower cold tolerance values. Our results identified a strong negative relationship between the organic acid accumulation and thermal tolerance of bromeliad leaves that largely explained the differences in thermal tolerance among groups. One of these differences occurred among regions of a single leaf, with the base showing critical heat values of up to 8°C higher than the top region, suggesting a possible partitioning of leaf response among its regions. Differences in thermal tolerance were also observed between sampling times, with higher values observed in the morning.
