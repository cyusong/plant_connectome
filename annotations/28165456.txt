Evolution often diversifies a peptide hormone family into multiple subfamilies, which exert distinct activities by exclusive interaction with specific receptors. Here we show that systematic swapping of pre-existing variation in a subfamily of plant CLE peptide hormones leads to a synthetic bifunctional peptide that exerts activities beyond the original subfamily by interacting with multiple receptors. This approach provides new insights into the complexity and specificity of peptide signalling.
