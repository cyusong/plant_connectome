Rubisco activase is required to regulate the catalytic activity of Rubisco in plants, in an ATP-dependent manner. One or two Rubisco activase proteins have been identified in different plant species. In some species, the two isoforms are the products of alternative splicing of the Rubisco activase gene. The aim of this study was to confirm that Lolium perenne and Festuca pratensis plants have two isoforms of Rubisco activase and that they are the products of alternative splicing of common pre-mRNA. Protein gel blot analyses indicated that L. perenne and F. pratensis leaves contained two Rubisco activase proteins. Sequence analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA showed that differential splicing generated two mRNAs that differed in sequence only in the inclusion of 48 bp. The insertion contains a stop codon leading to the synthesis of a shorter polypeptide. Under the conditions of our experiment, the shorter splicing variant of L. perenne and F. pratensis Rubisco activase gene was preferentially produced. Any further studies concerning Rubisco activase genes in L. perenne and/or F. pratensis plants should take into consideration the mechanism of its expression.
