Heading date is a critical trait that determines the regional adaptability and grain productivity of many crops. Although rice is a facultative short-day plant, its domestication led to the Ghd7-Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 pathway for adaptation to long-day conditions (LDs). The formation of the "florigen activation complex" (FAC) containing florigen Hd3a has been characterized. However, the molecular composition of the FAC that contains RFT1 for long-day flowering is unclear. We show here that RFT1 forms a ternary FAC with 14-3-3 proteins and OsFD1 to promote flowering under LDs. We identified a calcineurin B-like-interacting protein kinase, OsCIPK3, which directly interacts with and phosphorylates OsFD1, thereby facilitating the localization of the FAC to the nucleus. Mutation in OsCIPK3 results in a late heading date under LDs but a normal heading date under short-day conditions. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCIPK3 phosphorylates OsFD1 to promote RFT1-containing FAC formation and consequently induce flowering in rice under LDs.
