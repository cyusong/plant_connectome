In the version of this Resource originally published, the author information was incorrect. Jos R. Wendrich should have had a present address: Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics and VIB Center for Plant Systems Biology, Ghent University, Technologiepark 927, 9052 Ghent, Belgium. Mark Boekschoten and Guido J. Hooiveld should have been affiliated to the Nutrition, Metabolism and Genomics Group, Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University, 6708 WE Wageningen, The Netherlands. In addition, the version of Supplementary Table 5 originally published with this Resource was not the intended final version and included inaccurate citations to the display items of the Resource, and the file format and extension did not match.
