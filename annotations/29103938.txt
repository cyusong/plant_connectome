Etiolated growth in darkness or the irreversible transition to photomorphogenesis in the light engages alternative developmental programs operating across all organs of a plant seedling. Dark-grown Arabidopsis de-etiolated by zinc (dez) mutants exhibit morphological, cellular, metabolic, and transcriptional characteristics of light-grown seedlings. We identify the causal mutation in TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE encoding a putative acyl transferase. Pectin acetylation is decreased in dez, as previously found in the reduced wall acetylation2-3 mutant, shown here to phenocopy dez. Moreover, pectin of dez is excessively methylesterified. The addition of very short fragments of homogalacturonan, tri-galacturonate, and tetra-galacturonate, restores skotomorphogenesis in dark-grown dez and similar mutants, suggesting that the mutants are unable to generate these de-methylesterified pectin fragments. In combination with genetic data, we propose a model of spatiotemporally separated photoreceptive and signal-responsive cell types, which contain overlapping subsets of the regulatory network of light-dependent seedling development and communicate via a pectin-derived dark signal.
