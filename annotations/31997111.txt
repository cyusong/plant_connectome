PTR2 in Arabidopsis thaliana is negatively regulated by ABI4 and plays a key role in water uptake by seeds, ensuring that imbibed seeds proceed to germination. Peptide transporters (PTRs) transport nitrogen-containing substrates in a proton-dependent manner. Among the six PTRs in Arabidopsis thaliana, the physiological role of the tonoplast-localized, seed embryo abundant PTR2 is unknown. In the present study, a molecular physiological analysis of PTR2 was conducted using ptr2 mutants and PTR2CO complementation lines. Compared with the wild type, the ptr2 mutant showed ca. 6 h delay in testa rupture and consequently endosperm rupture because of 17% lower water content and 10% higher free abscisic acid (ABA) content. Constitutive overexpression of the PTR2 gene under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in ptr2 mutants rescued the mutant phenotypes. After cold stratification, a transient increase in ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4) transcript levels during induction of testa rupture was followed by a similar increase in PTR2 transcript levels, which peaked prior to endosperm rupture. The PTR2 promoter region containing multiple CCAC motifs was recognized by ABI4 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and PTR2 expression was repressed by 67% in ABI4 overexpression lines compared with the wild type, suggesting that PTR2 is an immediate downstream target of ABI4. Taken together, the results suggest that ABI4-dependent temporal regulation of PTR2 expression may influence water status during seed germination to promote the post-germinative growth of imbibed seeds.
