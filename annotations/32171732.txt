Soybean (Glycine max), as an economically important food and oilseedcrop, is a major source of plant proteins and oils. Although considerable progress has been made in increasing the yields of rice, wheat, and maize through the "Green Revolution", little improvements have been made for soybean. With the increasing demand of soybean production and the rapid development of crop breeding technologies, time has come for this important crop to undergo a Green Revolution. Here, we briefly summarize the history of crop breeding and Green Revolution in other crops. We then discuss the possible directions and potential approaches toward achieving a Green Revolution for soybean. We provide our views and perspectives on how to breed new soybean varieties with improved yield.
