['21632542', 'Unlike thioredoxins, glutaredoxins are involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly  and in reduction of specific disulfides (i.e. protein-glutathione adducts), and  thus they are also important redox regulators of chloroplast metabolism. Using  GFP fusion, AtGrxC5 isoform, present exclusively in Brassicaceae, was shown to be  localized in chloroplasts. A comparison of the biochemical, structural, and  spectroscopic properties of Arabidopsis GrxC5 (WCSYC active site) with poplar  GrxS12 (WCSYS active site), a chloroplastic paralog, indicated that, contrary to  the solely apomonomeric GrxS12 isoform, AtGrxC5 exists as two forms when  expressed in Escherichia coli. The monomeric apoprotein possesses  deglutathionylation activity mediating the recycling of plastidial methionine  sulfoxide reductase B1 and peroxiredoxin IIE, whereas the dimeric holoprotein  incorporates a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments and  resolution of the x-ray crystal structure of AtGrxC5 in its holoform revealed  that, although not involved in its ligation, the presence of the second active  site cysteine (Cys(32)) is required for cluster formation. In addition, thiol  titrations, fluorescence measurements, and mass spectrometry analyses showed  that, despite the presence of a dithiol active site, AtGrxC5 does not form any  inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond and that its activity exclusively relies  on a monothiol mechanism.', '2011 Aug 5', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111.228726', 'Rouhier']
