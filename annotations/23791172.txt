The prediction and verification of adaptive trajectories on macroevolutionary timescales have rarely been achieved for complex biological systems. Employing a model linking biological information at multiple scales, Heckmann et al. simulate likely sequences of evolutionary changes from C3 to C4 photosynthesis biochemistry.
