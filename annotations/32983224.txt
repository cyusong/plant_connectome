<i>Dickeya solani</i> is a Gram-negative bacterium able to cause disease symptoms on a variety of crop and ornamental plants worldwide. Weeds including <i>Solanum dulcamara</i> (bittersweet nightshade) growing near agricultural fields have been reported to support populations of soft rot bacteria in natural settings. However, little is known about the specific interaction of <i>D. solani</i> with such weed plants that may contribute to its success as an agricultural pathogen. The aim of this work was to assess the interaction of <i>D. solani</i> with its crop plant (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and an alternative (<i>S. dulcamara</i>) host plant. From a collection of 10,000 Tn5 transposon mutants of <i>D. solani</i> IPO2222 carrying an inducible, promotorless <i>gusA</i> reporter gene, 210 were identified that exhibited plant tissue-dependent expression of the gene/operon into which the Tn5 insertion had occurred. Thirteen Tn5 mutants exhibiting the greatest plant tissue induction of such transcriptional units in <i>S. tuberosum</i> or <i>S. dulcamara</i> as measured by qRT-PCR were assessed for plant host colonization, virulence, and ability to macerate plant tissue, as well as phenotypes likely to contribute to the ecological fitness of <i>D. solani</i>, including growth rate, carbon and nitrogen source utilization, motility, chemotaxis toward plant extracts, biofilm formation, growth under anaerobic conditions and quorum sensing. These 13 transcriptional units encode proteins involved in bacterial interactions with plants, with functions linked to cell envelope structure, chemotaxis and carbon metabolism. The selected 13 genes/operons were differentially expressed in, and thus contributed preferentially to <i>D. solani</i> fitness in potato and/or <i>S. dulcamara</i> stem, leaf, and root tissues.
