Leaf senescence is a complex but tightly regulated developmental process involving a coordinated sequence of multiple molecular events, which ultimately leads to death of the leaf. Efforts to understand the mechanistic principles underlying leaf senescence have been largely made by transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies over the past decade. This review focuses on recent milestones in leaf senescence research obtained using multi-omics technologies, as well as future endeavors toward systems understanding of leaf senescence processes. In particular, we discuss recent advances in understanding molecular events during leaf senescence through genome-wide transcriptome analyses in Arabidopsis. We also describe comparative transcriptome analyses used to unveil the commonality and diversity of regulatory mechanisms governing leaf senescence in the plant kingdom. Finally, we provide current illustrations of epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic landscapes of leaf senescence. We envisage that integration of multi-omics leaf senescence data will enable us to address unresolved questions regarding leaf senescence, including determining the molecular principles that coordinate concurrent and ordered changes in biological events during leaf senescence.
