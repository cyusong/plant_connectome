With the changing climate, crops are facing mounting threats from multiple abiotic stresses, and studies that assess the response of plants to combinations, rather than to individual, abiotic stresses are becoming increasingly relevant. Bananas are one of the most globally important and popular food crops and their production is threatened by increasing heat and diminishing rainfall in tropical and subtropical regions. In pursuit of effective stress management strategies, Jangale et al. (2019) look into the physiological and molecular responses of banana plants to combined heat and drought stresses.
