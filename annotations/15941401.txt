['15941401', 'Glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GR-RBPs) have been implicated to play roles in  post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in plants under various stress  conditions, but the functional roles of GR-RBPs under stress conditions remain to  be verified. Here, we examine the biological roles of a GR-RBP, designated  atRZ-1a, in Arabidopsis thaliana under stress conditions. atRZ-1a was expressed  ubiquitously in various Arabidopsis organs including stems, roots, leaves,  flowers, and siliques. The transcript level of atRZ-1a increased markedly by cold  stress, whereas its expression was marginally downregulated by drought stress or  abscisic acid treatment. Germination and seedling growth of the loss-of-function  mutants were retarded remarkably compared with those of the wild type under cold  stress. In contrast, the transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress atRZ-1a  displayed earlier germination and better seedling growth than the wild type under  cold stress. Moreover, the atRZ-1a-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants  were more freezing tolerant than the wild-type plants. Heterologous expression of  atRZ-1a in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the E. coli cells expressing  atRZ-1a displayed much higher growth rate than the non-transformed cells after  cold shock. These results provide evidence that atRZ-1a affects seed germination  and seedling growth under low temperature and plays a role in the enhancement of  freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis plants.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02420.x', 'Kang']
