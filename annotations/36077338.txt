Despite the great advancements made in cancer treatment, there are still many unsatisfied aspects, such as the wide palette of side effects and the drug resistance. There is an obvious increasing scientific attention towards nature and what it can offer the human race. Natural products can be used to treat many diseases, of which some plant products are currently used to treat cancer. Plants produce secondary metabolites for their signaling mechanisms and natural defense. A variety of plant-derived products have shown promising anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo. Rather than recreating the natural production environment, ongoing studies are currently setting various strategies to significantly manipulate the quantity of anticancer molecules in plants. This review focuses on the recently studied secondary metabolite agents that have shown promising anticancer activity, outlining their potential mechanisms of action and pathways.
