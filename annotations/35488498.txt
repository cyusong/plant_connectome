Startup plants include seedlings and basal and epicormic resprouts. It has long been held that startups have different strategies from adult plants, but theory for what trait differences to expect is limited and not yet quantitatively tested. Three applicable concepts are analogous to human startup firms, R-shift, and trait-growth theory. All three suggest startups should be built with lower construction costs than established plants. This appears to be almost always true in terms of leaf mass per area (LMA), though many comparisons are complicated by the startups growing in lower light. Trait-growth theory predicts LMA should increase progressively with height or total leaf area, driven by higher conductive-pathway costs associated with each unit leaf area, and by greater reward from slowing leaf turnover. Basal resprouts often have somewhat higher LMA than seedlings, but possibly this is simply because they are larger. A number of eminently testable questions are identified. Prospects are good for a theoretically cogent and field-tested body of knowledge about plant startups.

Startup plants: !have different strategies from! Adult plants
R-shift: !predicts! Lower construction costs
Trait-growth theory: !predicts! Increasing LMA with height/leaf area
Basal resprouts: !often have higher! LMA than seedlings
