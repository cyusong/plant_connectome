The molecular mechanisms underlying seed dormancy and germination are not fully understood. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana SEED DORMANCY 4-LIKE (AtSdr4L) is a novel specific regulator of dormancy and germination. AtSdr4L encodes a protein with an unknown biochemical function that is localized in the nucleus and is expressed specifically in seeds. Loss of function of AtSdr4L results in increased seed dormancy. The germination of freshly harvested seeds of the Atsdr4l mutant is insensitive to gibberellin (GA). After-ripened mutant seeds are hypersensitive to the GA biosynthesis-inhibitor paclobutrazol but show unaltered sensitivity to abscisic acid. Several GA biosynthesis genes and GA-regulated cell wall remodeling genes are down-regulated in the mutant in both dormant and after-ripened seeds. These results suggest that the Atsdr4l mutation causes both decreased GA biosynthesis and reduced responses. In addition, a genetic analysis indicated that AtSdr4L is epistatic to DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1) for dormancy and acts upstream of RGA-LIKE 2 (RGL2) in the GA pathway. We propose that AtSdr4L regulates seed dormancy and germination by mediating both the DOG1 and GA pathways.
