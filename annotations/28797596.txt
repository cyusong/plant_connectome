Light is important for algae, as it warrants metabolic independence via photosynthesis. In addition to the absorption of light by the photosystems, algae possess a variety of specific photoreceptors that allow the quantification of the light fluxes as well as the assessment of light qualities. About a decade ago, aureochromes have been described in the xanthophyte alga Vaucheria frigida. These proteins represent a new type of blue light photoreceptor as they possess both a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain for light reception as well as a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain for DNA binding, indicating that they represent light-driven transcription factors. Aureochromes so far have been detected only in a single group of algae, photosynthetic stramenopiles, but not in any other prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms. Recent biophysical work on aureochromes in the absence and the presence of DNA revealed the mechanism of allosteric communication between the sensor and effector domains despite their unusual inversed arrangement. Different molecular models have been proposed to describe the effect of light on DNA binding. Functional characterization of mutants of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, in which the aureochrome genes have been silenced or deleted, indicate that different aureochromes may have different functions, being involved in central processes like light acclimation and regulation of the cell cycle.
