['15255863', "Summary Atercc1, the recently characterized Arabidopsis homologue of the Ercc1  (Rad10) protein, is a key component of nucleotide excision repair as part of a  structure-specific endonuclease which cleaves 5' to UV photoproducts in DNA. This  endonuclease also acts in removing overhanging non-homologous DNA 'tails' in  synapsed recombination intermediates. We have previously demonstrated this  recombination function of the Arabidopsis thaliana Xpf homologue, AtRad1p, and  show here that recombination between plasmid DNA substrates containing  non-homologous tails is specifically reduced 12-fold in atercc1 mutant plants  compared with the wild type. Furthermore, using chromosomal tandem-repeat  recombination substrates, we show that AtErcc1p is required for bleomycin  induction of mitotic recombination in the chromosomal context. This work thus  confirms both the specific and general recombination roles of the Atercc1 protein  in recombination in Arabidopsis.", '2004 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02136.x', 'White']
