The polysaccharide pectin is a major component of the plant cell wall. The pectic glycan homogalacturonan (HG) is a proportionally small but important component of a specialized seed cell wall called mucilage. HG is synthesized in a highly methylesterified form, and, following secretion, is de-methylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs). The degree of methylesterification of HG determines the structural and functional properties of pectin, but how methylesterification is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we identified two BEL1-Like homeodomain (BLH) transcription factors, BLH2 and BLH4, as positive regulators of HG de-methylesterification in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage. <i>BLH2</i> and <i>BLH4</i> were significantly expressed in mucilage secretory cells during seed mucilage production. <i>BLH2</i> and <i>BLH4</i> single mutants exhibited no obvious mucilage phenotype, but the <i>blh2 blh4</i> double mutant displayed significantly reduced mucilage adherence to the seed. Reduced mucilage adherence in <i>blh2 blh4</i> was caused by decreased PME activity in the seed coat, which increased the degree of methylesterification of HG in mucilage. The expression of several PME metabolism-related genes, including <i>PME58</i>, <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i>, <i>SEEDSTICK</i>, and <i>MYB52</i> was significantly altered in <i>blh2 blh4</i> seeds. BLH2 and BLH4 directly activated <i>PME58</i> expression by binding to its TGACAGGT cis-element. Moreover, <i>pme58</i> mutants exhibited reduced mucilage adherence similar to that of <i>blh2 blh4</i>, and the <i>blh2 blh4 pme58</i> triple mutant exhibited no additional mucilage adherence defects. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>PME58</i> in <i>blh2 blh4</i> rescued the mucilage adherence defect. Together, these results demonstrate that BLH2 and BLH4 redundantly regulate de-methylesterification of HG in seed mucilage by directly activating <i>PME58</i>.
