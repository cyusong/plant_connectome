Pear fruit exhibit a single sigmoid pattern during development, while peach and strawberry fruits exhibit a double sigmoid pattern. However, little is known about the differences between these two patterns. In this study, fruit weights were measured and paraffin sections were made from fruitlet to maturated pear, peach, and strawberry samples. Results revealed that both single and double sigmoid patterns resulted from cell expansion, but not cell division. Comparative transcriptome analyses were conducted among pear, peach, and strawberry fruits at five fruit enlargement stages. Comparing the genes involved in these intervals among peaches and strawberries, 836 genes were found to be associated with all three fruit enlargement stages in pears (Model I). Of these genes, 25 were located within the quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions related to fruit weight and 90 were involved in cell development. Moreover, 649 genes were associated with the middle enlargement stage, but not early or late enlargement in pears (Model II). Additionally, 22 genes were located within the QTL regions related to fruit weight and 63 were involved in cell development. Lastly, dual-luciferase assays revealed that the screened bHLH transcription factors induced the expression of cell expansion-related genes, suggesting that the two models explain the single sigmoid pattern. Single sigmoid patterns are coordinately mediated by Models I and II, thus, a potential gene regulation network for the single sigmoid pattern was proposed. These results enhance our understanding of the molecular regulation of fruit size in Rosaceae.
