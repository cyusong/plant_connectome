Crop breeding schemes can be significantly accelerated by using (doubled) haploid plants. In vivo haploid induction has been applied in plant breeding for decades but is still not available for all crops and genotypes, and haploidization rates are generally very low. Therefore, methodological improvements to and new concepts for haploidization are required. Here, we report a novel system for the induction of haploid plants by mutating genes encoding egg cell-specific aspartic endopeptidases (ECSs). We show that after successful sperm-egg cell fusion, ECSs play a critical role to ensure male and female nucleus fusion after fertilization. The ecs1 ecs2 double mutant can induce haploids by both selfing and hybridization in Arabidopsis and ECS mutation is also capable of producing haploids in rice. In summary, our study develops a novel approach for maternal haploidization and provides new insights into the molecular basis of fertilization.
