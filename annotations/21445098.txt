['21445098', 'Potassium (K(+)) channel function is fundamental to many physiological processes.  However, components and mechanisms regulating the activity of plant K(+) channels  remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the calcium (Ca(2+)) sensor CBL4  together with the interacting protein kinase CIPK6 modulates the activity and  plasma membrane (PM) targeting of the K(+) channel AKT2 from Arabidopsis thaliana  by mediating translocation of AKT2 to the PM in plant cells and enhancing AKT2  activity in oocytes. Accordingly, akt2, cbl4 and cipk6 mutants share similar  developmental and delayed flowering phenotypes. Moreover, the isolated regulatory  C-terminal domain of CIPK6 is sufficient for mediating CBL4- and Ca(2+)-dependent  channel translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to the PM by a  novel targeting pathway that is dependent on dual lipid modifications of CBL4 by  myristoylation and palmitoylation. Thus, we describe a critical mechanism of  ion-channel regulation where a Ca(2+) sensor modulates K(+) channel activity by  promoting a kinase interaction-dependent but phosphorylation-independent  translocation of the channel to the PM.', '2011 Jul', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2011.50', 'Kudla']
