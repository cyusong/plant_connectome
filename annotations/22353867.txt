Transcriptional co-activators of the multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) controls gene expression by connecting transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery. In Arabidopsis thaliana functions of MBF1 genes have been related to stress tolerance and developmental alterations. Endogenous ABA plays a major role in the regulation of Arabidopsis seed dormancy and germination. Seed dormancy and ABA sensitivity are enhanced in ethylene insensitive mutants suggesting that ethylene signal transduction pathway is necessary to fully develop ABA-dependent germination. In this report we showed that a triple knock-down mutant for Arabidopsis MBF1 genes (abc-) has enhanced seed dormancy and displays hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA. In addition, higher ABA contents were detected in abc- seeds after imbibition. These evidences suggest a negative role of MBF1s genes in ABA-dependent inhibition of germination. The participation of MBF1s in ethylene signal transduction pathway is also discussed.
