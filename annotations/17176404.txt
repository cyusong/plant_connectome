* The relationship between carboxylate release from roots and the ability of the species to utilize phosphorus from sparingly soluble forms was studied by comparing Triticum aestivum, Brassica napus, Cicer arietinum, Pisum sativum, Lupinus albus, Lupinus angustifolius and Lupinus cosentinii. * Plants were grown in sand and supplied with 40 mg P kg(-1) in the sparingly soluble forms AlPO(4), FePO(4) or Ca(5)OH(PO(4))(3), or as soluble KH(2)PO(4); control plants received no P. * The ability to utilize sparingly soluble forms of P differed between forms of P supplied and species. Pisum sativum and C. arietinum did not access AlPO(4) or FePO(4) despite releasing carboxylates into the rhizosphere. * Species accessed different forms of sparingly soluble P, but no species was superior in accessing all forms. We conclude that a single trait cannot explain access to different forms of sparingly soluble P, and hypothesize that in addition to carboxylates, rhizosphere pH and root morphology are key factors.
