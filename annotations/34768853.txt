<i>Phytophthora infestans</i> (<i>P. infestans</i>) recently caused epidemics of tomato late blight. Our study aimed to identify the function of the <i>SlMYBS2</i> gene in response to tomato late blight. To further investigate the function of <i>SlMYBS2</i> in tomato resistance to <i>P. infestans</i>, we studied the effects of <i>SlMYBS2</i> gene knock out. The <i>SlMYBS2</i> gene was knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9, and the resulting plants (<i>SlMYBS2</i> gene knockout, <i>slmybs2-c</i>) showed reduced resistance to <i>P. infestans</i>, accompanied by increases in the number of necrotic cells, lesion sizes, and disease index. Furthermore, after <i>P. infestans</i> infection, the expression levels of pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) genes in <i>slmybs2-c</i> plants were significantly lower than those in wild-type (AC) plants, while the number of necrotic cells and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were higher than those in wild-type plants. Taken together, these results indicate that <i>SlMYBS2</i> acts as a positive regulator of tomato resistance to <i>P. infestans</i> infection by regulating the ROS level and the expression level of <i>PR</i> genes.
