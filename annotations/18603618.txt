Expression and localization of myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (MIPS) in developing seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. MIPS is an essential enzyme for production of inositol and inositol phosphates via its circularization of glucose-6-phosphate as the initial step. myo-inositol-6-phosphate (InsP(6) or phytic acid) is the predominant form of phosphorus found in seeds and accumulates as a consequence of MIPS action. Three MIPS genes have been identified in Arabidopsis, all of which were expressed not only in siliques but in both leaves and roots. Immunoelectron microscopy using a MIPS antibody showed that MIPS localizes to the cytosol primarily in the endosperm during seed development and not in the embryo. This is consistent with results obtained using fluorescent microscopy and western blot analysis that showed a similar pattern of localization. However, InsP(6), which is the final product of inositol phosphate metabolism, was present mainly in the embryo. This suggests that a complex interaction between the endosperm and embryo occurs during the synthesis and subsequent accumulation of InsP(6) in developing seeds of Arabidopsis.
