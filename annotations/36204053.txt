As one of the most important and largest transcription factors, WRKY plays a critical role in plant disease resistance. However, little is known regarding the functions of the WRKY family in cultivated peanuts (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.). In this study, a total of 174 WRKY genes (<i>AhWRKY</i>) were identified from the genome of cultivated peanuts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AhWRKY proteins could be divided into four groups, including 35 (20.12%) in group I, 107 (61.49%) in group II, 31 (17.82%) in group III, and 1 (0.57%) in group IV. This division is further supported by the conserved motif compositions and intron/exon structures. All <i>AhWRKY</i> genes were unevenly located on all 20 chromosomes, among which 132 pairs of fragment duplication and seven pairs of tandem duplications existed. Eighteen miRNAs were found to be targeting 50 <i>AhWRKY</i> genes. Most <i>AhWRKY</i> genes from some groups showed tissue-specific expression. <i>AhWRKY46, AhWRKY94, AhWRKY156, AhWRKY68, AhWRKY41, AhWRKY128, AhWRKY104, AhWRKY19, AhWRKY62, AhWRKY155, AhWRKY170, AhWRKY78, AhWRKY34, AhWRKY12, AhWRKY95</i>, and <i>AhWRKY76</i> were upregulated in ganhua18 and kainong313 genotypes after <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> infection. Ten <i>AhWRKY</i> genes (<i>AhWRKY34, AhWRKY76, AhWRKY78, AhWRKY120, AhWRKY153, AhWRKY155, AhWRKY159, AhWRKY160, AhWRKY161</i>, and <i>AhWRKY162</i>) from group III displayed different expression patterns in <i>R. solanacearum</i> sensitive and resistant peanut genotypes infected with the <i>R. solanacearum</i>. Two AhWRKY genes (<i>AhWRKY76</i> and <i>AhWRKY77</i>) from group III obtained the LRR domain. <i>AhWRKY77</i> downregulated in both genotypes; <i>AhWRKY76</i> showed lower-higher expression in ganhua18 and higher expression in kainong313. Both <i>AhWRKY76</i> and <i>AhWRKY77</i> are targeted by ahy-miR3512, which may have an important function in peanut disease resistance. This study identified candidate <i>WRKY</i> genes with possible roles in peanut resistance against <i>R. solanacearum</i> infection. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of the novel role of <i>WRKY</i> family genes but also provide valuable information for disease resistance in <i>A. hypogaea</i>.
