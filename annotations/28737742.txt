Organ-to-organ signal transmission is essential for higher organisms to ensure coordinated biological reactions during metabolism and morphogenesis. Similar to organs in animals, plant organs communicate by various signalling molecules. Among them, cytokinins, a class of phytohormones, play a key role as root-to-shoot long-distance signals, regulating various growth and developmental processes in shoots<sup>1,2</sup>. Previous studies have proposed that trans-zeatin-riboside, a type of cytokinin precursor, is a major long-distance signalling form in xylem vessels and its action depends on metabolic conversion via the LONELY GUY enzyme in proximity to the site of action<sup>3-5</sup>. Here we report an additional long-distance signalling form of cytokinin: trans-zeatin, an active form. Grafting between various cytokinin biosynthetic and transportation mutants revealed that root-to-shoot translocation of trans-zeatin, a minor component of xylem cytokinin, controls leaf size but not meristem activity-related traits, whereas that of trans-zeatin riboside is sufficient for regulating both traits. Considering the ratio of trans-zeatin to trans-zeatin-riboside in xylem and their delivery rate change in response to environmental conditions, this dual long-distance cytokinin signalling system allows plants to fine-tune the manner of shoot growth to adapt to fluctuating environments.
