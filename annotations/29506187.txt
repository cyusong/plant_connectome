Chromatin modifiers and remodelers are involved in generating dynamic changes at the chromatin, which allow differential and specific readouts of the genome. While genetic evidence indicates that several chromatin factors play a key role in controlling basic developmental programs for inflorescence and flower morphogenesis, it remained unknown until recently how they exert their specificity toward gene expression, both temporally and spatially. An emerging topic is the recruitment or eviction of chromatin factors through the activity of sequence-specific DNA-binding domains, present in the chromatin factors themselves or in partnering transcription factors. Here we summarize recent progress that has been made in this regard in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We further outline the different possible modes through which chromatin complexes specifically target genes involved in flower development.
