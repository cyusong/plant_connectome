Transgenic technologies have been applied to a wide range of biological research. However, information on the potential epigenetic effects of transgenic technology is still lacking. Here, we show that the transgenic process can simultaneously induce both genetic and epigenetic changes in rice. We analyzed genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic changes in plants subjected to tissue culture regeneration, using transgenic lines expressing the same coding sequence from two different promoters in transgenic lines of two rice cultivars: Wuyunjing7 (WYJ7) and Nipponbare (NP). We determined the expression of <i>OsNAR2.1</i> in two overexpression lines generated from the two cultivars, and in the RNA interference (RNAi) <i>OsNAR2.1</i> line in NP. DNA methylation analyses were performed on wild-type cultivars (WYJ7 and NP), regenerated lines (CK, T0 plants), segregation-derived wild-type from <i>pOsNAR2.1-OsNAR2.1</i> (SDWT), <i>pOsNAR2.1-OsNAR2.1</i>, <i>pUbi-OsNAR2.1</i>, and RNAi lines. Interestingly, we observed global methylation decreased in the T<sub>0</sub> regenerated line of WYJ7 (CK-WJY7) and <i>pOsNAR2.1-OsNAR2.1</i> lines but increased in <i>pUbi-OsNAR2.1</i> and RNAi lines of NP. Furthermore, the methylation pattern in SDWT returned to the WYJ7 level after four generations. Phenotypic changes were detected in all the generated lines except for SDWT. Global methylation was found to decrease by 13% in <i>pOsNAR2.1-OsNAR2.1</i> with an increase in plant height of 4.69% compared with WYJ7, and increased by 18% in <i>pUbi</i>-<i>OsNAR2.1</i> with an increase of 17.36% in plant height compared with NP. This suggests an absence of a necessary link between global methylation and the phenotype of transgenic plants with <i>OsNAR2.1</i> gene over-expression. However, epigenetic changes can influence phenotype during tissue culture, as seen in the massive methylation in CK-WYJ7, T0 regenerated lines, resulting in decreased plant height compared with the wild-type, in the absence of a transformed gene. We conclude that in the transgenic lines the phenotype is mainly determined by the nature and function of the transgene after four generations of transformation, while the global epigenetic modification is dependent on the genetic background. Our research suggests an innovative insight in explaining the reason behind the occurrence of transgenic plants with random and undesirable phenotypes.
