Wounding not only induces the expression of damage-responsive genes, but also initiates physiological changes, such as tissue repair, vascular reconnection, and <i>de novo</i> organogenesis in locally damaged tissues. Wound-induced signals also propagate from the site of wounding to distal organs to elicit a systemic response. Electrical signaling, which is the most conserved type of systemic signaling in eukaryotes, is triggered by wound-induced membrane potential changes. Changes in membrane potential spread toward systemic tissues in synergy with chemical and hydraulic signals. Here, we review current knowledge on wound-induced local and systemic responses in plants. We focus particularly on how wound-activated plasma membrane-localized ion channels and pumps propagate systemic information about wounding to induce downstream molecular responses in distal tissues. Finally, we propose future studies that could lead to a better understanding of plant electrical signals and their role in physiological responses to wounding.

Wounding: !induces! Expression of damage-responsive genes
Membrane potential changes: !trigger! Electrical signaling
Ion channels/pumps: !propagate! Systemic information about wounding
Systemic information: !induces! Downstream molecular responses
