Lycium chinense is an important medicinal plant in the northwest of China. Flavonoids are the major pharmacological components of L. chinense fruits. However, flavonoid metabolism during fruit development of L. chinense remains to be studied. Here, we analyzed the change of flavonoid contents, enzyme activity, and gene expression during fruit development of L. chinense. We found that flavonoids, anthocyanins, and catechins are the most important components of L. chinense fruits. Flavonoid content was increased with fruit development and was high at the late developmental stage. PAL, CHS, and F3H enzymes played a significant role in flavonoid accumulation in fruits. Transcriptomic analysis showed that anthocyanin pathway, flavonol pathway, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylpropanoid synthesis pathway were the major pathways involved in flavonoid metabolism in L. chinense. Gene expression analysis indicated that PAL1 and CHS2 genes were critical for flavonoid metabolism in L. chinense fruits. These discoveries help us understand the dynamic changes in flavonoids during fruit development and enhance the use of L. chinense fruits.
