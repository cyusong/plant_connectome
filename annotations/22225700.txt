['22225700', 'Membrane-anchored receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) recognize extracellular  signals at the cell surface and activate the downstream signaling pathway by  phosphorylating specific target proteins. We analyzed a receptor-like cytosolic  kinase (RLCK) gene, ARCK1, whose expression was induced by abiotic stress. ARCK1  belongs to the cysteine-rich repeat (CRR) RLK sub-family and encodes a cytosolic  protein kinase. The arck1 mutant showed higher sensitivity than the wild-type to  ABA and osmotic stress during the post-germinative growth phase. CRK36, an  abiotic stress-inducible RLK belonging to the CRR RLK sub-family, was screened as  a potential interacting factor with ARCK1 by co-expression analyses and a yeast  two-hybrid system. CRK36 physically interacted with ARCK1 in plant cells, and the  kinase domain of CRK36 phosphorylated ARCK1 in vitro. We generated CRK36 RNAi  transgenic plants, and found that transgenic plants with suppressed CRK36  expression showed higher sensitivity than arck1-2 to ABA and osmotic stress  during the post-germinative growth phase. Microarray analysis using CRK36 RNAi  plants revealed that suppression of CRK36 up-regulates several ABA-responsive  genes, such as LEA genes, oleosin, ABI4 and ABI5. These results suggest that  CRK36 and ARCK1 form a complex and negatively control ABA and osmotic stress  signal transduction.', '2012 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04901.x', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
