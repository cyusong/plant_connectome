Drought is an important stress factor that limits plant growth and development. Female willows generally display stronger drought tolerance than males. The application of exogenous acetic acid (AA) has emerged as an efficient and eco-friendly approach to facilitate drought tolerance in willows. However, whether AA exerts sexually different effects on willows remains undefined. In this study, we comprehensively performed morphological and physiological analyses on three willow species, Salix rehderiana, S. babylonica and S. matsudana, to investigate the sexually different responses to drought and AA. The results indicated that willow females were more drought-tolerant than males. AA application effectively enhanced willows' drought tolerance, and females applied with AA displayed greater root distribution and activity, stronger osmotic and antioxidant capacity and photosynthetic rate but less reactive oxygen species, or abscisic acid-mediated stomatal closure than males. In addition, AA application enhanced the jasmonic acid signaling pathway in females but inhibited it in males, conferring stronger drought defense capacity in female willows than in males. Overall, AA application improves drought tolerance more in female than in male willows, further enlarging the sexual differences in willows under drought-stressed conditions.
