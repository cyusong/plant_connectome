['16636050', 'The genes that control mammalian programmed cell death are conserved across wide  evolutionary distances. Although plant cells can undergo apoptosis-like cell  death, plant homologs of mammalian regulators of apoptosis have, in general, not  been found. This is in part due to the lack of primary sequence conservation  between animal and putative plant regulators of apoptosis. Thus, alternative  approaches beyond sequence similarities are required to find functional plant  homologs of apoptosis regulators. Here, we present the results of using advanced  bioinformatic tools to uncover the Arabidopsis family of BAG proteins. The  mammalian BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) proteins are a family of chaperone  regulators that modulate a number of diverse processes ranging from proliferation  to growth arrest and cell death. Such proteins are distinguished by a conserved  BAG domain that directly interacts with Hsp70 and Hsc70 proteins to regulate  their activity. Our searches of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence revealed  seven homologs of the BAG protein family. We further show that plant BAG family  members are also multifunctional and remarkably similar to their animal  counterparts, as they regulate apoptosis-like processes ranging from pathogen  attack to abiotic stress and development.', '2006 Jul 7', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M511794200', 'Dickman']
