The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is an ancient, evolutionarily conserved membrane remodeling complex that is essential for multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis in eukaryotes. FYVE DOMAIN PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR ENDOSOMAL SORTING 1 (FREE1), which was previously identified as a plant-specific ESCRT component, modulates MVB-mediated endosomal sorting and autophagic degradation. Although the basic cellular functions of FREE1 as an ESCRT component have been described, the regulators that control FREE1 turnover remain unknown. Here, we analyzed how FREE1 homeostasis is mediated by the RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases, SINA of Arabidopsis thaliana (SINATs), in response to iron deficiency. Under iron-deficient growth conditions, SINAT1-4 were induced and ubiquitinated FREE1, thereby promoting its degradation and relieving the repressive effect of FREE1 on iron absorption. By contrast, SINAT5, another SINAT member that lacks ubiquitin ligase activity due to the absence of the RING domain, functions as a protector protein which stabilizes FREE1. Collectively, our findings uncover a hitherto unknown mechanism of homeostatic regulation of FREE1, and demonstrate a unique regulatory SINAT-FREE1 module that subtly regulates plant response to iron deficiency stress.

SINAT1-4: !ubiquitinates! FREE1
SINAT5: !stabilizes! FREE1
FREE1: !modulates! MVB-mediated endosomal sorting
FREE1: !represses! iron absorption
SINATs: !regulate! FREE1 homeostasis
