Using simple biochemical tricks, metabolite-binding riboswitches take on gene control functions that have long been thought to be the work of protein factors. Although modern riboswitches might be the last holdouts of primitive genetic elements, some are capable of sensory and regulatory feats that are competitive with their protein counterparts.
