['27827441', 'Auxin and cytokinin (CK) are both important hormones involved in many aspects of  plant growth and development. However, the details of auxin biosynthesis and the  interaction between auxin and CK are still unclear. Isolation and  characterization of an auxin deficient mutant cytokinin induced root curling 2  (ckrc2) in this work reveal that CKRC2 encodes a previously identified member of  YUCCA (YUC) flavin monooxygenase-like proteins (YUC8). Our results show that,  like other YUCs, CKRC2/YUC8 is a rate-limiting enzyme for catalyzing the  conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), acting  downstream of CKRC1/TAA1 in the IPyA pathway. Here we show that the transcription  of both CKRC1/TAA and CKRC2/YUC8 can be induced by CK and that the  phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4) is required for this upregulation.  Transcription of PIF4 itself is induced by CK via the AHKs-ARR1/12 signalling  pathway. These results indicate that PIF4 plays an essential role in mediating  the regulatory effect of CK on the transcriptions of CKRC1 and CKRC2 genes in the  IPyA pathway of auxin biosynthesis.', '2016 Nov 9', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep36866', 'Guo']
