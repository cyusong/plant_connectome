Enhancement of the natural defenses of a plant by beneficial microorganisms, i.e., endophytic bacteria and fungi or fertilizers such as copper phosphonates, could result in a potential alternative strategy against verticillium wilt of olive tree (<i>Olea europaea</i>). In this study, two beneficial microorganisms (the fungus <i>Aureobasidium pullulans</i> AP08 and the bacterium <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> PAB-024) and a phosphonate salt copper phosphite (CuPh) were evaluated for their effectiveness as host resistance inducers against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> in olive. To this end, 6-month-old healthy olive plants of the susceptible cultivar Picual were treated by foliar or root applications by spraying 15 ml per plant or by irrigation with 350 ml per plant of the dilutions of each product (CuPh: 3 or 10 ml l<sup>-1</sup>, respectively; PAB-024: 10<sup>8</sup> UFC ml<sup>-1</sup>; AP08: 10<sup>6</sup> UFC ml<sup>-1</sup>). Treatments were conducted weekly from 2 weeks before inoculation to 10 days after inoculation. A cornmeal-water-sand mixture (1:2:9; w:v:w) colonized by <i>V. dahliae</i> was used for plant inoculation. Additionally, treated and noninoculated, nontreated and inoculated, and nontreated and noninoculated plants were included for comparative purposes. Disease severity progress and shoot fresh weight were assessed. Parameters involved in plant resistance were monitored through determination and quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) response (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and evaluation of hormones was done by gene expression analysis. <i>Aureobasidium pullulans</i> and CuPh were the most effective in disease reduction <i>in planta</i> by foliar or root application, respectively. Plants treated with CuPh showed significantly higher shoot fresh weight compared to the other treatments. ROS was significantly enhanced in plants treated with <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> PAB-024 compared to the rest of treatments and control. With regard to the evaluation of hormones, high levels of salicylic acid were detected on leaves from all treatment combinations, but without significant enhancements compared to the nontreated control. Regarding the gene expression related to salicylic acid, only the <i>WRKY5</i> gene has shown a strong enhancement in the treatment with <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i>. On the other hand, a strong accumulation of jasmonic acid and jasmonic acid-isoleucine in plants treated with <i>A. pullulans</i> was observed in all the tissues analyzed and also in the roots of plants treated with <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> and CuPh.
