Brassinosteroid-related genes are involved in regulating plant growth and stress responses. However, systematic analysis is limited to Gramineae species, and their roles in plant architecture and salt stress remain unclear. In this study, we identified brassinosteroid-related genes in wheat, barley, maize, and sorghum and investigated their evolutionary relationships, conserved domains, transmembrane topologies, promoter sequences, syntenic relationships, and gene/protein structures. Gene and genome duplications led to considerable differences in gene numbers. Specific domains were revealed in several genes (i.e., <i>HvSPY</i>, <i>HvSMOS1</i>, and <i>ZmLIC</i>), indicating diverse functions. Protein-protein interactions suggested their synergistic functions. Their expression profiles were investigated in wheat and maize, which indicated involvement in adaptation to stress and regulation of plant architecture. Several candidate genes for plant architecture (<i>ZmBZR1</i> and <i>TaGSK1/2/3/4-3D</i>) and salinity resistance (<i>TaMADS22/47/55-4B</i>, <i>TaGRAS19-4B</i>, and <i>TaBRD1-2A.1</i>) were identified. This study is the first to comprehensively investigate brassinosteroid-related plant architecture genes in four Gramineae species and should help elucidate the biological roles of brassinosteroid-related genes in crops.
