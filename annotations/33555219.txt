WRKY transcription factors have been implicated in plant response to pathogens but how WRKY-mediated networks are organized and operate to produce appropriate transcriptional outputs remains largely unclear. Here, we identify a member of the WRKY family from pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>), CaWRKY28, that physically interacts with CaWRKY40, a positive regulator of pepper immunity and thermotolerance. We confirmed CaWRKY28-CaWRKY40 interaction by coimmunoprecipitation, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and microscale thermophoresis. Our findings supported the idea that CaWRKY28 is a nuclear protein that acts as positive regulator in pepper responses to infection by the pathogenic bacterium <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>. It performs its function not by directly modulating the W-box containing immunity-related genes but by promoting CaWRKY40 via physical interaction to bind and activate its immunity-related target genes, including <i>CaPR1</i>, <i>CaNPR1</i>, <i>CaDEF1</i>, and <i>CaABR1</i>, but not its thermotolerance-related target gene, <i>CaHSP24</i>. All of these data indicate that CaWRKY28 interacts with and potentiates CaWRKY40 in regulating immunity against <i>R. solanacearum</i> infection but not thermotolerance. Importantly, we discovered that CaWRKY28 Cys249, shared by CaWRKY28 and its orthologs probably only in the family Solanaceae, is crucial for the CaWRKY28-CaWRKY40 interaction. These results highlight how CaWRKY28 associates with CaWRKY40 during the establishment of WRKY networks, and how CaWRKY40 achieves its functional specificity during pepper responses to <i>R. solanacearum</i> infection.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
