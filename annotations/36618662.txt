<i>Litsea cubeba</i> (Lour.) Person, an economically important aromatic plant producing essential oils, has lemon-like fragrance and 96.44-98.44% monoterpene contents. bHLH transcription factor plays an important role in plant secondary metabolism and terpene biosynthesis. In this study, we used bioinformatics to identify bHLH transcription factors in <i>L. cubeba</i>, 173 <i>bHLH</i> genes were identified from <i>L. cubeba</i> and divided these into 26 subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis. The majority of bHLHs in each subfamily shared comparable structures and motifs. While <i>LcbHLHs</i> were unevenly distributed across 12 chromosomes, 10 tandem repeats were discovered. Expression profiles of bHLH genes in different tissues demonstrated that <i>LcbHLH78</i> is a potential candidate gene for regulating monoterpene biosynthesis. <i>LcbHLH78</i> and the terpene synthase <i>LcTPS42</i> showed comparable expression patterns in various tissues and fruit development stages of <i>L. cubeba</i>. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that LcbHLH78 protein localizes to the nucleus, consistent with a transcription factor function. Importantly, transient overexpression of <i>LcbHLH78</i> increased geraniol and linalol contents. Our research demonstrates that <i>LcbHLH78</i> enhances terpenoid biosynthesis. This finding will be beneficial for improving the quality of <i>L. cubeba</i> and provides helpful insights for further research into the control mechanism of <i>LcbHLH</i> genes over terpenoid biosynthesis.
