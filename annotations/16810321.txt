['16810321', 'Proline metabolism has been implicated in plant responses to abiotic stresses.  The Arabidopsis thaliana proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) is catalysing the first  step in proline degradation. Transcriptional activation of ProDH by  hypo-osmolarity is mediated by an ACTCAT cis element, a typical binding site of  basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. In this study, we demonstrate  by gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, as well as chromatin  immunoprecipitation (ChIP), that ProDH is a direct target gene of the group-S  bZIP factor AtbZIP53. Dimerisation studies making use of yeast and Arabidopsis  protoplast-based two-hybrid systems, as well as bimolecular fluorescence  complementation (BiFC) reveal that AtbZIP53 does not preferentially form dimers  with group-S bZIPs but strongly interacts with members of group-C. In particular,  a synergistic interplay of AtbZIP53 and group-C AtbZIP10 was demonstrated by  colocalisation studies, strong enhancement of ACTCAT-mediated transcription as  well as complementation studies in atbzip53 atbzip10 T-DNA insertion lines.  Heterodimer mediated activation of transcription has been found to operate  independent of the DNA-binding properties and is described as a crucial mechanism  to modulate transcription factor activity and function.', '2006 Jul 12', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601206', 'Droge-Laser']
