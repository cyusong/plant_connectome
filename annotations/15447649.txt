['15447649', 'Previous studies have established that mutations in the NDR1 gene in Arabidopsis  thaliana suppress the resistance response of three resistance proteins, RPS2,  RPM1, and RPS5, to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strain DC3000 containing  the cognate effector genes, avrRpt2, avrRpm1, and avrpPhB, respectively. NDR1 is  a plasma membrane (PM)-localized protein, and undergoes several  post-translational modifications including carboxy-terminal processing and  N-linked glycosylation. Expression of NDR1 under the NDR1 native promoter  complements the ndr1-1 mutation, while overexpression of NDR1 results in enhanced  resistance to virulent Pst. Sequence analysis and mass spectrometry suggest that  NDR1 is localized to the PM via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)  anchor. GPI modification would potentially place NDR1 on the outer surface of the  PM, perhaps allowing NDR1 to act as a transducer of pathogen signals and/or  interact directly with the pathogen.', '2004 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02203.x', 'Staskawicz']
