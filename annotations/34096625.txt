Environmental conditions influence the use of different nitrogen (N) sources by plants. We hypothesized that an increase in light intensity favors the use of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ) relative to ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> ) by seedlings of neotropical tree species from different functional groups, that is, Cecropia pachystachya (a shade-intolerant species), Cariniana estrellensis (a shade-tolerant canopy species), and Guarea kunthiana (a shade-tolerant understory species). We analyzed the growth and N metabolism in seedlings simultaneously provided with NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> , under lower (LL) and higher (HL) light intensity. <sup>15</sup> N incorporation into amino acids was monitored after incubation with <sup>15</sup> N-labeled NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> or NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> . Under HL, all species showed decreased leaf area ratio, and increased growth, nitrate reductase activity and assimilated N content. Cecropia pachystachya increased the use of both N sources under HL, with substantial increases in <sup>15</sup> N-amino acids derived from <sup>15</sup> NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> (12.5- and 4.0-fold in roots and leaves, respectively) and <sup>15</sup> NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> (4.5- and 3.0-fold in roots and leaves, respectively). Guarea kunthiana showed the greatest plasticity in N use, as the assimilation of <sup>15</sup> NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> in roots and leaves increased substantially under HL (11.2- and 17.0-fold, respectively). Cariniana estrellensis increased the assimilation of <sup>15</sup> NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> in roots and <sup>15</sup> NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> in leaves under HL. Therefore, the responses of N use strategies to light intensity varied with the species according to their ecological characteristics.
