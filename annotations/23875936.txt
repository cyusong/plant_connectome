['23875936', 'The Arabidopsis genome contains seven members of Hsp90. Mutations in plastid  AtHsp90.5 were reported to cause defects in chloroplast development and  embryogenesis. However, the exact function of plastid AtHsp90.5 has not yet been  defined. In this study, albino seedlings were found among AtHsp90.5 transformed  Arabidopsis, which were revealed to be AtHsp90.5 co-suppressed plants. The  accumulation of photosynthetic super-complexes in the albinos was decreased, and  expression of genes involved in photosynthesis was significantly down-regulated.  AtHsp90.5 T-DNA insertion mutants were embryo-lethal with embryo arrested at the  heart stage. Further investigation showed AtHsp90.5 expression was up-regulated  in the siliques at 4 days post anthesis (DPA). Confocal microscopy proved  AtHsp90.5 was located in the chloroplasts. Plastid development in the AtHsp90.5  mutants and co-suppressed plants was seriously impaired, and few thylakoid  membranes were observed, indicating the involvement of AtHsp90.5 in chloroplast  biogenesis. AtHsp90.5 was found to interact with vesicle-inducing protein in  plastids 1 (VIPP1) by bimolecular fluorescence complementation system. The ratio  between VIPP1 oligomers and monomers in AtHsp90.5 co-suppressed plants  drastically shifted toward the oligomeric state. Our study confirmed that  AtHsp90.5 is vital for chloroplast biogenesis and embryogenesis. Further evidence  also suggested that AtHsp90.5 may help in the disassembly of VIPP1 for thylakoid  membrane formation and/or maintenance.', '2014 Feb', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/ppl.12083', 'Li']
