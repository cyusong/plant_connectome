The <i>NAC</i> gene family is one of the largest plant transcription factors (TFs) families and plays important roles in plant growth, development, metabolism, and biotic and abiotic stresses. However, <i>NAC</i> gene family has not been reported in passion fruit (<i>Passiflora edulis</i>). In this study, a total of 105 <i>NAC</i> genes were identified in the passion fruit genome and were unevenly distributed across all nine-passion fruit chromomere, with a maximum of 48 <i>PeNAC</i> genes on chromosome one. The physicochemical features of all 105 <i>PeNAC</i> genes varied including 120 to 3,052 amino acids, 3 to 8 conserved motifs, and 1 to 3 introns. The <i>PeNAC</i> genes were named (<i>PeNAC001-PeNAC105</i>) according to their chromosomal locations and phylogenetically grouped into 15 clades (NAC-a to NAC-o). Most PeNAC proteins were predicted to be localized in the nucleus. The <i>cis</i>-element analysis indicated the possible roles of <i>PeNAC</i> genes in plant growth, development, light, hormones, and stress responsiveness. Moreover, the <i>PeNAC</i> gene duplications including tandem (11 gene pairs) and segmental (12 gene pairs) were identified and subjected to purifying selection. All PeNAC proteins exhibited similar 3D structures, and a protein-protein interaction network analysis with known <i>Arabidopsis</i> proteins was predicted. Furthermore, 17 putative ped-miRNAs were identified to target 25 <i>PeNAC</i> genes. Potential TFs including <i>ERF</i>, <i>BBR-BPC</i>, <i>Dof</i>, and <i>bZIP</i> were identified in promoter region of all 105 <i>PeNAC</i> genes and visualized in a TF regulatory network. GO and KEGG annotation analysis exposed that <i>PeNAC</i> genes were related to different biological, molecular, and cellular terms. The qRT-PCR expression analysis discovered that most of the <i>PeNAC</i> genes including <i>PeNAC001, PeNAC003, PeNAC008, PeNAC028, PeNAC033, PeNAC058, PeNAC063</i>, and <i>PeNAC077</i> were significantly upregulated under <i>Fusarium kyushuense</i> and drought stress conditions compared to controls. In conclusion, these findings lay the foundation for further functional studies of <i>PeNAC</i> genes to facilitate the genetic improvement of plants to stress resistance.
