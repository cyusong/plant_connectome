Verticillium wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is one of the most devastating diseases in cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Lignin in the cell wall forms a physical barrier to inhibit pathogen invasion, and defense-induced lignification reinforces secondary cell wall to prevent pathogens from further spreading. Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs) catalyze the production of three main monolignols, <i>p</i>-coumaryl- (H), coniferyl- (G), and sinapyl-alcohols (S), which are the fundamental blocks of lignin. Here, we identified <i>CAD</i> genes in <i>G. hirsutum</i>, analyzed their expression profiles in cotton leaf, stem, and root from different developmental stages, and selected <i>GhCAD35</i>, <i>GhCAD45</i>, and <i>GhCAD43</i>, which were consistently induced by <i>V. dahliae</i> inoculation in <i>G. hirsutum</i> cultivars resistant or susceptible to <i>V. dahliae</i>. On the basis of confirmation of the <i>in vitro</i> enzymatic activity of the three proteins in generation of the three monolignols, we used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to investigate the effects of silencing of <i>GhCAD35</i>, <i>GhCAD45</i>, or <i>GhCAD43</i> on resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> as well as on deposition and the composition of lignin. Silencing each of the three <i>CAD</i>s impaired the defense-induced lignification and salicylic acid biosynthesis in stem, and compromised resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Moreover, our study showed that silencing the three <i>GhCAD</i>s severely affected the biosynthesis of S-lignin, leading to a decrease of the syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio. Heterogeneous overexpression of <i>GhCAD35</i>, <i>GhCAD45</i>, or <i>GhCAD43</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> enhanced disease resistance. Taken together, our study demonstrates a role of the three <i>GhCAD</i>s in defense-induced lignin biosynthesis and resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> in <i>G. hirsutum</i>.
