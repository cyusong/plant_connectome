['28077082', 'BACKGROUND: Plants respond to abiotic stress on physiological, biochemical and  molecular levels. This includes a global change in their cellular proteome  achieved by changes in the pattern of their protein synthesis and degradation.  The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a key player in protein degradation in  eukaryotes. Proteins are marked for degradation by the proteasome by coupling  short chains of ubiquitin polypeptides in a three-step pathway. The last and  regulatory stage is catalyzed by a member of a large family of substrate-specific  ubiquitin ligases. RESULTS: We have identified AtPUB46 and AtPUB48-two paralogous  genes that encode ubiquitin ligases (E3s)-to have a role in the plant  environmental response. The AtPUB46, -47, and -48 appear as tandem gene copies on  chromosome 5, and we present a phylogenetic analysis that traces their evolution  from an ancestral PUB-ARM gene. Single homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants of  AtPUB46 and AtPUB48 displayed hypersensitivity to water stress; this was not  observed for similar mutants of AtPUB47. Although the three genes show a similar  spatial expression pattern, the steady state levels of their transcripts are  differentially affected by abiotic stresses and plant hormones. CONCLUSIONS:  AtPUB46 and AtPUB48 encode plant U-Box E3s and are involved in the response to  water stress. Our data suggest that despite encoding highly homologous proteins,  AtPUB46 and AtPUB48 biological activity does not fully overlap.', '2017 Jan 11', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-016-0963-5', 'Bar-Zvi']
