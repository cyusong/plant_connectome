To understand complex responses of plant cells to low temperatures, suspension-cultured cells of Arabidopsis thaliana (line T87) were characterized during cold treatment. Freezing tolerance of cells collected at the lag or log phase was quite different: an increase in freezing tolerance during cold treatment was only detectable with cells at the lag phase. Although there were little differences in the osmolality of cells at the two growth phases, sugar content increased during cold treatment only in lag phase cells. Abscisic acid (ABA) content was greater at the lag phase than at the log phase throughout the cold treatment, and increased only in lag phase cells. Interestingly, ABA treatment resulted in an increase in freezing tolerance only in lag phase cells. Expression of cold-responsive genes such as DREB1A/CBF3, COR15a and RD29A occurred in cells at the two growth phases; however, the extent of the induction of COR15a and RD29A was somewhat greater in cells at the lag phase than at the log phase. Microarray analysis revealed that cold-regulated genes (COR genes) were categorized into three groups: up- or down-regulated consistently during cold treatment, transiently after 1 d and later after 2 d of cold treatment. Among genes that were up-regulated throughout or transiently after 1 d of cold treatment only in lag phase cells, functions in upstream of signal transduction such as kinase and transcription factor were often deduced. These results collectively suggest that these genes seem to be associated with induction of freezing tolerance by cold treatment in cells at the lag phase.
