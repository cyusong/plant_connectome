Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis Planch) is suitable for neutral acid soil. However, soil salinization is increasing in kiwifruit production areas, which has adverse effects on the growth and development of plants, leading to declining yields and quality. Therefore, analyzing the salt tolerance regulation mechanism can provide a theoretical basis for the industrial application and germplasm improvement of kiwifruit. We identified 120 NAC members and divided them into 13 subfamilies according to phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic analysis based on the conserved motifs, key amino acid residues in the NAC domain, expression patterns, and protein interaction network predictions and screened the candidate gene <i>AvNAC030</i>. In order to study its function, we adopted the method of heterologous expression in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Compared with the control, the overexpression plants had higher osmotic adjustment ability and improved antioxidant defense mechanism. These results suggest that <i>AvNAC030</i> plays a positive role in the salt tolerance regulation mechanism in kiwifruit.
