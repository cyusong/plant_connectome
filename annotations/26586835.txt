PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORs (PRRs) play overlapping and distinct roles in maintaining circadian rhythms and regulating diverse biological processes, including the photoperiodic control of flowering, growth, and abiotic stress responses. PRRs act as transcriptional repressors and associate with chromatin via their conserved C-terminal CCT (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-like, and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 [TOC1/PRR1]) domains by a still-poorly understood mechanism. Here, we identified genome-wide targets of PRR9 using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and compared them with PRR7, PRR5, and TOC1/PRR1 ChIP-seq data. We found that PRR binding sites are located within genomic regions of low nucleosome occupancy and high DNase I hypersensitivity. Moreover, conserved noncoding regions among Brassicaceae species are enriched around PRR binding sites, indicating that PRRs associate with functionally relevant cis-regulatory regions. The PRRs shared a significant number of binding regions, and our results indicate that they coordinately restrict the expression of target genes to around dawn. A G-box-like motif was overrepresented at PRR binding regions, and we showed that this motif is necessary for mediating transcriptional regulation of CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 and PRR9 by the PRRs. Our results further our understanding of how PRRs target specific promoters and provide an extensive resource for studying circadian regulatory networks in plants.
