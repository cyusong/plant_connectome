Traditional breeding for high-yielding crops has mainly relied on the widespread cultivation of gibberellin (GA)-deficient semi-dwarf varieties, as dwarfism increases lodging resistance and allows for high nitrogen use, resulting in high grain yield. Although the adoption of semi-dwarf varieties in rice and wheat breeding brought big success to the 'Green Revolution' in the 20th century, it consequently increased the demand for nitrogen-based fertilizer, which causes severe threat to ecosystems and sustainable agriculture. To make the 'Green Revolution' truly green, it is necessary to develop new varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Under this demand, research on NUE, mainly for rice, has made great strides in the last decade. This mini-review focuses on three aspects of recent epoch-making findings on rice breeding for high NUE. The first one on 'NUE genes related to GA signaling' shows how promising it is to improve NUE in semi-dwarf Green Revolution varieties. The second aspect centers around the nitrate transporter1.1B, NRT1.1B; studies have revealed a nutrient signaling pathway through the discovery of the nitrate-NRT1.1B-SPX4-NLP3 cascade. The last one is based on the recent finding that the teosinte branched1, cycloidea, proliferating cell factor (TCP)-domain protein 19 underlies the genomic basis of geographical adaptation to soil nitrogen; OsTCP19 regulates the expression of a key transacting factor, DLT/SMOS2, which participates in the signaling of four different phytohormones, GA, auxin, brassinosteroid and strigolactone. Collectively, these breakthrough findings represent a significant step toward breeding high-NUE rice in the future.
