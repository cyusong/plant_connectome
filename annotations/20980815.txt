The growth and development of plants is regulated by several external and internal factors including auxin. Its distribution regulates several developmental processes in plants. Auxin molecules function as mobile signals and are involved in the spatial and temporal coordination of plant morphogenesis and in plant responses to their environment. The intercellular transport of auxin is facilitated by transport proteins and the disruption of polar auxin flow results in various developmental abnormalities. In this review, we discuss the developmental and physiological significance of over-accumulation of PIN1 auxin transport facilitator protein in tomato as seen in the enhanced polar auxin transport pct1-2 mutant.
