['20573049', 'Three vacuolar cation/H+ antiporters, AtNHX1 (At5g27150), 2 (At3g05030) and 5  (At1g54370), have been characterized as functional Na+/H+ antiporters in  Arabidopsis. However, the physiological functions of AtNHX3 (At5g55470) still  remain unclear. In this study, the physiological functions of AtNHX3 were studied  using T-DNA insertion mutant and 35S-driven AtNHX3 over-expression Arabidopsis  plants. RT-PCR analyses revealed that AtNHX3 is highly expressed in germinating  seeds, flowers and siliques. Experiments with AtNHX3::YFP fusion protein in  tobacco protoplasts indicated that AtNHX3 is mainly localized to vacuolar  membrane, with a minor localization to pre-vacuolar compartments (PVCs) and  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Seedlings of null nhx3 mutants were hypersensitive to  K+-deficient conditions. Expression of AtNHX3 complemented the sensitivity to K+  deficiency in nhx3 seedlings. Tonoplast vesicles isolated from transgenic plants  over-expressing AtNHX3 displayed significantly higher K+/H+ exchange rates than  those isolated from wild-type plants. Furthermore, nhx3 seeds accumulated less K+  and more Na+ when both wild-type and nhx3 were grown under normal growth  condition. The overall results indicate that AtNHX3 encodes a K+/H+ antiporter  required for low-potassium tolerance during germination and early seedling  development, and may function in K+ utilization and ion homeostasis in  Arabidopsis.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02200.x', 'Zhang']
