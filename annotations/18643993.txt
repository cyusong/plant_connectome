['18643993', 'We used the chimeric Arabidopsis cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel AtCNGC11/12  to conduct a structure-function study of plant cyclic nucleotide-gated ion  channels (CNGCs). AtCNGC11/12 induces multiple pathogen resistance responses in  the Arabidopsis mutant constitutive expresser of PR genes 22 (cpr22). A genetic  screen for mutants that suppress cpr22-conferred phenotypes identified an  intragenic mutant, #73, which has a glutamate to lysine substitution (E519K) at  the beginning of the eighth beta-sheet of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain in  AtCNGC11/12. The #73 mutant is morphologically identical to wild-type plants and  has lost cpr22-related phenotypes including spontaneous cell death and enhanced  pathogen resistance. Heterologous expression analysis using a  K(+)-uptake-deficient yeast mutant revealed that this Glu519 is important for  AtCNGC11/12 channel function, proving that the occurrence of cpr22 phenotypes  requires active channel function of AtCNGC11/12. Additionally, Glu519 was also  found to be important for the function of the wild-type channel AtCNGC12.  Computational structural modeling and in vitro cAMP-binding assays suggest that  Glu519 is a key residue for the structural stability of AtCNGCs and contributes  to the interaction of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and the C-linker  domain, rather than the binding of cAMP. Furthermore, a mutation in the  alpha-subunit of the human cone receptor CNGA3 that causes total color blindness  aligned well to the position of Glu519 in AtCNGC11/12. This suggests that  AtCNGC11/12 suppressors could be a useful tool for discovering important residues  not only for plant CNGCs but also for CNGCs in general.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03619.x', 'Yoshioka']
