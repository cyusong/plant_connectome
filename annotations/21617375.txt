Phosphorus is one of the most essential and limiting macronutrients for plants. Phosphate (Pi) deficiency could affect crop productivity seriously in agriculture. How to cope with this problem? Unveiling the molecular mechanism behind the Pi starvation responses of plants will be helpful to solve this issue. Rice is one of the most important crops, which feeds over one-third of the people in the world. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on Pi starvation signaling in rice with the intention to provide a further insight into the molecular mechanism of Pi starvation responses in rice and to give a new research direction to design transgenic plants with high Pi efficiency.
