In many fruiting plant species, flower abscission is induced by low light stress. Here, we elucidated how signaling mediated by the peptide INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) controls low light-induced flower drop in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We analyzed the expression patterns of an IDA-Like gene (SlIDL6) during low light-induced flower abscission, and used tandem mass spectrometry to identify and characterize the mature SlIDL6 peptide. Tomato knockout lines were created to investigate the in vivo function of SlIDL6. In addition, yeast one-hybrid assays were used to investigate the binding of the SlWRKY17 transcription factor to the SlIDL6 promoter, and silencing of SlWRKY17 expression delayed low light-induced flower abscission. SlIDL6 was specifically expressed in the abscission zone and at high levels during low light-induced abscission and ethylene treatment. SlIDL6 knockout lines showed delayed low light-induced flower drop, and the application of SlIDL6 peptide accelerated abscission. Overexpression of SlIDL6 rescued the ida mutant phenotype in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), suggesting functional conservation between species. SlIDL6-mediated abscission was via an ethylene-independent pathway. We report a SlWRKY17-SlIDL6 regulatory module that functions in low light promoted abscission by increasing the expression of enzymes involved in cell wall remodeling and disassembly.
