['28633330', 'The soil-borne fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae infects a wide range of  dicotyledonous plants including cotton, tobacco, and Arabidopsis. Among the  effector proteins secreted by V. dahliae, the 16 kDa PevD1 induces a  hypersensitive response in tobacco. Here we report the high-resolution structure  of PevD1 with folds resembling a C2 domain-like structure with a calcium ion  bound to the C-terminal acidic pocket. A yeast two-hybrid screen, designed to  probe for molecular functions of PevD1, identified Arabidopsis asparagine-rich  protein (NRP) as the interacting partner of PevD1. Extending the pathway of V.  dahliae effects, which include induction of early flowering in cotton and  Arabidopsis, NRP was found to interact with cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), leading to  increased cytoplasmic accumulation of CRY2 in a blue light-independent manner.  Further physiological and genetic evidence suggests that PevD1 indirectly  activates CRY2 by antagonizing NRP functions. The promotion of CRY2-mediated  flowering by a fungal effector outlines a novel pathway by which an external  stimulus is recognized and transferred in changing a developmental program.', '2017 Jun 15', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erx192', 'Liu']
