Explicit proof for de novo origin of a rare post-illumination monoterpene burst and its consistency under low O <sub>2</sub> , shows interaction of photorespiration, photosynthesis, and isoprenoid biosynthesis during light-dark transitions. Quercus ilex L (holm oak) constitutively emits foliar monoterpenes in an isoprene-like fashion via the methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway located in chloroplasts. Isoprene-emitting plants are known to exhibit post-illumination isoprene burst, a transient emission of isoprene in darkness. An analogous post-illumination monoterpene burst (PiMB) had remained elusive and is reported here for the first time in Q. ilex. Using <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> labelling, we show that PiMB is made from freshly fixed carbon. PiMB is rare at ambient (20%) O<sub>2</sub>, absent at high (50%) O<sub>2</sub>, and becomes consistent in leaves exposed to low (2%) O<sub>2</sub>. PiMB is stronger and occurs earlier at higher temperatures. We also show that primary and secondary post-illumination CO <sub>2</sub> bursts (PiCO<sub>2</sub>B) are sensitive to O<sub>2</sub> in Q. ilex. The primary photorespiratory PiCO<sub>2</sub>B is absent under both ambient and low O<sub>2</sub>, but is induced under high (>50%) O<sub>2</sub>, while the secondary PiCO<sub>2</sub>B (of unknown origin) is absent under ambient, but present at low and high O<sub>2</sub>. We propose that post-illumination recycling of photorespired CO<sub>2</sub> competes with the MEP pathway for photosynthetic carbon and energy, making PiMB rare under ambient O<sub>2</sub> and absent at high O<sub>2</sub>. PiMB becomes consistent when photorespiration is suppressed in Q. ilex.
