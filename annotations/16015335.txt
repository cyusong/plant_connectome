['16015335', 'A significant proportion of the genomes of higher plants and vertebrates consists  of transposable elements and their derivatives. Autonomous DNA type transposons  encode a transposase that enables them to mobilize to a new chromosomal position  in the host genome by a cut-and-paste mechanism. As this is potentially  mutagenic, the host limits transposition through epigenetic gene silencing and  heterochromatin formation. Here we show that a transposase from Arabidopsis  thaliana that we named DAYSLEEPER is essential for normal plant growth; it shares  several characteristics with the hAT (hobo, Activator, Tam3) family of  transposases. DAYSLEEPER was isolated as a factor binding to a motif (Kubox1)  present in the upstream region of the Arabidopsis DNA repair gene Ku70. This  motif is also present in the upstream regions of many other plant genes. Plants  lacking DAYSLEEPER or strongly overexpressing this gene do not develop in a  normal manner. Furthermore, DAYSLEEPER overexpression results in the altered  expression of many genes. Our data indicate that transposase-like genes can be  essential for plant development and can also regulate global gene expression.  Thus, transposases can become domesticated by the host to fulfil important  cellular functions.', '2005 Jul 14', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature03667', 'Hooykaas']
