['16554362', 'The transition to flowering is tightly controlled by endogenous programs and  environmental signals. We found that MSI1 is a novel flowering-time gene in  Arabidopsis. Both partially complemented msi1 mutants and MSI1 antisense plants  were late flowering, whereas ectopic expression of MSI1 accelerated flowering.  Physiological experiments revealed that MSI1 is similar to genes from the  autonomous promotion of flowering pathway. Expression of most known  flowering-time genes did not depend on MSI1, but the induction of SOC1 was  delayed in partially complemented msi1 mutants. Delayed activation of SOC1 is  often caused by increased expression of the floral repressor FLC. However, MSI1  function is independent of FLC. MSI1 is needed to establish epigenetic H3K4  di-methylation and H3K9 acetylation marks in SOC1 chromatin. The presence of  these modifications correlates with the high levels of SOC1 expression that  induce flowering in Arabidopsis. Together, the control of flowering time depends  on epigenetic mechanisms for the correct expression of not only the floral  repressor FLC, but also the floral activator SOC1.', '2006 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02340', 'Hennig']
