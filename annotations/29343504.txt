Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process required for all cellular activities. Histone deacetylases play critical roles in many biological processes including transcriptional repression and rDNA silencing. However, their function in pre-rRNA processing remains poorly understood. Here, we discovered a previously uncharacterized role of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> histone deacetylase HD2C in pre-rRNA processing via both canonical and noncanonical manners. HD2C interacts with another histone deacetylase HD2B and forms homo- and/or hetero-oligomers in the nucleolus. Depletion of HD2C and HD2B induces a ribosome-biogenesis deficient phenotype and aberrant accumulation of 18S pre-rRNA intermediates. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that HD2C binds and represses the expression of key genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Using RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we further uncovered a noncanonical mechanism of HD2C directly associating with pre-rRNA and small nucleolar RNAs to regulate rRNA methylation. Together, this study reveals a multifaceted role of HD2C in ribosome biogenesis and provides mechanistic insights into how histone deacetylases modulate rRNA maturation at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.
