This study highlights the potential link between high light-induced canopy-level photosynthesis and mesophyll cell K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in tomato. Light is a primary energy source for photosynthesis and a vital regulator of mineral nutrient uptake and distribution in plants. Plants need to optimize photosynthesis and nutrient balance in leaves for performance in fluctuating light conditions that are partially regulated by light-induced ion homeostatsis in the mesophyll cells. It is still elusive whether high light-induced leaf mesophyll ion fluxes affect leaf photosynthesis at different canopy levels in Solanum lycopersicum L. Leaf gas exchange and microelectrode ion flux (MIFE) measurements were employed to study the effects of prolonged light-induced canopy-level leaf physiological responses of tomato plants. High light resulted in a significant lowering in photosynthesis in the fully-exposed top canopy leaves of tomato, but not to mid- or low-canopy leaves. Leaf mesophyll K<sup>+</sup> effluxes of all canopies were significantly decreased after three weeks of high light treatment. However, high light-induced leaf mesophyll Ca<sup>2+</sup> effluxes were significantly enhanced only in the top and mid canopies. Moreover, we found that photosynthetic parameters were significantly correlated with leaf mesophyll ion fluxes. We thus propose that canopy-level significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux and K<sup>+</sup> efflux of leaf mesophyll may serve as early indicators for light-induced regulation on photosynthesis. We conclude that light-induced differential photosynthetic performance and ion fluxes in leaves may implicate a requirement of more uniform light irradiance and spectra at different canopy levels of tall greenhouse tomato plants. This can be achieved through new innovative greenhouse lighting technologies and covering materials towards the enhancement of crop photosynthesis and yield.
