We report the growth promoting potential in wheat under saline conditions by an endophytic fungus <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> BTK-1. The isolated BTK-1 from the root of <i>Chenopodium album</i> was identified as <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> through 18S rDNA sequence analysis. BTK-1 secreted indole acetic acid (IAA), exhibited 1- aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylate deaminase (ACC) and siderophores activity, and solubilized phosphate. Wheat seedlings were exposed to a saline environment (0, 60, 120, and 180 mM) with or without BKT-1 inoculation. Seedlings inoculated with BTK-1 showed higher concentrations of IAA and gibberellins, whereas they showed low concentrations of abscisic acid compared to the BTK-1 non-inoculated plants. Also, BTK-1 inoculated wheat plants revealed significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.05) longer shoots and roots, biomass, and chlorophyll contents. On the contrary, plants without BTK-1 inoculation indicated significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.05) low amounts of carbohydrates, phenolics, prolines, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, with high amounts of Na and malonaldehyde under salt stress. Likewise, BTK-1 inoculated wheat plants showed high activity of reduced glutathione, and low activity of ascorbate, catalase, and peroxidase under salt stress. The mitigation of salinity stress by BTK-1 inoculated wheat plants suggested its use as a bio-stimulator in salt affected soils.
