Cultivated rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) is frequently exposed to multiple stresses, including <i>Schizotetranychus oryzae</i> mite infestation. Rice domestication has narrowed the genetic diversity of the species, leading to a wide susceptibility. This work aimed to analyze the response of two African rice species (<i>Oryza barthii</i> and <i>Oryza glaberrima</i>), weedy rice (<i>O. sativa</i> f. <i>spontanea</i>), and <i>O. sativa</i> cv. Nipponbare to <i>S. oryzae</i> infestation. Surprisingly, leaf damage, histochemistry, and chlorophyll concentration/fluorescence indicated that the African species present a higher level of leaf damage, increased accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and lower photosynthetic capacity when compared to <i>O. sativa</i> plants under infested conditions. Infestation decreased tiller number, except in Nipponbare, and caused the death of <i>O. barthii</i> and <i>O. glaberrima</i> plants during the reproductive stage. While infestation did not affect the weight of 1,000 grains in both <i>O. sativa</i>, the number of panicles per plant was affected only in <i>O. sativa</i> f. <i>spontanea</i>, and the percentage of full seeds per panicle and seed length were increased only in Nipponbare. Using proteomic analysis, we identified 195 differentially abundant proteins when comparing susceptible (<i>O. barthii</i>) and tolerant (Nipponbare) plants under control and infested conditions. <i>O. barthii</i> presents a less abundant antioxidant arsenal and is unable to modulate proteins involved in general metabolism and energy production under infested condition. Nipponbare presents high abundance of detoxification-related proteins, general metabolic processes, and energy production, suggesting that the primary metabolism is maintained more active compared to <i>O. barthii</i> under infested condition. Also, under infested conditions, Nipponbare presents higher levels of proline and a greater abundance of defense-related proteins, such as osmotin, ricin B-like lectin, and protease inhibitors (PIs). These differentially abundant proteins can be used as biotechnological tools in breeding programs aiming at increased tolerance to mite infestation.
