Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient in plants. However, excessive Mn absorption in acidic and waterlogged soils can lead to Mn toxicity. Despite their essential roles in Mn homeostasis, transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications of Mn transporters remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that high-Mn stress induces an obvious Ca<sup>2+</sup> signature in Arabidopsis. We identified four calcium-dependent protein kinases, CPK4/5/6/11, that interact with the tonoplast-localized Mn and iron (Fe) transporter MTP8 in vitro and in vivo. The cpk4/5/6/11 quadruple mutant displayed a dramatic high-Mn-sensitive phenotype similar to that of the mtp8 mutant. CPKs phosphorylated the N-terminal domain of MTP8 primarily at the Ser31 and Ser32 residues. Transport assays combined with multiple physiological experiments on phospho-dead variant MTP8<sup>S31/32A</sup> and phospho-mimetic variant MTP8<sup>S31/32D</sup> plants under different Mn and Fe conditions suggested that Ser31 and Ser32 are crucial for MTP8 function. In addition, genetic analysis showed that CPKs functioned upstream of MTP8. In summary, we identified a tonoplast-associated calcium signaling cascade that orchestrates Mn homeostasis and links Mn toxicity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and Mn transporters. These findings provide new insight into Mn homeostasis mechanisms and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in plants, providing potential targets for engineering heavy metal toxicity-tolerant plants.
