A new locus responsible for increased yield potential across the genetic background in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was identified and evaluated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were analysed for the ratio of filled grains, a yield component, in backcrossed inbred lines of a japonica 'Nipponbare'xindica 'Kasalath' cross for 3 years. Only one QTL (rg5), with a positive Kasalath allele, was detected across environments (years). The physiological functions of rg5 were clarified in a near-isogenic line (NILrg5) with a Kasalath chromosome segment containing rg5 in a Nipponbare genetic background. In NILrg5, carbohydrate storage capacity before heading or sink activity in the first or last stages of the reproductive phase was significantly higher than in Nipponbare (control). The ratio of filled grains and yield per plant were significantly higher in NILrg5 than in Nipponbare, by 5% (P <0.01) and 15% (P <0.05), respectively. These results suggest that rg5 improves carbohydrate storage capacity and keeps sink activity higher in the reproductive stage, and consequently increases yield potential. Greater capacity to accumulate carbohydrate is the main target for increasing rice yield potential; therefore, rg5 might function under other genetic backgrounds. Substitution of the rice cv. Kasalath chromosome segment containing rg5 gave higher yield potential in the top premium rice cv. Koshihikari. These results suggest that rg5 might be able to affect yield under different genetic backgrounds, and physiological analyses of the targeted locus might reveal these effects.
