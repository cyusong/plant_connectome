['29462792', "Various phytohormones control plant growth and development and mediate biotic and  abiotic stress responses. Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) acyl acid amido synthetases are  plant enzymes that typically conjugate amino acids to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)  or jasmonic acid (JA) to inactivate or activate these phytohormones,  respectively; however, the physiological and biological roles of many of these  enzymes remain unclear. Using a biochemical approach, we found that the  Arabidopsis thaliana GH3.15 (AtGH3.15) preferentially uses indole-3-butyric acid  (IBA) and glutamine as substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of the  AtGH3.15.AMP complex, modeling of IBA in the active site, and biochemical  analysis of site-directed mutants provide insight on active site features that  lead to AtGH3.15's preference for IBA. Assay-based in planta analysis of  AtGH3.15-overexpressing lines indicated that their root elongation and lateral  root density were resistant to IBA treatment but not to treatment with either IAA  or JA. These findings suggest that AtGH3.15 may play a role in auxin homeostasis  by modulating the levels of IBA for peroxisomal conversion to IAA. Analysis of  AtGH3.15 promoter-driven yellow fluorescent protein reporter lines revealed that  AtGH3.15 is expressed at significant levels in seedlings, roots, and parts of the  siliques. We conclude that AtGH3.15 is unique in the GH3 protein family for its  role in modifying IBA in auxin homeostasis and that it is the first GH3 protein  shown to primarily modify a plant growth regulator other than IAA and JA.", '2018 Mar 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.RA118.002006', 'Jez']
