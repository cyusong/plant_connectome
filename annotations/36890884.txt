Ammonium absorbed by roots is assimilated into amino acids. The glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase (glutamine 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase) (GS/GOGAT) cycle is essential to this biological process. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>GLN1;2</i> and <i>GLT1</i> are the <i>GS</i> and <i>GOGAT</i> isoenzymes induced in response to ammonium supply and playing key roles in ammonium utilization. Although recent studies suggest gene regulatory networks involved in transcriptional regulation of ammonium-responsive genes, direct regulatory mechanisms for ammonium-induced expression of <i>GS/GOGAT</i> remain unclear. In this study, we revealed that the expression of <i>GLN1;2</i> and <i>GLT1</i> in Arabidopsis is not directly induced by ammonium but is regulated by glutamine or post-glutamine metabolites produced by ammonium assimilation. Previously, we identified a promoter region required for ammonium-responsive expression of <i>GLN1;2</i>. In this study, we further dissected the ammonium-responsive region of the <i>GLN1;2</i> promoter and also performed a deletion analysis of the <i>GLT1</i> promoter, which led to the identification of a conserved ammonium-responsive region. Yeast one-hybrid screening using the ammonium-responsive region of the <i>GLN1;2</i> promoter as a decoy sequence revealed a trihelix family transcription factor DF1 that binds to this region. A putative DF1 binding site was also found in the ammonium-responsive region of the <i>GLT1</i> promoter.
