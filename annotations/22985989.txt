Caulogenesis in mature stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) cotyledons is promoted, to varying degrees depending on genotype, by exogenous application of the cytokinin (CK) benzyladenine (BA). In the present study, endogenous CK profiles of cotyledons from open-pollinated plants and two families of stone pine with widely differing organogenic capacities were monitored during caulogenesis and linked to previously characterized BA uptake and induction phases. Changes in levels of free bases, ribosides, ribotides and glucosides of both isoprenoid and aromatic CKs were followed. Before BA application, the pool of endogenous CKs in all sets of cotyledons was dominated by isoprenoid ribotides, but 1h after BA exposure, aromatic CKs (mainly active free bases and ribosides of topolins) accounted for more than 90% of the pool. BA N-glucosides were also observed, levels of which (and topolins) rose from 2d until the end of the (six-day) culture period. The CK profiles of the two selected pine families also differed, although the general trends were similar. During the first 6h, levels of BA and meta-topolin were highest in cotyledons from the family with the strongest caulogenic responses, while levels of ribotides and aromatic glucosides were highest in cotyledons from the other family.
