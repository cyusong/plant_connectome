In plant immunity, pathogen-activated intracellular nucleotide binding/leucine rich repeat (NLR) receptors mobilize disease resistance pathways, but the downstream signaling mechanisms remain obscure. Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) controls transcriptional reprogramming in resistance triggered by Toll-Interleukin1-Receptor domain (TIR)-family NLRs (TNLs). Transcriptional induction of the salicylic acid (SA) hormone defense sector provides one crucial barrier against biotrophic pathogens. Here, we present genetic and molecular evidence that in Arabidopsis an EDS1 complex with its partner PAD4 inhibits MYC2, a master regulator of SA-antagonizing jasmonic acid (JA) hormone pathways. In the TNL immune response, EDS1/PAD4 interference with MYC2 boosts the SA defense sector independently of EDS1-induced SA synthesis, thereby effectively blocking actions of a potent bacterial JA mimic, coronatine (COR). We show that antagonism of MYC2 occurs after COR has been sensed inside the nucleús but before or coincident with MYC2 binding to a target promoter, pANAC019. The stable interaction of PAD4 with MYC2 in planta is competed by EDS1-PAD4 complexes. However, suppression of MYC2-promoted genes requires EDS1 together with PAD4, pointing to an essential EDS1-PAD4 heterodimer activity in MYC2 inhibition. Taken together, these results uncover an immune receptor signaling circuit that intersects with hormone pathway crosstalk to reduce bacterial pathogen growth.
