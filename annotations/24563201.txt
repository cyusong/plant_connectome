['24563201', 'Autophagy-mediated turnover removes damaged organelles and unwanted cytoplasmic  constituents and thus plays critical roles in cellular housekeeping and nutrient  recycling. This "self eating" is tightly regulated by the AUTOPHAGY-RELATED1/13  (ATG1/13) kinase complex, which connects metabolic and environmental cues to the  vacuolar delivery of autophagic vesicles. Here, we describe the Arabidopsis  thaliana accessory proteins ATG11 and ATG101, which help link the ATG1/13 complex  to autophagic membranes. ATG11 promotes vesicle delivery to the vacuole but is  not essential for synthesizing the ATG12-ATG5 and ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine  adducts that are central to autophagic vesicle assembly. ATG11, ATG101, ATG1, and  ATG13 colocalize with each other and with ATG8, with ATG1 tethered to ATG8 via a  canonical ATG8-interacting motif. Also, the presence of ATG11 encourages  starvation-induced phosphorylation of ATG1 and turnover of ATG1 and ATG13. Like  other atg mutants, ATG11-deficient plants senesce prematurely and are  hypersensitive to nitrogen and fixed-carbon limitations. Additionally, we  discovered that the senescence-induced breakdown of mitochondria-resident  proteins and mitochondrial vesicles occurs via an autophagic process requiring  ATG11 and other ATG components. Together, our data indicate that ATG11 (and  possibly ATG101) provides important scaffolds connecting the ATG1/13 complex to  both general autophagy and selective mitophagy.', '2014 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.120014', 'Vierstra']
