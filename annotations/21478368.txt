Only a handful of endogenous peptide defense signals have been isolated from plants. Herein, we report a novel peptide from soybean (Glycine max) leaves that is capable of alkalinizing the media of soybean suspension cells, a response that is generally associated with defense peptides. The peptide, DHPRGGNY, was synthesized and found to be active at 0.25 nM and requiring only 5 to 10 min to obtain a maximal pH change. The peptide is located on the carboxy-terminal end of a 52-amino acid precursor protein (Glyma12g00990) deduced from the soybean genome project. A search of the soybean databank revealed a homolog (Glyma09g36370) that contained a similar peptide, DLPRGGNY, which was synthesized and shown to have identical activity. The peptides, designated GmPep914 (DHPRGGNY) and GmPep890 (DLPRGGNY), were capable of inducing the expression of both Glyma12g00990 (GmPROPEP914) and Glyma09g36370 (GmPROPEP890) in cultured soybean suspension cells within 1 h. Both peptides induced the expression of defense genes, including CYP93A1, a cytochrome P450 gene involved in phytoalexin synthesis, chitinaseb1-1, a chitinase involved in pathogen defense, and Glycine max chalcone synthase1 (Gmachs1), chalcone synthase, involved in phytoalexin production. Both GmPROPEP914 and GmPROPEP890 were highly expressed in the roots, relative to the aerial portions of the plant. However, treatment of the aerial portion of soybean plants with hormones involved in elicitation of defense responses revealed a significant increase in expression levels of GmPROPEP914 and GmPROPEP890. A search of gene databases revealed homologous sequences in other members of the Fabales and also in the closely related Cucurbitales but not in any other order of plants.
