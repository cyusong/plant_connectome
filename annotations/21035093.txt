['21035093', "Complex I (the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial respiratory  chain is a complicated, multi-subunit, membrane-bound assembly and contains more  than 40 different proteins in higher plants. In this paper, we characterize the  Arabidopsis homologue (designated as AtCIB22) of the B22 subunit of eukaryotic  mitochondrial Complex I. AtCIB22 is a single-copy gene and is highly conserved  throughout eukaryotes. AtCIB22 protein is located in mitochondria and the AtCIB22  gene is widely expressed in different tissues. Mutant Arabidopsis plants with a  disrupted AtCIB22 gene display pleiotropic phenotypes including shorter roots,  smaller plants and delayed flowering. Stress analysis indicates that the AtCIB22  mutants' seed germination and early seedling growth are severely inhibited by  sucrose deprivation stress but more tolerant to ethanol stress. Molecular  analysis reveals that in moderate knockdown AtCIB22 mutants, genes including cell  redox proteins and stress related proteins are significantly up-regulated, and  that in severe knockdown AtCIB22 mutants, the alternative respiratory pathways  including NDA1, NDB2, AOX1a and AtPUMP1 are remarkably elevated. These data  demonstrate that AtCIB22 is essential for plant development and mitochondrial  electron transport chains in Arabidopsis. Our findings also enhance our  understanding about the physiological role of Complex I in plants.", '2010 Oct', 'J Genet Genomics', '10.1016/S1673-8527(09)60085-0', 'Qu']
