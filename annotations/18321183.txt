In this study, we compared the transcriptional activities between Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)35S promoter and polyubiquitin (Ljubq1) promoter from Lotus japonicus using beta-glucuronidase (gus) reporter gene in transgenic plants of L. japonicus. The promoter analysis demonstrated that the Ljubq1 promoter possessed higher activity than the CaMV35S promoter in leaves, stems, roots, nodules, and pollen. Finally, we created GATEWAY conversion technology-compatible binary vectors for over-expression and RNA interference under the Ljubq1 promoter. These materials could provide alternative choice for studies in L. japonicus.

CaMV35S promoter: !less active than! Ljubq1 promoter
Ljubq1 promoter: !higher activity in! leaves, stems, roots, nodules, and pollen
GATEWAY conversion technology: !compatible with! binary vectors
binary vectors: !allow for! over-expression and RNA interference
