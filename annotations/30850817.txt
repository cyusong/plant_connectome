Successful double fertilization in flowering plants relies on two coordinated gamete fusion events, but the underlying molecular processes are not well understood. We show that two sperm-specific DOMAIN OF UNKNOWN FUNCTION 679 membrane proteins (DMP8 and DMP9) facilitate gamete fusion, with a greater effect on sperm-egg fusion than on sperm-central cell fusion. We also show that sperm adhesion and sperm cell separation depend on egg cell-secreted EGG CELL 1 proteins.

DMP8: !facilitates! gamete fusion
DMP9: !facilitates! gamete fusion
EGG CELL 1: !secretes! proteins
sperm: !adheres to! egg cell
sperm: !separates from! central cell
