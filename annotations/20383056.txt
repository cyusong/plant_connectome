Much of what we, as plant molecular biologists studying gene regulation, know comes from paradigms characterized or developed in mammalian systems. Although plants, animals, and fungi have been diverging for a very long time, a great deal of the machineries and components discovered in yeast and mammals seem to have been maintained in plants. Nevertheless, despite this apparent conservation, evolutionary pressures on the mechanisms of gene regulation are likely to be different between these kingdoms, given their different environmental constraints. As such, it is imperative for plant molecular biologists to develop their own paradigms, even on seemingly conserved systems. It is with this intent that we compare and contrast the regulation of two pathogenesis-related genes, the arabidopsis PR-1 and potato PR-10a genes. The transcription factors regulating these genes present prime paradigms for the study of plant signal- and context-dependent dual-function transcription factors.

Transcription Factors: !regulate! PR-1 and PR-10a genes
PR-1 and PR-10a genes: !are pathogenesis-related!
Yeast and Mammals: !maintain! Plant machineries and components
Evolutionary pressures: !differ between! Kingdoms 
Plant molecular biologists: !develop! Own paradigms
