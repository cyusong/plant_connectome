Plant pathogenic bacteria have developed effectors to manipulate host cell functions to facilitate infection. A certain number of effectors use the conserved ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotic to proteolyze targets. The proteasome utilization mechanism is mainly mediated by ubiquitin interaction with target proteins destined for degradation. Phyllogens are a family of protein effectors produced by pathogenic phytoplasmas that transform flowers into leaves in diverse plants. Here, we present a noncanonical mechanism for phyllogen action that involves the proteasome and is ubiquitin-independent. Phyllogens induce proteasomal degradation of floral MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs) in the presence of RADIATION-SENSITIVE23 (RAD23) shuttle proteins, which recruit ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. Intracellular localization analysis revealed that phyllogen induced colocalization of MTF with RAD23. The MTF/phyllogen/RAD23 ternary protein complex was detected not only in planta but also in vitro in the absence of ubiquitin, showing that phyllogen directly mediates interaction between MTF and RAD23. A Lys-less nonubiquitinated phyllogen mutant induced degradation of MTF or a Lys-less mutant of MTF. Furthermore, the method of sequential formation of the MTF/phyllogen/RAD23 protein complex was elucidated, first by MTF/phyllogen interaction and then RAD23 recruitment. Phyllogen recognized both the evolutionarily conserved tetramerization region of MTF and the ubiquitin-associated domain of RAD23. Our findings indicate that phyllogen functionally mimics ubiquitin as a mediator between MTF and RAD23.
