Protein degradation is essential in plant growth and development. The stability of Cullin3 substrate adaptor protein BPM1 is regulated by multiple environmental cues pointing on manifold control of targeted protein degradation. A small family of six MATH-BTB genes (BPM1-6) is described in Arabidopsis thaliana. BPM proteins are part of the Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and are known to bind at least three families of transcription factors: ERF/AP2 class I, homeobox-leucine zipper and R2R3 MYB. By targeting these transcription factors for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, BPMs play an important role in plant flowering, seed development and abiotic stress response. In this study, we generated BPM1-overexpressing plants that showed an early flowering phenotype, resistance to abscisic acid and tolerance to osmotic stress. We analyzed BPM1-GFP protein stability and found that the protein has a high turnover rate and is degraded by the proteasome 26S in a Cullin-dependent manner. Finally, we found that BPM1 protein stability is environmentally conditioned. Darkness and salt stress triggered BPM1 degradation, whereas elevated temperature enhanced BPM1 stability and accumulation in planta.
