Chromatin modifications are known to affect flowering time in plants, but little is known about how these modifications regulate flowering time in response to environmental signals like photoperiod. In Arabidopsis thaliana, HDC1, a conserved subunit of the RPD3-like histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, was previously reported to regulate flowering time via the same mechanism as does the HDAC HDA6. Here, we demonstrate that HDC1, SNLs and MSI1 are shared subunits of the HDA6 and HDA19 HDAC complexes. While the late-flowering phenotype of the hda6 mutant is independent of photoperiod, the hda19, hdc1 and snl2/3/4 mutants flower later than or at a similar time to the wild-type in long-day conditions but flower earlier than the wild-type in short-day conditions. Our genome-wide analyses indicate that the effect of hdc1 on histone acetylation and transcription is comparable with that of hda19 but is different from that of hda6. Especially, we demonstrate that the HDA19 complex directly regulates the expression of two flowering repressor genes related to the gibberellin signaling pathway. Thus, the study reveals a photoperiod-dependent role of the HDA19 HDAC complex in the regulation of flowering time.
