Polyamines are known to accumulate in response to stress. Compelling evidence indicate a protective role for polyamines during defense. However, signaling pathways underlying polyamine functions have not been fully elucidated. We recently found that the polyamine putrescine (Put) accumulates during effector triggered immunity (ETI). Treatment with Put triggered local and systemic transcriptional reprogramming partly overlapping with systemic acquired resistance (SAR) responses. In addition, Put treatment led to local salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and systemic defenses against virulent bacteria. Consistent with this, we found that Put signaling is mainly ROS dependent and partly compromised by <i>ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1</i> (<i>EDS1), SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2</i> (<i>SID2</i>) and <i>NONEXPRESSOR of PR GENES1</i> (NPR1) loss-of-function mutations. Here, we propose a preliminary model by which putrescine contributes to local and systemic defenses in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
