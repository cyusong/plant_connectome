['21134079', 'The trans Golgi network (TGN) of plant cells sorts and packages Golgi products  into secretory (SV) and clathrin-coated (CCV) vesicles. We have analyzed of TGN  cisternae in Arabidopsis root meristem cells by cell fractionation and electron  microscopy/tomography to establish reliable criteria for identifying TGN  cisternae in plant cells, and to define their functional attributes.  Transformation of a trans Golgi cisterna into a Golgi-associated TGN cisterna  begins with cisternal peeling, the formation of SV buds outside the plane of the  cisterna and a 30-35% reduction in cisternal membrane area. Free TGN compartments  are defined as cisternae that have detached from the Golgi to become independent  organelles. Golgi-associated and free TGN compartments, but not trans Golgi  cisternae, bind anti-RabA4b and anti-phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase (PI-4K)  antibodies. RabA4b and PI-4Kbeta1 localize to budding SVs in the TGN and to SVs en  route to the cell surface. SV and CCV release occurs simultaneously via cisternal  fragmentation, which typically yields  approximately 30 vesicles and one to four residual  cisternal fragments. Early endosomal markers, VHA-a1-green fluorescent protein  (GFP) and SYP61-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), colocalized with RabA4b in TGN  cisternae, suggesting that the secretory and endocytic pathways converge at the  TGN. pi4k1/pi4k2 knockout mutant plants produce SVs with highly variable sizes  indicating that PI-4Kbeta1/2 regulates SV size.', '2011 Mar', 'Traffic', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01146.x', 'Staehelin']
