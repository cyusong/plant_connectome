['15908594', 'Light and auxin control many aspects of plant growth and development in an  overlapping manner. We report here functional characterization of two closely  related ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter genes, AtMDR1 and AtPGP1, in light  and auxin responses. We showed that loss-of-function atmdr1 and atpgp1 mutants  display hypersensitivity to far-red, red, and blue-light inhibition of hypocotyl  elongation, reduced chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation, and abnormal  expression of several light-responsive genes, including CAB3, RBCS, CHS, and  PORA, under both darkness and far-red light conditions. In addition, we showed  that the atmdr1-100 and atmdr1-100/atpgp1-100 mutants are defective in multiple  aspects of root development, including increased root-growth sensitivity to  1-naphthalene acetic acid (1-NAA), and decreased sensitivity to  naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA)-mediated inhibition of root elongation. Consistent  with the proposed role of AtMDR1 in basipetal auxin transport, we found that  expression of the auxin responsive DR5::GUS reporter gene in the central  elongation zone is significantly reduced in the atmdr1-100 mutant roots treated  with 1-NAA at the root tips, compared to similarly treated wild-type plants.  Moreover, atmdr1-100, atpgp1-100, and their double mutants produced fewer lateral  roots, in the presence or absence of 1-NAA or NPA. The atmdr1-100 and  atmdr1-100/atpgp1-100 mutants also displayed enhanced root gravitropism.  Genetic-epistasis analysis revealed that mutations in phyA largely suppress the  randomized-hypocotyl growth and the short-hypocotyl phenotype of the atmdr1-100  mutants under far-red light, suggesting that phyA acts downstream of AtMDR1.  Together, our results suggest that AtMDR1 and AtPGP1 regulate Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) photomorphogenesis and multiple aspects of root  development by mediating polar auxin transport.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.061572', 'Wang']
