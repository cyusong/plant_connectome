['26742850', 'Cellular signaling through protein tyrosine phosphorylation is well established  in mammalian cells. Although lacking the classic tyrosine kinases present in  humans, plants have a tyrosine phospho-proteome that rivals human cells. Here we  report a novel plant tyrosine phosphatase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtRLPH2)  that, surprisingly, has the sequence hallmarks of a phospho-serine/threonine  phosphatase belonging to the PPP family.  Rhizobiales/Rhodobacterales/Rhodospirillaceae-like phosphatases (RLPHs) are  conserved in plants and several other eukaryotes, but not in animals. We  demonstrate that AtRLPH2 is localized to the plant cell cytosol, is resistant to  the classic serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin,  but is inhibited by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and is  particularly sensitive to inhibition by the adenylates, ATP and ADP. AtRLPH2  displays remarkable selectivity toward tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides versus  serine/threonine phospho-peptides and readily dephosphorylates a classic tyrosine  phosphatase protein substrate, suggesting that in vivo it is a tyrosine  phosphatase. To date, only one other tyrosine phosphatase is known in plants;  thus AtRLPH2 represents one of the missing pieces in the plant tyrosine  phosphatase repertoire and supports the concept of protein tyrosine  phosphorylation as a key regulatory event in plants.', '2016 Mar 11', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M115.683656', 'Moorhead']
