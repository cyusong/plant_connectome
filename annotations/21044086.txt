Endophytic bacteria have been shown to increase resistance against biotic stress and tolerance to abiotic stress in many plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an endophytic bacterium, Clavibacter sp. strain Enf12, in regenerated plantlets of Chorispora bungeana subjected to chilling stress (0°C). Aerial biomass and physiological markers for chilling stress, such as electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, proline content and activities of superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), guaiacol peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) and ascorbate peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.11), were assessed. We demonstrated that Clavibacter sp. strain Enf12 was capable of colonizing internal tissues of regenerated plantlets of C. bungeana and maintained stable population densities under both normal (20°C) and chilling (0°C) conditions. Inoculation enhanced plantlet growth under both conditions and significantly attenuated the chilling-induced electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation and ROS accumulation. The endophyte significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and proline content in C. bungeana plantlets under chilling stress. These findings suggest that Clavibacter sp. strain Enf12 inoculation stimulates the growth of C. bungeana plantlets and improves their tolerance to chilling stress through enhancing the antioxidant defense system.
