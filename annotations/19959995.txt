['19959995', 'Cytokinesis represents the final stage of eukaryotic cell division during which  the cytoplasm becomes partitioned between daughter cells. The process differs to  some extent between animal and plant cells, but proteins of the syntaxin family  mediate membrane fusion in the plane of cell division in diverse organisms. How  syntaxin localization is kept in check remains elusive. Here, we report that  localization of the Arabidopsis KNOLLE syntaxin in the plane of cell division is  maintained by sterol-dependent endocytosis involving a clathrin- and  DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN1A-dependent mechanism. On genetic or pharmacological  interference with endocytosis, KNOLLE mis-localizes to lateral plasma membranes  after cell-plate fusion. Fluorescence-loss-in-photo-bleaching and  fluorescence-recovery-after-photo-bleaching experiments reveal lateral diffusion  of GFP-KNOLLE from the plane of division to lateral membranes. In an  endocytosis-defective sterol biosynthesis mutant displaying lateral KNOLLE  diffusion, KNOLLE secretory trafficking remains unaffected. Thus, restriction of  lateral diffusion by endocytosis may serve to maintain specificity of syntaxin  localization during late cytokinesis.', '2010 Feb 3', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2009.363', 'Grebe']
