The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) fatty acid biosynthesis1 (fab1) mutant grows as well as wild type at 22 degrees C, but after transfer to 2 degrees C fab1 plants cannot maintain photosynthetic function and die after 5 to 7 weeks at 2 degrees C. A fab1 suppressor line, S7, was isolated in a screen that identified mutants that remained alive after 16 weeks at 2 degrees C and were able to flower and produce seed after return to 22 degrees C. Relative to wild type, S7 plants had reduced levels of 16:3 fatty acid in leaf galactolipids, indicating reduced synthesis of chloroplast glycerolipids by the prokaryotic pathway of lipid metabolism. The suppressor mutation was identified, by map-based and candidate-gene approaches, as a hypomorphic allele of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase1 (lpat1), lpat1-3. LPAT1 encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the second reaction in the prokaryotic pathway. Several lines of evidence indicate that damage and death of fab1 plants at 2 degrees C may be a result of the increased proportion of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in fab1 that are high-melting-point molecular species (containing only 16:0, 18:0, and 16:1,Delta3-trans fatty acids). Consistent with this proposal, the lpat1-3 mutation strongly affects the fatty acid composition of PG. The proportion of high-melting-point molecular species in PG is reduced from 48.2% in fab1 to 10.7% in fab1 lpat1-3 (S7), a value close to the 7.6% found in wild type.
