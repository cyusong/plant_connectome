Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Medicago truncatula and Nicotiana tabacum cell suspension cultures, responding to elicitation with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were used to analyse the suppressor (and elicitor) activity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the symbiotic soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. In order to identify the epitopes of the LPS molecule recognized by the plant, S. meliloti mutants defective in LPS biosynthesis and hydrolytically obtained Lipid A were analysed for biological activity. Lipopolysaccharides isolated from Sinorhizobium meliloti mutants 6963 (altered core region) and L994 (no long-chain fatty acid) showed the same ability to suppress the oxidative burst in host plant cell cultures as the wild-type LPS. Lipid A also displayed the same suppressor activity. By contrast, rhizobial LPS, but not Lipid A, was active as an inducer of the oxidative burst reaction in cell cultures of the nonhost Nicotiana tabacum. In host plants of Sinorhizobium meliloti the Lipid A part is sufficient to suppress the oxidative burst, but in non-host plants at least some sugars of the LPS core region are required to induce defence reactions.

LPS: !suppresses! oxidative burst in host plant cell cultures
LPS: !induces! defence reactions in non-host plants
Lipid A: !suppresses! oxidative burst in host plant cell cultures
Lipid A: !inactive as inducer! in non-host plants
