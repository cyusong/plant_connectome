Alternative splicing (AS) is a critical means by which plants respond to changes in the environment, but few splicing factors contributing to AS have been reported and functionally characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we explored the function and molecular mechanism of the spliceosome-associated protein OsFKBP20-1b during AS. We determined the AS landscape of wild-type and osfkbp20-1b knockout plants upon abscisic acid (ABA) treatment by transcriptome deep sequencing. To capture the dynamics of translating intron-containing mRNAs, we blocked transcription with cordycepin and performed polysome profiling. We also analyzed whether OsFKBP20-1b and the splicing factors OsSR34 and OsSR45 function together in AS using protoplast transfection assays. We show that OsFKBP20-1b interacts with OsSR34 and regulates its stability, suggesting a role as a chaperone-like protein in the spliceosome. OsFKBP20-1b facilitates the splicing of mRNAs with retained introns after ABA treatment; some of these mRNAs are translatable and encode functional transcriptional regulators of stress-responsive genes. In addition, interacting proteins, OsSR34 and OsSR45, regulate the splicing of the same retained introns as OsFKBP20-1b after ABA treatment. Our findings reveal that spliceosome-associated immunophilin functions in alternative RNA splicing in rice by positively regulating the splicing of retained introns to limit ABA response.
