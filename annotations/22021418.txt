['22021418', 'The Mediator (Med) complex relays regulatory information from DNA-bound  transcription factors to the RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. This macromolecular  unit is composed of three core subcomplexes in addition to a separable kinase  module. In this study, conservation of Meds has been investigated in 16 plant  species representing seven diverse groups across the plant kingdom. Using Hidden  Markov Model-based conserved motif searches, we have identified all the known  yeast/metazoan Med components in one or more plant groups, including the Med26  subunits, which have not been reported so far for any plant species. We also  detected orthologs for the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Med32, -33, -34,  -35, -36, and -37 in all the plant groups, and in silico analysis identified the  Med32 and Med33 subunits as apparent orthologs of yeast/metazoan Med2/29 and  Med5/24, respectively. Consequently, the plant Med complex appears to be composed  of one or more members of 34 subunits, as opposed to 25 and 30 members in yeast  and metazoans, respectively. Despite low similarity in primary Med sequences  between the plants and their fungal/metazoan partners, secondary structure  modeling of these proteins revealed a remarkable similarity between them,  supporting the conservation of Med organization across kingdoms. Phylogenetic  analysis between plant, human, and yeast revealed single clade relatedness for 29  Med genes families in plants, plant Meds being closer to human than to yeast  counterparts. Expression profiling of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis Med  genes reveals that Meds not only act as a basal regulator of gene expression but  may also have specific roles in plant development and under abiotic stress  conditions.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.188300', 'Tyagi']
