To tolerate phosphate (Pi) deficiency in the environment, plants alter their developmental and metabolic programs. In the past two decades, researchers have extensively used Petri dish-grown seedlings of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to study the molecular mechanisms underlying root developmental responses to Pi deficiency. A typical developmental response of the Petri dish-grown Arabidopsis seedlings to Pi deficiency is the inhibited growth of primary root (PR). This response is generally thought to enhance the production of lateral roots and root hairs, which increases the plant's ability to obtain Pi and is therefore regarded as an active cellular response. Here, we report that direct illumination of root surface with blue light is critical and sufficient for Pi deficiency-induced inhibition of PR growth in Arabidopsis seedlings. We further show that a blue light-triggered malate-mediated photo-Fenton reaction and a canonical Fenton reaction form an Fe redox cycle in the root apoplast. This Fe redox cycle results in the production of hydroxyl radicals that inhibit PR growth. In addition to revealing the molecular mechanism underlying Pi deficiency-induced inhibition of PR growth, our work demonstrated that this developmental change is not an active cellular response; instead, it is a phenotype resulting from root growth in transparent Petri dishes. This finding is significant because illuminated, transparent Petri dishes have been routinely used to study Arabidopsis root responses to environmental changes.
