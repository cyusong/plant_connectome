In some plants and animals, microtubules attach across the length of the chromosome in mitosis, forming a holocentromere instead of a single centromeric locus. A new study in Cell shows that in the holocentric beak sedge Rhynchospora, holocentromeres also impact genomic architecture, epigenome organization, and karyotype evolution.
