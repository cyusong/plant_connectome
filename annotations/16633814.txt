['16633814', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates essential growth and developmental  processes in plants. Recently, RNA-binding proteins have been described as  components of ABA signaling during germination. We have identified ten  ABA-regulated RNA-binding proteins in Arabidopsis seedlings. Among those genes,  AtCSP41B and cpRNP29 are highly expressed in seedlings. Using promoter:reporter  gene analyses, we showed that both AtCSP41B and cpRNP29 were in particular  expressed in photosynthetically active organs like green cotyledons, leaves, and  petioles. The analysis of CFP-fusion proteins demonstrates that cpRNP29 localized  to chloroplasts and AtCSP41B to chloroplasts and stromules. Whereas RNA-binding  of cpRNP29 has previously been shown, we demonstrated through in vitro  RNA-binding assays that recombinant AtCSP41B binds to RNA, and that chloroplast  petD RNA can serve as a target of AtCSP41B. Developmental or environmental  stimuli affected the expression of AtCSP41B and cpRNP29 in seedlings. Both genes  were repressed during senescence, but only AtCSP41B was significantly repressed  upon water stress. In addition, AtCSP41B and cpRNP29 exhibited low expression in  etiolated seedlings compared to green seedlings, and cpRNP29 was regulated during  the day photoperiod. Homozygous T-DNA insertion lines were isolated,  characterized on the molecular level, and monitored for phenotypic changes. Taken  together, the data show that both proteins are regulated during processes that  are known to involve ABA signaling. Their localization in chloroplasts and  RNA-binding activity suggest a role in chloroplast RNA metabolism in Arabidopsis  seedlings.', '2006 Sep', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-006-0282-4', 'Hoth']
