Local and systemic induction of JA-associated chemical defenses and resistance to western flower thrips in Chrysanthemum are spatially variable and dependent on the site of the JA application. Plants have evolved numerous inducible defense traits to resist or tolerate herbivory, which can be activated locally at the site of the damage, or systemically through the whole plant. Here we investigated how activation of local and systemic chemical responses upon exogenous application of the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) varies along the plant canopy in Chrysanthemum, and how these responses correlate with resistance to thrips. Our results showed that JA application reduced thrips damage per plant when applied to all the plant leaves or when locally applied to apical leaves, but not when only basal leaves were locally treated. Local application of JA to apical leaves resulted in a strong reduction in thrips damage in new leaves developed after the JA application. Yet, activation of a JA-associated defensive protein marker, polyphenol oxidase, was only locally induced. Untargeted metabolomic analysis further showed that JA increased the concentrations of sugars, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and some amino acids in locally induced basal and apical leaves. However, local application of JA to basal leaves marginally affected the metabolomic profiles of systemic non-treated apical leaves, and vice versa. Our results suggest that JA-mediated activation of systemic chemical defense responses is spatially variable and depends on the site of the application of the hormone in Chrysanthemum.
