Cytochrome c3 (uranyl reductase) from <i>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</i> can reduce uranium in bacterial cells and in cell-free systems. This gene was introduced in tobacco under control of the RbcS promoter, and the resulting transgenic plants accumulated uranium when grown on a uranyl ion containing medium. The uptaken uranium was detected by EM in chloroplasts. In the presence of uranyl ions in sublethal concentration, the transgenic plants grew phenotypically normal while the control plants' development was impaired. The data on uranium oxidation state in the transgenic plants and the possible uses of uranium hyperaccumulation by plants for environmental cleanup are discussed.
