Two highly similar plastidic NADP-malic enzymes (NADP-MEs) are found in the C(4) species maize (Zea mays); one exclusively expressed in the bundle sheath cells (BSCs) and involved in C(4) photosynthesis (ZmC(4)-NADP-ME); and the other (ZmnonC(4)-NADP-ME) with housekeeping roles. In the present work, these two NADP-MEs were analyzed regarding their redox-dependent activity modulation. The results clearly show that ZmC(4)-NADP-ME is the only one modulated by redox status, and that its oxidation produces a conformational change limiting the catalytic process, although inducing higher affinity binding of the substrates. The reversal of ZmC(4)-NADP-ME oxidation by chemical reductants suggests the presence of thiol groups able to form disulfide bonds. In order to identify the cysteine residues involved in the activity modulation, site-directed mutagenesis and MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) analysis of ZmC(4)-NADP-ME were performed. The results obtained allowed the identification of Cys192, Cys246 (not conserved in ZmnonC(4)-NADP-ME), Cys270 and Cys410 as directly or indirectly implicated in ZmC(4)-NADP-ME redox modulation. These residues may be involved in forming disulfide bridge(s) or in the modulation of the oxidation of critical residues. Overall, the results indicate that, besides having acquired a high level of expression and localization in BSCs, ZmC(4)-NADP-ME displays a particular redox modulation, which may be required to accomplish the C(4) photosynthetic metabolism. Therefore, the present work could provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms potentially involved in the recruitment of genes for the C(4) pathway during evolution.
