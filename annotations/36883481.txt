Plant diseases worsen the threat of food shortage with the growing global population, and disease recognition is the basis for the effective prevention and control of plant diseases. Deep learning has made significant breakthroughs in the field of plant disease recognition. Compared with traditional deep learning, meta-learning can still maintain more than 90% accuracy in disease recognition with small samples. However, there is no comprehensive review on the application of meta-learning in plant disease recognition. Here, we mainly summarize the functions, advantages, and limitations of meta-learning research methods and their applications for plant disease recognition with a few data scenarios. Finally, we outline several research avenues for utilizing current and future meta-learning in plant science. This review may help plant science researchers obtain faster, more accurate, and more credible solutions through deep learning with fewer labeled samples.
