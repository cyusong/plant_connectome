['16516937', 'Our work with almond peptide N-glycosidase A made us interested also in the  alpha1,3/4-fucosidase which is used as a specific reagent for glycoconjugate  analysis. The enzyme was purified to presumed homogeneity by a series of  chromatographic steps including dye affinity and fast-performance anion exchange  chromatography. The 63 kDa band was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry which  yielded several partial sequences. A homology search retrieved the hypothetical  protein Q8GW72 from Arabidopsis thaliana. This protein has recently been  described as being specific for alpha1,2-linkages. However, cDNA cloning and  expression in Pichia pastoris of the A. thaliana fucosidase showed that it  hydrolyzed fucose in 3- and 4-linkage to GlcNAc in Lewis determinants whereas  neither 2-linked fucose nor fucose in 3-linkage to the innermost GlcNAc residue  were attacked. This first cloning of a plant alpha1,3/4-fucosidase also confirmed  the identity of the purified almond enzyme and thus settles the notorious  uncertainty about its molecular mass. The alpha1,3/4-fucosidase from Arabidopsis  exhibited striking sequence similarity with an enzyme of similar substrate  specificity from Streptomyces sp. (Q9Z4I9) and with putative proteins from rice.', '2006 Apr', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.01.021', 'Altmann']
