AS events affect genes encoding protein domain composition and make the single gene produce more proteins with a certain number of genes to satisfy the establishment of photosynthesis during de-etiolation. The drastic switch from skotomorphogenic to photomorphogenic development is an excellent system to elucidate rapid developmental responses to environmental stimuli in plants. To decipher the effects of different light wavelengths on de-etiolation, we illuminated etiolated maize seedlings with blue, red, blue-red mixed and white light, respectively. We found that blue light alone has the strongest effect on photomorphogenesis and that this effect can be attributed to the higher number and expression levels of photosynthesis and chlorosynthesis proteins. Deep sequencing-based transcriptome analysis revealed gene expression changes under different light treatments and a genome-wide alteration in alternative splicing (AS) profiles. We discovered 41,188 novel transcript isoforms for annotated genes, which increases the percentage of multi-exon genes with AS to 63% in maize. We provide peptide support for all defined types of AS, especially retained introns. Further in silico prediction revealed that 58.2% of retained introns have changes in domains compared with their most similar annotated protein isoform. This suggests that AS acts as a protein function switch allowing rapid light response through the addition or removal of functional domains. The richness of novel transcripts and protein isoforms also demonstrates the potential and importance of integrating proteomics into genome annotation in maize.
