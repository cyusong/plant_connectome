Anthocyanins, a flavonoid group of polyphenolic compounds, have evolved in plants since the land was colonized by plants. These bioactive compounds play critical roles in diverse physiological processes. They are synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the vacuole for storage or to other destinations, where they function as bioactive molecules. The mechanisms of anthocyanin synthesis and transport have been well studied. However, the precise regulation of the mechanisms of anthocyanin degradation remains to be elucidated. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the understanding of the characteristics and functions of anthocyanins and class III peroxidases, as well as of the existing evidence of the effects of class III peroxidases on the degradation of anthocyanins and the possible regulatory mechanisms involved.
