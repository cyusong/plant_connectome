Translocation of metabolites between different plant species provides important hints in understanding the fate of bioactive root exudates. In the present study, targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was applied to elucidate the transfer of bioactive compounds between rye and several crops and weed species. Our results demonstrated that benzoxazinoids (BXs) synthesized by rye were taken up by roots of neighbouring plant species and translocated into their shoots. Furthermore, we showed that roots of rye plants took up compounds originating from neighbouring plants. Among the compounds taken up by rye roots, wogonin was detected in the rye shoot, which indicated a root-to-shoot translocation of this compound. Elucidating the transfer of bioactive compounds between plants is essential for understanding plant-plant interactions, developing natural pesticides and understanding their modes of action.
