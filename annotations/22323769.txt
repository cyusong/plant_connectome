['22323769', 'Unraveling the role of genes annotated as protein of unknown function is of  importance in progression of plant science. l-Galactono-1,4-lactone (l-GalL) is  the terminal precursor for ascorbic acid (AsA) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis  thaliana, and a previous study showed two DUF (domains of unknown function) 642  family genes (At1g80240 and At5g25460, designated as DGR1 and DGR2, respectively)  to be sensitive to it. In this work, leaves from wild-type Arabidopsis were fed  with d-glucose, l-galactose, l-GalL and AsA, and the expression level of the  At1g80240 and At5g25460 genes showed a specific response to l-GalL, but not to  the other supplements despite the increases of the tissue AsA contents. Analysis  of promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic plants showed the two genes to be  complementarily expressed at the root apex and in the rest of the root excluding  the apex, respectively, in both young and old seedlings, and to be expressed at  the leaf primordia. The GUS activity under the control of the At5g25460 promoter  was high in the cotyledon and leaf veins of young seedlings. These findings were  consistent with the results of quantitative real-time PCR. Interestingly, the  T-DNA insertion mutant of At5g25460 (SALK_125079) displayed shorter roots and  smaller rosettes than Col-0; however, no phenotypic difference was observed  between the T-DNA insertion mutant of At1g80240 and the wild type. This is the  first report on the expression and functional analysis of these two DUF642 family  genes, with the results revealing the contribution of DGR genes to the  development of Arabidopsis.', '2012 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcs014', 'Ishikawa']
