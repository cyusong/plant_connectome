The phytohormones jasmonates (JAs) act as important molecules of elicitors for the chlorophyll degradation and anthocyanin biosynthesis. JAs do usually not act independently but integrate in complex networks linking to other hormonal signaling transduction. Here, the crosstalk was detected between the JAs (jasmonic acid) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways in the mediation of chlorophyll degradation and anthocyanin biosynthesis. In this study, we found that the ABA receptor mutants, <i>pyr1pyl1pyl2pyl4</i> (1124) and <i>pyr1pyl1ply2pyl4pyl5pyl8</i> (112458) showed less level of chlorophyll and anthocyanin than the wild-type plants, while gain-of-function of <i>RCAR13</i> transgenic lines inhibited chlorophyll degradation and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation after MeJA treatment. The amidohydrolases, including <i>ILL6</i> and <i>IAR3</i> and cytochrome P450 (<i>CYP94B3</i>), encoding JA-Ile catabolism were markedly depressed by ABA receptors. While transcripts of the enzymes for activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were analyzed, the results indicating that JA biosynthetic genes, including allene oxide synthase (<i>AOS), LOX3</i> and <i>LOX4</i> were enhanced by the link of JAs and ABA receptors. Moreover, the ABA receptors are also involved in JAs signal transduction through the regulation of <i>COI, JAZ</i> and <i>MYC2</i> transcripts. These findings elucidate a connection between a core component of the ABA signaling pathway and JA responses.
