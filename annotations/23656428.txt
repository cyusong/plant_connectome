Aquaporins are thought to be associated with water transport and play important roles in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibre elongation. Among aquaporins, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) constitute a plasma-membrane-specific subfamily and are further subdivided into PIP1 and PIP2 groups. In this study, four fibre-preferential GhPIP2 genes were functionally characterized. The selective interactions among GhPIP2s and their interaction proteins were studied in detail to elucidate the molecular mechanism of cotton fibre development. GhPIP2;3 interacted with GhPIP2;4 and GhPIP2;6, but GhPIP2;6 did not interact with GhPIP2;4. Coexpression of GhPIP2;3/2;4 or GhPIP2;3/2;6 resulted in a positive cooperative effect which increased the permeability coefficient of oocytes, while GhPIP2;4/2;6 did not. GhBCP2 (a blue copper-binding protein) inhibited GhPIP2;6 water channel activity through their interaction. Overexpression of GhPIP2 genes in yeast induced longitudinal growth of the host cells. By contrast, knockdown of expression of GhPIP2 genes in cotton by RNA interference markedly hindered fibre elongation. In conclusion, GhPIP2 proteins are the primary aquaporin isoforms in fibres. They selectively form hetero-oligomers in order to regulate their activities to meet the requirements for rapid fibre elongation.
