In animals, early embryogenesis is maternally controlled, whereas in plants, parents contribute equally to the proembryo transcriptome. Thus, the question remains whether equivalent parental contribution to the transcriptome of the early proembryo means equal control of early embryogenesis. Here, on the basis of cell-lineage-specific and allele-specific transcriptome analysis, we reveal that paternal and maternal genomes contribute equally to the transcriptomes of both the apical cell lineage and the basal cell lineage of early proembryos. However, a strong maternal effect on basal cell lineage development was found, indicating that equal parental contribution to the transcriptome is not necessarily coupled with equivalent parental control of proembryonic development. Parental contributions to embryogenesis therefore cannot be concluded solely on the basis of the ratio of paternal/maternal transcripts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that parent-of-origin genes display developmental-stage-dependent and cell-lineage-dependent allelic expression patterns. These findings will facilitate the investigation of specific parental roles in specific processes of early embryogenesis.
