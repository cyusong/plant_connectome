Syncytial cells in soybean (Glycine max cultivar [cv.] Peking) roots infected by incompatible and compatible populations of soybean cyst nematode (SCN [Heterodera glycines]) were collected using laser capture microdissection (LCM). Gene transcript abundance was assayed using Affymetrix soybean GeneChips, each containing 37,744 probe sets. Our analyses identified differentially expressed genes in syncytial cells that are not differentially expressed in the whole root analyses. Therefore, our results show that the mass of transcriptional activity occurring in the whole root is obscuring identification of transcriptional events occurring within syncytial cells. In syncytial cells from incompatible roots at three dpi, genes encoding lipoxygenase (LOX), heat shock protein (HSP) 70, superoxidase dismutase (SOD) were elevated almost tenfold or more, while genes encoding several transcription factors and DNA binding proteins were also elevated, albeit at lower levels. In syncytial cells formed during the compatible interaction at three dpi, genes encoding prohibitin, the epsilon chain of ATP synthase, allene oxide cyclase and annexin were more abundant. By 8 days, several genes of unknown function and genes encoding a germin-like protein, peroxidase, LOX, GAPDH, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptolosonate 7-phosphate synthase, ATP synthase and a thioesterase were abundantly expressed. These observations suggest that gene expression is different in syncytial cells as compared to whole roots infected with nematodes. Our observations also show that gene expression is different between syncytial cells that were isolated from incompatible and compatible roots and that gene expression is changing over the course of syncytial cell development as it matures into a functional feeding site.
