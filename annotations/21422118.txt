['21422118', 'Plant cell walls are complex structures that offer structural and mechanical  support to plant cells and are ultimately responsible for plant architecture and  form. Pectins are a large group of complex polysaccharides of the plant cell wall  that are made in the Golgi and secreted to the wall. The methylesterification of  pectins is believed to be an important factor for the dynamic properties of the  cell wall. Here, we report on a protein of unknown function discovered using an  extensive proteomics analysis of cotton Golgi. Through bioinformatic analyses, we  identified the ortholog of such protein, here named cotton Golgi-related 3 (CGR3)  in Arabidopsis and found that it shares conserved residues with  S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferases. We established that CGR3 is localized at  the Golgi apparatus and that the expression of the CGR3 gene is correlated with  that of several cell wall biosynthetic genes, suggesting a possible role of the  protein in pectin modifications. Consistent with this hypothesis,  immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies for homogalacturonan pectins (HG)  indicated that the cell walls of cgr3 knockout mutants and plants overexpressing  CGR3 are decreased and increased in HG methylesterification, respectively. Our  results suggest that CGR3 plays a role in the methylesterification of  homogalacturonan in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Sep', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssr012', 'Brandizzi']
