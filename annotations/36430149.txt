In situ extraction is a method for separating plant secondary metabolites from in vitro systems of plant biomass cultures. The study aimed to investigate the MTMS-based xerogels morphology effect on the growth kinetics and deoxyshikonin productivity in xerogel-supported in vitro culture systems of <i>Rindera graeca</i> hairy root. Cultures were supplemented with three types of xerogel, i.e., mesoporous gel, microporous gel, and agglomerated precipitate, in the disintegrated or monolithic form. Structure, oil sorption capacity, and SEM analyses for xerogel-based additives were performed. Application of monolithic macroporous xerogel resulted in the highest biomass proliferation, i.e., 5.11-fold fresh biomass increase after four weeks of the screening culture. The highest deoxyshikonin production (i.e., 105.03 µg) was noted when hairy roots were maintained with particles of disintegrated mesoporous xerogel. The detailed kinetics investigations (6-week culture) revealed the highest growth of hairy root biomass and secondary metabolite production, equaling 9.46-fold fresh weight biomass and 204.08 µg deoxyshikonin, respectively. MTMS-based xerogels have been recognized as selective biocompatible scaffolds for boosting the proliferation of transgenic roots or for productivity enhancement of naphthoquinones without detrimental effects on biomass growth, and their successful applicability in in situ removal of secondary plant metabolites has been experimentally confirmed.
