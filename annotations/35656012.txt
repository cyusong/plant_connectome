The cultivation medium of <i>Dendrobium nobile</i> has an effect on the contents of its main medicinal components, but the specific mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the callus, seedlings, rhizomes, and leaves of <i>D. nobile</i> were sequenced for the PacBio SMRT. The 2-year-old stems were selected for the Illumina sequencing and metabolome sequencing to analyze the genetic mechanism of metabolic differences under different epiphytic patterns. As a result, a total of 387 differential genes were obtained, corresponding to 66 differential metabolites. Different epiphytic patterns can induce a series of metabolic changes at the metabolome and transcriptome levels of <i>D. nobile</i>, including flavonoid metabolism, purine metabolism, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolic, and related regulatory genes include <i>ALDH2B7, ADC, EPSPS-1, SHKA, DHAPS-1, GES, ACS1, SAHH, ACS2, CHLP, LOX2, LOX2.3</i>, and <i>CYP74B2</i>. The results showed that the genetic mechanism of <i>D. nobile</i> under various epiphytic patterns was different. In theory, the content of metabolites under the epiphytic patterns of Danxia stone is higher, which is more suitable for field cultivation.
