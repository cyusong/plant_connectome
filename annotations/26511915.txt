MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs that repress target gene expression posttranscriptionally, and are critically involved in various developmental processes and responses to environmental stresses in eukaryotes. MiRNA857 is not widely distributed in plants and is encoded by a single gene, AtMIR857, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The functions of miR857 and its mechanisms in regulating plant growth and development are still unclear. Here, by means of genetic analysis coupled with cytological studies, we investigated the expression pattern and regulation mechanism of miR857 and its biological functions in Arabidopsis development. We found that miR857 regulates its target gene, Arabidopsis LACCASE7, at the transcriptional level, thereby reducing laccase activity. Using stimulated Raman scattering and x-ray microtomography three-dimensional analyses, we showed that miR857 was involved in the regulation of lignin content and consequently morphogenesis of the secondary xylem. In addition, miR857 was activated by SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 in response to low copper conditions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the role of miR857 in the regulation of secondary growth of vascular tissues in Arabidopsis and reveal a unique control mechanism for secondary growth based on the miR857 expression in response to copper deficiency.
