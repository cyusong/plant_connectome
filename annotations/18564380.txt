The fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis establishes a biotrophic relationship with its host plant maize (Zea mays). Hallmarks of the disease are large plant tumours in which fungal proliferation occurs. Previous studies suggested that classical defence pathways are not activated. Confocal microscopy, global expression profiling and metabolic profiling now shows that U. maydis is recognized early and triggers defence responses. Many of these early response genes are downregulated at later time points, whereas several genes associated with suppression of cell death are induced. The interplay between fungus and host involves changes in hormone signalling, induction of antioxidant and secondary metabolism, as well as the prevention of source leaf establishment. Our data provide novel insights into the complexity of a biotrophic interaction.
