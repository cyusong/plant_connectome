The etiolation process, which occurs after germination, is terminated once light is perceived and then de-etiolation commences. During the de-etiolation period, monochromatic lights (blue, red and far-red) induce differences in gene expression profiles and plant behavior through their respective photoreceptors. ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), a bZIP-type transcription factor (TF), regulates gene expression in the de-etiolation process, and other bZIP TFs are also involved in this regulation. However, transcriptomic changes that occur in etiolated seedlings upon monochromatic light irradiation and the relationship with the bZIP TFs still remain to be elucidated. Here, we track changes in the transcriptome after exposure to white, blue, red and far-red light following darkness and reveal both shared and non-shared trends of transcriptomic change between the four kinds of light. Interestingly, after exposure to light, <i>HY5</i> expression synchronized with those of the related bZIP TF genes, <i>GBF2</i> and <i>GBF3</i>, rather than <i>HY5 HOMOLOG</i> (<i>HYH</i>). To speculate on the redundancy of target genes between the bZIP TFs, we inspected the genome-wide physical binding sites of homodimers of seven bZIP TFs, HY5, HYH, GBF1, GBF2, GBF3, GBF4 and EEL, using an in vitro binding assay. The results reveal large overlaps of target gene candidates, indicating a complicated regulatory literature among TFs. This work provides novel insight into understanding the regulation of gene expression of the plant response to monochromatic light irradiation.
