The availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi) for ATP synthesis is thought to limit photosynthesis at elevated [CO2] when Pi regeneration via sucrose or starch synthesis is limited. We report here another mechanism for the occurrence of Pi-limited photosynthesis caused by insufficient capacity of chloroplast triose phosphate isomerase (cpTPI). In cpTPI-antisense transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants with 55%-86% reductions in cpTPI content, CO2 sensitivity of the rate of CO2 assimilation (A) decreased and even reversed at elevated [CO2]. The pool sizes of the Calvin-Benson cycle metabolites from pentose phosphates to 3-phosphoglycerate increased at elevated [CO2], whereas those of ATP decreased. These phenomena are similar to the typical symptoms of Pi-limited photosynthesis, suggesting sufficient capacity of cpTPI is necessary to prevent the occurrence of Pi-limited photosynthesis and that cpTPI content moderately affects photosynthetic capacity at elevated [CO2]. As there tended to be slight variations in the amounts of total leaf-N depending on the genotypes, relationships between A and the amounts of cpTPI were examined after these parameters were expressed per unit amount of total leaf-N (A/N and cpTPI/N, respectively). A/N at elevated [CO2] decreased linearly as cpTPI/N decreased before A/N sharply decreased, owing to further decreases in cpTPI/N. Within this linear range, decreases in cpTPI/N by 80% led to decreases up to 27% in A/N at elevated [CO2]. Thus, cpTPI function is crucial for photosynthesis at elevated [CO2].
