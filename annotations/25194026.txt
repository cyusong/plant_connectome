['25194026', 'Photosynthetic light harvesting in plants is regulated by phosphorylation-driven  state transitions: functional redistributions of the major trimeric  light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to balance the relative excitation of  photosystem I and photosystem II. State transitions are driven by reversible  LHCII phosphorylation by the STN7 kinase and PPH1/TAP38 phosphatase. LHCII  trimers are composed of Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3 proteins in various trimeric  configurations. Here, we show that despite their nearly identical amino acid  composition, the functional roles of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 are different but  complementary. Arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking only Lhcb2 contain thylakoid  protein complexes similar to wild-type plants, where Lhcb2 has been replaced by  Lhcb1. However, these do not perform state transitions, so phosphorylation of  Lhcb2 seems to be a critical step. In contrast, plants lacking Lhcb1 had a more  profound antenna remodeling due to a decrease in the amount of LHCII trimers  influencing thylakoid membrane structure and, more indirectly, state transitions.  Although state transitions are also found in green algae, the detailed  architecture of the extant seed plant light-harvesting antenna can now be dated  back to a time after the divergence of the bryophyte and spermatophyte lineages,  but before the split of the angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages more than 300  million years ago.', '2014 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.127373', 'ORCID:']
