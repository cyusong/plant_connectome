Nitric oxide (NO) is emerging as a key signalling molecule in plants. The chief mechanism for the transfer of NO bioactivity is thought to be S-nitrosylation, the addition of an NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). The enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) indirectly controls the total levels of cellular S-nitrosylation, by depleting S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the major cellular NO donor. Here we show that depletion of GSNOR function impacts tomato (Solanum lycopersicum. L) fruit development. Thus, reduction of GSNOR expression through RNAi modulated both fruit formation and yield, establishing a novel function for GSNOR. Further, depletion of S. lycopersicum GSNOR (SlGSNOR) additionally impacted a number of other developmental processes, including seed development, which also has not been previously linked with GSNOR activity. In contrast to Arabidopsis, depletion of GSNOR function did not influence root development. Further, reduction of GSNOR transcript abundance compromised plant immunity. Surprisingly, this was in contrast to previous data in Arabidopsis that reported that reducing Arabidopsis thaliana GSNOR (AtGSNOR) expression by antisense technology increased disease resistance. We also show that increased SlGSNOR expression enhanced pathogen protection, uncovering a potential strategy to enhance disease resistance in crop plants. Collectively, our findings reveal, at the genetic level, that some but not all GSNOR activities are conserved outside the Arabidopsis reference system. Thus, manipulating the extent of GSNOR expression may control important agricultural traits in tomato and possibly other crop plants.
