['11602264', 'Using in vitro import assays into purified mitochondria and chloroplasts we found  that Arabidopsis ferrochelatase-I and ferrochelatase-II were not imported into  mitochondria purified from Arabidopsis (or several other plants) but were  imported into pea leaf chloroplasts. Other dual targeted proteins could be  imported into purified mitochondria from Arabidopsis. As only two ferrochelatase  genes are present in the completed Arabidopsis genome, the presence of  ferrochelatase activity in plant mitochondria needs to be re-evaluated. Previous  reports of Arabidopsis ferrochelatase-I import into pea mitochondria are due to  the fact that pea leaf (and root) mitochondria appear to import a variety, but  not all chloroplast proteins. Thus pea mitochondria are not a suitable system to  either study dual targeting, or to distinguish between isozymes present in  mitochondria and chloroplasts.', '2001 Oct 12', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(01)02925-8', 'Whelan']
