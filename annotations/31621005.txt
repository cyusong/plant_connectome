Short review focussing on the role and targeting of vacuolar substructure in plant immunity and pathogenesis. Plants lack specialized immune cells, therefore each plant cell must defend itself against invading pathogens. A typical plant defense strategy is the hypersensitive response that results in host cell death at the site of infection, a process largely regulated by the vacuole. In plant cells, the vacuole is a vital organelle that plays a central role in numerous fundamental processes, such as development, reproduction, and cellular responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli. It shows divergent membranous structures that are continuously transforming. Recent technical advances in visualization and live-cell imaging have significantly altered our view of the vacuolar structures and their dynamics. Understanding the active nature of the vacuolar structures and the mechanisms of vacuole-mediated defense responses is of great importance in understanding plant-pathogen interactions. In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge about the vacuole and its internal structures, as well as their role in plant-microbe interactions. There is so far limited information on the modulation of the vacuolar structures by pathogens, but recent research has identified the vacuole as a possible target of microbial interference.
