['15619622', 'The maternally expressed Arabidopsis thaliana Polycomb group protein MEDEA (MEA)  controls expression of the MADS-box gene PHERES1 (PHE1). Here, we show that PHE1  is mainly paternally expressed but maternally repressed and that this maternal  repression of PHE1 breaks down in seeds lacking maternal MEA activity. Because  Polycomb group proteins control parental imprinting in mammals as well, the  independent recruitment of similar protein machineries for the imprinting of  genes is a notable example of convergent evolution.', '2005 Jan', 'Nat Genet', '10.1038/ng1495', 'Grossniklaus']
