['24906355', 'The major plant polyamines (PAs) are the tetraamines spermine (Spm) and  thermospermine (T-Spm), the triamine spermidine, and the diamine putrescine. PA  homeostasis is governed by the balance between biosynthesis and catabolism; the  latter is catalyzed by polyamine oxidase (PAO). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) has five PAO genes, AtPAO1 to AtPAO5, and all encoded proteins have  been biochemically characterized. All AtPAO enzymes function in the  back-conversion of tetraamine to triamine and/or triamine to diamine, albeit with  different PA specificities. Here, we demonstrate that AtPAO5 loss-of-function  mutants (pao5) contain 2-fold higher T-Spm levels and exhibit delayed transition  from vegetative to reproductive growth compared with that of wild-type plants.  Although the wild type and pao5 are indistinguishable at the early seedling  stage, externally supplied low-dose T-Spm, but not other PAs, inhibits aerial  growth of pao5 mutants in a dose-dependent manner. Introduction of wild-type  AtPAO5 into pao5 mutants rescues growth and reduces the T-Spm content,  demonstrating that AtPAO5 is a T-Spm oxidase. Recombinant AtPAO5 catalyzes the  conversion of T-Spm and Spm to triamine spermidine in vitro. AtPAO5 specificity  for T-Spm in planta may be explained by coexpression with T-Spm synthase but not  with Spm synthase. The pao5 mutant lacking T-Spm oxidation and the acl5 mutant  lacking T-Spm synthesis both exhibit growth defects. This study indicates a  crucial role for T-Spm in plant growth and development.', '2014 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.242610', 'Kusano']
