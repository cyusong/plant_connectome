Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are proton pumps for proton translocation across membranes that utilize energy derived from ATP hydrolysis; OsV-ATPase subunit d (OsV-ATPase d) is part of an integral, membrane-embedded V0 complex in the V-ATPase complex. Whether OsV-ATPase d is involved in phytohormone biosynthesis and resistance in rice remains unknown. The knockout mutants of <i>OsV-ATPase d</i> in rice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and mutation of <i>OsV-ATPase d</i> did not show any detrimental effect on plant growth or yield productivity. Transcriptomic results showed that <i>OsV-ATPase d</i> is probably involved in mediating the biosynthesis of plant hormones and resistance in rice. Compared to wild type, mutation of <i>OsV-ATPase d</i> significantly increased JA and ABA biosynthesis and resistance against <i>Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus</i> (SRBSDV), but it decreased resistance against <i>Rice stripe virus</i> (RSV) in rice. The data presented in this study reveal that <i>OsV-ATPase d</i> mediates phytohormone biosynthesis and virus resistance in rice and can be selected as a potential target for resistance breeding in rice.
