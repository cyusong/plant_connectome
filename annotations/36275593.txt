Flowering time is crucial for the survival and reproduction. <i>Prunus</i> genus belongs to the Rosaceae family and includes several hundred species of flowering trees and shrubs with important ornamental and economic values. However, the molecular mechanism underlying early flowering in <i>Prunus</i> genus is unclear. Here, we utilized the genome and transcriptome of <i>P. mume</i> and <i>P. persica</i> to explore the transcriptional regulation mechanism of early flowering. Comparative genomics found that genes accounting for 92.4% of the total <i>P. mume</i> genome and 91.2% of the total <i>P. persica</i> genome belonged to orthogroups. A total of 19,169 orthogroups were found between <i>P. mume</i> and <i>P. persica</i>, including 20,431 corresponding orthologues and 20,080 collinearity gene pairs. A total of 305 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with early flowering were found, among which <i>FT</i>, <i>TLI65</i>, and <i>NAP57</i> were identified as hub genes in the early flowering regulation pathway. Moreover, we identified twenty-five transcription factors (TFs) from nine protein families, including MADS-box, AP2/ERF, and MYB. Our results provide insights into the underlying molecular model of flowering time regulation in <i>Prunus</i> genus and highlight the utility of multi-omics in deciphering the properties of the inter-genus plants.
