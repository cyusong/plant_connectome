Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the two most abundant mineral nutrients used by plants, and are also the mostly widely used fertilizer elements driving crop yield improvement in agricultural production. The coordinated utilization of N and P is essential to maintain optimal plant growth and achieve maximal crop yield. The signaling pathways of N and P are generally studied separately, so our understanding of N-P interactions is very limited. A series of recent studies have revealed the critical components regulating N-P interactions in both Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), and have shed light on our in-depth understanding of the network integrating N and P signaling pathways. Here, we summarize recent progress on N-P interaction and propose possible working mechanisms integrating these N-P interactive regulation pathways. We further discuss future work that might reveal the N-P interactive regulation network in plants.
