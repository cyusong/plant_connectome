The phytohormone auxin regulates nearly all aspects of plant growth and development. Tremendous achievements have been made in elucidating the tryptophan (Trp)-dependent auxin biosynthetic pathway; however, the genetic evidence, key components, and functions of the Trp-independent pathway remain elusive. Here we report that the Arabidopsis indole synthase mutant is defective in the long-anticipated Trp-independent auxin biosynthetic pathway and that auxin synthesized through this spatially and temporally regulated pathway contributes significantly to the establishment of the apical-basal axis, which profoundly affects the early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis. These discoveries pave an avenue for elucidating the Trp-independent auxin biosynthetic pathway and its functions in regulating plant growth and development.
