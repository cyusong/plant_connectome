A fundamental aspect of multicellular development is the patterning of distinct cell types in appropriate locations. In this review, the molecular genetic control of cell-type pattern formation in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana is summarized. This developmental system represents a simple and genetically tractable example of plant cell patterning. The distribution of the two epidermal cell types, root-hair cells and non-hair cells, are generated by a combination of positional signalling and lateral inhibition mechanisms. In addition, recent evidence suggests that reinforcing mechanisms are used to ensure that the initial cell fate choice is adopted in a robust manner.
