['25658798', 'For more than a decade, the Arabidopsis seed coat epidermis (SCE) has been used  as a model system to study the synthesis, secretion and modification of cell wall  polysaccharides, particularly pectin. Our detailed re-evaluation of available  biochemical data highlights that Arabidopsis seed mucilage is more than just  pectin. Typical secondary wall polymers such as xylans and heteromannans are also  present in mucilage. Despite their low abundance, these components appear to play  essential roles in controlling mucilage properties, and should be further  investigated. We also provide a comprehensive community resource by re-assessing  the mucilage phenotypes of almost 20 mutants using the same conditions. We  conduct an in-depth functional evaluation of all the SCE genes described in the  literature and propose a revised model for mucilage production. Further  investigation of SCE cells will improve our understanding of plant cell walls.', '2015 Feb 4', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms16023452', 'Usadel']
