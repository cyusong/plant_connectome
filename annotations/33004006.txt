The HD-Zip transcription factors are unique to plants and play an essential role in plant growth, development and stress responses. The HD-Zip transcription factor family consists of a highly conserved homeodomain (HD) and a leucine zipper domain (LZ) domain. Although the HD-Zip gene family has been extensively studied in many plant species, a systematic study of the Eucalyptus HD-Zip family has not been reported until today. Here, we systematically identified 40 HD-Zip genes in Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis). Besides, we comprehensively analyzed the HD-Zips of Eucalyptus by studying the homology, conserved protein regions, gene structure, 3D structure of the protein, location of the genes on the chromosomes and the expression level of the genes in different tissues. The HD-Zip family in Eucalyptus has four subfamilies, which is consistent with other plants such as Arabidopsis and rice. Moreover, genes that are in the same group tend to have similar exon-intron structures, motifs, and protein structures. Under salt stress and temperature stress, the Eucalyptus HD-Zip transcription factors show a differential expression pattern. Our findings reveal the response of HD-Zip transcription factors under salt and temperature stresses, laying a foundation for future analysis of Eucalyptus HD-Zip transcription factors.
