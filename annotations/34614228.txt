The embryonic cuticle integrity is critical for the embryo to separate from the neighboring endosperm. The sulfated TWISTED SEED1 (TWS1) peptide precursor generated in the embryo diffuses through gaps of the nascent cuticle to the surrounding endosperm, where it is cleaved by ABNORMAL LEAF SHAPE1 (ALE1) and becomes an active mature form. The active TWS1 is perceived by receptor-like protein kinases GASSHO1 (GSO1) and GSO2 in the embryonic epidermal cells to start the downstream signaling and guide the formation of an intact embryonic cuticle. However, the early signaling events after TWS1 is perceived by GSO1/2 are still unknown. Here, we report that serk1/2/3 embryos show cuticle defects similar to ale1, tws1, and gso1/2. Genetic and biochemical analyses were performed to dissect the signaling pathway mediated by SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASEs (SERKs) during cuticle development. SERKs function with GSO1/2 in a common pathway to monitor the integrity of the embryonic cuticle. SERKs interact with GSO1/2, which can be enhanced dramatically by TWS1. The phosphorylation levels of SERKs and GSO1/2 rely on each other and can respond to and be elevated by TWS1. Our results demonstrate that SERKs may function as coreceptors of GSO1/2 to transduce the TWS1 signal and ultimately regulate embryonic cuticle integrity.
