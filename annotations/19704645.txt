Plant pathogenic microbes deliver effector proteins inside host cells to modulate plant defense circuitry and enable parasitic colonization. As genome sequences from plant pathogens become available, genome-wide evolutionary analyses will shed light on how pathogen effector genes evolved and adapted to the cellular environment of their host plants. In the August 2007 issue of Plant Cell, we described adaptive evolution (positive selection) in the cytoplasmic RXLR effectors of three recently sequenced oomycete plant pathogens. Here, we summarize our findings and describe additional data that further validate our approach.
