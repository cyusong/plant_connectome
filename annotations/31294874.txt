Drought is an increasingly common climatic event that can devastate ecosystems, as well as surrounding agricultural and forestry industries. Few places face this challenge more than Australia, where millennia of droughts linked to geography and climatic drivers, such as El Niño, have shaped the flora and fauna into forms predicated on resilience and economy. How an organism responds to these cyclic challenges is a combination of the inherent tolerance mechanisms encoded in their genome and outside influences, such as the effect of nutrients and symbiotic interactions. In this issue of Physiologia Plantarum, Tariq et al. (2019) describes how the presence of the element phosphorus can bolster the physiological and biochemical response of eucalypt seedlings to severe drought conditions.
