['15860013', "Most plant microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have homologues across the  phylogenetic spectrum. To find potential plant-specific MAPs that will have  evaded bioinformatic searches we devised a low stringency method for isolating  proteins from an Arabidopsis cell suspension on endogenous taxol-microtubules. By  tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting we identified 55 proteins that were enriched  on taxol-microtubules. Amongst a range of known MAPs, such as kinesins, MAP65  isoforms and MOR1, we detected 'unknown' 70 kDa proteins that belong to a family  of five closely related Arabidopsis proteins having no known homologues amongst  non-plant organisms. To verify that AtMAP70-1 associates with microtubules in  vivo, it was expressed as a GFP fusion. This confirmed that the protein decorates  all four microtubule arrays in both transiently infected Arabidopsis and stably  transformed tobacco BY-2 suspension cells. Microtubule-directed drugs perturbed  the localization of AtMAP70-1 but cytochalasin D did not. AtMAP70-1 contains four  predicted coiled-coil domains and truncation studies identified a central domain  that targets the fusion protein to microtubules in vivo. This study therefore  introduces a novel family of plant-specific proteins that interact with  microtubules.", '2005 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02393.x', 'Lloyd']
