Adaptation of higher plants to extreme environmental conditions is under complex regulation. Several small peptides have recently been described to modulate responses to stress conditions. The Small Paraquat resistance protein (SPQ) of Lepidium crassifolium has previously been identified due to its capacity to confer paraquat resistance to overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Here, we show that overexpression of the closely related Arabidopsis SPQ can also enhance resistance to paraquat, while the Arabidopsis spq1 mutant is slightly hypersensitive to this herbicide. Besides being implicated in paraquat response, overexpression of SPQs enhanced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), and the knockout spq1 mutant was less sensitive to ABA. Both Lepidium- and Arabidopsis-derived SPQs could improve drought tolerance by reducing water loss, stabilizing photosynthetic electron transport and enhancing plant viability and survival in a water-limited environment. Enhanced drought tolerance of SPQ-overexpressing plants could be confirmed by characterizing various parameters of growth, morphology and photosynthesis using an automatic plant phenotyping platform with RGB and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Our results suggest that SPQs can be regulatory small proteins connecting ROS and ABA regulation and through that influence responses to certain stresses.
