As a liverwort Conocephalum conicum belongs to the oldest terrestrial plants1 and is phylogenetically located between green algae and higher plants. Recent patch-clamp recordings on Conocephalum vacuoles2,3 demonstrate ion channels very similar to higher plants and clearly different from vacuolar ion channels described in green algae. Here we summarize the features of a vacuolar cation channel and a vacuolar anion channel that both are common in terrestrial plants but are not detected in green algae, and we speculate about the molecular identity of these channels in the liverwort Conocephalum.
