['8106082', 'Homeodomain proteins have been shown to play a major role in the development of  various organisms. A novel Arabidopsis homeodomain protein has been isolated  based on its capability to interact with a DNA motif derived from the  light-induced cab-E promoter of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. The homeodomain of  this protein, designated HAT3.1, differs substantially from those in other plant  homeobox proteins identified so far. Furthermore, HAT3.1 is unique among other  Arabidopsis proteins in that it does not contain a leucine zipper motif following  the homeodomain. HAT3.1 is further characterized by an N-terminal region that  shares substantial sequence similarity with the maize homeodomain protein  Zmhox1a. Within this conserved region, the presence of eight regularly spaced  cysteine/histidine residues was observed reminiscent of other metal-binding  domains. Based on the strong evolutionary conservation of this domain, it is  proposed that this region represents a novel protein-motif which is denoted  PHD-finger (plant homeodomain-finger). In vitro DNA binding studies demonstrated  that HAT3.1 is capable of interacting with any DNA fragment larger than 100 bp.  Interestingly, a deletion of the N-terminal PHD-finger domain completely  abolished DNA binding, suggesting that this region may play an important  functional role in protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction. HAT3.1 mRNA was  primarily detected in root tissue, implying a regulatory function of this protein  in root development.', '1993 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.04010137.x', 'Cashmore']
