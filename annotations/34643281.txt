Since the roots are the very organ where plants first sense and respond drought stress, it is of great importance to better understand root responses to drought. Yet the underlying molecular mechanisms governing root responses to drought stress have been poorly understood. Here, we identified and functionally characterized a CCCH type transcription factor, PuC3H35, and its targets, anthocyanin reductase (PuANR) and early Arabidopsis aluminum induced1 (PuEARLI1), which are involved in mediating proanthocyanidin (PA) and lignin biosynthesis in response to drought stress in Populus ussuriensis root. PuC3H35 was root-specifically induced upon drought stress. Overexpressing PuC3H35 promoted PA and lignin biosynthesis and vascular tissue development, resulting in enhanced tolerance to drought stress by the means of anti-oxidation and mechanical supporting. We further demonstrated that PuC3H35 directly bound to the promoters of PuANR and PuEARLI1 and overexpressing PuANR or PuEARLI1 increased root PA or lignin levels, respectively, under drought stress. Taken together, these results revealed a novel regulatory pathway for drought tolerance, in which PuC3H35 mediated PA and lignin biosynthesis by collaboratively regulating 'PuC3H35-PuANR-PA' and 'PuC3H35-PuEARLI1-PuCCRs-lignin' modules in poplar roots.
