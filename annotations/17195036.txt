['17195036', 'Phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects of plant development and  growth. To explore the molecular mechanism of ABA, we identified the novel  ABA-regulated genes in Arabidopsis thaliana by searching for genes possessing two  or more ABREs (ABA-responsive elements). One of these genes, two or more  ABREs-containing gene 2 (TMAC2) is highly induced by ABA and NaC1. Database  searches revealed that TMAC2 encodes a protein with no domains of known function.  Expression of TMAC2-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts  indicated that TMAC2 is targeted to the nucleus. Although the gene has a basal  level of expression in various Arabidopsis organs/tissues except for adult  leaves, a high expression level was detected in roots. Constitutive  overexpression of TMAC2 in plants resulted in the insensitivity to ABA and NaCl,  suggesting that TMAC2 plays a negative role in ABA and salt stress responses.  Furthermore, TMAC2-overexpressing plants exhibited the short roots, late  flowering and starch-excess phenotypes. RT-PCR analysis showed that decreased  expression of two floral- and one starch degradation-related genes, SOC1/AGL20  and SEP3/AGL9, and SEX1, respectively, may lead to altered phenotypes of  TMAC2-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our data reveal that TMAC2 acts in  the nucleus and is an important negative regulator of ABA and salt stress  responses, and could play a critical role in controlling root elongation, floral  initiation and starch degradation.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-006-9109-8', 'Wu']
