We identified IspF gene through yellow-green leaf mutant 505ys in rice. OsIspF was expressed in all tissues detected, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast. On expression levels of genes in this mutant, OsIspF itself and the genes encoding other enzymes of the MEP pathway and chlorophyll synthase were all up-regulated, however, among eight genes associated with photosynthesis, only psaA, psaN and psbA genes for three reaction center subunits of photosystem obviously changed. Isoprenoids are the most abundant natural compounds in all organisms, which originate from the basic five-carbon units isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In plants, IPP and DMAPP are synthesized through two independent pathways, the mevalonic acid pathway in cytoplasm and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. The MEP pathway comprises seven enzymatic steps, in which IspF is the fifth enzyme. So far, no IspF gene has been identified in monocotyledonous plants. In this study, we isolated a leaf-color mutant, 505ys, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant displayed yellow-green leaf phenotype, reduced level of photosynthetic pigments, and arrested development of chloroplasts. By map-based cloning of this mutant, we identified OsIspF gene (LOC_Os02g45660) showing significant similarity to IspF gene of Arabidopsis, in which a missense mutation occurred in the mutant, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein. OsIspF gene was expressed in all tissues detected, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast. Further, the mutant phenotype of 505ys was complemented by transformation with the wild-type OsIspF gene. Therefore, we successfully identified an IspF gene in monocotyledonous plants. In addition, real-time quantitative RT-PCR implied that a positive regulation could exist between the OsIspF gene and the genes encoding other enzymes of the MEP pathway and chlorophyll synthase. At the same time, it also implied that the individual genes involved in the MEP pathway might differentially regulated expression levels of the genes associated with photosynthesis.
