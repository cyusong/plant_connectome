We investigated the deposition of glucomannans (GMs) in differentiating earlywood tracheids of Cryptomeria japonica using immunocytochemical methods. GMs began to deposit at the corner of the cell wall at the early stages of S(1) formation and showed uneven distribution in the cell wall during S(1) formation. At the early stages of S(2) formation, limited GM labeling was observed in the S(2) layer, and then the labeling increased gradually. In mature tracheids, the boundary between the S(1) and S(2) layers and the innermost part of the cell wall showed stronger labeling than other parts of the cell wall. Deacetylation of GMs with mild alkali treatment led to a significant increase in GM labeling and a more uniform distribution of GMs in the cell wall than that observed before deacetylation, indicating that some GM epitopes may be masked by acetylation. However, the changes in GM labeling after deacetylation were not very pronounced until early stages of S(2) formation, indicating that GMs deposited in the cell wall at early stages of cell-wall formation may contain fewer acetyl groups than those deposited at later stages. Additionally, the density of GM labeling increased in the cell wall in both specimens before and after GM deacetylation, even after cell-wall formation was complete. This finding suggests that some acetyl groups may be removed from GMs after cell-wall formation is complete as part one of the tracheid cell aging processes.
