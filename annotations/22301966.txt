Plant viral symptoms are rarely explained by direct molecular interaction between a viral protein and a host factor, but rather understood as a consequence of arms race between host RNA silencing and viral silencing suppressors. However, we have recently demonstrated that the 2b protein (2b) of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) HL strain could bind to Arabidopsis catalase that is important in scavenging cellular hydrogen peroxide, leading to the induction of distinct necrosis on Arabidopsis. Because we previously used virulent strains of subgroup I CMV in the study, we here further analyzed mild strains of subgroup II CMV, which share 70 to 80% sequence homology with subgroup I, to understand whether the necrosis induction is a general phenomenon to compromise host defense system mediated by catalase in the pathosystem of any CMV strains and Arabidopsis. Based on the results, we concluded that 2bs of subgroup II could also bind to catalase, resulting in decrease in catalase activity and weak necrosis on Arabidopsis. Because the 2b-catalase interaction did not prevent CMVs from spreading, it may eventually operate in favor of CMV.
