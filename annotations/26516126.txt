Copper homeostasis under deficiency is regulated by the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 (SPL7) transcription factor. The daily oscillating expression of two SPL7-dependent copper deficiency markers, COPPER TRANSPORTER (COPT2) and IRON SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (FSD1), has been followed by quantitative PCR and in promoter:LUCIFERASE transgenic plants. Both genes showed circadian and diurnal regulation. Under copper deficiency, their expression decreased drastically in continuous darkness. Accordingly, total copper content was slightly reduced in etiolated seedlings under copper deficiency. The expression of SPL7 and its targets COPT2 and FSD1 was differently regulated in various light signalling mutants. On the other hand, increased copper levels reduced the amplitude of nuclear circadian clock components, such as GIGANTEA (GI). The alteration of copper homeostasis in the COPT1 overexpression line and spl7 mutants also modified the amplitude of a classical clock output, namely the circadian oscillation of cotyledon movements. In the spl7 mutant, the period of the oscillation remained constant. These results suggest a feedback of copper transport on the circadian clock and the integration of rhythmic copper homeostasis into the central oscillator of plants.
