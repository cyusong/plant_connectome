The mycoparasite <i>Clonostachys rosea</i> ACM941 is under development as a biocontrol organism against <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, the causative agent of Fusarium head blight in cereals. To identify molecular factors associated with this interaction, the transcriptomic and exometabolomic profiles of <i>C. rosea</i> and <i>F. graminearum</i> GZ3639 were compared during coculture. Prior to physical contact, the antagonistic activity of <i>C. rosea</i> correlated with a response heavily dominated by upregulation of polyketide synthase gene clusters, consistent with the detected accumulation of corresponding secondary metabolite products. Similarly, prior to contact, trichothecene gene clusters were upregulated in <i>F. graminearum</i>, while those responsible for fusarielin and fusarin biosynthesis were downregulated, correlating with an accumulation of trichothecene products in the interaction zone over time. A concomitant increase in 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside in the interaction zone was also detected, with <i>C. rosea</i> established as the source of this detoxified mycotoxin. After hyphal contact, <i>C. rosea</i> was found to predominantly transcribe genes encoding cell wall-degradation enzymes, major facilitator superfamily sugar transporters, anion:cation symporters, as well as alternative carbon source utilization pathways, together indicative of a transition to necrotropism at this stage. <i>F. graminearum</i> notably activated the transcription of phosphate starvation pathway signature genes at this time. Overall, a number of signature molecular mechanisms likely contributing to antagonistic activity by <i>C. rosea</i> against <i>F. graminearum</i>, as well as its mycotoxin tolerance, are identified in this report, yielding several new testable hypotheses toward understanding the basis of <i>C. rosea</i> as a biocontrol agent for continued agronomic development and application.
