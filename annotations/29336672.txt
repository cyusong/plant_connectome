The root system anchors the plant to the soil and contributes to plant autotrophy by taking up nutrients and water. In relation with this nutritional function, root development is largely impacted by availability of nutrients and water. Due to human activity, plants, in particular crops, can also be exposed to pollutants which can be absorbed and incorporated into the food chain. Cesium in soils is present at non-toxic concentrations for the plant (micromolar or less), even in soils highly polluted with radioactive cesium due to nuclear accidents. Here, we report on the morphological response of rice roots to Cs<sup>+</sup> at micromolar concentrations. It is shown that Cs<sup>+</sup> reduces root elongation without affecting root dry weight. Noteworthy, inactivation of the Cs<sup>+</sup>-permeable K<sup>+</sup> transporter OsHAK1 prevents such effect of Cs<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that internal Cs<sup>+</sup> triggers the modification of the root system.
