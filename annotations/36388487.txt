MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small noncoding RNAs (approximately 20-24 nucleotides), act as essential regulators affecting endogenous gene expression in plants. MiR482/2118 is a unique miRNA superfamily in plants and represses <i>NUCLEOTIDE BINDING SITE-LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT</i> (<i>NBS-LRR</i>) genes to function in plant resistance to pathogens. In addition, over the past several years, it has been found that miR482/2118 not only targets <i>NBS-LRR</i>s but also acts on other molecular mechanisms to affect plant resistance. miR482/2118-5ps, phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in plant disease resistance. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the interactions and links between miR482/2118 and its new interacting molecules, miR482/2118-5p, phasiRNAs and lncRNAs, in plant disease resistance. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive view describing the new molecular mechanism associated with miR482/2118 in the plant immune system.
