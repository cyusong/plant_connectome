['11701887', 'To understand the biogenesis of the plastid cytochrome b(6)f complex and to  identify the underlying auxiliary factors, we have characterized the nuclear  mutant hcf164 of Arabidopsis and isolated the affected gene. The mutant shows a  high chlorophyll fluorescence phenotype and is severely deficient in the  accumulation of the cytochrome b(6)f complex subunits. In vivo protein labeling  experiments indicated that the mutation acts post-translationally by interfering  with the assembly of the complex. Because of its T-DNA tag, the corresponding  gene was cloned and its identity confirmed by complementation of homozygous  mutant plants. HCF164 encodes a thioredoxin-like protein that possesses disulfide  reductase activity. The protein was found in the chloroplast, where it is  anchored to the thylakoid membrane at its lumenal side. HCF164 is closely related  to the thioredoxin-like protein TxlA of Synechocystis sp PCC6803, most probably  reflecting its evolutionary origin. The protein also shows a limited similarity  to the eubacterial CcsX and CcmG proteins, which are required for the maturation  of periplasmic c-type cytochromes. The putative roles of HCF164 for the assembly  of the cytochrome b(6)f complex are discussed.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010245', 'Meierhoff']
