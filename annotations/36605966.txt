High temperature is one of the main constraints affecting plant growth and development. It has been reported that abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis gene <i>9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase</i> (<i>NCED</i>) positively regulates plant resistance to salt, cold, and drought stresses. However, little is known about the function of the <i>NCED</i> gene in heat tolerance of rice. Here, we found that <i>OsNCED1</i> was a heat stress inducible gene. Rice seedlings overexpressing <i>OsNCED1</i> showed enhanced heat tolerance with more abundant ABA content, whereas the knockout mutant <i>osnced1</i> accumulated less ABA and showed more sensitive to heat stress. Under heat stress, increased expression of <i>OsNCED1</i> could reduce membrane damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level of plants, and elevate the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, real time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that overexpression of <i>OsNCED1</i> significantly activated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant enzymes, ABA signaling pathway, heat response, and defense. Together, our results indicate that <i>OsNCED1</i> positively regulates heat tolerance of rice seedling by raising endogenous ABA contents, which leads to the improved antioxidant capacity and activated expression of heat and ABA related genes.
