Artificial mechanical perturbations affect chromatin in animal cells in culture. Whether this is also relevant to growing tissues in living organisms remains debated. In plants, aerial organ emergence occurs through localized outgrowth at the periphery of the shoot apical meristem, which also contains a stem cell niche. Interestingly, organ outgrowth has been proposed to generate compression in the saddle-shaped organ-meristem boundary domain. Yet whether such growth-induced mechanical stress affects chromatin in plant tissues is unknown. Here, by imaging the nuclear envelope in vivo over time and quantifying nucleus deformation, we demonstrate the presence of active nuclear compression in that domain. We developed a quantitative pipeline amenable to identifying a subset of very deformed nuclei deep in the boundary and in which nuclei become gradually narrower and more elongated as the cell contracts transversely. In this domain, we find that the number of chromocenters is reduced, as shown by chromatin staining and labeling, and that the expression of linker histone H1.3 is induced. As further evidence of the role of forces on chromatin changes, artificial compression with a MicroVice could induce the ectopic expression of H1.3 in the rest of the meristem. Furthermore, while the methylation status of chromatin was correlated with nucleus deformation at the meristem boundary, such correlation was lost in the <i>h1.3</i> mutant. Altogether, we reveal that organogenesis in plants generates compression that is able to have global effects on chromatin in individual cells.
