['19704565', 'The ubiquitin pathway is emerging as a powerful system that controls the  stability of key regulatory proteins. In plants, this pathway plays an important  role in controlling several developmental processes, responses to environmental  changes and also cell division. Arabidopsis SKP2A is an F-box protein that  regulates the stability of the E2FC-DPB transcription factor, a repressor of cell  proliferation. Although the function of SKP2A is to recruit targets for  degradation, we have shown that SKP2A is also degraded through the Ub/26S pathway  and, interestingly, auxin stimulates such degradation. Overexpression of SKP2A  positively regulates cell division, increasing the number of cells in G(2)/M,  reducing the level of ploidy and developing higher number of lateral root  primordia. In addition, we showed in this report that overexpression of SKP2A  increased the survival of Arabidopsis plants when they grown on a medium with  high levels of sucrose, likely by maintaining cell division active. Thus, it is  likely that SKP2A connects cell division with stress responses.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.3.10.5888', 'Del']
