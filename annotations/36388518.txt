<i>Liriodendron chinense</i> is a relic tree species of the family Magnoliaceae with multiple uses in timber production, landscape decoration, and afforestation. <i>L. chinense</i> often experiences drought stress in arid areas. However, the molecular basis underlying the drought response of <i>L. chinense</i> remains unclear. Many studies have reported that the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<i>XTH</i>) family plays an important role in drought stress resistance. Hereby, to explore the drought resistance mechanism of <i>L. chinense</i>, we identify <i>XTH</i> genes on a genome-wide scale in <i>L. chinense</i>. A total of 27 <i>XTH</i> genes were identified in <i>L. chinense</i>, and these genes were classified into three subfamilies. Drought treatment and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that six <i>LcXTH</i> genes significantly responded to drought stress, especially <i>LcXTH21</i>. Hence, we cloned the <i>LcXTH21</i> gene and overexpressed it in tobacco <i>via</i> gene transfer to analyze its function. The roots of transgenic plants were more developed than those of wild-type plants under different polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration, and further RT-qPCR analysis showed that <i>LcXTH21</i> highly expressed in root compared to aboveground organs, indicating that <i>LcXTH21</i> may play a role in drought resistance through promoting root development. The results of this study provide new insights into the roles of <i>LcXTH</i> genes in the drought stress response. Our findings will also aid future studies of the molecular mechanisms by which <i>LcXTH</i> genes contribute to the drought response.
