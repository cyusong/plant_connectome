Community genetics was originally proposed as a novel approach to identifying links between genes and ecosystems, and merging ecological and evolutional perspectives. The dozen years since the birth of community genetics have seen many empirical studies and common garden experiments, as well as the rise of eco-evolutionary dynamics research and a general shift in ecology to incorporate intraspecific variation. So what have we learned from community genetics? Can individual genes affect entire ecosystems? Are there interesting questions left to be answered, or has community genetics run its course? This perspective makes a series of key points about the general patterns that have emerged and calls attention to gaps in our understanding to be addressed in the coming years.

Gene: !affects! Ecosystem
Gene: !localizes to! Intraspecific variation
Gene: !interacts with! Eco-evolutionary dynamics
Gene: !enhances! Community genetics
Gene: !represses! Common garden experiments
Gene: !synthesizes! Novel approach
