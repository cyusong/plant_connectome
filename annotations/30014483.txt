Plants closing stomata in the presence of harmful gases is believed to be a stress avoidance mechanism. SO<sub>2</sub> , one of the major airborne pollutants, has long been reported to induce stomatal closure, yet the mechanism remains unknown. Little is known about the stomatal response to airborne pollutants besides O<sub>3</sub> . SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAC1) and OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) were identified as genes mediating O<sub>3</sub> -induced closure. SLAC1 and OST1 are also known to mediate stomatal closure in response to CO<sub>2</sub> , together with RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGs (RBOHs). The overlaying roles of these genes in response to O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> suggested that plants share their molecular regulators for airborne stimuli. Here, we investigated and compared stomatal closure event induced by a wide concentration range of SO<sub>2</sub> in Arabidopsis through molecular genetic approaches. O<sub>3</sub> - and CO<sub>2</sub> -insensitive stomata mutants did not show significant differences from the wild type in stomatal sensitivity, guard cell viability, and chlorophyll content revealing that SO<sub>2</sub> -induced closure is not regulated by the same molecular mechanisms as for O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> . Nonapoptotic cell death is shown as the reason for SO<sub>2</sub> -induced closure, which proposed the closure as a physicochemical process resulted from SO<sub>2</sub> distress, instead of a biological protection mechanism.
