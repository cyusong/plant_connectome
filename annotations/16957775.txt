['16957775', 'Plants use sophisticated strategies to balance responses to oxidative stress.  Programmed cell death, including the hypersensitive response (HR) associated with  successful pathogen recognition, is one cellular response regulated by reactive  oxygen in various cellular contexts. The Arabidopsis basic leucine zipper (bZIP)  transcription factor AtbZIP10 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and  binds consensus G- and C-box DNA sequences. Surprisingly, AtbZIP10 can be  retained outside the nucleus by LSD1, a protein that protects Arabidopsis cells  from death in the face of oxidative stress signals. We demonstrate that AtbZIP10  is a positive mediator of the uncontrolled cell death observed in lsd1 mutants.  AtbZIP10 and LSD1 act antagonistically in both pathogen-induced HR and basal  defense responses. LSD1 likely functions as a cellular hub, where its interaction  with AtbZIP10 and additional, as yet unidentified, proteins contributes  significantly to plant oxidative stress responses.', '2006 Sep 20', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601312', 'Dangl']
