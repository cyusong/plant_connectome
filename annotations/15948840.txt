A single-copy 5.7 kilobase (kb) DNA fragment, termed Linum Insertion Sequence 1 (LIS-1), has been identified and characterized. This is one of the DNA changes associated with the environmentally induced heritable changes resulting in stable lines termed genotrophs in flax (Linum usitatissimum). The insertion sequence and its insertion site have been cloned from genomic libraries and sequenced. PCR products across the insertion and surrounding regions have also been cloned and sequenced. The 5.7 kb DNA fragment is inserted into a 3.7 kb EcoRI fragment in the plastic line (Pl) with the generation of a 3 base pair duplication at the insertion site, as well as additional sequence changes. The identical insertion was also found in other genotrophs and flax varieties. The intact element was not present in Pl but appeared to be generated by a reproducible series of complex rearrangements or insertion events. LIS-1 is the result of a targeted, highly specific, complex insertion event that occurs during the formation of some of the genotrophs, and occurs naturally in many flax and linseed varieties.
