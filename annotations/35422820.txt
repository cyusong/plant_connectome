Inflictions caused by cold stress can result in disastrous effects on the productivity and survival of plants. Cold stress response in plants requires crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways including cold, heat, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling networks. CBF, MYB, bHLH, and WRKY families are among the TFs that function as key players in the regulation of cold stress response at the molecular level. This review discusses some of the latest understanding on the regulation of expression and the mechanistic actions of plant TFs to address cold stress response. It was shown that the plant response consists of early and late responses as well as memory reprogramming for long-term protection against cold stress. The regulatory network can be differentiated into CBF-dependent and independent pathways involving different sets of TFs. Post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs, control during ribosomal translation process, and post-translational regulation involving 26S proteosomic degradation are processes that affect the cellular abundance of key regulatory TFs, which is an important aspect of the regulation for cold acclimation. Therefore, fine-tuning of the regulation by TFs for adjusting to the cold stress condition involving the dynamic action of protein kinases, membrane ion channels, adapters, and modifiers is emphasized in this review.
