<i>Populus</i> sp. is a developing feedstock for second-generation biofuel production. To ensure its success as a sustainable biofuel source, it is essential to capitalize on the ability of <i>Populus</i> sp. to associate with beneficial plant-associated microbes (<i>e.g</i>., mycorrhizal fungi) and engineer <i>Populus</i> sp. to associate with non-native symbionts (<i>e.g</i>., rhizobia). Here, we review recent research into the molecular mechanisms that control ectomycorrhizal associations in <i>Populus</i> sp. with particular emphasis on the discovery that ectomycorrhizal fungi produce lipochitooligosaccharides capable of activating the common symbiosis pathway. We also present new evidence that lipo-chitooligosaccharides produced by both ectomycorrhizal fungi and various species of rhizobia that do not associate with <i>Populus</i> sp. can induce nuclear calcium spiking in the roots of <i>Populus</i> sp. Thus, we argue <i>Populus</i> sp. already possesses the molecular machinery necessary for perceiving rhizobia, and the next step in engineering symbiosis with rhizobia should be focused on inducing bacterial accommodation and nodule organogenesis. The gene <i>Nodule INception</i> is central to these processes, and several putative orthologs are present in <i>Populus</i> sp. Manipulating the promoters of these genes to match that of plants in the nitrogen-fixing clade may be sufficient to introduce nodulation in <i>Populus</i> sp.
