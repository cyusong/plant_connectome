Proanthocyanidins are major UV-absorbing compounds. To clarify the effect of enhanced UV-B radiation on the proanthocyanidin synthesis and antioxidant capacity of traditional rice varieties in Yuanyang terraced fields, we studied the effects of enhanced UV-B radiation (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 kJ·m<sup>-2</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>) on the rice grain morphology, proanthocyanidins content, and synthesis. The effects of UV-B radiation on the antioxidant capacity of rice were evaluated by feeding aging model mice. The results showed that UV-B radiation significantly affected the grain morphology of red rice and increased the compactness of starch grains in the starch storage cells of central endosperm. The content of proanthocyanidin B2 and C1 in the grains was significantly increased by 2.5 and 5.0 kJ·m<sup>-2</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup> UV-B radiation. The activity of leucoanthocyanidin reductase was higher in rice treated by 5.0 kJ·m<sup>-2</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup> than other treatments. The number of neurons in the hippocampus CA1 of mice brain fed red rice increased. After 5.0 kJ·m<sup>-2</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup> treatment, red rice has the best antioxidant effect on aging model mice. UV-B radiation induces the synthesis of rice proanthocyanidins B2 and C1, and the antioxidant capacity of rice is related to the content of proanthocyanidins.
