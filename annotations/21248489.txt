The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls the development of plants and plays a crucial role in their response to adverse environmental conditions like salt and water stress. Complex interactions between ABA and sugar signal transduction pathways have been shown. However, the role played by glycolysis in these interactions is not known. In the associated study, we investigated the interactions between plastidial glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPCp) and ABA signal transduction in Arabidopsis. We followed physiological, genetic and genomic approaches to understand the processes and mechanisms underlying the ABA-glycolysis interactions. Our results indicated that GAPCp deficiency leads to ABA-insensitivity and impaired ABA signal transduction. The gene expression of the transcription factor ABI4, involved in both sugar and ABA signaling, was altered in gapcp double mutants (gapcp1gapcp2), suggesting that the ABA insensitivity of mutants is mediated, at least in part, through this transcriptional regulator. We also suggested that amino acid homeostasis and/or serine metabolism may also be important determinants in the connections of ABA with primary metabolism. These studies provide new insights into the links between plant primary metabolism and ABA signal transduction, and demonstrate the importance of plastidial glycolytic GAPCps in these interactions.
