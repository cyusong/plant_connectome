['25410139', 'Lignins result from the oxidative polymerization of three hydroxycinnamyl  (p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl) alcohols in a reaction mediated by  peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7) and laccases (EC 1.10.3.2), yielding H, G and S units,  respectively. Although both acidic and basic peroxidases can oxidize p-coumaryl  and coniferyl alcohol, only basic peroxidases are able to oxidize sinapyl  alcohol. The AtPrx52 from Arabidopsis is a basic peroxidase that has been  reported to be highly homologous to the basic peroxidase of Zinnia elegans, the  only peroxidase which has been unequivocally linked to lignin formation. Here, we  show how the suppression of AtPrx52 causes a change in lignin composition, mainly  at the level of stem interfascicular fibers. Quantification of lignins in two  different atprx52 knock-out mutants revealed a decrease of lignin amount compared  with wild type. The S/G ratio, obtained by both nitrobenzene oxidation and  thioacidolysis, indicated a decrease in S units in the atprx52 mutants. As  deduced from Wiesner and mainly Maule staining, this reduction in S unit content  appears to be restricted to the interfascicular fibers. Moreover, quantitative  polymerase chain reaction analysis in atprx52 plants showed a general  downregulation of genes involved in lignin biosynthetic pathway, as well as genes  related to secondary cell wall. On the other hand, other routes from  phenylpropanoid metabolism were induced. Taken together, our results indicate  that AtPrx52 is involved in the synthesis of S units in interfascicular fibers at  late stages of the lignification process.', '2015 Jul', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/ppl.12310', 'Novo-Uzal']
