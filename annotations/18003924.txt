['18003924', 'Cryptochrome blue-light receptors mediate many aspects of plant  photomorphogenesis, such as suppression of hypocotyl elongation and promotion of  cotyledon expansion and root growth. The cryptochrome 1 (cry1) protein of  Arabidopsis is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells, but how the  functions of one pool differ from the other is not known. Nuclear localization  and nuclear export signals were genetically engineered into GFP-tagged cry1  molecules to manipulate cry1 subcellular localization in a cry1-null mutant  background. The effectiveness of the engineering was confirmed by confocal  microscopy. The ability of nuclear or cytoplasmic cry1 to rescue a variety of  cry1 phenotypes was determined. Hypocotyl growth suppression by blue light was  assessed by standard end-point analyses and over time with high resolution by a  custom computer-vision technique. Both assays indicated that nuclear, rather than  cytoplasmic, cry1 was the effective molecule in these growth inhibitions, as was  the case for the mechanistically linked membrane depolarization, which occurs  within several seconds of cry1 activation. Petiole elongation also was inhibited  by nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, cry1. Conversely, primary root growth and  cotyledon expansion in blue light were promoted by cytoplasmic cry1 and inhibited  by nuclear cry1. Anthocyanin production in response to blue light was strongly  stimulated by nuclear cry1 and, to a lesser extent, by cytoplasmic cry1. An  important step toward elucidation of cry1 signaling pathways is the recognition  that different subcellular pools of the photoreceptor have different functions.', '2007 Nov 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0705082104', 'Spalding']
