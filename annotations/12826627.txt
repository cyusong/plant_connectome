['12826627', 'APRR1 (ARABIDPSIS PSUEDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) (or TOC1, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION  1) is believed to be a crucial component of biological clocks of Arabidopsis  thaliana. Nevertheless, its molecular function remains to be fully elucidated.  Based on the results of yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, we  previously showed that APRR1/TOC1 interacts with certain bHLH factors (i.e. PIF3  and PIL1, which are PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3 and its homolog (PIF3-LIKE  1), respectively). To critically examine the relevance of PIL1 with reference to  the function of APRR1/TOC1, T-DNA insertion mutants were isolated for PIL1. No  phenotype was observed for such homozygous pil1 mutants, in terms of  circadian-associated events in plants. We then examined more extensively a  certain set of bHLH factors, which are considerably similar to PIL1 in their  structural designs. The results of extensive analyses of such bHLH factors  (namely, HFR1, PIL2, PIF4, PIL5 and PIL6) in wild-type and APRR1-overexressing  (APRR1-ox) transgenic lines provided us with several new insights into a link  between APRR1/TOC1 and these bHLH factors. In yeast two-hybrid assays, APRR1/TOC1  showed the ability to interact with these proteins (except for HFR1), as well as  PIL1 and PIF3. Among them, it was found that the expressions of PIF4 and PIL6  were regulated in a circadian-dependent manner, exhibiting free-running robust  rhythms. The expressions of PIF4 and PIL6 were regulated also by light in a  manner that their transcripts were rapidly accumulated upon exposure of etiolated  seedlings to light. The light-induced expressions of PIF4 and PIL6 were severely  impaired in APRR1-ox transgenic lines. Taken together, here we propose the novel  view that these bHLH factors (PIF4 and PIL6) might play roles, in concert with  APRR1/TOC1, in the integration of light-signals to control both circadian and  photomorphogenic processes.', '2003 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcg078', 'Mizuno']
