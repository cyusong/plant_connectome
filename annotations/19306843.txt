['19306843', 'AtNHX4 belongs to the monovalent cation:proton antiporter-1 (CPA1) family in  Arabidopsis. Several members of this family have been shown to be critical for  plant responses to abiotic stress, but little is known on the biological  functions of AtNHX4. Here, we provide the evidence that AtNHX4 plays important  roles in Arabidopsis responses to salt stress. Expression of AtNHX4 was  responsive to salt stress and abscisic acid. Experiments with CFP-AtNHX4 fusion  protein indicated that AtNHX4 is vacuolar localized. The nhx4 mutant showed  enhanced tolerance to salt stress, and lower Na(+) content under high NaCl stress  compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, heterologous expression of AtNHX4 in  Escherichia coli BL21 rendered the transformants hypersensitive to NaCl. Deletion  of the hydrophilic C-terminus of AtNHX4 dramatically increased the  hypersensitivity of transformants, indicating that AtNHX4 may function in Na(+)  homeostasis in plant cell, and its C-terminus plays a role in regulating the  AtNHX4 activity.', '2009 May 8', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.03.091', 'Zhang']
