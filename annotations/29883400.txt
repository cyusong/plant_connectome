Melatonin (<i>N</i>-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine) is a universal molecule that is present in animals and plants. It has been detected in different kinds of plants and organs in different levels. Melatonin in plants shares the same initial biosynthesis compound with auxin, and therefore functions as indole-3-acetic acid like hormones. Moreover, melatonin is involved in regulating plant growth and development, protecting plants against biotic and abiotic stresses, such as salt, drought, cold, heat and heavy metal stresses. Melatonin improves the stress tolerance of plants via a direct pathway, which scavenges reactive oxygen species directly, and indirect pathways, such as increasing antioxidate enzymes activity, photosynthetic efficiency and metabolites content. In addition, melatonin plays a role in regulating gene expression, and hence affects performance of plants. In this review, the biosynthesis pathway, growth and development regulation, and the environment stress response of melatonin in plants are summarized and future research directions and priorities of melatonin in plants are speculated.
