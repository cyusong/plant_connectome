['18757557', 'To complete the metabolic map for an entire class of compounds, it is essential  to identify gene-metabolite correlations of a metabolic pathway. We used liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify the flavonoids produced by  Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and flavonoid biosynthetic mutant lines. The  structures of 15 newly identified and eight known flavonols were deduced by LC-MS  profiling of these mutants. Candidate genes presumably involved in the flavonoid  pathway were delimited by transcriptome coexpression network analysis using  public databases, leading to the detailed analysis of two flavonoid pathway  genes, UGT78D3 (At5g17030) and RHM1 (At1g78570). The levels of flavonol  3-O-arabinosides were reduced in ugt78d3 knockdown mutants, suggesting that  UGT78D3 is a flavonol arabinosyltransferase. Recombinant UGT78D3 protein could  convert quercetin to quercetin 3-O-arabinoside. The strict substrate specificity  of UGT78D3 for flavonol aglycones and UDP-arabinose indicate that UGT78D3 is a  flavonol arabinosyltransferase. A comparison of flavonol profile in RHM knockout  mutants indicated that RHM1 plays a major role in supplying UDP-rhamnose for  flavonol modification. The rate of flavonol 3-O-glycosylation is more affected  than those of 7-O-glycosylation by the supply of UDP-rhamnose. The precise  identification of flavonoids in conjunction with transcriptomics thus led to the  identification of a gene function and a more complete understanding of a plant  metabolic network.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.058040', 'Saito']
