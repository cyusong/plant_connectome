Cross talking between natural senescence and cell death in response to pathogen attack is an interesting topic; however, its action mechanism is kept open. In this study, 33 <i>OsWRKY</i> genes were obtained by screening with leaf aging procedure through RNA-seq dataset, and 11 of them were confirmed a significant altered expression level in the flag leaves during aging by using the reverse transcript quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Among them, the <i>OsWRKY2</i>, <i>OsWRKY14</i>, <i>OsWRKY26</i>, <i>OsWRKY69</i>, and <i>OsWRKY93</i> members exhibited short-term alteration in transcriptional levels in response to <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> infection. The CRISPR/Cas9-edited mutants of five genes were developed and confirmed, and a significant sensitivity to <i>M. oryzae</i> infection was observed in <i>CRISPR OsWRKY93-edited</i> lines; on the other hand, a significant resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i> infection was shown in the enhanced expression <i>OsWRKY93</i> plants compared to mock plants; however, enhanced expression of other four genes have no significant affection. Interestingly, ROS accumulation was also increased in <i>OsWRKY93</i> enhanced plants after flg22 treatment, compared with the controls, suggesting that <i>OsWRKY93</i> is involved in PAMP-triggered immune response in rice. It indicated that <i>OsWRKY93</i> was involved in both flag leaf senescence and in response to fungi attack.
