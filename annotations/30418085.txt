Systems biology is an inclusive approach to study the static and dynamic emergent properties on a global scale by integrating multiomics datasets to establish qualitative and quantitative associations among multiple biological components. With an abundance of improved high throughput -omics datasets, network-based analyses and machine learning technologies are playing a pivotal role in comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Network topological features reveal most important nodes within a network as well as prioritize significant molecular components for diverse biological networks, including coexpression, protein-protein interaction, and gene regulatory networks. Machine learning techniques provide enormous predictive power through specific feature extraction from biological data. Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, has plausible future applications because a domain expert for feature extraction is not needed in this algorithm. Inspired by diverse domains of biology, we here review classic systems biology techniques applied in plant immunity thus far. We also discuss additional advanced approaches in both graph theory and machine learning, which may provide new insights for understanding plant-microbe interactions. Finally, we propose a hybrid approach in plant immune systems that harnesses the power of both network biology and machine learning, with a potential to be applicable to both model systems and agronomically important crop plants.
