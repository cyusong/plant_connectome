Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an important factor affecting the yield and quality of leguminous crops. Nodulation is regulated by a complex network comprising several transcription factors. Here, we functionally characterized the role of a TOC1 family member, GmTOC1b, in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) nodulation. RT-qPCR assays showed that <i>GmTOC1b</i> is constitutively expressed in soybean. However, <i>GmTOC1b</i> was also highly expressed in nodules, and GmTOC1 localized to the cell nucleus, based on transient transformation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves. Homozygous <i>Gmtoc1b</i> mutant plants exhibited increased root hair curling and produced more infection threads, resulting in more nodules and greater nodule fresh weight. By contrast, <i>GmTOC1b</i> overexpression inhibited nodulation. Furthermore, we also showed that GmTOC1b represses the expression of nodulation-related genes including <i>GmNIN2a</i> and <i>GmENOD40-1</i> by binding to their promoters. We conclude that GmTOC1b functions as a transcriptional repressor to inhibit nodulation by repressing the expression of key nodulation-related genes including <i>GmNIN2a</i>, <i>GmNIN2b</i>, and <i>GmENOD40-1</i> in soybean.
