We previously reported that the SLEEPY1 (SLY1) homolog, F-box gene SNEEZY/SLEEPY2 (SNE/SLY2), can partly replace SLY1 in gibberellin (GA) hormone signaling through interaction with DELLAs RGA and GAI. To determine whether SNE normally functions in GA signaling, we characterized the phenotypes of two T-DNA alleles, sne-t2 and sne-t3. These mutations result in no apparent vegetative phenotypes, but do result in increased ABA sensitivity in seed germination. Double mutants sly1-t2 sne-t2 and sly1-t2 sne-t3 result in a significant decrease in plant fertility and final plant height compared to sly1-t2. The fact that sne mutations have an additive effect with sly1 suggests that SNE normally functions as a redundant positive regulator of GA signaling.
