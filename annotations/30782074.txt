Plant roots respond positively to gravity force and orientate it growth providing anchorage to the soil and gathering water and nutrient sources. The gravitropic response is a complex process wherein nitric oxide (NO) participates as a key signaling molecule. Here, we used genetically impaired genotypes to demonstrate the role of the nitrate reductase (NR) enzyme as a possible source of endogenous NO during gravitropic response in Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) roots. A. thaliana has two NR genes, NIA1 and NIA2. The single mutants nia1 and nia2, and the double mutant nia1/nia2 showed perturbed gravitropism. Complementation with the exogenous NO donor, S-nitroso-L-cysteine, partially rescued the wild-type phenotype in nia2 and nia1/nia2 but not in the nia1 mutant. Our findings showed that each NR gene differentially contributes to reaching the optimum level of NO during the gravitropic response, suggesting that NIA1 and NIA2 isoforms are not equivalent and have potential regulatory feedback to each other during the gravitropic response in A. thaliana roots.
