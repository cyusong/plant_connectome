['15268852', 'BACKGROUND: Plant development is exquisitely environmentally sensitive, with  plant hormones acting as long-range signals that integrate developmental,  genetic, and environmental inputs to regulate development. A good example of this  is in the control of shoot branching, where wide variation in plant form can be  generated in a single genotype in response to environmental and developmental  cues. RESULTS: Here we present evidence for a novel plant signaling molecule  involved in the regulation of shoot branching. We show that the MAX3 gene of  Arabidopsis is required for the production of a graft-transmissible, highly  active branch inhibitor that is distinct from any of the previously characterized  branch-inhibiting hormones. Consistent with its proposed function in the  synthesis of a novel signaling molecule, we show that MAX3 encodes a plastidic  dioxygenase that can cleave multiple carotenoids. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that  MAX3 is required for the synthesis of a novel carotenoid-derived long-range  signal that regulates shoot branching.', '2004 Jul 27', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.061', 'Leyser']
