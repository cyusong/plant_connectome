The advent of powerful site-specific nucleases, particularly the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system, which enables precise genome manipulation, has revolutionized plant breeding. Until recently, the main focus of researchers has been to simply knock-in or knock-out single genes, or to induce single base changes, but constant improvements of this technology have enabled more ambitious applications that aim to improve plant productivity or other desirable traits. One long-standing aim has been the induction of targeted chromosomal rearrangements (crossovers, inversions, or translocations). The feasibility of this technique has the potential to transform plant breeding, because natural rearrangements, like inversions, for example, typically present obstacles to the breeding process. In this way, genetic linkages between traits could be altered to combine or separate favorable and deleterious genes, respectively. In this review, we discuss recent breakthroughs in the field of chromosome engineering in plants and their potential applications in the field of plant breeding. In the future, these approaches might be applicable in shaping plant chromosomes in a directed manner, based on plant breeding needs.
