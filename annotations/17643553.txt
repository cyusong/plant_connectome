Temperature is one of the major environmental factors affecting potato tuberization. It has been suggested that lipoxygenase (LOX) mediates between temperature and tuber induction. In this study, the contents of the LOX-derived metabolites hydroperoxylinolenic acid (HPOT), jasmonic acid (JA), tuberonic acid (TA) and tuberonic acid glucoside (TAG) were analyzed in leaves of potatoes growing at different temperatures. At low, tuber-inducing temperature, endogenous levels of JA, TA and TAG rise, indicating their crucial role in tuber induction. The concentration of 13(S)-HPOT seems not to be directly affected by temperature. Instead, the molecule has only a short half-life in leaves and is readily metabolized.
