['16227452', "Ribosomal protein L24 (RPL24) is implicated in translation reinitiation of  polycistronic genes. A newly isolated Arabidopsis thaliana short valve1 (stv1)  mutant, in which one of the RPL24-encoding genes, RPL24B, is deleted, shows  specific defects in the apical-basal patterning of the gynoecium, in addition to  phenotypes induced by ribosome deficiency. A similar gynoecium phenotype is  caused by mutations in the auxin response factor (ARF) genes ETTIN (ETT) and  MONOPTEROS (MP), which have upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their  5'-transcript leader sequences. Gynoecia of a double mutant of stv1 and a weak  ett mutant allele are similar to those of a strong ett allele, and transformation  with a uORF-eliminated ETT construct partially suppressed the stv1 gynoecium  phenotype, implying that STV1 could influence ETT translation through its uORFs.  Analyses of 5'-leader-reporter gene fusions showed that the uORFs of ETT and MP  negatively regulate the translation of the downstream major ORFs, indicating that  translation reinitiation is an important step for the expression of these  proteins. Taken together, we propose that perturbation of translation  reinitiation of the ARF transcripts causes the defects in gynoecium patterning  observed in the stv1 mutant.", '2005 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.036533', 'Okada']
