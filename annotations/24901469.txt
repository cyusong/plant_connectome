['24901469', 'Zinc fingers are a ubiquitous class of protein domain with considerable variation  in structure and function. Zf-FCS is a highly diverged group of C2-C2 zinc finger  which is present in animals, prokaryotes and viruses, but not in plants. In this  study we identified that a plant specific domain of unknown function, DUF581 is a  zf-FCS type zinc finger. Based on HMM-HMM comparison and signature motif  similarity we named this domain as FCS-Like Zinc finger (FLZ) domain. A genome  wide survey identified that FLZ domain containing genes are bryophytic in origin  and this gene family is expanded in spermatophytes. Expression analysis of  selected FLZ gene family members of A. thaliana identified an overlapping  expression pattern suggesting a possible redundancy in their function. Unlike the  zf-FCS domain, the FLZ domain found to be highly conserved in sequence and  structure. Using a combination of bioinformatic and protein-protein interaction  tools, we identified that FLZ domain is involved in protein-protein interaction.', '2014', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0099074', 'Laxmi']
