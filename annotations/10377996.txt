['10377996', 'In this issue we described a dwarf mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana, sax1, which is  affected in brassinosteroid biosynthesis. This primary defect is responsible for  alterations in hormone sensitivity of sax1 plants characterized by the  hypersensitivity of root elongation to abscisic acid and auxin and the  insensitivity of hypocotyl growth to gibberellins and ethylene (Ephritikhine et  al., 1999; Plant J. 18, 303-314). In this paper, we report the further  characterization of the sax1 mutant aimed at identification of the mutated step  in the brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathway. Rescue experiments with various  intermediates of the pathway showed that the sax1 mutation alters a very early  step catalyzing the oxidation and isomerization of 3 beta-hydroxyl, delta 5,6  precursors to 3-oxo, delta 4,5 steroids. The mapping of the mutation, the  physiological properties of the mutant and the rescue experiments indicate that  sax1 defines a new locus in the brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathway. The SAX1  protein is involved in brassinosteroid-dependent growth of seedlings in both  light and dark conditions.', '1999 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00455.x', 'Barbier-Brygoo']
