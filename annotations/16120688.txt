An increase in atmospheric CO(2) concentration ( [CO(2)]) is generally expected to enhance photosynthesis and biomass. Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) were grown in ambient CO(2) (AMB) or free-air CO(2)-enrichment (FACE), in which the target [CO(2)] was 200 micromol mol(-1) above AMB. (13)CO(2) was fed to the plants at different stages so we could examine the partitioning of photosynthates. Furthermore, canopy photosynthesis and respiration were measured at those stages. The ratio of (13)C content in the whole plant to the amount of fixed (13)C under FACE was similar to that under AMB at the vegetative stage. However, the ratio under FACE was greater than the ratio under AMB at the grain-filling stage. At the vegetative stage, plants grown under FACE had a larger biomass than those grown under AMB owing to enhancement of canopy photosynthesis by the increased [CO(2)]. On the other hand, at the grain-filling stage, CO(2) enrichment promoted the partitioning of photosynthate to ears, and plants grown under FACE had a greater weight of ears. However, enhancement of ear weight by CO(2) enrichment was not as great as that of biomass at the vegetative stage. Plants grown under FACE did not necessarily show higher canopy photosynthetic rates at the grain-filling stage. Therefore, we concluded that the ear weight did not increase as much as biomass at the vegetative stage owing to a loss of the advantage in CO(2) gain during the grain-filling period.
