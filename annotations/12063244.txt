['12063244', 'Real time biomolecular interaction analysis based on surface plasmon resonance  has been proven useful for studying protein-protein interaction but has not been  extended so far to investigate enzyme-enzyme interactions, especially as  pertaining to regulation of metabolic activity. We have applied BIAcore  technology to study the regulation of enzyme-enzyme interaction during  mitochondrial cysteine biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The association of  the two enzyme subunits in the hetero-oligomeric cysteine synthase complex was  investigated with respect to the reaction intermediate and putative effector  O-acetylserine. We have determined an equilibrium dissociation constant of the  cysteine synthase complex (K(D) = 25 +/- 4 x 10(-9) m), based on a reliable A + B  <--> AB model of interaction. Analysis of dissociation kinetics in the presence  of O-acetylserine revealed a half-maximal dissociation rate at 77 +/- 4 microm  O-acetylserine and strong positive cooperativity for complex dissociation. The  equilibrium of interaction was determined using an enzyme activity-based approach  and yielded a K(m) value of 58 +/- 7 microm O-acetylserine. Both effector  concentrations are in the range of intracellular O-acetylserine fluctuations and  support a functional model that integrates effector-driven cysteine synthase  complex dissociation as a regulatory switch for the biosynthetic pathway. The  results show that BIAcore technology can be applied to obtain quantitative  kinetic data of a hetero-oligomeric protein complex with enzymatic and regulatory  function.', '2002 Aug 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111632200', 'Hell']
