This study revealed novel insights into the function of MSP18 effector during root-knot nematode parasitism in rice roots. MSP18 may modulate host immunity and enhance plant susceptibility to Meloidogyne spp. Rice (Oryza sativa) production is seriously impacted by root-knot nematodes (RKN), including Meloidogyne graminicola, Meloidogyne incognita, and Meloidogyne javanica, in upland and irrigated culture systems. Successful plant infection by RKN is likely achieved by releasing into the host cells some effector proteins to suppress the activation of immune responses. Here, we conducted a series of functional analyses to assess the role of the Meloidogyne-secreted protein (MSP) 18 from M. incognita (Mi-MSP18) during rice infection by RKN. Developmental expression profiles of M. javanica and M. graminicola showed that the MSP18 gene is up-regulated throughout nematode parasitic stages in rice. Reproduction of M. javanica and M. graminicola is enhanced in rice plants overexpressing Mi-MSP18, indicating that the Mi-MSP18 protein facilitates RKN parasitism. Transient expression assays in onion cells suggested that Mi-MSP18 is localized to the cytoplasm of the host cells. In tobacco, Mi-MSP18 suppressed the cell death induced by the INF1 elicitin, suggesting that Mi-MSP18 can interfere with the plant defense pathways. The data obtained in this study highlight Mi-MSP18 as a novel RKN effector able to enhance plant susceptibility and modulate host immunity.
