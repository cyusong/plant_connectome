Attachment mechanisms used by climbing animals facilitate their interactions with complex 3D environments and have inspired novel types of synthetic adhesives. Here we investigate one of the most dynamic forms of attachment, used by jumping insects living on plants. Froghopper insects can perform explosive jumps with some of the highest accelerations known among animals. As many plant surfaces are smooth, we studied whether <i>Philaenus spumarius</i> froghoppers are able to take off from such substrates. When attempting to jump from smooth glass, the insects' hind legs slipped, resulting in weak, uncontrolled jumps with a rapid forward spin. By contrast, on smooth ivy leaves and smooth epoxy surfaces, <i>Philaenus</i> froghoppers performed strong jumps without any slipping. We discovered that the insects produced traction during the acceleration phase by piercing these substrates with sharp spines of their tibia and tarsus. High-speed microscopy recordings of hind legs during the acceleration phase of jumps revealed that the spine tips indented and plastically deformed the substrate. On ivy leaves, the spines of jumping froghoppers perforated the cuticle and epidermal cell walls, and wounds could be visualized after the jumps by methylene blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. Improving attachment performance by indenting or piercing plant surfaces with sharp spines may represent a widespread but previously unrecognized strategy utilized by plant-living insects. This attachment mechanism may also provide inspiration for the design of robotic grippers.
