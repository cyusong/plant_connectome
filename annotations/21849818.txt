Plant roots perceive declining soil water potential as an initial signal which further triggers an array of physiological, morphological and molecular responses in the whole plant. Understanding the root responses with parallel insights on protein level changes has always been an area of interest for stress biologists. In a recent study, we reported drought stress-induced changes among certain structural and functional root proteins involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, primary and secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways as well as proteins associated with cell signalling in an economically important legume crop Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek. We also demonstrated photosynthetic gas exchange characteristics and root physiology under varying levels of water-deficit and recovery. In this report, we depict a closer analysis of the expression patterns of the identified proteins which were categorized into five major functional groups. These proteins represent a unique coherence and networking with each other as well as with the overall physiological and metabolic machinery in the plant cell.
