RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is responsible for transcriptional silencing of endogenous transposable elements and introduced transgenes. This process requires non-coding RNAs produced by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V). Pol IV-produced non-coding RNAs are precursors of 24-nt small interfering RNAs, whereas Pol V-produced ncRNAs directly act as scaffold RNAs. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of RdDM. In particular, we focus on the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of Pol IV and Pol V to chromatin and the targeting of RdDM.

Pol IV: !produces! non-coding RNAs 
Pol V: !produces! non-coding RNAs 
Pol IV: !recruited to! chromatin 
Pol V: !recruited to! chromatin 
RdDM: !targeted by! Pol IV and Pol V 
RdDM: !responsible for! transcriptional silencing
