The availability of potassium to the plant is highly variable, due to complex soil dynamics, which are strongly influenced by root-soil interactions. A low plant potassium status triggers expression of high affinity K+ transporters, up-regulates some K+ channels, and activates signalling cascades, some of which are similar to those involved in wounding and other stress responses. The molecules that signal low K+ status in plants include reactive oxygen species and phytohormones, such as auxin, ethylene and jasmonic acid. Apart from up-regulation of transport proteins and adjustment of metabolic processes, potassium deprivation triggers developmental responses in roots. All these acclimation strategies enable plants to survive and compete for nutrients in a dynamic environment with a variable availability of potassium.
