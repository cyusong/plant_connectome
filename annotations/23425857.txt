Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin in plant growth and development has already been established. However, their dynamics in plant immunity is still not well understood and requires systems biological approaches for analysis. Omics based public databases are exploited for the reconstruction, integration and analysis of Boolean models for hormonal interactions in plants. We established a meta-network by combining the plant immune regulatory network and the pathogen virulence specific network and used it as substrate for dynamic simulations on hormonal aspects of plant immunity. Our integrated analysis of this meta-network reveals antagonistic crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin in the Pst DC3000 and Arabidopsis interaction. Moreover, we discuss here the importance of Boolean models in unfolding inferences relevant to plant pathogen interactions.

Boolean models: !unfold! inferences
Omics databases: !reconstruct! Boolean models
meta-network: !combines! plant immune regulatory network and pathogen virulence specific network
dynamic simulations: !analyze! hormonal aspects of plant immunity
