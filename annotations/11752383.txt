['11752383', 'The HUELLENLOS (HLL) gene participates in patterning and growth of the  Arabidopsis ovule. We have isolated the HLL gene and shown that it encodes a  protein homologous to the L14 proteins of eubacterial ribosomes. The Arabidopsis  genome also includes a highly similar gene, HUELLENLOS PARALOG (HLP), and genes  for both cytosolic (L23) and chloroplast ribosome L14 proteins. Phylogenetic  analysis shows that HLL and HLP differ significantly from these other two classes  of such proteins. HLL and HLP fusions to green fluorescent protein were localized  to mitochondria. Ectopic expression of HLP complemented the hll mutant,  indicating that HLP and HLL share redundant functions. We conclude that HLL and  HLP encode L14 subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes. HLL mRNA was at significantly  higher levels than HLP mRNA in pistils, with the opposite pattern in leaves. This  differential expression can explain the confinement of effects of hll mutations  to gynoecia and ovules. Our elucidation of the nature of HLL shows that metabolic  defects can have specific effects on developmental patterning.', '2001 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010323', 'Gasser']
