Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that activates adaptive mechanisms to environmental stress conditions. Plant adaptive mechanisms are complex and highly modulated processes induced by stress-responsive proteins; however, the precise mechanisms by which these processes function under adverse conditions remain unclear. Here, we isolated CaUBP12 (Capsicum annuum ubiquitin-specific protease 12) from pepper (C. annuum) leaves. We show that CaUBP12 expression is significantly induced after exposure to abiotic stress treatments. We conducted loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic studies to elucidate the biological functions of CaUBP12 in response to ABA and dehydration stress. CaUBP12-silenced pepper plants and CaUBP12-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants displayed dehydration-sensitive and dehydration-tolerant phenotypes, respectively; these phenotypes were characterized by regulation of transpirational water loss and stomatal aperture. Under dehydration stress conditions, CaUBP12-silenced pepper plants and CaUBP12-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants exhibited lower and higher expression levels of stress-related genes, respectively, than the control plants. We isolated a CaUBP12 interaction protein, CaSnRK2.6, which is a homolog of Arabidopsis OST1; degradation of this protein was partially inhibited by CaUBP12. Similar to CaUBP12-silenced pepper plants and CaUBP12-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, CaSnRK2.6-silenced pepper plants and CaSnRK2.6-overexpressing Arabidopsis displayed dehydration-sensitive and dehydration-tolerant phenotypes, respectively. Our findings suggest that CaUBP12 positively modulates the dehydration stress response by suppressing CaSnRK2.6 protein degradation.
