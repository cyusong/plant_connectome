Plants respond to adverse environmental cues by adjusting a wide variety of processes through highly regulated mechanisms to maintain plant homeostasis for survival. As a result of the sessile nature of plants, their response, adjustment and adaptation to the changing environment is intimately coordinated with their developmental programs through the crosstalk of regulatory networks. Germination is a critical process in the plant life cycle, and thus plants have evolved various strategies to control the timing of germination according to their local environment. The mechanisms involved in these adjustment responses are largely unknown, however. Here, we report that mutations in core elements of canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) affect the germination and post-germination growth of Arabidopsis seeds grown under salinity stress. Transcriptomic and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analyses support the involvement of this pathway in the control of germination timing and post-germination growth under salinity stress by preventing the transcriptional activation of genes implicated in these processes. Subsequent transcriptional effects on genes that function in relation to these developmental events support this conclusion.
