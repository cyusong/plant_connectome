We used 'Shannong No.1' experimental material to simulate higher salt concentration in ginger and analyzed the physiological responses of different parts of ginger seedlings under salt stress. The results showed that salt stress led to a significant decrease in fresh and dry weight of ginger, lipid membrane peroxidation, increased sodium ion content and enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes. Compared with the control, the overall plant dry weight of ginger under salt stress decreased by about 60%, and the MDA content in roots, stems, leaves, and rhizomes increased by 372.27%, 184.88%, 291.5%, and 171.13%, respectively, and the APX content increased by 188.85%, 165.56%, 195.38%, and 40.08%, respectively. After analysis of the physiological indicators, it was found that the roots and leaves of ginger were the most significantly changed parts. We analyzed the transcriptional differences between ginger roots and leaves by RNA-seq and found that they jointly initiated MAPK signaling pathways in response to salt stress. By combining physiological and molecular indicators, we elucidated the response of different tissues and parts of ginger to salt stress during the seedling stage.
