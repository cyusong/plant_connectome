Previous CO<sub>2</sub> studies have provided great insights into the effects of rising [CO<sub>2</sub> ] on leaf-level gas exchange, carbohydrate dynamics and plant growth. However, scaling CO<sub>2</sub> effects across biological levels, especially in field settings, has proved challenging. Moreover, many questions remain about the fundamental molecular mechanisms driving plant responses to [CO<sub>2</sub> ] and other global change factors. Here we discuss three examples of topics in which significant questions in CO<sub>2</sub> research remain unresolved: (1) mechanisms of CO<sub>2</sub> effects on plant developmental transitions; (2) implications of rising [CO<sub>2</sub> ] for integrated plant-water dynamics and drought tolerance; and (3) CO<sub>2</sub> effects on symbiotic interactions and eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Addressing these and other key questions in CO<sub>2</sub> research will require collaborations across scientific disciplines and new approaches that link molecular mechanisms to complex physiological and ecological interactions across spatiotemporal scales.
