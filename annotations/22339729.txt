['22339729', 'E3 ubiquitin ligases select specific proteins for ubiquitin conjugation, and the  modified proteins are commonly degraded through the 26S proteasome. XBAT32 is a  RING-type E3 ligase involved in maintaining appropriate levels of ethylene.  Previous work has suggested that XBAT32 modulates ethylene production by  ubiquitinating two ethylene biosynthesis enzymes, ACS4 (type-II isoform) and ACS7  (type-III isoform). In Arabidopsis, conserved sequences within the C-terminal  tail of type-I and -II 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS)  isoforms influence ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. ACS7, the sole Arabidopsis  type-III ACS, contains a truncated C-terminal tail that lacks all known  regulatory sequences, which suggests that this isoform may not be subject to  ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Here we demonstrate in planta that  ACS7 is turned over in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner and that degradation of  ACS7 requires the E3 ligase XBAT32. Furthermore, the ethylene-related phenotypes  that result from overexpression of ACS7 in wild-type plants are greatly  exaggerated in xbat32-1, suggesting that XBAT32 is required to attenuate the  effect of overexpression of ACS7. This observation is consistent with a role for  XBAT32 in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ACS7. The dark-grown phenotype of  xbat32-1 seedlings overexpressing ACS7 can be effectively rescued by  aminoethoxyvinylglycine, an inhibitor of ACS activity. The degradation rate of  ACS4 is also significantly slower in the absence of XBAT32, further implicating  XBAT32 in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ACS4. Altogether, these results  demonstrate that XBAT32 targets ethylene biosynthetic enzymes for proteasomal  degradation to maintain appropriate levels of hormone production.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04965.x', 'Stone']
