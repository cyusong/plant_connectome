['16942608', 'The exocyst is a hetero-oligomeric protein complex involved in exocytosis and has  been extensively studied in yeast and animal cells. Evidence is now accumulating  that the exocyst is also present in plants. Bioinformatic analysis of genes  encoding plant homologs of the exocyst subunit, Exo70, revealed that three Exo70  subgroups are evolutionarily conserved among angiosperms, lycophytes and mosses.  Arabidopsis and rice contain 22 and approximately 39 EXO70 genes, respectively,  which can be classified into nine clusters considered to be ancient in  angiosperms (one has been lost in Arabidopsis). We characterized two independent  T-DNA insertional mutants of the AtEXO70A1 gene (exo70A1-1 and exo70A1-2).  Heterozygous EXO70A1/exo70A1 plants appear to be normal and segregate in a 1:2:1  ratio, suggesting that neither male nor female gametophytes are affected by the  EXO70A1 disruption. However, both exo70A1-1 and exo70A1-2 homozygotes exhibit an  array of phenotypic defects. The polar growth of root hairs and stigmatic  papillae is disturbed. Organs are generally smaller, plants show a loss of apical  dominance and indeterminate growth where instead of floral meristems new lateral  inflorescences are initiated in a reiterative manner. Both exo70A1 mutants have  dramatically reduced fertility. These results suggest that the putative exocyst  subunit EXO70A1 is involved in cell and organ morphogenesis.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02854.x', 'Zarsky']
