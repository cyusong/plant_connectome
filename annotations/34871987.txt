Nitrogen (N) metabolism is a major research target for increasing productivity in crop plants. In maize (Zea mays L.), yield gain over the last few decades has been associated with increased N absorption and utilization efficiency (i.e. grain biomass per unit of N absorbed). However, a dynamical framework is still needed to unravel the role of internal processes such as uptake, allocation, and translocation of N in these adaptations. This study aimed to 1) characterize how genetic enhancement in N efficiency conceals changes in allocation and translocation of N, and 2) quantify internal fluxes behind grain N sources in two historical genotypes under high and low N supply. The genotypes 3394 and P1197, landmark hybrids representing key eras of genetic improvement (1990s and 2010s), were grown under high and low N supply in a two-year field study. Using stable isotope <sup>15</sup>N labelling, post-silking nitrogen fluxes were modeled through Bayesian estimation by considering the external N (exogenous-N) and the pre-existing N (endogenous-N) supply across plant organs. Regardless of N availability, P1197 exhibited greater exogenous-N accumulated in leaves and cob-husks. This response was translated to a larger amount of N mobilized to grains (as endogenous-N) during grain-filling in this genotype. Furthermore, the enhanced N supply to leaves in P1197 was associated with increased post-silking carbon accumulation. The overall findings suggest that increased N utilization efficiency over time in maize genotypes was associated with an increased allocation of N to leaves and subsequent translocation to the grains.
