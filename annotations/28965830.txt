Plants have evolved tightly regulated signaling networks to respond and adapt to environmental perturbations, but the nature of the signaling hub(s) involved have remained an enigma. We have previously established that methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP), a precursor of plastidial isoprenoids and a stress-specific retrograde signaling metabolite, enables cellular readjustments for high-order adaptive functions. Here, we specifically show that MEcPP promotes two Brassicaceae-specific traits, namely endoplasmic reticulum (ER) body formation and induction of indole glucosinolate (IGs) metabolism selectively, via transcriptional regulation of key regulators NAI1 for ER body formation and MYB51/122 for IGs biosynthesis). The specificity of MEcPP is further confirmed by the lack of induction of wound-inducible ER body genes as well as IGs by other altered methylerythritol phosphate pathway enzymes. Genetic analyses revealed MEcPP-mediated COI1-dependent induction of these traits. Moreover, MEcPP signaling integrates the biosynthesis and hydrolysis of IGs through induction of nitrile-specifier protein1 and reduction of the suppressor, ESM1, and production of simple nitriles as the bioactive end product. The findings position the plastidial metabolite, MEcPP, as the initiation hub, transducing signals to adjust the activity of hard-wired gene circuitry to expand phytochemical diversity and alter the associated subcellular structure required for functionality of the secondary metabolites, thereby tailoring plant stress responses.
