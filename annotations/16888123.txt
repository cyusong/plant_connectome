Based on limited sampling 2 years after the 2002 Biscuit Fire in Oregon, Donato et al. (Brevia, 20 January 2006, p. 352) concluded that postfire logging reduced seedling regeneration by 71%. Analysis of the study methodology and raw data suggest that this estimate is statistically flawed and misleading and says nothing about the impacts of more prompt postfire harvest.
