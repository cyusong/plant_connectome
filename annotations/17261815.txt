['17261815', 'The plastid envelope of higher plant chloroplasts is a focal point of plant  metabolism. It is involved in numerous pathways, including tetrapyrrole  biosynthesis and protein translocation. Chloroplasts need to import a large  number of proteins from the cytosol because most are encoded in the nucleus. Here  we report that a loss-of-function mutation in the outer plastid envelope 16-kDa  protein (oep16) gene causes a conditional seedling lethal phenotype related to  defects in import and assembly of NADPH:protochlorophyllide (Pchlide)  oxidoreductase A. In the isolated knockout mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, excess  Pchlide accumulated in the dark operated as photosensitizer and provoked cell  death during greening. Our results highlight the essential role of the  substrate-dependent plastid import pathway of precursor Pchlide oxidoreductase A  for seedling survival and the avoidance of developmentally programmed porphyria  in higher plants.', '2007 Feb 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0610934104', 'Reinbothe']
