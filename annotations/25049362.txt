['25049362', 'By means of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid screening, we identified  basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor05 (bHLH05) as an interacting partner  of MYB51, the key regulator of indolic glucosinolates (GSLs) in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Furthermore, we show that bHLH04, bHLH05, and bHLH06/MYC2  also interact with other R2R3-MYBs regulating GSL biosynthesis. Analysis of bhlh  loss-of-function mutants revealed that the single bhlh mutants retained GSL  levels that were similar to those in wild-type plants, whereas the triple  bhlh04/05/06 mutant was depleted in the production of GSL. Unlike bhlh04/06 and  bhlh05/06 mutants, the double bhlh04/05 mutant was strongly affected in the  production of GSL, pointing to a special role of bHLH04 and bHLH05 in the control  of GSL levels in the absence of jasmonic acid. The combination of two specific  gain-of-function alleles of MYB and bHLH proteins had an additive effect on GSL  levels, as demonstrated by the analysis of the double MYB34-1D bHLH05D94N mutant,  which produces 20-fold more indolic GSLs than bHLH05D94N and ecotype Columbia-0  of Arabidopsis. The amino acid substitution D94N in bHLH05D94N negatively affects  the interaction with JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN protein, thereby resulting in  constitutive activation of bHLH05 and mimicking jasmonic acid treatment. Our  study revealed the bHLH04, bHLH05, and bHLH06/MYC2 factors as novel regulators of  GSL biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.', '2014 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.240887', 'ORCID:']
