['19860740', 'HOs (haem oxygenases) catalyse the oxidative cleavage of haem to BV (biliverdin),  iron and carbon monoxide. In plants, the product of the reaction is BV IXalpha,  the precursor of the PHY (phytochrome) chromophore and is thus essential for  proper photomorphogenesis. Arabidopsis thaliana contains one major biochemically  characterized HO (HY1) and three additional putative HOs (HO2, HO3 and HO4). All  four proteins are encoded in the nucleus but contain chloroplast translocation  sequences at their N-termini. The transit peptides of all four proteins are  sufficient for chloroplast translocalization as shown by GFP (green fluorescent  protein) reporter gene fusions. Overall, all four proteins can be divided into  two subfamilies: HO1 and HO2. Here we show that all members of the HO1 subfamily  (HY1, HO3 and HO4) are active monomeric HOs and can convert haem to BV IXalpha  using spinach Fd (ferredoxin) as an electron donor. Addition of a second electron  donor, such as ascorbate, led to a 10-fold increase in the haem conversion rate.  Furthermore, haem turnover is also promoted by light when spinach thylakoids are  present. All HO1 family members displayed similar kinetic parameters indicating  they all have a possible involvement in PHY chromophore biosynthesis. HO2 did not  yield sufficient amounts of soluble protein and therefore required the  construction of a synthetic gene adapted to the codon usage of Escherichia coli.  HO2 is unable to bind or degrade haem and therefore it is not a haem oxygenase.  However, HO2 shows strong binding of proto IX (protoporphyrin IX), a precursor  for both haem and chlorophyll biosynthesis. A possible function of HO2 in the  regulation of tetrapyrrole metabolism is discussed.', '2010 Jan 15', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20090775', 'Frankenberg-Dinkel']
