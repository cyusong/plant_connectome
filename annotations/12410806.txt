['12410806', 'The twisted dwarf1 (twd1) mutant from Arabidopsis thaliana was identified in a  screen for plant architecture mutants. The TWD1 gene encodes a 42 kDa  FK506-binding protein (AtFKBP42) that possesses similarity to multidomain PPIases  such as mammalian FKBP51 and FKBP52, which are known to be components of  mammalian steroid hormone receptor complexes. We report here for the first time  the stoichiometry and dissociation constant of a protein complex from Arabidopsis  that consists of AtHsp90 and AtFKBP42. Recombinant AtFKBP42 prevents aggregation  of citrate synthase in almost equimolar concentrations, and can be cross-linked  to calmodulin. In comparison to one active and one inactive FKBP domain in  FKBP52, AtFKBP42 lacks the PPIase active FKBP domain. While FKBP52 is found in  the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus, AtFKBP42 was predicted to be  membrane-localized, as shown by electron microscopy.', '2002 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01420.x', 'Rahfeld']
