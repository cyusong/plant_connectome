Achlorophylous and early developmental stages of chorolophylous orchids are highly dependent on carbon and other nutrients provided by mycorrhizal fungi, in a nutritional mode termed mycoheterotrophy. Previous findings have implied that some common properties at least partially underlie the mycorrhizal symbioses of mycoheterotrophic orchids and that of autotrophic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plants; however, information about the molecular mechanisms of the relationship between orchids and their mycorrhizal fungi is limited. In this study, we characterized the molecular basis of an orchid-mycorrhizal (OM) symbiosis by analyzing the transcriptome of Bletilla striata at an early developmental stage associated with the mycorrhizal fungus Tulasnella sp. The essential components required for the establishment of mutual symbioses with AM fungi or rhizobia in most terrestrial plants were identified from the B. striata gene set. A cross-species gene complementation analysis showed one of the component genes, calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene CCaMK in B. striata, retains functional characteristics of that in AM plants. The expression analysis revealed the activation of homologs of AM-related genes during the OM symbiosis. Our results suggest that orchids possess, at least partly, the molecular mechanisms common to AM plants.
