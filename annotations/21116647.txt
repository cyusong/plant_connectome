The flowering integrator gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis thaliana is conserved between diverse plant species and is thought to be the flowering signal ''florigen'', a universal long-distance mobile signal. In soybean, two FT homologs having a function to induce flowering in Arabidopsis have been identified. In this study, we showed that the expression of FT from Arabidopsis by the Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) vector promoted precocious flowering and terminated vegetative growth in a wide range of genotypes of soybean, without using a short-day treatment. Four determinate and two indeterminate cultivars, infected with ALSV expressing FT (FT-ALSV), set flower buds on shoot apices and terminated vegetative growth at the fourth- to seventh-node stages under long-day conditions. In contrast, non-infected, healthy plants did not set flower buds on shoot apices at the same stage under the same conditions. After flowering, soybean cultivars infected with FT-ALSV, belonging to different maturity groups and stem growth habits, matured and produced seeds. The results suggest that the basic flowering pathway controlled by FT in A. thaliana might also be conserved in soybean. A system for precocious flowering and shortening of generation time using FT-ALSV would be a useful and novel technology for efficient soybean breeding.
