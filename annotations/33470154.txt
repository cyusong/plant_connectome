Global warming has induced higher frequencies of excessively high-temperature weather episodes, which pose damage risk to rice growth and production. Past studies seldom specified how high temperature-induced carbohydrate metabolism disturbances from both source and sink affect rice fertilization and production. Here we discuss the mechanism of heat-triggered damage to rice quality and production through disturbance of carbohydrate generation and consumption under high temperatures. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence from past studies that rice varieties that maintain high photosynthesis and carbohydrate usage efficiencies under high temperatures will suffer less heat-induced damage during reproductive developmental stages. We also discuss the complexity of expressional regulation of rice genes in response to high temperatures, while highlighting the important roles of heat-inducible post-transcriptional regulations of gene expression. Lastly, we predict future directions in heat-tolerant rice breeding and also propose challenges that need to be conquered in the future.

High temperature: !affects! Rice growth and production
Carbohydrate metabolism: !disturbed by! High temperature
Rice varieties: !maintain high! Photosynthesis and carbohydrate usage efficiencies
Heat-inducible post-transcriptional regulations: !regulate! Gene expression
