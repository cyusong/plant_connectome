Endoreduplication, a process in which DNA replication occurs in the absence of mitosis, is found in all eukaryotic kingdoms, especially plants, where it is assumed to be important for cell growth and cell fate maintenance. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism regulating endoreduplication is still lacking. We previously reported that UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE14 (UBP14), encoded by DA3, acts upstream of CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE B1;1 (CDKB1;1) to influence endoreduplication and cell growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. The da3-1 mutant possesses large cotyledons with enlarged cells due to high ploidy levels. Here, we identified a suppressor of da3-1 (SUPPRESSOR OF da3-1 6; SUD6), encoding CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE G2 (CDKG2), which promotes endoreduplication and cell growth. CDKG2/SUD6 physically associates with CDKB1;1 in vivo and in vitro. CDKB1;1 directly phosphorylates SUD6 and modulates its stability. Genetic analysis indicated that SUD6 acts downstream of DA3 and CDKB1;1 to control ploidy level and cell growth. Thus, our study establishes a regulatory cascade for UBP14/DA3-CDKB1;1-CDKG2/SUD6-mediated control of endoreduplication and cell growth in Arabidopsis.
