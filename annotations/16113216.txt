['16113216', 'TPK1 (formerly KCO1) is the founding member of the family of two-pore domain K(+)  channels in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which originally was described  following expression in Sf9 insect cells as a Ca(2+)- and voltage-dependent  outwardly rectifying plasma membrane K(+) channel. In plants, this channel has  been shown by green fluorescent protein fusion to localize to the vacuolar  membrane, which led to speculations that the TPK1 gene product would be a  component of the nonselective, Ca(2+) and voltage-dependent slow-vacuolar (SV)  cation channel found in many plants species. Using yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) as an expression system for TPK1, we show functional expression of  the channel in the vacuolar membrane. In isolated vacuoles of yeast yvc1  disruption mutants, the TPK1 gene product shows ion channel activity with some  characteristics very similar to the SV-type channel. The open channel conductance  of TPK1 in symmetrically 100 mM KCl is slightly asymmetric with roughly 40 pS at  positive membrane voltages and 75 pS at negative voltages. Similar to the SV-type  channel, TPK1 is activated by cytosolic Ca(2+), requiring micromolar  concentration for activation. However, in contrast to the SV-type channel, TPK1  exhibits strong selectivity for K(+) over Na(+), and its activity turned out to  be independent of the membrane voltage over the range of +/-80 mV. Our data  clearly demonstrate that TPK1 is a voltage-independent, Ca(2+)-activated,  K(+)-selective ion channel in the vacuolar membrane that does not mediate SV-type  ionic currents.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.065599', 'Bertl']
