Contrary to the established notion that the apical hook of dark-grown dicotyledonous seedlings opens in response to light, we found in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) that the apical hook curvature is exaggerated by light. Experiments with several tomato cultivars and phytochrome mutants, irradiated with red and far-red light either as a brief pulse (Rp, FRp) or continuously (Rc, FRc), revealed: the hook-exaggeration response is maximal at the emergence of the hypocotyl from the seed; the effect of Rp is FRp-reversible; fluence-response curves to a single Rp or FRp show an involvement of low and very low fluence responses (LFR, VLFR); the effect of Rc is fluence-rate dependent, but that of FRc is not; the phyA mutant (phyA hp-1) failed to respond to an Rp of less than 10(-2) micromol m(-2) and to an FRp of all fluences tested as well as to FRc, thus indicating that the hook-exaggeration response involves phyA-mediated VLFR. The Rp fluence-response curve with the same mutant also confirmed the presence of an LFR mediated by phytochrome(s) other than phyA, although the phyB1 mutant (phyB1 hp-1) still showed full response probably due to other redundant phytochrome species (e.g., phyB2). Simulation experiments led to the possible significance of hook exaggeration in the field that the photoresponse may facilitate the release of seed coat when seeds germinate at some range of depth in soil. It was also observed that seed coat and/or endosperm are essential to the hook exaggeration.
