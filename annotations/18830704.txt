Distinct chemical species of iron were investigated by Mössbauer spectroscopy during iron uptake into cucumber roots grown in unbuffered nutrient solution with or without 57Fe-citrate. Mössbauer spectra of iron deficient roots supplied with 10-500 microM 57Fe-citrate for 30-180 min and 24 h and iron-sufficient ones, were recorded. The roots were analysed for Fe concentration and Fe reductase activity. The Mössbauer parameters in the case of iron-sufficient roots revealed high-spin iron(III) components suggesting the presence of FeIII-carboxylate complexes, hydrous ferric oxides and sulfate-hydroxide containing species. No FeII was detected in these roots. However, iron-deficient roots supplied with 0.5 mM 57FeIII-citrate for 30 min contained significant amount of FeII in a hexaaqua complex form. This is a direct evidence for the Strategy I iron uptake mechanism. Correlation was found between the decrease in Fe reductase activity and the ratio of FeII-FeIII components as the time of iron supply was increased. The data may refer to a higher iron reduction rate as compared to its uptake/reoxidation in the cytoplasm in accordance with the increased reduction rate in iron deficient Strategy I plants.
