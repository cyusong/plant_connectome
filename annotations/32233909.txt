Leaf development is a complex process and factors such as size, shape, curvature, compounding, and texture determine the final leaf morphology. MicroRNA160 is one of the crucial players that has been shown to regulate lamina formation and compounding in tomato. In this study, we show that miR160 also regulates leaf curvature in potato. miR160 targets a group of Auxin Response Factors - <i>StARF10, StARF16</i>, and <i>StARF17 -</i> that are proposed to function majorly as repressors of auxin signaling. We observed that overexpression of miR160 (miR160-OE) results in decrease in the levels of these ARFs along with hypersensitivity to exogenous auxin treatment, whereas knockdown of miR160 (miR160-KD) causes increased ARF levels and auxin hyposensitivity. The leaves of miR160-OE plants have a high positive curvature, but of miR160-KD plants are flattened compared to wildtype. A prolonged activation of cell cycle - as indicated by increased levels of <i>StCYCLIND3;2</i> - in the center region of miR160-OE leaves appears to have caused this positive curvature. However, a comparable <i>StTCP4</i> activity at both center and margin regions of miR160-KD leaves could be the cause for its flattened leaf phenotype. In summary, we show that miR160 plays an important role in regulating leaf curvature in potato plants.
