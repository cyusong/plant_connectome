<i>Aspilia africana</i> (Pers.) C. D. Adams is an important medicinal plant, that has been used as traditional medicine in many African countries for the treatment of various health problems, including inflammatory conditions, osteoporosis, tuberculosis, cough, measles, diabetes, diarrhea, malaria, and wounds. We developed an efficient and reproducible protocol for <i>in vitro</i> regeneration of <i>A. africana</i> from nodes. We assessed the effects of plant tissue culture media on <i>A. africana</i> growth, cytokinins for <i>in vitro</i> shoot regeneration and proliferation, and auxins for the rooting of regenerated shoots. Furthermore, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rates, anatomy (leaves, stems, and roots), and Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectra (leaves, stems, and roots) of the <i>in vitro</i> regenerated and maternal <i>A. africana</i> plants were compared. Murashige and Skoog media, containing vitamins fortified with benzylaminopurine (BA, 1.0 mg/l), regenerated the highest number of shoots (13.0 ± 0.424) from <i>A. africana</i> nodal segments. 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA, 0.1 mg/l) produced up to 13.10 ± 0.873 roots, 136.35 ± 4.316 mm length, and was the most efficient for rooting. During acclimatization, the <i>in vitro</i> regenerated <i>A. africana</i> plants had a survival rate of 95.7%, displaying normal morphology and growth features. <i>In vitro</i> regenerated and mother <i>A. africana</i> plants had similar chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic rates, stem and root anatomies, and FT-NIR spectra of the leaf, stem, and roots. The established regeneration protocol could be used for large-scale multiplication of the plant within a short time, thus substantially contributing to its rapid propagation and germplasm preservation, in addition to providing a basis for the domestication of this useful, high-value medicinal plant.
