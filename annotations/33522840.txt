<i>Clitopilus hobsonii</i> (Entolomataceae, Agaricales, Basidiomycetes) is a common soil saprotroph. There is also evidence that <i>C. hobsonii</i> can act as a root endophyte benefitting tree growth. Here, we report the genome assembly of <i>C. hobsonii</i> QYL-10, isolated from ectomycorrhizal root tips of <i>Quercus lyrata</i>. The genome size is 36.93 Mb, consisting of 13 contigs (N<sub>50</sub> = 3.3 Mb) with 49.2% GC content. Of them, 10 contigs approached the length of intact chromosomes, and three had telomeres at one end only. BUSCO analysis reported a completeness score of 98.4%, using Basidiomycota_odb10 lineage data. Combining <i>ab-initio</i>, RNA-seq data, and homology-based predictions, we identified 12,710 protein-coding genes. Approximately, 1.43 Mb of transposable elements (3.88% of the assembly), 36 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, and 361 genes encoding putative carbohydrate-active enzymes were identified. This genomic resource will allow functional studies aimed to characterize the symbiotic interactions between <i>C. hobsonii</i> and its host trees and will also provide a valuable foundation for further research on comparative genomics of the Entolomataceae.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
