Phytophthora infestans causes the devastating potato late blight disease, which is widely controlled with fungicides. However, the debate about chemical control is fueling a promotion toward alternative methods. In this context, the enhancement of natural plant immunity could be a strategy for more sustainable protection. We previously demonstrated that a concentrated culture filtrate (CCF) of P. infestans primes defense reactions in potato. They are genotype-dependent and metabolites produced decrease pathogen growth in vitro but not in vivo on tubers. Induced potato defenses are assumed to affect P. infestans life history traits depending on strains. This assumption was studied in vivo through induced leaflets on a susceptible genotype inoculated with four P. infestans strains differing for lesion growth rate. This study combines both defenses mechanistic analysis and ecological observations. Defense-gene expressions were thus assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; pathogen development was simultaneously evaluated by measuring necrosis, quantifying mycelial DNA, and counting sporangia. The results showed that CCF pretreatment reduced the pathogenicity differences between slow- and fast-growing strains. Moreover, after elicitation, PR-1, PR-4, PAL, POX, and THT induction was strain-dependent. These results suggest that P. infestans could develop different strategies to overcome plant defenses and should be considered in biocontrol and epidemic management of late blight.
