In Arabidopsis, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is required for the maintenance of CHH methylation, and for de novo methylation in all (CG, CHG, and CHH) contexts, but no obvious effect of RdDM deficiency on plant development has been found to date. We show that the combination of mutations in the chromatin remodeler PKL and RdDM components results in developmental alterations, which appear in a SUPPRESSOR OF DRM1 DRM2 CMT3 (SDC)-dependent manner.
