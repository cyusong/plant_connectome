['22104211', 'BACKGROUND: 14-3-3 proteins are considered master regulators of many signal  transduction cascades in eukaryotes. In plants, 14-3-3 proteins have major roles  as regulators of nitrogen and carbon metabolism, conclusions based on the studies  of a few specific 14-3-3 targets. RESULTS: In this study, extensive novel roles  of 14-3-3 proteins in plant metabolism were determined through combining the  parallel analyses of metabolites and enzyme activities in 14-3-3 overexpression  and knockout plants with studies of protein-protein interactions. Decreases in  the levels of sugars and nitrogen-containing-compounds and in the activities of  known 14-3-3-interacting-enzymes were observed in 14-3-3 overexpression plants.  Plants overexpressing 14-3-3 proteins also contained decreased levels of malate  and citrate, which are intermediate compounds of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)  cycle. These modifications were related to the reduced activities of isocitrate  dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, which are key enzymes of TCA cycle. In  addition, we demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins interacted with one isocitrate  dehydrogenase and two malate dehydrogenases. There were also changes in the  levels of aromatic compounds and the activities of shikimate dehydrogenase, which  participates in the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds. CONCLUSION: Taken  together, our findings indicate that 14-3-3 proteins play roles as crucial tuners  of multiple primary metabolic processes including TCA cycle and the shikimate  pathway.', '2011 Nov 21', 'BMC Syst Biol', '10.1186/1752-0509-5-192', 'Shin']
