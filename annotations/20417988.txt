Thellungiella halophila (T. halophila) suspension-cultured cells were used to gain knowledge of the pathway of programmed cell death (PCD) in halophytes under salt stress. Several apoptotic-like features occurred in T. halophila cells after exposure to 300 mM NaCl, including the retraction of the plasma membrane from the cell wall, nuclear condensation, DNA laddering and the release of cytochrome c accompanying the increase of caspase 3-like protease activity. This process resulted in ultrastructural changes of mitochondria and Golgi bodies, and autophagy was also induced by high salinity stress. DNA laddering and caspase 3-like activity were inhibited prior to the inhibition of cell death by a specific caspase 3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO. The results indicate that 300 mM NaCl stress-induced PCD in T. halophila is similar to animal apoptosis, and this process occurs partly through a caspase 3-like dependent pathway.

NaCl: !induces! PCD
PCD: !involves! caspase 3-like protease activity
caspase 3-like protease activity: !accompanies! cytochrome c release
300 mM NaCl stress: !inhibits! DNA laddering
Ac-DEVD-CHO: !inhibits! cell death
caspase 3 inhibitor: !inhibits! caspase 3-like activity
