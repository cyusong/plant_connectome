An introgression breeding programme was carried out to transfer the virus resistance gene <i>AV-1</i> <sup><i>pro</i></sup> from the wild species <i>Asparagus prostratus</i> to the garden asparagus <i>Asparagus officinalis</i>. Serious crossing barriers caused by genetic distance and different ploidy levels of the crossing parents have been overcome using embryo rescue for the F<sub>1</sub>, BC<sub>1</sub>, and BC<sub>2</sub> generations. The male and female fertility was widely restored in BC<sub>2</sub> and was shown to be comparable to the cultivated asparagus. Five AV-1 resistant diploid (2n = 2x = 20) BC<sub>2</sub> plants were selected and reciprocally backcrossed with asparagus cultivars. Segregation analyses of fourteen seedborne BC<sub>3</sub> progenies suggested a monogenic dominant inheritance of the AV-1 resistance. Genotyping by sequencing analysis gave a strong hint for location of the resistance gene on asparagus Chromosome 2. Using an Axiom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array for the analysis of three BC<sub>3</sub> families with 10 AV-1 resistant and 10 AV-1 susceptible plants each, as well as 25 asparagus cultivars, the <i>AV-1</i> <sup><i>pro</i></sup> locus on Chromosome 2 was further narrowed down. The SNP with the highest LOD score was converted to a kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) marker, shown to be useful for the further backcross programme and serving as the starting point for the development of a diagnostic marker.
