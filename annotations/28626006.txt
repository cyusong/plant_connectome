['28626006', 'AtAIRP2 is a cytosolic RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates an  abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Yeast  two-hybrid screening using AtAIRP2 as bait identified ATP1 (AtAIRP2 Target  Protein1) as a substrate of AtAIRP2. ATP1 was found to be identical to SDIRIP1,  which was reported recently to be a negative factor in ABA signaling and a target  protein of the RING E3 ligase SDIR1. Accordingly, ATP1 was renamed ATP1/SDIRIP1.  A specific interaction between AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 and ubiquitination of  ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 were demonstrated in vitro and in planta. The turnover of  ATP1/SDIRIP1 was regulated by AtAIRP2 in cell-free degradation and protoplast  cotransfection assays. The ABA-mediated germination assay of  35S:ATP1/SDIRIP1-RNAi/atairp2 double mutant progeny revealed that ATP1/SDIRIP1  acts downstream of AtAIRP2. AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 reciprocally complemented the ABA-  and salt-insensitive germination phenotypes of sdir1 and atairp2 mutants,  respectively, indicating their combinatory roles in seed germination. Subcellular  localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments in the  presence of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, showed that AtAIRP2 and  ATP1/SDIRIP1 were colocalized to the cytosolic spherical body, which lies in  close proximity to the nucleus, in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaf cells.  The 26S proteasome subunits RPN12a and RPT1 and the molecular chaperones HSP70  and HSP101 were colocalized to these discrete punctae-like structures. These  results raised the possibility that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 interact in the  cytosolic spherical compartment. Collectively, our data suggest that the  down-regulation of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 RING E3 ubiquitin ligases is  critical for ABA and high-salinity responses during germination in Arabidopsis.', '2017 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00467', 'ORCID:']
