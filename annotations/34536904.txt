Aluminum (Al) toxicity is one of the primary factors limiting crop production in acid soils worldwide. The cell wall is the major target of Al toxicity owing to the presence of many Al binding sites. Previous studies have found that XTH, encoding xyloglucan endohydrolase (XEH) and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET), could participate in cell wall extension and affect the binding ability of the cell wall to Al by impeding the activities of these two enzymes. In this study, we found that ZmXTH, an XTH gene in maize, was involved in Al detoxification. The Al-induced up-regulation of ZmXTH occurred in the roots, prominently in the root tips. Additionally, the expression of ZmXTH was specifically induced by Al<sup>3+</sup> but no other divalent or trivalent cations. Compared with the wild-type Arabidopsis, ZmXTH overexpressing plants grew more healthy and had decreased Al content in their root and root cell wall after Al stress. Overall, the results suggest that ZmXTH could confer the Al tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants by reducing the Al accumulation in their roots and cell walls.
