Numerous studies have shown that the nucleosome is a dynamic structure that strongly influences gene expression. Dynamism concerns different nucleosomal characteristics, including position, posttranslational modifications, and histone composition. Thus, within the nucleosome, canonical histones can be exchanged by histone variant proteins with specific functions-a process known as 'histone replacement'. The histone variant H2A.Z has an important function in transcription and, during the last few years, its role in plant development and immune response has become evident. Compiling genetic and biochemical studies from several laboratories has revealed that plants contain a multiprotein complex, similar to the SWR1/SRCAP complex from yeast and animals, involved in H2A.Z deposition. Despite intense research in different organisms, the mechanism by which H2A.Z influences transcription is still unknown. However, recent results from Arabidopsis have shown a strong inverse correlation between H2A.Z and DNA methylation, suggesting that H2A.Z might protect genes from silencing.
