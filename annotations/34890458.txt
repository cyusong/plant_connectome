Formation of pollen wall exine is preceded by the development of several transient layers of extracellular materials deposited on the surface of developing pollen grains. One such layer is primexine (PE), a thin, ephemeral structure that is present only for a short period of time and is difficult to visualize and study. Recent genetic studies suggested that PE is a key factor in the formation of exine, making it critical to understand its composition and the dynamics of its formation. In this study, we used high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples of developing Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pollen for a detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of the PE ultrastructure throughout the tetrad stage of pollen development. We also analyzed anthers from wild-type Arabidopsis and three mutants defective in PE formation by immunofluorescence, carefully tracing several carbohydrate epitopes in PE and nearby anther tissues during the tetrad and the early free-microspore stages. Our analyses revealed likely sites where these carbohydrates are produced and showed that the distribution of these carbohydrates in PE changes significantly during the tetrad stage. We also identified tools for staging tetrads and demonstrate that components of PE undergo changes resembling phase separation. Our results indicate that PE behaves like a much more dynamic structure than has been previously appreciated and clearly show that Arabidopsis PE creates a scaffolding pattern for formation of reticulate exine.
