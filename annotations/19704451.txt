DELLA proteins have been shown to act as integrators of the signaling network controlling plant growth. In the January issue of New Phytologist (2008), we analyzed the gai eto2-1 double mutant and corresponding single mutants, with defects in the ethylene-biosynthesis and/or in the gibberellin (GA)-signaling cascade. This research revealed yet unknown modes of cross-talk between the ethylene and GA pathways. Two hypotheses have been put forward. Both essentially suggest the existence of reciprocal posttranslational control of ethylene-GA crosstalk.
