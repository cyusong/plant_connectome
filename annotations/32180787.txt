The genus <i>Silene</i> includes a plethora of dioecious and gynodioecious species. Two species, <i>Silene latifolia</i> (white campion) and <i>Silene dioica</i> (red campion), are dioecious plants, having heteromorphic sex chromosomes with an XX/XY sex determination system. The X and Y chromosomes differ mainly in size, DNA content and posttranslational histone modifications. Although it is generally assumed that the sex chromosomes evolved from a single pair of autosomes, it is difficult to distinguish the ancestral pair of chromosomes in related gynodioecious and hermaphroditic plants. We designed an oligo painting probe enriched for X-linked scaffolds from currently available genomic data and used this probe on metaphase chromosomes of <i>S. latifolia</i> (2n = 24, XY), <i>S. dioica</i> (2n = 24, XY), and two gynodioecious species, <i>S. vulgaris</i> (2n = 24) and S. <i>maritima</i> (2n = 24). The X chromosome-specific oligo probe produces a signal specifically on the X and Y chromosomes in <i>S. latifolia</i> and <i>S. dioica</i>, mainly in the subtelomeric regions. Surprisingly, in <i>S. vulgaris</i> and <i>S. maritima</i>, the probe hybridized to three pairs of autosomes labeling their p-arms. This distribution suggests that sex chromosome evolution was accompanied by extensive chromosomal rearrangements in studied dioecious plants.
