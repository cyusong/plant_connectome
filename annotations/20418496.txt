['20418496', 'The plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (PM H(+)-ATPase) plays an important role in the  regulation of ion and metabolite transport and is involved in physiological  processes that include cell growth, intracellular pH, and stomatal regulation. PM  H(+)-ATPase activity is controlled by many factors, including hormones, calcium,  light, and environmental stresses like increased soil salinity. We have  previously shown that the Arabidopsis thaliana Salt Overly Sensitive2-Like  Protein Kinase5 (PKS5) negatively regulates the PM H(+)-ATPase. Here, we report  that a chaperone, J3 (DnaJ homolog 3; heat shock protein 40-like), activates PM  H(+)-ATPase activity by physically interacting with and repressing PKS5 kinase  activity. Plants lacking J3 are hypersensitive to salt at high external pH and  exhibit decreased PM H(+)-ATPase activity. J3 functions upstream of PKS5 as  double mutants generated using j3-1 and several pks5 mutant alleles with altered  kinase activity have levels of PM H(+)-ATPase activity and responses to salt at  alkaline pH similar to their corresponding pks5 mutant. Taken together, our  results demonstrate that regulation of PM H(+)-ATPase activity by J3 takes place  via inactivation of the PKS5 kinase.', '2010 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.069609', 'Guo']
