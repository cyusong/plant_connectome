Apomixis, defined as the transfer of maternal germplasm to offspring without fertilization, enables the fixation of F1-useful traits, providing advantages in crop breeding. However, most apomictic plants require pollination to produce the endosperm. The endosperm is essential for embryogenesis, and its development is suppressed until fertilization. We show that the expression of a chimeric repressor of the Elongation of Siliques without Pollination 3 (ESP3) gene (Pro35S:ESP3-SRDX) induces ovule enlargement without fertilization in Arabidopsis thaliana. The ESP3 gene encodes a protein similar to the flowering Wageningen homeodomain transcription factor containing a StAR-related lipid transfer domain. However, ESP3 lacks the homeobox-encoding region. Genes related to the cell cycle and sugar metabolism were upregulated in unfertilized Pro35S:ESP3-SRDX ovules similar to those in fertilized seeds, while those related to autophagy were downregulated similar to those in fertilized seeds. Unfertilized Pro35S:ESP3-SRDX ovules partially nourished embryos when only the egg was fertilized, accumulating hexoses without central cell proliferation. ESP3 may regulate nutrient flow during seed development, and ESP3-SRDX could be a useful tool for complete apomixis that does not require pseudo-fertilization.
