Phloem-derived amino acids are the major source of nitrogen supplied to developing seeds. Amino acid transfer from the maternal to the filial tissue requires at least one cellular export step from the maternal tissue prior to the import into the symplasmically isolated embryo. Some members of UMAMIT (usually multiple acids move in an out transporter) family (UMAMIT11, 14, 18, 28, and 29) have previously been implicated in this process. Here we show that additional members of the UMAMIT family, UMAMIT24 and UMAMIT25, also function in amino acid transfer in developing seeds. Using a recently published yeast-based assay allowing detection of amino acid secretion, we showed that UMAMIT24 and UMAMIT25 promote export of a broad range of amino acids in yeast. In plants, UMAMIT24 and UMAMIT25 are expressed in distinct tissues within developing seeds; UMAMIT24 is mainly expressed in the chalazal seed coat and localized on the tonoplast, whereas the plasma membrane-localized UMAMIT25 is expressed in endosperm cells. Seed amino acid contents of umamit24 and umamit25 knockout lines were both decreased during embryogenesis compared with the wild type, but recovered in the mature seeds without any deleterious effect on yield. The results suggest that UMAMIT24 and 25 play different roles in amino acid translocation from the maternal to filial tissue; UMAMIT24 could have a role in temporary storage of amino acids in the chalaza, while UMAMIT25 would mediate amino acid export from the endosperm, the last step before amino acids are taken up by the developing embryo.
