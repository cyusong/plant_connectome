Plant nuclear CBC consisted of two subunits (CBP20 and CBP80) is involved in both conserved processes related to RNA metabolism and simultaneously in extremely dynamic plant stress response.

CBP20: !interacts with! CBP80
CBP20/CBP80: !affects! RNA metabolism
CBP20/CBP80: !enhances! plant stress response
