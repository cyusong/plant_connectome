In eukaryotes, posttranslational modification by ubiquitin regulates the activity and stability of many proteins and thus influences a variety of developmental processes as well as environmental responses. Ubiquitination also plays a critical role in intracellular trafficking by serving as a signal for endocytosis. We have previously shown that the Arabidopsis thaliana associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM3 (AMSH3) is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that interacts with endosomal complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) and is essential for intracellular transport and vacuole biogenesis. However, physiological functions of AMSH3 in the context of its ESCRT-III interaction are not well understood due to the severe seedling lethal phenotype of its null mutant. In this article, we show that Arabidopsis AMSH1, an AMSH3-related DUB, interacts with the ESCRT-III subunit vacuolar protein sorting2.1 (VPS2.1) and that impairment of both AMSH1 and VPS2.1 causes early senescence and hypersensitivity to artificial carbon starvation in the dark similar to previously reported autophagy mutants. Consistent with this, both mutants accumulate autophagosome markers and accumulate less autophagic bodies in the vacuole. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AMSH1 and the ESCRT-III-subunit VPS2.1 are important for autophagic degradation and autophagy-mediated physiological processes.
