We isolated a novel strain of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp., SSBR45, from the nodulated roots of <i>Aeschynomene indica</i> and labeled it with <i>Discosoma</i> sp. red fluorescent protein (dsRED) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and determined its draft genomic sequence. The labeled SSBR45 stimulated the growth of <i>A. indica</i> markedly on a nitrogen-free medium, as observed by visualizing the fluorescent root nodules. The nodulated roots also exhibited high acetylene reduction activities. The SSBR45 genome included genes involved in nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, and type IV secretion system; however, it did not consist of canonical <i>nodABC</i> genes and type III secretion system genes. SSBR45, a novel species of the genus <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, consisted of an average nucleotide identity and average amino acid identity of 87% and 90%, respectively, with the closest strain <i>B. oligotrophicum</i> S58.
