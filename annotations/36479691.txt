Group VII ethylene response factors (ERF-VII) are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) known for their role in the activation of hypoxia-responsive genes under low oxygen stress but also in plant endogenous hypoxic niches. However, their function in the microaerophilic nitrogen-fixing nodules of legumes has not yet been investigated. We investigated regulation and the function of the two Medicago truncatula ERF-VII TFs (MtERF74 and MtERF75) in roots and nodules, MtERF74 and MtERF75 in response to hypoxia stress and during the nodulation process using an RNA interference strategy and targeted proteolysis of MtERF75. Knockdown of MtERF74 and MtERF75 partially blocked the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes in roots exposed to hypoxia stress. In addition, a significant reduction in nodulation capacity and nitrogen fixation activity was observed in mature nodules of double knockdown transgenic roots. Overall, the results indicate that MtERF74 and MtERF75 are involved in the induction of MtNR1 and Pgb1.1 expression for efficient Phytogb-nitric oxide respiration in the nodule.
