Boron (B) toxicity is a nutritional disorder affecting crop production in many parts of the world. This study explored genetic factors associated with B tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) through an integrated genome mapping and transcriptomic approach. Variation in B tolerance was first evaluated by screening a panel of 137 indica genotypes in B toxic conditions (+2 mM B), followed by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Leaf bronzing and greenness were significantly correlated with shoot and root dry weight, but B uptake was not correlated with any stress phenotype. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers exceeding a significance value of –log10P>4.0 were obtained for four traits, namely leaf bronzing, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and root length. Linkage disequilibrium block analysis of the corresponding chromosomal regions revealed candidate loci containing 75 gene models. Two contrasting genotypes from the panel were selected for transcriptomic analysis, which included gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially regulated genes and investigating transcriptional responses of GWAS candidate genes. Characteristic expression patterns associated with tolerance or sensitivity were seen in genes related to biochemical binding, transport, transcriptional regulation, and redox homeostasis. These results advance the understanding of genetic and physiological factors associated with B tolerance in rice.
