Germination performance is affected following seed exposure to a combination of temperature fluctuations and cycles of hydration and dehydration. This has long been exploited in a seed technology termed priming, which increases germination speed and seedling vigour, but these benefits have often been associated with effects on seed lifespan, or longevity, with conflicting evidence for positive and negative effects. Seed longevity is a key seed trait influencing not only the storage of commercial stocks but also in situ and ex situ seed conservation. In the context of increasingly variable environmental conditions faced by both crops and wild species, this has led to renewed interest in understanding the molecular factors that underlie priming. Here, we provide an overview of the literature relating to the effect of priming on seed lifespan, and catalogue the different parameters used for priming treatments and their consequences on longevity for a range of species. Our current limited understanding of the molecular basis for priming effects is also outlined, with an emphasis on recent advances and promising approaches that should lead towards the application and monitoring of the priming process in a less empirical manner.
