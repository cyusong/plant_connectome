We introduce ViroidDB, a value-added database that attempts to collect all known viroid and viroid-like circular RNA sequences into a single resource. Spanning about 10 000 unique sequences, ViroidDB includes viroids, retroviroid-like elements, small circular satellite RNAs, ribozyviruses, and retrozymes. Each sequence's secondary structure, ribozyme content, and cluster membership are predicted via a custom pipeline optimized for handling circular RNAs. The data can be explored via a purpose-built user interface that features visualizations, multiple sequence alignments, and a portal for downloading bulk data. Users can browse the data by sequence type, taxon, or typo-tolerant search of metadata fields. The database is freely accessible at https://viroids.org.
