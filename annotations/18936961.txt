An Arabidopsis thaliana pectin methylesterase that was not predicted to contain any signaling sequence was produced in E. coli and purified using a His tag added at its N-terminus. The enzyme demethylesterified Citrus pectin with a Km of 0.86 mg/ml. The enzyme did not require salt for activity and was found to be relatively temperature-sensitive. The precipitation of enzyme-treated pectin by CaCl2 suggested that the enzyme had a blockwise mode of pectin demethylesterification. A purified kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) pectin methylesterase inhibitor had no effect on the activity of the enzyme whereas it strongly inhibited a flax pectin methylesterase. A model of the protein structure revealed that an extra amino acid sequence in this particular Arabidopsis pectin methylesterase could form a ss-strand outside the core structure, which might be preventing the inhibitor from binding the protein.
