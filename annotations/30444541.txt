We explore their evolutionary origins, considering recent findings from bryophytes. Unlike vascular plant stomata, which close to prevent water loss, bryophyte stomata become locked open to promote spore desiccation. We find that the families of ion channels, known to control stomatal movements in angiosperms, are ancient and represented across extant land plants. However, although angiosperm guard cells express specific ion channel genes, none appear specifically expressed in stomata-bearing moss tissues. Given the evolutionary shift in stomatal function from promotion to prevention of water loss, we postulate that ion channels adopted guard cell-specific functions after the divergence of bryophytes.
