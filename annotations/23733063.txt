['23733063', 'Epigenetic regulations of transposable elements (TEs) and TE-like repeat  sequences help to protect genomic integrity and control various developmental  processes, including flowering time. This complex action of gene silencing  requires the coordination of many key players including DNA methylases, histone  deacetylases and histone methyltranferases. We have recently reported that an  AT-hook DNA binding protein, TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT SILENCING VIA AT-HOOK (TEK),  participates in silencing TEs and TE-like sequence containing genes, such as Ler  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FWA. TEK knockdown in amiTEK plants causes increased  histone acetylation, reduced H3K9me2 and DNA hypomethylation in the target loci,  which ultimately leads to the upregulation of FLC and FWA as well as TE  reactivation. In this report, we show that, besides FLC, other FLC-like genes  MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 4 (MAF4) and MAF5 are also upregulated in amiTEK. Here  we discuss the role of the nuclear matrix protein TEK in the maintenance of  genome integrity and in the control of flowering.', '2013 Aug', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.25006', 'Ito']
