Lipoxygenases (Loxs) are dioxygenases that play an important role in plant growth and defense. Loxs affect flour processing quality in common wheat (Triticum aestivum). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that identified 306 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to Lox activity in Chinese wheat accessions. Among them, a novel lipoxygenase-encoding (Lpx) gene, TaLpx-B4, was detected on chromosome 3B in a biparental population. Analysis of mutant wheat lines induced using ethyl methanesulfonate confirmed the role of TaLpx-B4 in modulating Lox activity. A phylogenetic tree of various plant Lpx genes indicated the predominance of the 9-Lpx type in common wheat. Further analysis revealed conserved intron number, exon length, and motif number in the TaLpx gene family. GWAS, linkage mapping, and gene annotation collectively showed that 14 out of 29 annotated TaLpx genes played a critical role in regulating Lox activity in the Chinese wheat accessions. Transgenic wheat grains with knockdown of Lpx family genes by RNAi showed significantly lower Lox activity than the wild type. One TaLpx-RNAi line had significantly reduced starch content and dough stability, and thus possessed relatively superior biscuit quality in soft wheat. Further analysis of the transcriptome, lipid components, and other metabolites revealed that knockdown of TaLpx genes significantly increased biscuit quality via changes in unsaturated fatty acid content as well as in starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism. Our results provide new insights into the role of the TaLpx gene family that will be beneficial in improving soft wheat flour quality.
