['11123798', 'Flowering time in many plants is triggered by environmental factors that lead to  uniform flowering in plant populations, ensuring higher reproductive success. So  far, several genes have been identified that are involved in flowering time  control. AGL20 (AGAMOUS LIKE 20) is a MADS domain gene from Arabidopsis that is  activated in shoot apical meristems during the transition to flowering. By  transposon tagging we have identified late flowering agl20 mutants, showing that  AGL20 is involved in flowering time control. In previously described late  flowering mutants of the long-day and constitutive pathways of floral induction  the expression of AGL20 is down-regulated, demonstrating that AGL20 acts  downstream to the mutated genes. Moreover, we can show that AGL20 is also  regulated by the gibberellin (GA) pathway, indicating that AGL20 integrates  signals of different pathways of floral induction and might be a central  component for the induction of flowering. In addition, the constitutive  expression of AGL20 in Arabidopsis is sufficient for photoperiod independent  flowering and the over-expression of the orthologous gene from mustard, MADSA, in  the classical short-day tobacco Maryland Mammoth bypasses the strict  photoperiodic control of flowering.', '2000 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00906.x', 'Melzer']
