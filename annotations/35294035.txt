Gene regulation ensures that the appropriate genes are expressed at the proper time. Nuclear retention of incompletely spliced or mature mRNAs is emerging as a novel, previously underappreciated layer of posttranscriptional regulation. Studies on this phenomenon indicated that it exerts a significant influence on the regulation of gene expression by regulating export and translation delay, which allows the synthesis of specific proteins in response to a stimulus or at strictly controlled time points, for example, during cell differentiation or development. Here, we show that transcription in microsporocytes of European larch (Larix decidua) occurs in a pulsatile manner during prophase of the first meiotic division. Transcriptional activity was then silenced after each pulse. However, the transcripts synthesized were not exported immediately to the cytoplasm but were retained in the nucleoplasm and Cajal bodies (CBs). In contrast to the nucleoplasm, we did not detect mature transcripts in CBs, which only stored nonfully spliced transcripts with retained introns. Notably, the retained introns were spliced at precisely defined times, and fully mature mRNAs were released into the cytoplasm for translation. As similar processes have been observed during spermatogenesis in animals, our results illustrate an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of gene expression regulation during generative cells development in Eukaryota.
