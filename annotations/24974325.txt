The mechanism of iron uptake in the chrysophyte microalga Dinobryon was studied. Previous studies have shown that iron is the dominant limiting elements for growth of Dinobryon in the Eshkol reservoir in northern Israel, which control its burst of bloom. It is demonstrated that Dinobryon has a light-stimulated ferrireductase activity, which is sensitive to the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor DCMU and to the uncoupler CCCP. Iron uptake is also light-dependent, is inhibited by DCMU and by CCCP and also by the ferrous iron chelator BPDS. These results suggest that ferric iron reduction by ferrireductase is involved in iron uptake in Dinobryon and that photosynthesis provides the major reducing power to energize iron acquisition. Iron deprivation does not enhance but rather inhibits iron uptake contrary to observations in other algae.

Photosynthesis: !energizes! Iron uptake
Ferrireductase: !reduces! Ferric iron
DCMU: !inhibits! Ferrireductase activity
CCCP: !inhibits! Ferrireductase activity
BPDS: !inhibits! Iron uptake
Iron deprivation: !inhibits! Iron uptake
