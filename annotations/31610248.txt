['31610248', 'During plant growth and development mineral elements are preferentially delivered  to different organs and tissues to meet the differential demand. It has been  shown that the preferential distribution of mineral nutrients in gramineous  plants is mediated by node-based transporters, but the mechanisms of preferential  distribution in dicots are poorly understood. Here, we report a distinct  mechanism for the preferential distribution of phosphorus (P) in Arabidopsis  plants, revealed by detailed functional analysis of AtSPDT/AtSULTR3;4 (SULTR-like  P Distribution Transporter), a homolog of rice OsSPDT. Like OsSPDT, AtSPDT is  localized at the plasma membrane and showed proton-dependent transport activity  for P. Interestingly, we found that AtSPDT is mainly expressed in the rosette  basal region and leaf petiole, and its expression is up-regulated by P  deficiency. Tissue-specific analysis showed that AtSPDT is mainly located in the  vascular cambium of different organs, as well as in the parenchyma tissues of  both xylem and phloem regions. Knockout of AtSPDT inhibited the growth of new  leaves under low P due to decreased P distribution to those organs. The seed  yields of the wild-type and atspdt mutant plants are similar, but the seeds of  mutant plants contain - less P. These results indicate that AtSPDT localized in  the vascular cambium is involved in preferential distribution of P to the  developing tissues, through xylem-to-phloem transfer mainly at the rosette basal  region and leaf petiole.', '2020 Jan 6', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2019.10.002', 'Ma']
