['24771765', 'In Arabidopsis, root hair and non-hair cell fates are determined by a  MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcription factor complex and are regulated by many internal and  environmental cues. Brassinosteroids play important roles in regulating root hair  specification by unknown mechanisms. Here, we systematically examined root hair  phenotypes in brassinosteroid-related mutants, and found that brassinosteroid  signaling inhibits root hair formation through GSK3-like kinases or upstream  components. We found that with enhanced brassinosteroid signaling, GL2, a cell  fate marker for non-hair cells, is ectopically expressed in hair cells, while its  expression in non-hair cells is suppressed when BR signaling is reduced. Genetic  analysis demonstrated that brassinosteroid-regulated root epidermal cell  patterning is dependent on the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 transcription factor complex.  One of the GSK3-like kinases, BIN2, interacted with and phosphorylated EGL3, and  EGL3s mutated at phosphorylation siteswere retained in hair cell nuclei. BIN2  phosphorylated TTG1 to inhibit the activity of the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex.  Thus, our study provides insights into the mechanism of brassinosteroid  regulation of root hair patterning.', '2014 Apr 25', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.02525', 'Wang']
