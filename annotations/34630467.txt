Icelandic barley genotypes have shown extreme earliness both in flowering and maturity compared to other north European genotypes, whereas earliness is a key trait in adapting barley to northern latitudes. Four genes were partially re-sequenced, which are <i>Ppd-H1, HvCEN, HvELF3</i>, and <i>HvFT1</i>, to better understand the mechanisms underlying this observed earliness. These genes are all known to play a part in the photoperiod response. The objective of this study is to correlate allelic diversity with flowering time and yield data from Icelandic field trials. The resequencing identified two to three alleles at each locus which resulted in 12 haplotype combinations. One haplotype combination containing the winter-type allele of <i>Ppd-H1</i> correlated with extreme earliness, however, with a severe yield penalty. A winter-type allele in <i>HvCEN</i> in four genotypes correlated with earliness combined with high yield. Our results open the possibility of marker-assisted pyramiding as a rapid way to develop varieties with a shortened time from sowing to flowering under the extreme Icelandic growing conditions and possibly in other arctic or sub-arctic regions.
