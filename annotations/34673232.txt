Photoperiod responsiveness is a key factor limiting the geographic distribution of cultivated soybean and its wild ancestor. In particular, the genetic basis of the adaptation in wild soybean remains poorly understood. In this study, by combining whole-genome resequencing and genome-wide association studies we identified a novel locus, Time of Flowering 5 (Tof5), which promotes flowering and enhances adaptation to high latitudes in both wild and cultivated soybean. By genomic, genetic and transgenic analyses we showed that Tof5 encodes a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana FRUITFULL (FUL). Importantly, further analyses suggested that different alleles of Tof5 have undergone parallel selection. The Tof5<sup>H1</sup> allele was strongly selected by humans after the early domestication of cultivated soybean, while Tof5<sup>H2</sup> allele was naturally selected in wild soybean, and in each case facilitating adaptation to high latitudes. Moreover, we found that the key flowering repressor E1 suppresses the transcription of Tof5 by binding to its promoter. In turn, Tof5 physically associates with the promoters of two important FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), FT2a and FT5a, to upregulate their transcription and promote flowering under long photoperiods. Collectively, our findings provide insights into how wild soybean adapted to high latitudes through natural selection and indicate that cultivated soybean underwent changes in the same gene but evolved a distinct allele that was artificially selected after domestication.
