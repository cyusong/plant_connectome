The hard-end is a disorder of pear fruit, however, the mechanisms underlying its development remain unknown. In this study, we found that the hard-end fruit contained a higher transcript abundance level of <i>ethylene-response factor 1b-like</i> (<i>PpERF1b-like</i>) and released more ethylene compared to normal pear. In the ethephon treated normal fruit, flesh tissues accumulated more lignin together with elevated expression of <i>PpERF1b-like</i>. Overexpressing <i>PpERF1b-like</i> transiently in fruit and stably in callus increased lignin accumulation and the expression of lignin biosynthesis genes; the opposite results were observed in fruit showing repressed expression of <i>PpERF1b-like</i>. These results confirmed the role of <i>PpERF1b-like</i> in promoting hard-end formation through promoting lignin synthesis. This study provided valuable information for further clarifying the regulation of hard-end formation in pear.

PpERF1b-like: !increases! lignin accumulation
PpERF1b-like: !enhances! expression of lignin biosynthesis genes
ethylene: !elevates! PpERF1b-like transcript abundance
ethephon: !induces! lignin accumulation in normal fruit
overexpressing PpERF1b-like: !promotes! hard-end formation
