With the exception of the grasses, plants rely on a reduction-based iron (Fe) uptake system that is compromised by high soil pH, leading to severe chlorosis and reduced yield in crop plants. We recently reported that iron deficiency triggers the production of secondary metabolites that are beneficial for Fe uptake in particular at high external pH when iron is present but not readily available. The exact function of these metabolites, however, remains enigmatic. Here, we speculate on the mechanism by which secondary metabolites secreted by roots from Fe-deficient plants improve Fe acquisition. We suggest that the production and excretion of Iron Binding Compounds (IBCs) constitute an integrative, pH-insensitive component of the reduction-based iron uptake strategy in plants.
