['18931021', 'The signal-mediated and spatially controlled assembly and dynamics of actin are  crucial for maintaining shape, motility, and tip growth of eukaryotic cells. We  report that a novel Armadillo repeat protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, ARMADILLO  REPEAT ONLY1 (ARO1), is of fundamental importance for polar growth and F-actin  organization in tip-growing pollen tubes. ARO1 is specifically expressed in the  vegetative cell of pollen as well as in the egg cell. ARO1-GFP (for green  fluorescent protein) fusion proteins accumulate most notably in pollen tube tips  and partially colocalize with F-actin in the shank of pollen tubes. ARO1 knockout  results in a highly disorganized actin cytoskeleton, growth depolarization, and  ultimately tube growth arrest. Tip-localized ARO1-GFP is spatially shifted toward  the future site of tip growth, indicating a role of ARO1 in the signaling network  controlling tip growth and regulating actin organization. After the pollen tube  discharges its contents into the receptive synergid, ARO1-GFP colocalizes with  emerging F-actin structures near the site of sperm cell fusion, suggesting  additional participation in the mechanism of sperm cell tracking toward the  female gametes. The variable localization of ARO1 in the cytoplasm, the nucleus,  and at the plasma membrane, however, indicates a multifunctional role like that  of beta-catenin/Armadillo and the p120 catenins.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.061028', 'Sprunck']
