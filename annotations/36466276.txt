In a cross between two homozygous <i>Brassica napus</i> plants of synthetic and natural origin, we demonstrate that novel structural genome variants from the synthetic parent cause immediate genome diversification among F1 offspring. Long read sequencing in twelve F1 sister plants revealed five large-scale structural rearrangements where both parents carried different homozygous alleles but the heterozygous F1 genomes were not identical heterozygotes as expected. Such spontaneous rearrangements were part of homoeologous exchanges or segmental deletions and were identified in different, individual F1 plants. The variants caused deletions, gene copy-number variations, diverging methylation patterns and other structural changes in large numbers of genes and may have been causal for unexpected phenotypic variation between individual F1 sister plants, for example strong divergence of plant height and leaf area. This example supports the hypothesis that spontaneous <i>de novo</i> structural rearrangements after <i>de novo</i> polyploidization can rapidly overcome intense allopolyploidization bottlenecks to re-expand crops genetic diversity for ecogeographical expansion and human selection. The findings imply that natural genome restructuring in allopolyploid plants from interspecific hybridization, a common approach in plant breeding, can have a considerably more drastic impact on genetic diversity in agricultural ecosystems than extremely precise, biotechnological genome modifications.
