Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is an RNA surveillance mechanism that detects aberrant transcript features and triggers degradation of erroneous as well as physiological RNAs. Originally considered to be constitutive, NMD is now recognized to be tightly controlled in response to inherent signals and diverse stresses. To gain a better understanding of NMD regulation and its functional implications, we systematically examined feedback control of the central NMD components in two dicot and one monocot species. On the basis of the analysis of transcript features, turnover rates and steady-state levels, up-frameshift (UPF) 1, UPF3 and suppressor of morphological defects on genitalia (SMG) 7, but not UPF2, are under feedback control in both dicots. In the monocot investigated in this study, only SMG7 was slightly induced upon NMD inhibition. The detection of the endogenous NMD factor proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana substantiated a negative correlation between NMD activity and SMG7 amounts. Furthermore, evidence was provided that SMG7 is required for the dephosphorylation of UPF1. Our comprehensive and comparative study of NMD feedback control in plants reveals complex and species-specific attenuation of this RNA surveillance pathway, with critical implications for the numerous functions of NMD in physiology and stress responses.
