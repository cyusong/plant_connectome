We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of xylans in the cell walls of differentiating earlywood tracheids of Cryptomeria japonica using two different types of monoclonal antibodies (LM10 and LM11) combined with immunomicroscopy. Xylans were first deposited in the corner of the S(1) layer in the early stages of S(1) formation in tracheids. Cell corner middle lamella also showed strong xylan labeling from the early stage of cell wall formation. During secondary cell wall formation, the innermost layer and the boundary between the S(1) and S(2) layers (S(1)/S(2) region) showed weaker labeling than other parts of the cell wall. However, mature tracheids had an almost uniform distribution of xylans throughout the entire cell wall. Xylan localization labeled with LM10 antibody was stronger in the outer S(2) layer than in the inner layer, whereas xylans labeled with LM11 antibody were almost uniformly distributed in the S(2) layer. In addition, the LM10 antibody showed almost no xylan labeling in the S(1)/S(2) region, whereas the LM11 antibody revealed strong xylan labeling in the S(1)/S(2) region. These findings suggest that structurally different types of xylans may be deposited in the tracheid cell wall depending on the developmental stage of, or location in, the cell wall. Our study also indicates that deposition of xylans in the early stages of tracheid cell wall formation may be spatially consistent with the early stage of lignin deposition in the tracheid cell wall.
