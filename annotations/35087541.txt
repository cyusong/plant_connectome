['35087541', 'Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) play fundamental roles in  cell-to-cell and plant-environment communication. LRR-RLKs can function as  receptors perceiving endogenous or external ligands, or as coreceptors, which  stabilize the complex, and enhance transduction of the intracellular signal. The  LRR-RLK BAK1 is a coreceptor for different developmental and immunity pathways.  In this article, we identified PXY-CORRELATED 3 (PXC3) as a BAK1-interacting  LRR-RLK, which was previously reported to be transcribed in vascular tissues  co-expressed with PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY), the receptor of the  TDIF/CLE41 peptide. Characterization of pxc3 loss-of-function mutants revealed  reduced hypocotyl stele width and vascular cells compared to wild type,  indicating that PXC3 plays a role in the vascular development in Arabidopsis.  Furthermore, our data suggest that PXC3 might function as a positive regulator of  the CLE41/TDIF-TDR/PXY signaling pathway.', '2021', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2021.706633', 'Fernandez']
