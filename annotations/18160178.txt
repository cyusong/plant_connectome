Two APETALA2 domain transcription factors were characterized first in angiosperms, and, recently, in several gymnosperms. These proteins are involved in several processes, from flowering to embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We extrapolated this result to hybrid larch (Larixxmarschlinsii Coaz) resulting from a cross between European (Larix decidua) and Japanese (Larix kaempferi) larches. Somatic embryogenesis is well described and controlled for this Pinaceae. We characterized two-AP2 domain genes: LmAP2L1 and LmAP2L2. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that LmAP2L1 and LmAP2L2 were orthologous to Norway spruce PaAP2L1 and PaAP2L2 and that L1 forms appeared to be specific to Pinaceae. RT-PCR analysis showed that larch APETALA2 was differentially expressed during late somatic embryogenesis and during the first steps of germination. Whereas LmAP2L2 was constitutively expressed during this process, LmAP2L1 expression appeared only during late somatic embryogenesis, when embryos were able to germinate. Further, LmAP2L1 appeared to be the preferentially expressed form during embryo germination. Thus, LmAP2L1 seems to be a valuable molecular marker for hybrid larch late somatic embryogenesis and could play a role during post-embryonic development.
