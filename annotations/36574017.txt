Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed nanoparticles that deliver bioactive proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other small molecules from donor to recipient cells. They have attracted significant interest recently due to their important roles in regulating plant-microbe interaction. During microbial infection, plant EVs play a prominent role in defense by delivering small regulatory RNA into pathogens, resulting in the silencing of pathogen virulence genes. Pathogens also deliver small RNAs into plant cells to silence host immunity genes. Recent evidence indicates that microbial EVs may be involved in pathogenesis and host immunity modulation by transporting RNAs and other biomolecules. However, the biogenesis and function of microbial EVs in plant-microbe interaction remain ill-defined. In this review, we discuss various aspects of microbial EVs, with a particular focus on current methods for EV isolation, composition, biogenesis, and their roles in plant-microbe interaction. We also discussed the potential role of microbial EVs in cross-kingdom RNA trafficking from pathogens to plants, as it is a highly likely possibility to explore in the future.
