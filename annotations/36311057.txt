The current study looked at the plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits of the pre-isolated and metal-tolerant <i>Bacillus cereus</i> NDRMN001 as well as their stimulatory effect on the physiology, biomolecule content, and phytoremediation potential of <i>Cajanus cajan</i> (L.) Millsp. on metal-polluted soil. The bauxite mine, which is surrounded by farmland (1 km away), has been severely polluted by metals such as Cd (31.24 ± 1.68), Zn (769.57 ± 3.46), Pb (326.85 ± 3.43), Mn (2519.6 ± 5.71), and Cr (302.34 ± 1.62 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) that exceeded Indian standards. The metal-tolerant <i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001 had excellent PGP activities such as synthesis of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), siderophore, indole acetic acid (IAA), N<sub>2</sub> fixation, and P solubilization. Furthermore, the optimal growth conditions (temperature of 30°C, pH 6.5, 6% glucose, 9% tryptophan, and 1.5% tricalcium phosphate) for effective synthesis and expression of PGP traits in <i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001 were determined. Such metal-tolerant <i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001 traits can significantly reduce metals in polluted soil, and their PGP traits significantly improve plant growth in polluted soil. Hence, this strain (<i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001) significantly improved the growth and phytoremediation potential of <i>C. cajan</i> (L.) Millsp on metal-polluted soil without [study I: 2 kg of sieved and autoclaved metal-polluted soil seeded with bacterium-free <i>C. cajan</i> (L.) Millsp. seeds] and with [study II: 2 kg of sieved and autoclaved metal-polluted soil seeded with <i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001-coated <i>C. cajan</i> (L.) Millsp. seeds] <i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001 amalgamation. Fertile soil was used as control. The physiological parameters, biomolecule contents, and the phytoremediation (Cr: 7.74, Cd: 12.15, Zn: 16.72, Pb: 11.47, and Mn: 14.52 mg g<sup>-1</sup>) potential of <i>C. cajan</i> (L.) Millsp. were significantly effective in study II due to the metal-solubilizing and PGP traits of <i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001. These results conclude that the test bacteria <i>B. cereus</i> NDRMN001 considerably improved the phytoremediation competence of <i>C. cajan</i> (L.) Millsp. on metal-polluted soil in a greenhouse study.
