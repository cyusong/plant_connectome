Demographic studies measure drivers of plant fecundity including seed production and survival, but few address both abiotic and biotic drivers of germination such as variation in climate among sites, population density, maternal plants, seed type and fungal pathogen abundance. We examined germination and microbial communities of seeds of Danthonia californica, which are either chasmogamous (external, wind-pollinated) or cleistogamous (internal, self-fertilized) and Festuca roemeri, which are solely chasmogamous. Seed populations were sourced across environmental gradients. We tested germination and used high-throughput sequencing to characterize seed fungal community structure. For F. roemeri, maternal plants significantly influenced germination as did climate and pathogens; germination increased from wetter, cooler sites. For D. californica, the main drivers of germination were maternal plant, seed type and pathogens; on average, more chasmogamous seeds germinated. Fungal communities depended largely on seed type, with fewer fungi associated with cleistogamous seeds, but the communities also depended on site factors such as vapor pressure deficit, plant density and whether the seeds had germinated. Putative pathogens that were negatively correlated with germination were more abundant for both D. californica and F. roemeri chasmogamous seeds than D. californica cleistogamous seeds. In D. californica, cleistogamous and chasmogamous seeds contain vastly different fungal communities.
