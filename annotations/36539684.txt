Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a herb within the Quinoa subfamily of Amaranthaceae, with remarkable environmental adaptability. Its edible young leaves and grains are rich in protein, amino acids, microorganisms, and minerals. Although assessing the effects of fertilization on quinoa yield and quality has become an intensive area of research focus, the associated underlying mechanisms remain unclear. As one of the three macro nutrients in plants, potassium has an important impact on plant growth and development. In this study, extensive metabolome and transcriptome analyses were conducted in quinoa seedlings 30 days after fertilizer application to characterize the growth response mechanism to potassium.  RESULTS: The differential metabolites and genes present in the seedlings of white and red quinoa cultivars were significantly enriched in the photosynthetic pathway. Moreover, the PsbQ enzyme on photosystem II and delta enzyme on ATP synthase were significantly down regulated in quinoa seedlings under potassium deficiency. Additionally, the differential metabolites and genes of red quinoa seedlings were significantly enriched in the arginine biosynthetic pathway. These findings provide a more thorough understanding of the molecular changes in quinoa seedlings that occur under deficient, relative to normal, potassium levels. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical basis regarding the importance of potassium fertilizers, as well as their efficient utilization by growing quinoa seedlings.
