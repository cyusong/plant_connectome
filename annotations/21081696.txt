['21081696', 'Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in cell structure and in multiple plant  developmental processes. beta-Ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KASI)  catalyzes the elongation of de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Here, we report  the functional characterization of KASI in the regulation of chloroplast division  and embryo development. Phenotypic observation of an Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA  insertion mutant, kasI, revealed multiple morphological defects, including  chlorotic (in netted patches) and curly leaves, reduced fertility, and  semidwarfism. There are only one to five enlarged chloroplasts in the mesophyll  cells of chlorotic sectors of young kasI rosette leaves, indicating suppressed  chloroplast division under KASI deficiency. KASI deficiency results in a  significant change in the polar lipid composition, which causes the suppressed  expression of FtsZ and Min system genes, disordered Z-ring placement in the  oversized chloroplast, and inhibited polymerization of FtsZ protein at mid-site  of the chloroplast in kasI. In addition, KASI deficiency results in disrupted  embryo development before the globular stage and dramatically reduces FA levels  (~33.6% of the wild type) in seeds. These results demonstrate that de novo FA  synthesis is crucial and has pleiotropic effects on plant growth. The polar lipid  supply is important for chloroplast division and development, revealing a key  function of FA synthesis in plastid development.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.075564', 'Xue']
