Iron (Fe) plays an important role in cellular respiration and catalytic reactions of metalloproteins in plants and animals. Plants maintain iron homeostasis through absorption, translocation, storage, and compartmentalization of iron <i>via</i> a cooperative regulative network. Here, we showed different physiological characteristics in the leaves and roots of <i>Malus baccata</i> under Fe sufficiency and Fe deficiency conditions and propose that <i>MbHY5</i> (elongated hypocotyl 5), an important transcription factor for its function in photomorphogenesis, participated in Fe deficiency response in both the leaves and roots of <i>M. baccata</i>. The gene co-expression network showed that <i>MbHY5</i> was involved in the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis and Fe transport pathway under Fe-limiting conditions. Specifically, we found that Fe deficiency induced the expression of <i>MbYSL7</i> in root, which was positively regulated by <i>MbHY5.</i> Overexpressing or silencing <i>MbYSL7</i> influenced the expression of <i>MbHY5</i> in <i>M. baccata.</i>
