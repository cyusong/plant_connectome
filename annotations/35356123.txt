At present, the alleviation of stress caused by climate change and environmental contaminants is a crucial issue. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) and an organochlorine, which causes significant health problems in humans. The stress caused by cadmium (Cd) and the toxicity of DDT have direct effects on the growth and yield of crop plants. Ultimately, the greater uptake and accumulation of DDT by edible plants affects human health by contaminating the food chain. The possible solution to this challenging situation is to limit the passive absorption of POPs into the plants. Calcium (Ca) is an essential life component mandatory for plant growth and survival. This study used impregnated Ca (Bd<sub>Ca</sub>) of benzenedicarboxylic acid (Bd) to relieve abiotic stress in plants of <i>Brassica alboglabra</i>. Bd<sub>Ca</sub> mitigated the deleterious effects of Cd and reduced DDT bioaccumulation. By increasing the removal efficacy (RE) up to 256.14%, Bd<sub>Ca</sub> greatly decreased pollutant uptake (Cd 82.37% and DDT 93.64%) and supported photosynthetic machinery (86.22%) and antioxidant enzyme defenses (264.73%), in applied plants. Exogenously applied Bd also successfully improved the antioxidant system and the physiochemical parameters of plants. However, impregnation with Ca further enhanced plant tolerance to stress. This novel study revealed that the combined application of Ca and Bd could effectively relieve individual and combined Cd stress and DDT toxicity in <i>B. alboglabra</i>.
