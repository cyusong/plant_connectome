['21187394', 'Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is an integral part of  the ER quality-control system that removes toxic misfolded proteins via  ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation. Most of our knowledge on ERAD comes  from biochemical and genetic studies in yeast and mammalian cells. Although ERAD  is known to operate in plant cells, little is known about its molecular  components and its biochemical mechanism. A genetic screen for suppressors of the  Arabidopsis bri1-9, a weak dwarf mutant caused by ER retention of a structurally  defective yet biochemically competent brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRI1,  resulted in identification of the EMS-mutagenized bri1 suppressor 5 (EBS5) gene  that encodes an Arabidopsis homolog of the yeast Hrd3/mammalian Sel1L protein  known to be involved in ERAD. Loss-of-function ebs5 mutations block the ERAD of  bri1-9 and bri1-5, another ER-retained BR receptor. We showed that EBS5  complemented the ERAD defect of the yeast Deltahrd3 mutant and interacted with the  two mutated BR receptors in plant cells. Using a reverse genetic approach, we  discovered that two Arabidopsis homologs of the yeast/mammalian Hrd1, an ER  membrane-localized ubiquitin ligase, function redundantly in the ERAD of bri1-9.  Together, our results revealed functional roles of two conserved ERAD components  in degrading mutated/misfolded receptor-like kinases in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Jan 11', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1013251108', 'Li']
