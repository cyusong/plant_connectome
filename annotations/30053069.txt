Seed ageing is a major problem in the conservation of germplasm resources. The involvement of possible signalling molecules during seed deterioration needs to be identified. In this study, we confirmed that nitric oxide (NO), a key signalling molecule in plants, plays a positive role in the resistance of elm seeds to deterioration. To explore which metabolic pathways were affected by NO, an untargeted metabolomic analysis was conducted, and 163 metabolites could respond to both NO and the ageing treatment. The primary altered pathways include glutathione, methionine, and carbohydrate metabolism. The genes involved in glutathione and methionine metabolism were up-regulated by NO at the transcriptional level. Using a biotin switch method, proteins with an NO-dependent post-translational modification were screened during seed deterioration, and 82 putative S-nitrosylated proteins were identified. Eleven of these proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and the activities of the three enzymes were regulated by NO. In combination, the results of the metabolomic and S-nitrosoproteomic studies demonstrated that NO could activate glycolysis and inhibit the pentose phosphate pathway. In summary, the combination of these results demonstrated that NO could modulate carbohydrate metabolism at the post-translational level and regulate glutathione and methionine metabolism at the transcriptional level. It provides initial insights into the regulatory mechanisms of NO in seed deterioration.
