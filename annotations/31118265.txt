['31118265', "High salinity is an increasingly prevalent source of stress to which plants must  adapt. The receptor-like protein kinases, including members of the Cys-rich  receptor-like kinase (CRK) subfamily, are a highly expanded family of  transmembrane proteins in plants that are largely responsible for communication  between cells and the extracellular environment. Various CRKs have been  implicated in biotic and abiotic stress responses; however, their functions on a  cellular level remain largely uncharacterized. Here we have shown that CRK2  enhances salt tolerance at the germination stage in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) and also modulates root length. We established that functional CRK2 is  required for salt-induced callose deposition. In doing so, we revealed a role for  callose deposition in response to increased salinity and demonstrated its  importance for salt tolerance during germination. Using fluorescently tagged  proteins, we observed specific changes in the subcellular localization of CRK2 in  response to various stress treatments. Many of CRK2's cellular functions were  dependent on phospholipase D activity, as were the subcellular localization  changes. Thus, we propose that CRK2 acts downstream of phospholipase D during  salt stress, promoting callose deposition and regulating plasmodesmal  permeability, and that CRK2 adopts specific stress-dependent subcellular  localization patterns that allow it to carry out its functions.", '2019 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00560', 'ORCID:']
