['14570879', 'An embryo-defective mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana was isolated that arrests  development at a variety of stages, from as early as the globular stage of  embryogenesis to as late as formation of an abnormal bent cotyledon stage embryo.  Defects in the suspensor, a normally transient structure derived from the  fertilized egg, were often associated with the arrested embryo. The lesion was  within a gene encoding a protein with domains characteristic of lariat  debranching enzymes, which has been named AtDBR1 (for Arabidopsis thaliana  Debranching enzyme 1). Cleavage of the 2\'-5\'-phosphodiester bond found in excised  intron lariats ("debranching") is essential for turnover of intronic sequences as  well as generation of some small nucleolar RNAs. The mutation within AtDBR1 was  confirmed by complementation as being responsible for the embryo-lethal  phenotype, and the activity of the encoded protein in cleavage of  2\'-5\'-phosphodiester bonds was verified using an in vitro debranching assay.', '2004 Jan 9', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M309106200', 'Perry']
