The transcription factor <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) is known as a master regulator of fatty acid synthesis in developing oilseeds of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and other species. <i>WRI1</i> is known to directly stimulate the expression of many fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and a few targets in the lower part of the glycolytic pathway. However, it remains unclear to what extent and how the conversion of sugars into fatty acid biosynthetic precursors is controlled by <i>WRI</i>1. To shortlist possible gene targets for future <i>in-planta</i> experimental validation, here we present a strategy that combines phylogenetic foot printing of cis-regulatory elements with additional layers of evidence. Upstream regions of protein-encoding genes in <i>A. thaliana</i> were searched for the previously described DNA-binding consensus for WRI1, the ASML1/WRI1 (AW)-box. For about 900 genes, AW-box sites were found to be conserved across orthologous upstream regions in 11 related species of the crucifer family. For 145 select potential target genes identified this way, affinity of upstream AW-box sequences to WRI1 was assayed by Microscale Thermophoresis. This allowed definition of a refined WRI1 DNA-binding consensus. We find that known WRI1 gene targets are predictable with good confidence when upstream AW-sites are phylogenetically conserved, specifically binding WRI1 in the <i>in vitro</i> assay, positioned in proximity to the transcriptional start site, and if the gene is co-expressed with WRI1 during seed development. When targets predicted in this way are mapped to central metabolism, a conserved regulatory blueprint emerges that infers concerted control of contiguous pathway sections in glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis by WRI1. Several of the newly predicted targets are in the upper glycolysis pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway. Of these, plastidic isoforms of fructokinase (<i>FRK</i>3) and of phosphoglucose isomerase (<i>PGI</i>1) are particularly corroborated by previously reported seed phenotypes of respective null mutations.
