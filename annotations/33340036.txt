Seeds are major vehicles of propagation and dispersal in plants. A number of transcription factors, including APETALA2 (AP2), play crucial roles during the seed development process in various plant species. However, genes essential for seed development and the regulatory networks that operate during seed development remain unclear in lettuce. Here, we identified a lettuce AP2 (LsAP2) gene that was highly expressed during the early stages of seed development. LsAP2 knockout plants obtained by the CRISPR/Cas9 system were used to explore the biological function of LsAP2. Compared with the wild type, the seeds of Lsap2 mutant plants were longer and narrower, and developed an extended tip at the seed top. After further investigating the structural characteristics of the seeds of Lsap2 mutant plants, we proposed a new function of LsAP2 in seed dispersal. Moreover, we identified several interactors of LsAP2. Our results showed that LsAP2 directly interacted with the lettuce homolog of BREVIPEDICELLUS (LsBP) and promoted the expression of LsBP. Transcriptome analysis revealed that LsAP2 might also be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and signaling pathways. Taken together, our data indicate that LsAP2 has a significant function in regulating seed shape in lettuce.
