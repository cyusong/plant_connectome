Laser microdissection was used as a tool to harvest secretory cavities (SC) from leaves of Dilatris pillansii Barker (Haemodoraceae) and from leaves and flowers of herbarium specimens of Dilatris corymbosa Berg. and Dilatris viscosa L. Cryogenic (1)H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC analysis of microdissected samples indicated specific accumulation of methoxyphenylphenalenones in the SC. The structures of two novel and a known natural product in the secretory tissue were confirmed by comparison with authentic compounds isolated from rhizomes and roots from which further phenylphenalenones and phenylphenalenone glucosides were isolated and identified by spectroscopic methods. How it will be possible to use the LMD technique to localize natural products in specific plant cell populations is also discussed.
