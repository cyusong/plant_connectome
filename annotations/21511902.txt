MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play essential roles in plant growth, development, and stress response. Populus euphratica is a typical abiotic stress-resistant woody species. This study presents an efficient method for genome-wide discovery of new drought stress responsive miRNAs in P. euphratica. High-throughput sequencing of P. euphratica leaves found 197 conserved miRNAs between P. euphratica and Populus trichocarpa. Meanwhile, 58 new miRNAs belonging to 38 families were identified, an increase in the number of P. euphratica miRNAs. Twenty-six new and 21 conserved miRNA targets were verified by degradome sequencing, and target annotation showed that these targets were involved in multiple biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and response to stimulus. Furthermore, comparison of high-throughput sequencing with miRNA microarray profiling data indicated that 104 miRNA sequences were up-regulated, whereas 27 were down-regulated under drought stress. This preliminary characterization provides a framework for future analysis of miRNA genes and their roles in key poplar traits such as stress resistance, and could be useful for plant breeding and environmental protection.
