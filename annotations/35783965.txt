Superoxide dismutase (SOD) proteins are important antioxidant enzymes that help plants to grow, develop, and respond to a variety of abiotic stressors. SOD gene family has been identified in a number of plant species but not yet in <i>Daucus carota</i>. A total of 9 DcSOD genes, comprising 2 FeSODs, 2 MnSODs, and 5 Cu/ZnSODs, are identified in the complete genome of <i>D. carota</i>, which are dispersed in five out of nine chromosomes. Based on phylogenetic analysis, SOD proteins from <i>D. carota</i> were categorized into two main classes (Cu/ZnSODs and MnFeSODs). It was predicted that members of the same subgroups have the same subcellular location. The phylogenetic analysis was further validated by sequence motifs, exon-intron structure, and 3D protein structures, with each subgroup having a similar gene and protein structure. <i>Cis</i>-regulatory elements responsive to abiotic stresses were identified in the promoter region, which may contribute to their differential expression. Based on RNA-seq data, tissue-specific expression revealed that <i>DcCSD2</i> had higher expression in both xylem and phloem. Moreover, <i>DcCSD2</i> was differentially expressed in dark stress. All SOD genes were subjected to qPCR analysis after cold, heat, salt, or drought stress imposition. SODs are antioxidants and play a critical role in removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). DcSODs were docked with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to evaluate their binding. The findings of this study will serve as a basis for further functional insights into the DcSOD gene family.
