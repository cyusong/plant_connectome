['11443110', 'A new component of the chloroplast proteolytic machinery from Arabidopsis  thaliana was identified as a SppA-type protease. The sequence of the mature  protein, deduced from a full-length cDNA, displays 22% identity to the  serine-type protease IV (SppA) from Escherichia coli and 27% identity to  Synechocystis SppA1 (sll1703) but lacks the putative transmembrane spanning  segments predicted from the E. coli sequence. The N-terminal sequence exhibits  typical features of a cleavable chloroplast stroma-targeting sequence. The  chloroplast localization of SppA was confirmed by in organello import experiments  using an in vitro expression system and by immunodetection with antigen-specific  antisera. Subfractionation of intact chloroplasts demonstrated that SppA is  associated exclusively with thylakoid membranes, predominantly stroma lamellae,  and is a part of some high molecular mass complex of about 270 kDa that exhibits  proteolytic activity. Treatments with chaotropic salts and proteases showed that  SppA is largely exposed to the stroma but that it behaves as an intrinsic  membrane protein that may have an unusual monotopic arrangement in the  thylakoids. We demonstrate that SppA is a light-inducible protease and discuss  its possible involvement in the light-dependent degradation of antenna and  photosystem II complexes that both involve serine-type proteases.', '2001 Sep 7', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M100506200', 'Sokolenko']
