['10743655', 'The ABI3 locus is a major regulator of embryo development in Arabidopsis and is  essential for the simultaneous activation of the maturation pathway, as well as  repression of germination and seedling development. We used a two-hybrid screen  in yeast in order to identify proteins that interact with ABI3. Four  ABI3-interacting proteins (AIPs) were identified which showed specific in vivo  and in vitro interactions with the C-terminal region of ABI3 that contains the B2  and B3 domains, previously shown to have DNA binding activity. The expression  characteristics of the genes encoding the AIPs have also been analysed in  wild-type and abi3, lec1 and fus3 embryo mutants. This analysis demonstrated  differential expression of these genes during normal embryo development and in  the mutant lines. All the AIPs show homology to existing transcription factors  and therefore they may function with ABI3 within the network of transcriptional  regulators that control embryo development in Arabidopsis.', '2000 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00663.x', 'Holdsworth']
