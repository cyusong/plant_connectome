Yellowhorn (<i>Xanthoceras sorbifolia</i>) is a species of deciduous tree that is native to Northern and Central China, including Loess Plateau. The yellowhorn tree is a hardy plant, tolerating a wide range of growing conditions, and is often grown for ornamental purposes in parks, gardens, and other landscaped areas. The seeds of yellowhorn are edible and contain rich oil and fatty acid contents, making it an ideal plant for oil production. However, the mechanism of its ability to adapt to extreme environments and the genetic basis of oil synthesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we reported a high-quality and near gap-less yellowhorn genome assembly, containing the highest genome continuity with a contig N50 of 32.5 Mb. Comparative genomics analysis showed that 1,237 and 231 gene families under expansion and the yellowhorn-specific gene family NB-ARC were enriched in photosynthesis and root cap development, which may contribute to the environmental adaption and abiotic stress resistance of yellowhorn. A 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (<i>KAT</i>) gene (<i>Xso_LG02_00600</i>) was identified under positive selection, which may be associated with variations of seed oil content among different yellowhorn cultivars. This study provided insights into environmental adaptation and seed oil content variations of yellowhorn to accelerate its genetic improvement.
