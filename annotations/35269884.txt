Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) based on trans-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) has been successfully exploited to engineer host resistance to pests and pathogens, including fungi and oomycetes. However, revealing the mechanisms underlying trans-kingdom RNAi between hosts and pathogens lags behind applications. The effectiveness and durability of trans-kingdom silencing of pathogenic genes are uncharacterized. In this study, using our transgenic <i>35S-VdH1i</i> cotton plants in which dsVdH1-derived small RNAs (siVdH1) accumulated, small RNA sequencing analysis revealed that siVdH1s exclusively occur within the double-stranded (ds)VdH1 region, and no transitive siRNAs were produced beyond this region in recovered hyphae of <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (<i>V. dahliae</i>). Accordingly, we found that <i>VdH1</i> silencing was reduced over time in recovered hyphae cultured in vitro, inferring that once the fungus got rid of the <i>35S-VdH1i</i> cotton plants would gradually regain their pathogenicity. To explore whether continually exporting dsRNAs/siRNAs from transgenic plants into recipient fungal cells guaranteed the effectiveness and stability of HIGS, we created GFP/RFP double-labeled <i>V. dahliae</i> and transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> expressing dsGFP (<i>35S</i>-<i>GFPi</i> plants). Confocal images visually demonstrate the efficient silencing of <i>GFP</i> in <i>V. dahliae</i> that colonized host vascular tissues. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HIGS effectively triggers long-lasting trans-kingdom RNAi during plant vasculature <i>V. dahliae</i> interactions, despite no amplification or transitivity of RNAi being noted in this soil-borne fungal pathogen.
