Known for their regulatory roles in stem cell homeostasis, CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptides also function as mediators of external stimuli such as hormones. De novo shoot regeneration, representing the remarkable plant cellular plasticity, involves reconstitution of stem cells under control of stem-cell regulators. Yet whether and how stem cell-regulating CLE peptides are implicated in plant regeneration remains unknown. By CRISPR/Cas9-induced loss-of-function studies, peptide application, precursor overexpression, and expression analyses, the role of CLE1-CLE7 peptides and their receptors in de novo shoot regeneration was studied in Arabidopsis thaliana. CLE1-CLE7 are induced by callus-induction medium and dynamically expressed in pluripotent callus. Exogenously-applied CLE1-CLE7 peptides or precursor overexpression effectively leads to shoot regeneration suppression, whereas their simultaneous mutation results in enhanced regenerative capacity, demonstrating that CLE1-CLE7 peptides redundantly function as negative regulators of de novo shoot regeneration. CLE1-CLE7-mediated shoot regeneration suppression is impaired in loss-of-function mutants of callus-expressed CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and BARELY ANY MERISTEM1 (BAM1) genes, indicating that CLV1/BAM1 are required for CLE1-CLE7-mediated shoot regeneration signaling. CLE1-CLE7 signaling resulted in transcriptional repression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a stem cell-promoting transcription factor known as a principal regulator of plant regeneration. Our results indicate that functionally-redundant CLE1-CLE7 peptides genetically act through CLV1/BAM1 receptors and repress WUS expression to modulate shoot-regeneration capacity, establishing the mechanistic basis for CLE1-CLE7-mediated shoot regeneration and a novel role for CLE peptides in hormone-dependent developmental plasticity.
