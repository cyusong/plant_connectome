['17991753', 'Previous work on intact thylakoid membranes showed that transient formation of a  zeaxanthin radical cation was correlated with regulation of photosynthetic  light-harvesting via energy-dependent quenching. A molecular mechanism for such  quenching was proposed to involve charge transfer within a chlorophyll-zeaxanthin  heterodimer. Using near infrared (880-1100 nm) transient absorption spectroscopy,  we demonstrate that carotenoid (mainly zeaxanthin) radical cation generation  occurs solely in isolated minor light-harvesting complexes that bind zeaxanthin,  consistent with the engagement of charge transfer quenching therein. We estimated  that less than 0.5% of the isolated minor complexes undergo charge transfer  quenching in vitro, whereas the fraction of minor complexes estimated to be  engaged in charge transfer quenching in isolated thylakoids was more than 80  times higher. We conclude that minor complexes which bind zeaxanthin are sites of  charge transfer quenching in vivo and that they can assume Non-quenching and  Quenching conformations, the equilibrium LHC(N) <==> LHC(Q) of which is modulated  by the transthylakoid pH gradient, the PsbS protein, and protein-protein  interactions.', '2008 Feb 8', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M705645200', 'Fleming']
