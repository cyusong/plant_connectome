Insect vector-borne diseases are a major constraint to a wide variety of crops. Plants integrate environmental light and internal signalings to defend dual stresses both from the vector insects and vector-transmitted pathogens. In this review, we highlight a studies that demonstrate how light regulates plants deploying mechanisms against vector-borne diseases. Four major host defensive pathways involved in the host defense network against multiple biotic stresses are reviewed: innate immunity, phytohormone signaling, RNA interference, and protein degradation. The potential with light-engineering technology with light emitting diodes (LEDs) and genome engineering technology for fine-tuning crop defense and yield are also discussed.
