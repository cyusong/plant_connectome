['18378899', 'Phototropins are autophosphorylating protein kinases of plant-specific blue light  receptors. They regulate various blue light responses, including phototropism,  chloroplast movements, hypocotyl growth inhibition, leaf flattening, and stomatal  opening. However, the physiological role of autophosphorylation remains unknown.  Here, we identified phosphorylation sites of Ser or Thr in the N terminus, Hinge1  region, kinase domain, and C terminus in Arabidopsis phototropin1 (phot1) by  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in vivo. We substituted these Ser  or Thr residues with Ala in phot1 and analyzed their functions by inspecting the  phot1-mediated responses of stomatal opening, phototropism, chloroplast  accumulation, and leaf flattening after the transformation of the phot1 phot2  double mutant. Among these sites, we found that autophosphorylation of Ser-851 in  the activation loop of the kinase domain was required for the responses mentioned  above, whereas the phosphorylation of the other Ser and Thr, except those in the  activation loop, was not. Ser-849 in the loop may have an additional role in the  responses. Immunological analysis revealed that Ser-851 was phosphorylated  rapidly by blue light in a fluence-dependent manner and dephosphorylated  gradually upon darkness. We conclude that autophosphorylation of Ser-851 is a  primary step that mediates signaling between photochemical reaction and  physiological events.', '2008 Apr 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0709189105', 'Shimazaki']
