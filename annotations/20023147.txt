Transporters move hydrophilic substrates across hydrophobic biological membranes and play key roles in plant nutrition, metabolism, and signaling and, consequently, in plant growth, development, and responses to the environment. To initiate and support systematic characterization of transporters in the model legume Medicago truncatula, we identified 3,830 transporters and classified 2,673 of these into 113 families and 146 subfamilies. Analysis of gene expression data for 2,611 of these transporters identified 129 that are expressed in an organ-specific manner, including 50 that are nodule specific and 36 specific to mycorrhizal roots. Further analysis uncovered 196 transporters that are induced at least 5-fold during nodule development and 44 in roots during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Among the nodule- and mycorrhiza-induced transporter genes are many candidates for known transport activities in these beneficial symbioses. The data presented here are a unique resource for the selection and functional characterization of legume transporters.
