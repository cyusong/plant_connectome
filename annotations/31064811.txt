Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a common signal molecule initiating transcriptional responses to all the known biotic and abiotic stresses of land plants. However, the degree of involvement of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in these stress responses has not yet been well studied. Here we identify time-dependent transcriptome profiles stimulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> application in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Promoter prediction based on transcriptome data suggests strong crosstalk among high light, heat, and wounding stress responses in terms of environmental stresses and between the abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) responses in terms of phytohormone signaling. Quantitative analysis revealed that ABA accumulation is induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but SA is not, suggesting that the implied crosstalk with ABA is achieved through ABA accumulation while the crosstalk with SA is different. We identified potential direct regulatory pairs between regulator transcription factor (TF) proteins and their regulated TF genes based on the time-course transcriptome analysis for the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> response, in vivo regulation of the regulated TF by the regulator TF identified by expression analysis of mutants and overexpressors, and in vitro binding of the regulator TF protein to the target TF promoter. These analyses enabled the establishment of part of the transcriptional regulatory network for the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> response composed of 15 regulatory pairs of TFs, including five pairs previously reported. This regulatory network is suggested to be involved in a wide range of biotic and abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis.
