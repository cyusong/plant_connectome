['21575088', "Currently, there are strong inconsistencies in our knowledge of plant  heterotrimeric G-proteins that suggest the existence of additional members of the  family. We have identified a new Arabidopsis G-protein gamma-subunit (AGG3) that  modulates morphological development and ABA-regulation of stomatal aperture. AGG3  strongly interacts with the Arabidopsis G-protein beta-subunit in vivo and in vitro.  Most importantly, AGG3-deficient mutants account for all but one of the 'orphan'  phenotypes previously unexplained by the two known gamma-subunits in Arabidopsis.  AGG3 has unique characteristics never before observed in plant or animal systems,  such as its size (more than twice that of canonical gamma-subunits) and the presence  of a C-terminal Cys-rich domain. AGG3 thus represent a novel class of G-protein  gamma-subunits, widely spread throughout the plant kingdom but not present in  animals. Homologues of AGG3 in rice have been identified as important  quantitative trait loci for grain size and yield, but due to the atypical nature  of the proteins their identity as G-protein subunits was thus far unknown. Our  work demonstrates a similar trend in seeds of Arabidopsis agg3 mutants, and  implicates G-proteins in such a crucial agronomic trait. The discovery of this  highly atypical subunit reinforces the emerging notion that plant and animal  G-proteins have distinct as well as shared evolutionary pathways.", '2011 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04638.x', 'Botella']
