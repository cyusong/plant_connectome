The effect of shading during seed development on subsequent germination remains largely unknown. In this study, two soybean (Glycine max) seed production systems, monocropping (MC) and maize-soybean intercropping (IC), were employed to examine the effects of shading of the mother plant on subsequent seed germination. Compared to the MC soybean seeds, which received light, the developing IC seeds were exposed to shade resulting from the taller neighboring maize plants. The IC seeds germinated faster than the MC seeds, although there was no significant difference in the thickness of the seed coat. The concentration of soluble pro-anthocyanidin in the IC seed coat was significantly lower than that in the MC seed coat. Changes in the concentrations of several types of fatty acids in IC seeds were also observed, the nature of which were consistent with the effect on germination. The expression levels of genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis were down-regulated in IC seeds, while the transcription levels of the genes related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis were up-regulated. This was consistently reflected in decreased ABA concentrations and increased active GA4 concentrations in IC seeds, resulting in an increased GA4/ABA ratio. Our results thus indicated that shading of the mother plant during seed development in soybean promoted subsequent germination by mediating the biosynthesis of pro-anthocyanidins, fatty acids, and phytohormones.
