['17237362', 'The class III homeodomain leucine-zipper (HD-ZIP III) genes are thought to be  targets of microRNAs (miRNAs) 165 and 166, but it is not known whether all the  developmental processes affected by mutations of the HD-ZIP III genes could be  recapitulated by an alteration in the expression of miR165 and miR166. Previous  work showed that overexpression of miR166 by activation tagging results in  down-regulation of the ATHB-9/PHV, ATHB-14/PHB and ATHB-15 genes, and  concomitantly causes an enlargement of shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and an  enhancement in vascular development. Here we demonstrated that overexpression of  miR165 causes a drastic reduction in the transcript levels of all five HD-ZIP III  genes in Arabidopsis. The miR165 overexpressors display prominent phenotypes  reminiscent of loss-of-function mutants of rev phb phv and rev/ifl1, including  loss of SAM, alteration of organ polarity, abnormal formation of carpels,  inhibition of vascular development and aberrant differentiation of  interfascicular fibers. Global gene expression analysis revealed a link between  miR165 overexpression and altered expression of genes involved in auxin signaling  and vascular development. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of miR165  recapitulates the phenotypes caused by loss-of-function mutations of HD-ZIP III  genes, such as loss of SAM, altered organ polarity and defects in development of  vascular tissues and interfascicular fibers.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcm008', 'Ye']
