In the age of genomics-based crop improvement, a high-quality genome of a local landrace adapted to the local environmental conditions is critically important. Grain amaranths produce highly nutritional grains with a multitude of desirable properties including C4 photosynthesis highly sought-after in other crops. For improving the agronomic traits of grain amaranth and for the transfer of desirable traits to dicot crops, a reference genome of a local landrace is necessary. Toward this end, our lab had initiated sequencing the genome of <i>Amaranthus (A.) hypochondriacus</i> (A.hyp_K_white) and had reported a draft genome in 2014. We selected this landrace because it is well adapted for cultivation in India during the last century and is currently a candidate for TILLING-based crop improvement. More recently, a high-quality chromosome-level assembly of <i>A. hypochondriacus</i> (PI558499, Plainsman) was reported. Here, we report a chromosome-level assembly of A.hyp_K_white (AhKP) using low-coverage PacBio reads, contigs from the reported draft genome of A.hyp_K_white, raw HiC data and reference genome of Plainsman (A.hyp.V.2.1). The placement of A.hyp_K_white on the phylogenetic tree of grain amaranths of known accessions clearly suggests that A.hyp_K_white is genetically distal from Plainsman and is most closely related to the accession PI619259 from Nepal (Ramdana). Furthermore, the classification of another accession, Suvarna, adapted to the local environment and selected for yield and other desirable traits, is clearly <i>Amaranthus cruentus</i>. A classification based on hundreds of thousands of SNPs validated taxonomy-based classification for a majority of the accessions providing the opportunity for reclassification of a few.
