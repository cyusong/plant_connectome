Plant response to various stress conditions often results in expression of common genes, known as stress-responsive/inducible genes. Accumulating data point to a common, yet elusive process underlying the response of plant cells to stress. Evidence derived from transcriptome profiling of shoot apical meristem stem cells, dedifferentiating protoplast cells as well as from senescing cells lends support to a model in which a common response of cells to certain biotic and abiotic stresses converges on cellular dedifferentiation whereby cells first acquire a stem cell-like state before assuming a new fate.
