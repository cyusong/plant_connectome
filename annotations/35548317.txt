Plants are indispensable on earth and their improvement in terms of food security is a need of time. The current study has been designed to investigate how biogenic zinc nanoparticles (Zn NPs) can improve the growth and development of <i>Brassica napus</i> L. In this study, Zn NPs were synthesized utilizing <i>Mentha arvensis</i> aqueous extracts, and their morphological and optical properties were assessed using UV-Visible spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The synthesized Zn NPs were irregular in shape, indicating aggregation in pattern, with an average particle size of 30 nm, while XRD analysis revealed the crystalline structure of nanoparticles. The growth and development of <i>B. napus</i> varieties (Faisal canola and Shiralee) were assessed after foliar treatments with different concentrations of biogenic Zn NPs. In <i>B. napus</i> varieties, exposure to 15 mg/L Zn NPs dramatically increased chlorophyll, carotenoid content, and biomass accumulation. Similarly, proteomic analyses, on the other hand, revealed that proteins associated with photosynthesis, transport, glycolysis, and stress response in both <i>Brassica</i> varieties were substantially altered. Such exposure to Zn NPs, differential expression of genes associated with photosynthesis, ribosome structural constituents, and oxidative stress response were considerably upregulated in <i>B. napus</i> var. (Faisal and Shiralee canola). The results of this study revealed that foliar applications of biogenic Zn NPs influence the transcriptome and protein profiling positively, therefore stimulating plant growth and development.
