Drought stress severely threatens the yield of cereal crops. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of drought stress response of plants is crucial for developing drought-tolerant cultivars. NAC transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in abiotic stress of plants, but the functions of NAC TFs in sorghum are largely unknown. Here, we characterized a sorghum NAC gene, <i>SbNAC9</i>, and found that <i>SbNAC9</i> can be highly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG)-simulated dehydration treatments. We therefore investigated the function of SbNAC9 in drought stress response. Sorghum seedlings overexpressing <i>SbNAC9</i> showed enhanced drought-stress tolerance with higher chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency of PSII, stronger root systems, and higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability than wild-type. In contrast, sorghum seedlings with silenced <i>SbNAC9</i> by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) showed weakened drought stress tolerance. Furthermore, SbNAC9 can directly activate a putative peroxidase gene <i>SbC5YQ75</i> and a putative ABA biosynthesis gene <i>SbNCED3</i>. Silencing <i>SbC5YQ75</i> and <i>SbNCED3</i> led to compromised drought tolerance and reduced ABA content of sorghum seedlings, respectively. Therefore, our findings revealed the important role of SbNAC9 in response to drought stress in sorghum and may shed light on genetic improvement of other crop species under drought-stress conditions.
