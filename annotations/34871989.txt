Photosynthesis plays an important role in plant growth and development. Increasing photosynthetic rate is a main objective of improving crop productivity. Chlorophyll fluorescence is an effective method for quickly evaluating photosynthesis. In this study, four representative chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, that is, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II, quantum efficiency of PSII, photochemical quenching, and non-photochemical quenching, of 219 diverse soybean accessions were measured across three environments. The underlying genetic architecture was analyzed by genome-wide association study. Forty-eight SNPs were detected to associate with the four traits and explained 10.43-20.41% of the phenotypic variation. Nine candidate genes in the stable QTLs were predicted. Great differences in the expression levels of the candidate genes existed between the high photosynthetic efficiency accessions and low photosynthetic efficiency accessions. In all, we uncover 17 QTLs associated with photosynthesis-related traits and nine genes that may participate in the regulation of photosynthesis, which can provide references for revealing the genetic mechanism of photosynthesis. These QTLs and candidate genes will provide new targets for crop yield improvement through increasing photosynthesis.
