GWAS Atlas (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwas/) is a manually curated resource of genome-wide variant-trait associations for a wide range of species. Unlike existing related resources, it features comprehensive integration of a high-quality collection of 75 467 variant-trait associations for 614 traits across 7 cultivated plants (cotton, Japanese apricot, maize, rapeseed, rice, sorghum and soybean) and two domesticated animals (goat and pig), which were manually curated from 254 publications. We integrated these associations into GWAS Atlas and presented them in terms of variants, genes, traits, studies and publications. More importantly, all associations and traits were annotated and organized based on a suite of ontologies (Plant Trait Ontology, Animal Trait Ontology for Livestock, etc.). Taken together, GWAS Atlas integrates high-quality curated GWAS associations for animals and plants and provides user-friendly web interfaces for data browsing and downloading, accordingly serving as a valuable resource for genetic research of important traits and breeding application.
