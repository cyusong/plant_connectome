['10611389', 'Chlorophyllase (Chlase) is the first enzyme involved in chlorophyll (Chl)  degradation and catalyzes the hydrolysis of ester bond to yield chlorophyllide  and phytol. In the present study, we isolated the Chlase cDNA. We synthesized  degenerate oligo DNA probes based on the internal amino acid sequences of  purified Chlase from Chenopodium album, screened the C. album cDNA library, and  cloned a cDNA (CaCLH, C. album chlorophyll-chlorophyllido hydrolase). The deduced  amino acid sequence (347 aa residues) had a lipase motif overlapping with an  ATP/GTP-binding motif (P-loop). CaCLH possibly was localized in the  extraplastidic part of the cell, because a putative signal sequence for  endoplasmic reticulum is at the N terminus. The amino acid sequence shared 37%  identity with a function-unknown gene whose mRNA is inducible by coronatine and  methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCLH1). We expressed the gene  products of AtCLH1 and of CaCLH in Escherichia coli, and they similarly exhibited  Chlase activity. Moreover, we isolated another full-length cDNA based on an  Arabidopsis genomic fragment and expressed it in E. coli, demonstrating the  presence of the second Arabidopsis CLH gene (AtCLH2). No typical feature of  signal sequence was identified in AtCLH1, whereas AtCLH2 had a typical signal  sequence for chloroplast. AtCLH1 mRNA was induced rapidly by a treatment of MeJA,  which is known to promote senescence and Chl degradation in plants, and a high  mRNA level was maintained up to 9 h. AtCLH2, however, did not respond to MeJA.', '1999 Dec 21', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.96.26.15362', 'Takamiya']
