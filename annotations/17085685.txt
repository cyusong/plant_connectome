['17085685', 'We describe the crystallization and structure elucidation of Arabidopsis thaliana  allene oxide cyclase 2 (AOC2), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of jasmonates. In  a coupled reaction with allene oxide synthase, AOC2 releases the first cyclic and  biologically active metabolite, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA). AOC2 (AT3G25770)  folds into an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a C-terminal partial  helical extension. The protein forms a hydrophobic binding cavity with two  distinct polar patches. AOC2 is trimeric in crystals, in vitro and in planta.  Based on the observed folding pattern, we assigned AOC2 as a low molecular weight  member of the lipocalin family with enzymatic activity in plants. We determined  the binding position of the competitive inhibitor vernolic acid (a substrate  analog) in the binding pocket. Based on models for bound substrate  12,13-epoxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid and product OPDA, we propose a reaction  scheme that explains the influence of the C15 double bond on reactivity. Reaction  is promoted by anchimeric assistance through a conserved Glu residue. The  transition state with a pentadienyl carbocation and an oxyanion is stabilized by  a strongly bound water molecule and favorable pi-pi interactions with aromatic  residues in the cavity. Stereoselectivity results from steric restrictions to the  necessary substrate isomerizations imposed by the protein.', '2006 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.043984', 'Schaller']
