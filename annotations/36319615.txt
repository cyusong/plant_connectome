Preharvest sprouting (PHS) is an unfavorable trait in cereal crops and causes serious yield loss. However, the molecular mechanism underlying PHS remains largely elusive. Here, we identified a member of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase family, OsNCED3, which regulates PHS and grain development in rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsNCED3 encodes a chloroplast-localized abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic enzyme highly expressed in the embryo of developing seeds. Disruption of OsNCED3 by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis led to a lower ABA and higher gibberellic acid (GA) levels (thus a skewed ABA/GA ratio) in the embryo, promoting embryos growth and breaking seed dormancy before seed maturity and harvest, thus decreased seed dormancy and enhanced PHS in rice. However, the overexpression of OsNCED3 enhanced PHS resistance by regulating proper ABA/GA ratio in the embryo. Intriguingly, the overexpression of OsNCED3 resulted in increased grain size and weight, whereas the disruption of OsNCED3 function decreased grain size and weight. Nucleotide diversity analyses suggested that OsNCED3 may be selected during japonica populations adaptation of seed dormancy and germination. Taken together, we have identified a new OsNCED regulator involved rice PHS and grain development, and provide a potential target gene for improving PHS resistance and grain development in rice.
