The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) serves as a physiological monitor to assess the water status of plants and, under drought conditions, induces stomatal pore closure by activating specific ion channels, such as a slow-anion channel (SLAC1) that, in turn, mediate ion efflux from the guard cells. Earlier genetic analyses uncovered a protein kinase (OST1) and several 2C-type phosphatases, as respective positive and negative regulators of ABA-induced stomatal closure. Here we show that the OST1 kinase interacts with the SLAC1 anion channel, leading to its activation via phosphorylation. PP2CA, one of the PP2C phosphatase family members acts in an opposing manner and inhibits the activity of SLAC1 by two mechanisms: (1) direct interaction with SLAC1 itself, and (2) physical interaction with OSTI leading to inhibition of the kinase independently of phosphatase activity. The results suggest that ABA signaling is mediated by a physical interaction chain consisting of several components, including a PP2C member, SnRK2-type kinase (OST1), and an ion channel, SLAC1, to regulate stomatal movements. The findings are in keeping with a paradigm in which a protein kinase-phosphatase pair interacts physically with a target protein to couple a signal with a specific response.
