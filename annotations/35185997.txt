The disease <i>Fusarium</i> crown and root rot (FCRR), caused mainly by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>radicis-lycopersici</i> (<i>FORL</i>), seriously affects commercial tomato [<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> (Sl)] yields. However, the genes that offer resistance to <i>FORL</i> are limited and the mechanism of resistance to FCRR is poorly understood. Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRKs) play critical roles in defensive responses and immunity in many plant species; however, whether specific LecRKs are involved in the response of tomato plants to <i>FORL</i> is unclear. Here, we report that the expression of <i>SlLecRK1/Solyc09g011070.1</i> was obviously induced by the infection of <i>FORL</i>. Biochemical and cell biological data revealed that SlLecRK1 is an active kinase that is located at the cell membrane, while real-time quantitative PCR data suggested that <i>SlLecRK1</i> is mainly expressed in stems and roots. Genetic studies showed that overexpression of <i>SlLecRK1</i> significantly improved the resistance of tomato plants to <i>FORL</i> but did not cause visible changes in plant growth and development compared with wild-type control plants. RNA-Seq data suggested that the positive effects of SlLecRK1 on the resistance of tomato plants to <i>FORL</i> occur mainly by triggering the expression of <i>ethylene-responsive transcription factor</i> (<i>ERF</i>) genes. Together, our findings not only identify a new target for the development of FCRR-resistant tomato varieties, they also demonstrate a molecular mechanism linking SlLecRK1 and ERFs in regulating the immune responses of tomato plants to <i>FORL</i>.
