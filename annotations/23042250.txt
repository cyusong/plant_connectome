['23042250', "Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs is an important regulatory mechanism  shaping the transcriptome. In plants, only few RNA-binding proteins are known to  affect AS. Here, we show that the glycine-rich RNA-binding protein AtGRP7  influences AS in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a high-resolution RT-PCR-based AS  panel, we found significant changes in the ratios of AS isoforms for 59 of 288  analyzed AS events upon ectopic AtGRP7 expression. In particular, AtGRP7 affected  the choice of alternative 5' splice sites preferentially. About half of the  events are also influenced by the paralog AtGRP8, indicating that AtGRP7 and  AtGRP8 share a network of downstream targets. For 10 events, the AS patterns were  altered in opposite directions in plants with elevated AtGRP7 level or lacking  AtGRP7. Importantly, RNA immunoprecipitation from plant extracts showed that  several transcripts are bound by AtGRP7 in vivo and indeed represent direct  targets. Furthermore, the effect of AtGRP7 on these AS events was abrogated by  mutation of a single arginine that is required for its RNA-binding activity. This  indicates that AtGRP7 impacts AS of these transcripts via direct interaction. As  several of the AS events are also controlled by other splicing regulators, our  data begin to provide insights into an AS network in Arabidopsis.", '2012 Dec', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gks873', 'Staiger']
