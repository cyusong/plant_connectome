['16581911', "Understanding how the expression of transcription factor (TF) genes is modulated  is essential for reconstructing gene regulatory networks. There is increasing  evidence that sequences other than upstream noncoding can contribute to  modulating gene expression, but how frequently they do so remains unclear. Here,  we investigated the regulation of TFs expressed in a tissue-enriched manner in  Arabidopsis roots. For 61 TFs, we created GFP reporter constructs driven by each  TF's upstream noncoding sequence (including the 5'UTR) fused to the GFP reporter  gene alone or together with the TF's coding sequence. We compared the visually  detectable GFP patterns with endogenous mRNA expression patterns, as defined by a  genome-wide microarray root expression map. An automated image analysis method  for quantifying GFP signals in different tissues was developed and used to  validate our visual comparison method. From these combined analyses, we found  that (i) the upstream noncoding sequence was sufficient to recapitulate the mRNA  expression pattern for 80% (35/44) of the TFs, and (ii) 25% of the TFs undergo  posttranscriptional regulation via microRNA-mediated mRNA degradation (2/24) or  via intercellular protein movement (6/24). The results suggest that, for  Arabidopsis TFs, upstream noncoding sequences are major contributors to mRNA  expression pattern establishment, but modulation of transcription factor protein  expression pattern after transcription is relatively frequent. This study  provides a systematic overview of regulation of TF expression at a cellular  level.", '2006 Apr 11', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0510607103', 'Benfey']
