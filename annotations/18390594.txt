['18390594', 'This work investigated the roles of beta-amylases in the breakdown of leaf  starch. Of the nine beta-amylase (BAM)-like proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis  thaliana genome, at least four (BAM1, -2, -3, and -4) are chloroplastic. When  expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, BAM1, BAM2, and BAM3 had  measurable beta-amylase activity but BAM4 did not. BAM4 has multiple amino acid  substitutions relative to characterized beta-amylases, including one of the two  catalytic residues. Modeling predicts major differences between the glucan  binding site of BAM4 and those of active beta-amylases. Thus, BAM4 probably lost  its catalytic capacity during evolution. Total beta-amylase activity was reduced  in leaves of bam1 and bam3 mutants but not in bam2 and bam4 mutants. The bam3  mutant had elevated starch levels and lower nighttime maltose levels than the  wild type, whereas bam1 did not. However, the bam1 bam3 double mutant had a more  severe phenotype than bam3, suggesting functional overlap between the two  proteins. Surprisingly, bam4 mutants had elevated starch levels. Introduction of  the bam4 mutation into the bam3 and bam1 bam3 backgrounds further elevated the  starch levels in both cases. These data suggest that BAM4 facilitates or  regulates starch breakdown and operates independently of BAM1 and BAM3. Together,  our findings are consistent with the proposal that beta-amylase is a major enzyme  of starch breakdown in leaves, but they reveal unexpected complexity in terms of  the specialization of protein function.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056507', 'Zeeman']
