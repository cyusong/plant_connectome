['24556609', 'Membrane trafficking in plants is involved in cellular development and the  adaptation to various environmental changes. SNARE (soluble  N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins mediate the  fusion between vesicles and organelles to facilitate transport cargo proteins in  cells. To characterize further the SNARE protein networks in cells, we carried  out interactome analysis of SNARE proteins using 12 transgenic Arabidopsis  thaliana plants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Qa-SNAREs  (SYP111, SYP121, SYP122, SYP123, SYP132, SYP21, SYP22, SYP31, SYP32, SYP41, SYP42  and SYP43). Microsomal fractions were prepared from each transgenic root, and  subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using micromagnetic beads coupled to  anti-GFP antibodies. To identify Qa-SNARE-interacting proteins, all  immunoprecipitated products were then subjected to mass spectrometric (IP-MS)  analysis. The IP-MS data revealed not only known interactions of SNARE proteins,  but also unknown interactions. The IP-MS results were next categorized by gene  ontology analysis. The data revealed that categories of cellular component  organization, the cytoskeleton and endosome were enriched in the SYP2, SYP3 and  SYP4 groups. In contrast, transporter activity was classified specifically in the  SYP132 group. We also identified a novel interaction between SYP22 and VAMP711,  which was validated using co-localization analysis with confocal microscopy and  IP. Additional novel SNARE-interacting proteins play roles in vesicle transport  and lignin biosynthesis, and were identified as membrane microdomain-related  proteins. We propose that Qa-SNARE interactomics is useful for understanding  SNARE interactions across the whole cell.', '2014 Apr', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcu038', 'Fukao']
