The soil houses a tremendous amount of micro-organisms, many of which are plant parasites and pathogens by feeding off plant roots for sustenance. Such root pathogens and parasites often rely on plant-secreted signaling molecules in the rhizosphere as host guidance cues. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a chemoattractant of plant-parasitic root-knot nematodes (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>, RKN). The Super-growing Root (SR) culture, consisting of excised roots from the legume species <i>Lotus corniculatus</i> L., was found to strongly attract infective RKN juveniles and actively secrete chemoattractants into the liquid culture media. The chemo-attractant in the culture media supernatant was purified using hydrophobicity and anion exchange chromatography, and found to be enriched in carbohydrates. Monosaccharide analyses suggest the chemo-attractant contains a wide array of sugars, but is enriched in arabinose, galactose and galacturonic acid. This purified chemoattractant was shown to contain pectin, specifically anti-rhamnogalacturonan-I and anti-arabinogalactan protein epitopes but not anti-homogalacturonan epitopes. More importantly, the arabinose and galactose sidechain groups were found to be essential for RKN-attracting activities. This chemo-attractant appears to be specific to <i>M. incognita</i>, as it wasn't effective in attracting other <i>Meloidogyne</i> species nor <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. This is the first report to identify the nematode attractant purified from root exudate of <i>L corniculatus</i> L. Our findings re-enforce pectic carbohydrates as important chemicals mediating micro-organism chemotaxis in the soil, and also highlight the unexpected utilities of the SR culture system in root pathogen research.
