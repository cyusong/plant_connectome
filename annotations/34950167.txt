Soil salinity has become a major stress factor that reduces crop productivity worldwide. Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) toxicity in a number of crop plants is tightly linked with shoot Na<sup>+</sup> overaccumulation, thus Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion from shoot is crucial for salt tolerance in crops. In this study, we identified a member of the high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transport family (HAK), OsHAK12, which mediates shoots Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion in response to salt stress in rice. The <i>Oshak12</i> mutants showed sensitivity to salt toxicity and accumulated more Na<sup>+</sup> in the xylem sap, leading to excessive Na<sup>+</sup> in the shoots and less Na<sup>+</sup> in the roots. Unlike typical HAK family transporters that transport K<sup>+</sup>, OsHAK12 is a Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable plasma membrane transporter. In addition, <i>OsHAK12</i> was strongly expressed in the root vascular tissues and induced by salt stress. These findings indicate that OsHAK12 mediates Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion from shoot, possibly by retrieving Na<sup>+</sup> from xylem vessel thereby reducing Na<sup>+</sup> content in the shoots. These findings provide a unique function of a rice HAK family member and provide a potential target gene for improving salt tolerance of rice.
