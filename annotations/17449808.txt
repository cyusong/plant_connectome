['17449808', 'The composition and permeability of the cuticle has a large influence on its  ability to protect the plant against various forms of biotic and abiotic stress.  WAX INDUCER1 (WIN1) and related transcription factors have recently been shown to  trigger wax production, enhance drought tolerance, and modulate cuticular  permeability when overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that WIN1  influences the composition of cutin, a polyester that forms the backbone of the  cuticle. WIN1 overexpression induces compositional changes and an overall  increase in cutin production in vegetative and reproductive organs, while its  downregulation has the opposite effect. Changes in cutin composition are preceded  by the rapid and coordinated induction of several genes known or likely to be  involved in cutin biosynthesis. This transcriptional response is followed after a  delay by the induction of genes associated with wax biosynthesis, suggesting that  the regulation of cutin and wax production by WIN1 is a two-step process. We  demonstrate that at least one of the cutin pathway genes, which encodes  long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase LACS2, is likely to be directly targeted by WIN1.  Overall, our results suggest that WIN1 modulates cuticle permeability in  Arabidopsis by regulating genes encoding cutin pathway enzymes.', '2007 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047076', 'Broun']
