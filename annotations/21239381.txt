A network of promoting and inhibiting pathways that respond to environmental and internal signals controls the flowering transition. The outcome of this regulatory network establishes, for any particular plant, the correct time of the year to flower. The photoperiod pathway channels inputs from light, day length, and the circadian clock to promote the floral transition. CONSTANS (CO) is a central regulator of this pathway, triggering the production of the mobile florigen hormone FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T) that induces flower differentiation. Because plant reproductive fitness is directly related to its capacity to flower at a precise time, the photoperiod pathway is present in all known plant species. Recent findings have stretched the evolutionary span of this photophase signal to unicellular algae, which show unexpected conserved characteristics with modern plant photoperiodic responses. In this review, a comparative description of the photoperiodic systems in algae and plants will be presented and a general role for the CO family of transcriptional activators proposed.
