In many species, environmental stress reduces plant fertility. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a significant fraction of this reduction in plant fertility results from ovule abortion and embryo senescence. In this species, environmental conditions were identified that induced 94% of the developing ovules to either undergo stress-induced ovule abortion or embryo senescence (Sun et al. Plant Physiol 135:2358-2367, 2004). Following salt stress, physiological and anatomical changes were first detected in the female gametophyte of an aborting ovule. Two to four hours after a period of salt stress that induces most ovules to abort, the mitochondrial membrane potential dissipated. Subsequently, cells in the gametophyte accumulated reactive oxygen species, which are known to be molecules that promote programmed cell death (PCD). Because mitochondria often play an important role in PCD, these organelles were closely examined for changes in structure. Although the anatomy of mitochondria varied, reproducible changes in mitochondria structure were not observed. Nonetheless, other changes in ultrastructure were found. In some aborting gametophytes, concentric rings of endoplasmic reticulum were formed. In a fraction of the aborting ovules, cytoplasmic contents and organelles were invaginated into the vacuole. Even in cryofixed sections, many of these bodies appeared indistinct, which is consistent with the degradation of their contents.
